Chapter 1:About how Constantine and Herena wrote in their writings: "Through Him who gathers us to God."




  
    
      Human weakness often exceeds its limits of impossibility, and as much as it lifts itself up beyond what it should, it withdraws from Him who dwells on high and looks down on the humble in heaven and on earth.
    
    
      The more it tries to approach Him, who is exalted above all nations, through its elevation, the more it is stretched away from Him.
    
    
      But if it does not neglect the limits of its condition and strives for higher things, submitting itself with a devoted mind to the humble, it can rise by lowering itself to Him, from whom it was known to descend by exalting itself.
    
    
      As much as it humbles itself to the ground, it becomes as close to heaven.
    
  
  
    
      Therefore, since our being is so different from God's being and our living from His living and our reigning from His reigning, the madness of those who, among other things they indiscriminately usurp for themselves, even say that God reigns with them is more to be mourned than admired.
    
    
      For He knows only to exist, not to have been or to be in the future.
    
    
      He does not have a part of eternity, which we call time and divide into past, present, and future, but He has the entirety of eternity in the unchangeableness of His essence.
    
    
      To Him, to exist is to be.
    
    
      Wherefore He said to holy Moses: "I am who I am," and "He who is has sent me to you."
    
    
      Our being, which includes the past in memory, the present in sight, and the future in expectation, compared to His essence, is not being.
    
  
  
    
      For His living feels neither beginning nor end nor any changeability.
    
    
      Hence it is written in the prophets: "I live, says the Lord," and some of the saints dared to say: "The Lord lives," that is: He lives in that life which neither began nor is moved by change nor is interrupted by an end.
    
    
      Our living, however, suffers birth, decline, and change; although the soul is immortal, it is still known to be "changeable," which changeability is often ascribed to it as death.
    
    
      Hence it was said to the first man: "On the day you eat from it, you will surely die," not that he was immediately punished with the death of the flesh as soon as he transgressed the command of the Lord, but because he distanced himself far from that holiness in which he stood close to God through the changeability of his soul.
    
  
  
    
      Furthermore, His reigning differs from our reigning no less than His being from our being and His living from our living, for His essence, just as it always had being and living, so also reigning.
    
    
      Our reigning is preceded by our being and living and succeeded by our ceasing to exist.
    
    
      Given these facts, it is a great presumption for anyone to say that God reigns with them, something even David did not dare to say, of whom the Lord said: "I have found a man after my own heart," and "I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him."
    
    
      Nor Solomon, to whom the Lord said: "Wisdom and knowledge are given to you, and I will give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you ever had and none after you will have."
    
    
      Who also confidently speaks of himself: "God taught me wisdom, and I knew the understanding of the saints."
    
    
      Nor do we read that any of the kings, whether supported by the prerogative of merits or mentioned in Scripture as having acted with pride, ever said such a thing.
    
  
  
    
      Meanwhile, the syllable 'con' in composing words, according to those who are not ignorant of the skill of literary discipline, signifies almost nothing else than 'together,' as in: "Let all the congregation of Israel gather together"; and: "Let them come together for the festival day," that is: let them gather together in a flock, let them come together.
    
    
      And the Apostle: "If indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together," that is: be glorified together; and: "Both sat down beside the edge of the fountain," that is: they sat together; and 'consessor' is said to be 'sitting together.'
    
  
  
    
      'Together' is said in three ways by those who most keenly investigate the secrets of logic: in time, nature, and kind.
    
    
      In time, as Saint Augustine says, when things exist or appear together at the same time, so that neither of the two is before or follows the other, but both seem to have a common origin.
    
  


  
      In the same way, we can't rule together with Him. He is eternal, without beginning, while we have a beginning.
    
    
      By nature, some things exist together without one ruling over the other. For example, a simple number and a double number exist together naturally. But a double number doesn't cause a simple number to exist, nor does a simple number cause a double number to exist. In the same way, we can't rule together with Him, because His nature is so different from ours and He is the Creator, while we are the created.
    
    
      Whenever things of the same kind seem to exist together by nature, but are distinguished by species, like animals on land and in water, neither is prior to the other. All of them come from the same kind, which is the animal. This third way also shows that we can't rule together with Him, because our nature is entirely different from His nature. Even though He exists everywhere through His divine power, He can't rightly be said to rule together with anyone. Being everywhere is one thing, but being with someone is another; ruling ineffably is one thing, but ruling together with someone is another.
    
    
      If 'ruling together' and 'sitting together' are used absolutely, it means two or more rule or sit together. If someone is said to rule or sit together with someone else, it means one precedes the other, and the other becomes a participant with the one who rules and sits. As the chosen vessel Paul says: "You were buried with Christ;" and again: "If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above." This shows that the one who is buried and rises precedes, while those who are buried and rise with Him become participants with Him. If the Redeemer of humanity had not been buried and risen for us, we couldn't be buried and rise with Him. This shows that God, who is the author of all, precedes everyone in existence, living, and ruling.
    
    
      If someone argues that the words about the only Son of God in the form of a servant mean He rules with us because we suffer, are buried, are made alive, and rise with Him, and because we are co-heirs, co-body members, and co-participants in the same Jesus Christ through the gospel, in which God raised us up and made us sit in the heavenly places, and because the evangelist says: "While eating with them, He was lifted up," and again: "They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them," let them understand that this is not from His divinity, but from our humanity, in which we suffer, are buried, and are made alive with Him. Just as suffering, being buried, and eating, in which we suffer and are buried with Him, and He is said to eat with us, are properly human, so ruling is properly divine, as the psalmist attests: "His name alone is exalted;" and again: "The Lord reigns and He will rule the nations;" and the same: "Your kingdom, Lord, is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations."
    
    
      We are said to rule, but in a borrowed sense, not in a proper sense. Ruling, being immortal, and being true are natural to Him; for others who achieve these things, it is attributed by His generosity, who truly rules, is the only immortal, and is true, as the teacher of the nations preaches, who says: "God is true, and every human is a liar;" and again: "He alone has immortality." Not that, as Saint Jerome says, angels and other rational creatures don't have immortality and love truth, but He alone is naturally immortal and true, while others achieve immortality and truth from His generosity. Having something by oneself is different from having it by the power of the one who gives it.
    
  
    Therefore, we can rightly say that we die with and suffer with God, who is immortal and impassible. Likewise, it can be rightly said that God reigns with us. If the former is denied by clear reason, the latter is also rejected by prudent investigation.
  
  
    For we suffer with Christ when, in His love, who endured the suffering of the cross for us, we crucify our flesh—that is, the world—with its vices and desires. We die to the world and die with Christ, thus crucifying the flesh, that is, the body, so that we trample its desires.
  
  
    For we are buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the power of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life. Thus, we are baptized and buried with Him, so that we may follow this life in which Christ was raised. Baptism is the pledge and image of the resurrection, so that by remaining in the commandments of Christ, we do not turn back to past things.
  
  
    We are made alive and rise with Him if we are united with the likeness of His death—that is, if in baptism, laying aside all vices, we are transferred into a new life and no longer sin. "For the likeness of death has provided a similar resurrection." We are co-heirs and co-participants with Him, not because some possession is divided among us, but because He Himself is our Lord, inheritance, and possession.
  
  
    The Lord indeed says, "The Lord is your inheritance"; and elsewhere, "The Lord is my portion and my inheritance." We are one body with Him, for although those who believe in Christ have different graces, they are nevertheless united in one body of the church. Therefore, He has made the saints sit together with Christ in heavenly places, not that the saints sit with Him as long as they are in this world and are pilgrims from Him, but according to the opinion of the aforementioned doctor, this is the manner of the Scriptures.
  
  
    Sometimes future events are spoken of in the past tense—by a figure of speech called prolepsis—for example, concerning the cross of the Lord: "They pierced my hands and my feet"; and elsewhere concerning His passion: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter." Certainly, according to the spiritual sense, the saints are not in the flesh, although they live in the flesh and have their conversation in heaven. While they walk on the earth, ceasing to be flesh, striving entirely in the spirit, they sit in heavenly places with Christ.
  
  
    For the kingdom of God is within us, and where our treasure is, there will our heart be also. We sit firm and stable with Christ in wisdom, word, justice, and truth. The apostles were preaching with the Lord cooperating, providing them support to perform good works. Therefore, their work had such great power that thousands of people believed at their preaching. With the natural forces broken, the dead received life, the blind received sight, and the deaf received hearing.
  
  
    The Lord cooperates with all the saints according to the Apostle, who says: "I became a minister according to the gift of God's grace given to me by the effect of His power." But for sinners, insofar as they sin, He is neither believed to cooperate nor reign with them in any way.
  
  
    Therefore, if what the Apostle says: "If we endure, we will also reign with Him," thinks to provide some support in this part, let him understand that this differs from what he says in three ways: by person, by time, and by merit.
  
  
    By person, because it is not said that He reigns with the saints, but that the saints will reign with Him; by time, because it is not said that He has reigned or is reigning, but that He will reign; by merit, because it is not anyone, but only the saints who will reign with Him.
  
  
    For he says: "If we endure, we will also reign with Him," that is: if we endure in this age, we will reign in the future or certainly after judgment, when we will no longer see Him through a mirror, dimly, but face to face. For if we are still in this world, we are still enduring; if we are still enduring, we are not yet reigning. Therefore, if we are still in this world, we are not yet reigning with Him.
  
  
    Then if we reign with Him, what is perfect has already come; if what is perfect has already come, what is partial is already done away with. But what is partial is not done away with; therefore, we are not yet reigning with Him.
  


    
        He rules over them less than the one to whom the kingdom and power belong, and whose kingdom will have no end. If he does not rule with the saints, he certainly cannot be said to rule with sinners. 
    
    
        We learn from the Apostle John when the saints will rule with him; he says:  "Beloved, it has not yet been revealed what we shall be; but we know that when he is revealed, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."  This means that when he appears, we will be immortal and glorious, in which we will be "like him." He said "like," not equal. Like, evidently not in bodily similarity, but in the inner person, as Blessed Augustine says in his letter to the virgin Italica: "Who would be so insane as to say that we are or will be like God in body?"  Therefore, this likeness is in the inner person.  "We shall see him as he is," when, according to his promise, he reveals himself to those who love him, eternally, in which we will see God, infinitely celebrating the perpetual Sabbath feast. As the Lord tells us: "Be still, and know that I am God." 
    
    
        All these things will not be completed in the saints until, according to the Apostle, this mortal body puts on immortality and this corruptible body puts on incorruption.  For if we rule with him, it has already appeared what we shall be; if it has already appeared what we shall be, we are already like him; if we are already like him, we already see him as he is.  But we do not yet see him as he is, so we do not yet rule with him.
    
    
        Therefore, he rules in us, but does not "co-rule" with us. He rules, according to the opinion of Blessed Augustine, in believers because he was weakened until the cross and death.  In this way, the Son properly rules in the faith of believers; for the Father cannot be said or believed to have been incarnate, judged, or crucified.  But in the form in which he is equal to the Father, he rules in those who contemplate the truth, not co-ruling with us because he does not share with us in the kingdom.  It is his own kingdom, as we discussed earlier.  We do not yet co-rule with him as long as we are clothed with this mortal body.  We hope, through his mercy, that we will do so when, according to the contemplation of the supreme truth, to obtain blessedness, no movement of the mind, no part of the body resists, and no one loves their own power. Then God will be all in all.
    



Chapter 2:About how Constantine and Herena wrote in an epistle to the venerable Pope Adrian of Rome: "He has chosen this God, who truly possesses the glory of His name."




According to the Truth's declaration, he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. Those who have fervently worshipped images seem to seek and embrace their own glory to such an extent that they do not fear to scorn their predecessors or parents along with their deeds. Indeed, disregarding and despising them, they claim to seek God's glory in truth, rightly scorning those who have deviated from that Truth which said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

He is called "the way" because through His incarnation, He provides a living example. Christ is called "truth" because of the judgment He exercises in truth and because no falsehood can be found in Him; "life" because of His divinity, from which the origin of life comes and by which all things live. He is indeed the path leading the righteous to eternal life; from this path, the prophet advises us not to stray, saying: "Embrace discipline, lest the Lord become angry, and you perish from the righteous way." Of this path, the same saint says: "For the Lord knows the way of the righteous," the opposite of the author of death, about whom it is added: "And the way of the wicked will perish."

For if they have strayed from the truth, they have adhered to falsehood, and if they have adhered to falsehood, they have become liars. Therefore, if they have strayed from the truth, they have become liars. Accordingly, by the rule of derivatives, just as from truth comes "truthful," from justice "just," from piety "pious," from goodness "good," so conversely, from falsehood comes "false."

For liars can hardly or scarcely teach the truth. It is astonishing, then, how those who, according to their own opinion, are taught and born from liars have become such true and passionate followers of the truth. Therefore, they do not seek God's grace in that truth about which pious Truth and true Piety said: "If you remain in my word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free," but in images crafted by the skill of artisans, which often lead their viewers into admiration due to the memory of the acts represented, but always lead worshippers into error. It is no small error, for something other than the one who said: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" is worshipped with religious devotion.

Truth, always pure and unviolated, remains of one kind, but these images, according to the artist's will, seem to perform many actions, while in reality, they do nothing. For they seem to be men when they are not, to fight when they do not, to speak when they do not, to hear when they do not, to see when they do not, to gesture when they do not, to touch when they do not, and so forth. It is evident that they are the fabrications of artisans, not the truth, about which it is said: "And the truth will set you free." For it is true that images are without sense and reason, while it is false that they are men.

And if anyone, according to the principle of equivocation, affirms that they can be called men, like saying "Augustine was a great philosopher," and "Augustine should be read," and "Augustine stands in the church," and "Augustine is buried in that place," let him consider that all these statements, though they spring from one source, Augustine, only one was the true Augustine, about whom it was said: "a great philosopher," while the others refer to a book, an image, or a buried body. The principal difference between a living man and a true one is that one is real, while the other is false, and they are only united in the commonality of the name. For if one is true, defined as a rational, mortal animal capable of laughter and senses, then necessarily, the one who lacks these features must be considered false. And if the one who lacks all these is not false, then the one who possesses all these rules is not true.

Behold, many images are seen standing, some composed of colored pigments, some cast in gold or silver, some carved in wood by the sculptor's chisel, some engraved in marble, some formed in plaster or clay, in which, as much as in any other...


    
        The likeness and inscription of the name are the same, for example, the image of Paul and the inscription: Saint Paul. We must avoid those who err so greatly that they call them true and holy images at their own discretion, rather than according to the tradition of the venerable fathers. Among all, the holiest or most truthful is to be believed, for reason does not permit us to call them equal in terms of materials, sizes, or workmanship. Some are admitted to be holier than others.
    
    
        They are compelled to acknowledge, according to the reasoning of truth, that they should not be called true or holy, as they are unequal in price and are preferred over one another in degrees of comparison. They are equal in merit of holiness and truth, which they entirely lack. Just as a precious image admits a more precious and most precious one, so a holy and true one could admit a holier and more truthful, most holy and most truthful, if there were a positive degree from which the comparative and superlative could emerge.
    
    
        Granted, an image may contain holiness. But where was it before it was made? Was it in the wood taken from the forest for use, whose remnants are consigned to fire? Or in the colors, often made from impure substances? Or in the wax, which can hold both colors and dirt? 
    
    
        If in the wood, why does it perish when it is carved with an axe, planed with a chisel, or burned to ashes? Or in the colors dissolved by the artist's hand, or in the wax melted by excessive heat and dripping away, when holiness cannot perish? If holiness is not in these things we have mentioned, we must ask where it comes from after the image is assembled from various materials. 
    
    
        Since it cannot be found to be added through the laying on of hands or any canonical consecration, it should not be believed to be present. If it were present, we could ask whether it would decay with age or transfer to another image made from remnants. If it were present, it would come from somewhere else; if from somewhere else, it would transfer to another. But it does not transfer, so it should not be believed to be present.
    
    
        Given this, anyone who says they seek the glory of God in these images has strayed far from the truth. David did not feel the glory of God in man-made images when he said, "His glory is above the heavens," nor did the heavenly host when they sang, "Glory to God in the highest," nor did the glory of the Lord appear to the people of God in the vast wilderness in an image, when it is said, "The glory of the Lord appeared," and "The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
    
    
        Much could be said against this chapter's considerable folly according to the authority of the Holy Scriptures and the investigation of the truth, but let these brief remarks suffice for now, lest they hinder those hurrying on to other matters.
    



Chapter 3:About how the deeds of Constantine and Herena are written and are now called 'divine'.




  
    
      An outdated error from ancient paganism, repelled by the advent of Christ, seems to have left a trace among those who boast of retaining the pinnacle of Christian faith and religion.
    
    
      These individuals boldly attempt to establish new and foolish rules within the church and do not fear to call themselves 'divine' and their deeds 'divine' in a pagan manner.
    
    
      This has led to a situation where, just as the first humans were enticed by the promise of the venomous serpent in the flourishing garden and committed sin, these people, deceived by the old enemy's trickery, commit similar acts within the church.
    
    
      They do not shy away from calling themselves 'divine' out of a desire for empty glory, and through their greed, they attempt to introduce something new to the church.
    
    
      Therefore, whoever desires to be higher than their rank allows and wishes to be more extraordinary than they should be, will be cast down by the one who regards the humble and recognizes the lofty from afar, and will end up being less than they are.
    
  
  
    
      This can be confirmed by the examples of those whose fates we should avoid: one who, planning to place his throne in the north, lost angelic honor and companionship and was assigned to the darkness of this world.
    
    
      And another who, disobeying divine commands and wishing to be like God, was cast out from the most delightful place, lost immortality, and was destined for the labors and hardships of this mortal life.
    
    
      If their fates should be avoided, their actions should be shunned; if their actions should be shunned, the practice of humility must be embraced.
    
    
      Therefore, if their fates should be avoided, the practice of humility must be embraced, through which, along with other instruments of good works, we can become like the one to whom it was said: “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1), and the sons of God, according to what is written: “Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).
    
  
  
    
      For while God is essentially called the creator of all, according to: “For the Lord is a great God, the great King above all gods” (Psalm 95:3), there is another way in which gods and supreme powers and men are called gods abusively, as the Apostle says: “For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, yet for us there is but one God, the Father” (First Corinthians 8:5-6), and the psalmist: “I said, ‘You are gods’” (Psalm 82:6).
    
    
      In the third way, according to sacrilegious superstition, aerial powers are called gods, according to: “For all the gods of the nations are idols” (Psalm 96:5).
    
  
  
    
      For in the first way, no one can be called God essentially except the one who is ineffable, unchangeable, eternal, omnipotent, who is the highest good, the singular pinnacle, three in persons, one in nature, who is God above all, blessed forever.
    
    
      In the second way, both angels and men can be called gods.
    
    
      To reach this title of dignity, it is necessary to obey God, embrace humility, despise arrogance, and cling to Him through good works.
    
  
  
    
      The third way has several types.
    
    
      The demons were called gods by the pagans, as were the stars or many other created things of the world.
    
    
      Inventors of certain worldly arts and founders of cities or holders of imperial scepters were believed to be transferred to the status of gods after death and were called divinities, and their images were called gods.
    
    
      These names, arrogantly usurped by demonic or human pride, should be despised by a true Christian, just as they despise their author.
    
    
      For whoever spurns the author of lies must also despise the lie; and whoever despises the lie must also despise the name of the liar.
    
    
      Thus, whoever spurns the author of lies must also despise the name of the liar.
    
    
      The author of lies is the one about whom it was said: “He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth” (John 8:44).
    
  
  
    
      The deceitful name 'divine' is not undeservedly applied to those sinners who, meriting eternal punishment, strive to claim divinity for themselves.
    
    
      If the lovers of this name admit that it does not truly pertain to divinity, they should listen to the pagans themselves, who used this name more familiarly in their writings and often used 'divine' almost interchangeably with 'god' and 'divine' for 'gods'.
    
    
      For example:
    
    
      “You grant to recline at the feasts of the gods”
    
    
      and again,
    
    
      “What are those dire powers asking for?”
    
  


  
    It is about the gods. "Gods," however, refers to the divine, as in this line:
    
      "Or does the god of the boundless sea reign, and your sailors worship only his powers."
    
  
  
  
    This was said of Octavian, whom they believed was made divine after his death.
  
  
  
    Let the ambition for false names cease, let the trace of ancient error be abandoned, let the term of blind superstition fade away, let the arrogance of the presumptuous name be rejected, let the falsehood of men being transferred to gods be expelled from the faithful.
  
  
  
    Now the truth has risen from the earth, now the sun of righteousness has risen for the faithful, now those who sat in darkness have seen a great light, now a light has risen for those dwelling in the shadow of death. All falsehoods are nullified with the coming of the Truth.
  
  
  
    For if the pagan belief in false gods is false, then the story of men being transferred to gods after death is also false. But if the story of men being transferred to gods after death is false, then the designation "divine" is empty.
  
  
  
    So if the pagan belief in false gods is false, the designation "divine" is also empty. It is clearly evident that a false thing has a false name, and those who are disciples of the Truth should not be called by a false name.
  
  
  
    For even if some Catholics have been found to call the deceased "of divine memory," it is clear that they followed the practice of paganism, just as the names of days and months are often named after pagan vanities. But these and similar things were admitted more by Roman ambition than by apostolic tradition.
  
  
  
    We, who are both followers of the Truth and redeemed by the Truth itself, as we have rejected the falsehood of pagan gods, should also reject pagan terms, as the Apostle teaches, who says:
    
      "What partnership has light with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?"
    
    From which agreement may we be freed, with His help, who has delivered us from the darkness and shadow of death and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
  



Chapter 4:About how Constantine and Herena wrote in an epistle to the venerable Pope Adrian of Rome: "We ask your patience and beg you earnestly that no one should perish."




  
    Whoever dares to impudently claim that God reigns with them and boastfully and arrogantly speak of their deeds as divine, will undoubtedly also dare to say that God, whose kingdom and rule it is, requests something from someone.
    While extending their reckless pride, they seek to diminish the command of divine majesty.
    It is not surprising they presume to elevate themselves when they strive to lower divine matters with their unlearned words.
    For it is recorded that God created light by commanding it and separated the waters from the waters, establishing a firmament to prevent them from mixing again, and made the earth fertile with various seeds.
    He adorned the sky with the splendid lights of stars, filled the waters with swimming creatures and the air with flying ones, and created man, the creation of all things.
    And they say: "We ask your paternal care, and most importantly, God asks, who wishes no man to perish."
  
  
    It is recorded about Moses that he did what the Lord commanded; and he also writes: At the command of the Lord, the Israelites moved their camps, and at the command of the Lord, they set them up.
    And this person says: "most importantly, God asks," as if God, who is unchangeable, ineffable, and eternal, who created and governs the nature of all visible and invisible things with His command, would start asking.
    Indeed, the word "ask" is not one of power but of entreaty, not of authority but of necessity, not of commanding but of pleading.
    Since there is no need in God, and "asking" pertains to one pleading, and "pleading" pertains to one in need, whoever says that God asks for something undoubtedly attributes need to Him.
    If He has need, then He has necessity.
    If He has necessity, then omnipotence is lacking.
    However, omnipotence belongs to Him, therefore need is lacking.
    For it is written: The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens.
  
  
    If they perhaps say that "asking" can apply to Him because of the person of the Son, who, according to the Apostle, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, let them hear Him saying: Lazarus, come out; and again: Take up your bed and walk; and again: Talitha cumi; and again: Young man, I say to you, arise; and other such things, which are not the words of one asking but of one commanding, not of one requesting but of one ordering.
    We read that even the apostles had this power of command in His name.
    For example, the shepherd of the church says when he healed Aeneas: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk.
    See, Peter commands in the name of Jesus, and they say Jesus ought to ask.
    The servant gives health to the sick by the command of the Lord's name, and they say He ought to ask the priest.
    This is not to be attributed to prudence but to utter foolishness.
  
  
    If they perhaps want to use in defense of their error what the Truth Himself says: I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, and this: Father, glorify Your name, let them consider that He did not say this according to His divinity, in which He remains of one substance with the Father and equal to the Father, about which He says: I and the Father are one, but according to His humanity, in which the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and about which He says: The Father is greater than I.
    While He is lesser than the Father in the form of a servant, He is undoubtedly believed to be equal to Him in the form of God.
    Hence the Apostle says: He did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, that is, it was not like robbery to Him, as if He were seeking something foreign, who, being co-eternal, is also co-equal with the Father.
    The same Apostle confesses Him as true man and true God, saying: Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever.
    If, according to their foolishness, He needs to ask someone for something, then He is subject to someone.
    If He is subject to someone, He is not over all.
    But He is over all; therefore, He does not need to ask anyone for anything.
  
  
    Let those who authored this saying, therefore, hear what blessed Ambrose said against some enemies of the faith about this word:
    "But it is read that He asked. Learn the distinction: He asks as the Son of Man, commands as the Son of God."
  
  
    
      As the Son of God. Do you not grant this to the Son of God, which even the devil granted, and do you diminish it with even greater sacrilege?
    
    
      He says: If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.
    
    
      He believes that at the command of the Son of God, the nature of things and elements will change; you believe that, unless the Son of God pleads, even His own will cannot be fulfilled.
    
  
  
    
      Indeed, armed with the shield of faith, the preacher of the church fought against the enemies of faith with this sword.
    
    
      Among those whom anyone fears to be counted, let such madness be avoided.
    
  
  
    
      Meanwhile, let the holy evangelist say what the Lord did to the disciples, who were afraid as the boat was being covered by waves.
    
    
      Then, rising, he says, he commanded the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
    
    
      Let him also say what the centurion said to the Lord when he was about to go to his house and heal his servant: Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
    
  
  
    
      Oh, unfortunate speech! Oh, accursed error! Oh, pride that brings swelling rather than strength, and inflation rather than power!
    
    
      The centurion believes that by a mere word, he can heal the servant who was to be mocked, scourged, to suffer, to taste death, to descend into hell, and you say that he who sits at the right hand of the Father in the heavens, above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come, should plead with anyone!
    
    
      Therefore, it is not necessary for Him to plead, who is believed to have power over the heavenly, earthly, and infernal realms.
    
  



Chapter 5:About how the holy Scriptures should be understood not in a small way but as they are, and how they should be accommodated to their true sense, which some did not understand in an erroneous synod, which was held in Bithynia during the reign of Constantine and Herena, with Tharasius of Constantinople presiding.





We learned from the sacred law's teaching that when the rock was struck, water flowed out for the thirsty people, and we are taught by the apostolic document that this rock should be understood as Christ. He is the rock from which the thirsty hearts are watered, the river whose streams bring joy to the city of God, the fountain of life from which eternal life flows to believers, and the heavenly bread that eradicates eternal hunger from the hearts of the faithful. Whoever receives His spiritual drink and food differently than He gives them, that is, interprets the divine Scriptures in a sense other than that given by the Holy Spirit, is shown to be alien to His pastures. For the words of the Lord, says the prophet, are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace. Without a doubt, he seeks to corrupt their purity with adulterous stains who tries to mix them with strange meanings.



For whoever, out of arrogance and a desire for vain praise, tries to use the testimony of the divine Scriptures to support his error, what else does he do but shamefully captivate the purity of the divine word in adultery and drag the silver refined by the divine Spirit into the contamination of other metals, that is, strange meanings? Of such people, the Lord complains through the prophet: 'I gave them silver and gold, and they made Baal,' that is, they turned the dignity of spiritual understanding and the beauty of the word into the monstrosity of perverse meanings and empty glory. For when the lawgiver says: 'A fiery law in the right hand of the Lord,' it is amazing how dull they are who are neither charmed by its brightness nor terrified by its heat. For just as those who approach it with pure senses and a devoted mind are pierced by the splendor of its brightness, so on the contrary, those who approach it rashly to usurp it are burned by the greatness of its heat. Thus, those who adhere to it with a humble mind and sacred senses have their steps fortified in the race of this life by its lamp's illumination; but those who seek it with strange and rash senses are burned by the fire of eternity, as was symbolized in the four sons of Aaron. For while Eleazar and Ithamar, offering the sanctuary's fire to the Lord according to Moses' instruction, attained the dignity of the priestly crown, Nadab and Abihu, attempting to offer strange fire to the Lord, were most fearfully punished with a terrible death. Whoever wants to avoid this danger must flee from their example.



Whom, therefore, do those who misinterpret well-spoken words imitate in this act other than him who, trying to interpret what was said about a simple righteous man as referring to the Mediator between God and men, said: 'For it is written: He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' For to make his temptation stronger, he drew an example from the divine writings, thinking that his temptation's drink would be more eagerly accepted if it had the flavor of the Holy Scriptures. For if he is to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures, he should also be followed in deceitful temptations. And if he is to be followed in deceitful temptations, he should be embraced in other behaviors. But he is not to be embraced in other behaviors; therefore, he is not to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures. For the blessed Jerome says: 'The devil interprets the Scriptures badly.' Indeed, heretics and schismatics, who are his followers, understand the divine Scriptures badly, interpret them worse, and observe them in the worst way. But Catholics, taught by the examples of Truth, resist the temptations of the ancient enemy, oppose the machinations of heresies, and, receiving the manna of the divine word with pure and sound sense, are nourished by its sweet food, in which, when collected improperly, worms do not breed, that is, conscience is not corrupted.

From the hidden and innermost feelings,
  he pierces deeply with powerful stimuli.



Chapter 6:About how the holy Roman, Catholic, and Apostolic Church declares certain things and how faith spreads, with questions arising, and everything being settled.




  
    Before we enter the forest of testimonies to be discussed, which the Easterners have criticized in their synod, we thought it appropriate to explain how the holy Roman church is preferred over other churches by the Lord and should be consulted by the faithful. Especially since the testimonies are to be taken not from other scriptures but from those which it accepts as canonical, nor the teachings of other doctors but those accepted by Pope Gelasius the Second or other pontiffs of that holy see. These teachings are to be understood not according to anyone's whims but sensibly and soberly, as they were stated by them. For the blessed Augustine says, when instructing which scriptures should be received or how they should be understood: "Therefore, the most diligent investigator of the divine Scriptures will first read all the known Scriptures and have familiarity with them, and even if not in understanding, at least in reading, especially those called canonical. For the others, he will read more safely, instructed by the faith of truth, so that harmful falsehoods and illusions do not preoccupy the weak mind and prejudge anything against sound understanding. In the canonical Scriptures, however, he should follow the authority of the many Catholic churches, among which those are undoubtedly to be included which have merited to have the apostolic sees and receive the letters."
  
  
    For when he generally prefers the apostolic sees to all the sees established throughout the world, much more must that one be preferred to all, which has been preferred to the other apostolic sees as well. Therefore, just as Peter stands out among the other disciples and all the apostles, so the Roman see is known to stand out among the other apostolic sees. This one is preferred to the other churches not by any synodical decrees, but by the authority of the Lord himself, who said: "You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:18-19). To whom, not incongruously, the companionship of the blessed Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, is attributed so that the authority of that holy church might be completely strengthened, one chosen from a fisherman to fish for souls, the other from a persecutor to build the church, so that in one the true confession of the Son of God might appear, and in the other the sacred preaching of the divine word. For the same Son of God granted to one the keys of the kingdom of heaven, to the other the key to opening the words of the law, yet to both the power of signs, so that one going to him by the cross, the other by the sword, leaving to the faithful the pledge of the bodily burden, they might dedicate the above-mentioned Roman church to him with the splendor of example, the beauty of the word, and the holy blood; the church built on the most solid rock that neither coming floods nor blowing winds could drive to ruin.
  
  
    Thus, armed with the spiritual weapons of the holy faith and nourished by the saving streams from the source of light and the origin of goodness, it stands against the horrendous and atrocious monsters of heresies and provides the sweet drinks of preaching to the Catholic churches throughout the world. For the most blessed Jerome, a man learned in divine laws and skilled in many languages, while staying in the fields of Bethlehem and being consulted by the blessed Pope Damasus in Rome regarding difficult questions, is known to have consulted him in turn for reasons of faith, and whether to speak of the substances to be kept silent or to be spoken, or with whom he should communicate in the Eastern parts, he humbly begs for approval to receive his approval. A wondrous thing and worthy of great praise! He asks the one who asks him, consults the one who consults him, who feels himself a master in interpreting the divine Scriptures, unhesitatingly shames himself as a disciple of the venerable pontiff in matters of faith, and unravels the knots of sacred law questions, asking whether he should speak of 'substance' or with whom to communicate in the East.
  
  
    From this, it is understood...
  


    
        Learned and wise men, shining with the lamp of preaching and knowledge in various parts of the world, have not only not departed from the holy Roman Church but have also, in times of necessity, sought help from it to strengthen their faith. As we have regularly mentioned and shown by examples, all Catholics should observe the rule of the church to seek help from it after Christ to defend their faith. The Roman Church, which has no stain or wrinkle, crushes the monstrous heads of heresies and strengthens the minds of the faithful in faith.
    
    
        Although many have departed from its holy and venerable communion, our church has never left it. Instead, guided by its apostolic teaching and receiving all good and perfect gifts from Him from whom they come, it has continually accepted revered gifts. From the earliest times of faith, our church has remained united with it in the sacred union of religion. Even when separated slightly, which is not against the faith, in the celebration of services, through the care and diligence of our illustrious and excellent father, King Pepin, and the arrival in Gaul of the most reverend and holy man, Stephen, bishop of the city of Rome, it was united in the order of chanting, so that the order of chanting would not differ from the order of believing, and those united by one sacred law in sacred reading would also be united by one venerable tradition of chanting. The varied celebration of services should not separate those whom the pious devotion of one faith had united.
    
    
        We, too, having been granted the kingdom of Italy by God, have sought to elevate the prestige of the holy Roman Church and to heed the salutary exhortations of the most reverend Pope Adrian. Thus, many churches in that part, which once refused to accept the tradition of the apostolic see in chanting, now embrace it with all diligence. Those who adhered to the gift of faith now also adhere to the order of chanting. Not only are all the provinces of Gaul, Germany, and Italy doing this, but also the Saxons and some people from the northern regions, who have been converted to the rudiments of true faith through us with God's favor, are known to do this. They take care to follow the seat of blessed Peter in all things, as they desire to reach the place where he, the key-bearer, resides.
    
    
        May He, who deigned to found His church on Peter and through whose intervention we are followers of his chair, make us worthy to attain the kingdom of heaven, of which he was made the key-bearer, and persevere in the union and fellowship of the holy church.
    



Chapter 7:About how it pertains to not adoring images, which is written: "God created man in His image and likeness."




  
    
      In this testimony, it is irrelevant and even more than irrelevant that those in their synod placed it to support the error of worshipping images, as it diverges greatly from their assertion based on numerous indications.
    
    
      Where there is no resemblance, there is not much room for debate.
    
    
      Therefore, since no one with a sound mind believes it pertains to what they try to apply it to, it must be examined spiritually with a spiritual investigation.
    
    
      It remains for us to note briefly what the style of the holy fathers has expressed about it, so that what they have carelessly misused and what venerable men filled with the Holy Spirit have spiritually stated may be carefully understood by the reader.
    
  
  
    
      For the blessed Ambrose says: "In the beginning of the world, I hear the Father and the Son are present, and I see their work.
    
    
      I hear them speaking, I recognize them creating, but I also read one image and one likeness of the Father and the Son.
    
    
      This likeness is not of diversity but of unity.
    
    
      For man cannot be in the image of God except through the image of God.
    
    
      Therefore, the image of God is to be considered by the movement of the inner man.
    
    
      Just as God is one, always, everywhere whole, quickening, moving, and governing all things, as the Apostle confirms, 'in Him we live, move, and have our being,' so too the soul is whole in its body, quickening it, moving it, and governing it everywhere.
    
    
      It is not greater in the larger parts of its body and smaller in the smaller parts, but whole in the smallest and whole in the largest.
    
    
      And this is the image of the unity of the omnipotent God that the soul has within itself.
    
    
      It also has a certain image of the holy Trinity.
    
    
      Just as God is, lives, and knows, so too the soul in its highest form is, lives, and knows.
    
    
      There is also another trinity in it, which is made in the image of its creator, the perfect and highest Trinity, which is in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
    
    
      And although it is less than that nature, it still has three dignities in itself, namely intellect, will, and memory.
    
    
      The same is indicated in the Gospel, though in different words, when it says: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,' that is, with all your intellect, all your will, and all your memory.
    
    
      For just as the Son is generated from the Father, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, so too will is generated from intellect, and memory proceeds from both of them, as any wise person can easily understand.
    
    
      Nor can the soul be perfect without these three, nor can any one of these three be complete without the other two as far as its happiness is concerned.
    
    
      And just as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are, not three gods, but one God with three persons, so too the soul is intellect, the soul is will, the soul is memory, not three souls in one body, but one soul with three dignities.
    
    
      And in these three, our inner man wonderfully bears His image in its nature.
    
    
      The likeness, however, should be seen in morals, so that just as God the Creator, who created man in His own likeness, is love, goodness, justice, patience, and meekness, pure and merciful, and other virtues of the saints that are read about Him, so too man was created to have love, to be good and just, patient and meek, pure and merciful.
    
    
      The more someone has these virtues within themselves, the closer they are to God and the greater their likeness to their Creator.
    
  
  
    
      The blessed Augustine also discussed how man was made in the image and likeness of God.
    
    
      When divine Scripture mentions both the outer and inner man and makes such a distinction, and the Apostle said, 'Even though our outer man is perishing, yet the inner man is being renewed day by day,' one might ask which of these was made in the image and likeness of God?
    
    
      It is foolish to ask if it is one, which one?
    
    
      For who doubts that it is rather the one...
    
  


    
        Who is renewed, whom he, who is corrupted, speaks of? However, whether both are, is a great question. For if the outer man is Adam and the inner man is Christ, then both are understood well. But since Adam, as he was made by God, did not remain good and became carnal through loving carnal things, it cannot absurdly be said that this very thing was his fall, losing the image and likeness of God. Therefore, he himself is renewed and he himself is the inner man.
    
    
        So how is he both the inner and the outer man? Is it according to the body, so that he is the inner man according to the soul and the inner man is the resurrection and renewal, which happens according to the death of the previous life, that is, of sin, and according to the regeneration of the new life, that is, of righteousness? These same two men he calls, so that one is the old man, whom we ought to put off, the other the new man whom we should put on. Again, he calls one the image of the earthly man because it is carried according to the sin of the first man, who is Adam; the other the image of the heavenly man because it is carried according to the righteousness of the second man, who is Jesus Christ.
    
    
        The outer man, who is now corrupted, will be renewed in the future resurrection, when he has paid this death, which he owes to nature by that law, which was given in paradise through a commandment. How it is not incongruous to say that even the body was made in the likeness of God is easily understood by those who carefully attend to what was said: "And God made everything very good." For no one doubts that it was originally good.
    
    
        Things can be said to be like God in many ways: some according to virtue and wisdom, because in Him is virtue and uncreated wisdom; others inasmuch as they exist, because He is supremely and primarily existing; others inasmuch as they live, because He is supremely and primarily living. Therefore, those things that only exist, yet do not live or have wisdom, are not perfectly, but slightly in His likeness, because they are good in their own order, since He is above all good, and they are good. Moreover, all things that live and do not have wisdom participate a bit more in the likeness. For what lives, exists, but not all that exists, lives.
    
    
        Now those that have wisdom are so near in likeness to Him that there is nothing nearer in creation. For what participates in wisdom lives and exists; but what lives must exist, it does not need to have wisdom. Therefore, since man can participate in wisdom according to the inner man, he is so made in the image of God that no nature is formed in between, and for this reason, nothing is closer to God, for he has wisdom, lives, and exists, which no creature is better.
    
    
        If the outer man is taken as that life by which we perceive through the body with the five most well-known senses, which we have in common with animals—for this too can be corrupted by sensible troubles, which are brought on by persecutions—it is not without reason that this man too is said to be a partaker of the likeness of God, not only because he lives, which also appears in animals, but moreover because he is turned towards the mind governing him, which wisdom illuminates, which cannot happen in animals lacking reason.
    
    
        Also, the body of man, because among earthly animal bodies it alone is not prone to any prostration, since it is visible and stands upright to look at the sky, which is the beginning of visible things. Although it is known to live not by itself but by the presence of the soul, yet it is not only good because it exists, but also because it is such that it is more apt for contemplating the sky. It can rightly be considered more made in the image and likeness of God than other animal bodies.
    
    
        However, because man is not rightly called without life, not the body alone is the outer man nor the life alone, which is in the sense of the body, but both together perhaps are better understood as the outer man. Nor is it unwisely distinguished that one thing is the image and likeness of God, who is also called the Son, another thing is made in the image and likeness of God as man is accepted. There are also those who do not understand without reason that the two are said to be in the image and likeness, since if it were one thing, one name would have sufficed, but they want the mind to be made in the image, which is from the very truth with no intervening substance.
    


    
        The soul, which is also called the spirit, is not the Holy Spirit, who is of the same substance as the Father and the Son, but the spirit of man. For the Apostle distinguishes them in this way: 
        
            "No one knows what is going on in a man except the spirit of the man, and no one knows what is going on in God except the Spirit of God."
        
        Similarly, about the spirit of man, he says: 
        
            "May your spirit, soul, and body be kept safe."
        
        And this spirit was created by God just like the rest of creation. For it is written in Proverbs in this way: 
        
            "Know that the Lord knows the hearts of men and who formed the spirit of man, He knows all things."
        
    
    
        Therefore, this spirit is understood to be made in the image of God, without any doubt, in which there is understanding of truth. For truth is associated with no creature in between: the rest of man is seen to be made in likeness, because every image is similar, but not everything that is similar is properly an image, though it can perhaps be said abusively. 
        
        But one must be careful in such matters, so nothing is overly assumed beyond what should be properly kept, lest, because any body is extended through local spaces, anything like that is believed to be the substance of God. For a thing that is lesser in part than in whole does not suit the dignity of the soul, how much less the majesty of God?
    
    
        See how subtly and healthily holy men have discussed that man is made in the image and likeness of God, namely the image in the soul, in which there is intellect, will, and memory, and likeness in morals, that is, in love, justice, goodness, and holiness, all of which are incorporeal! 
        
        How far removed are those who apply this testimony to images shaped by the hands of artists from the sense and teaching of these holy men, it is not for us to discuss here, but rather it is reserved for the judgment of the reader, so that his own sense may warn how foolish they are in this part, not our pen.
    
    
        Whoever therefore believes that man is made in the image and likeness of God in the same way that an image shaped by an artist is made in the image of man, shows that he believes something corporeal in God, which is a blasphemous belief. 
        
            For if what is made in the image and likeness of God is applicable to man-made images, then man is made in the image of God according to bodily form; and if man is made in the image of God according to bodily form, then God is corporeal.
        
        
        But God is incorporeal, therefore what is made in the image and likeness of God is not applicable to man-made images.
    



Chapter 8:What is the difference between image and likeness and their equality.




  
    
      Since, with God's help, we have followed sound and sober teachings of the holy fathers to understand how God created man in His image and likeness, it is now worth examining briefly the difference between image, likeness, and even equality.
    
    
      This is so that those who worship images and are carried away by boundless assertions can understand these three terms, which they often consider as one, and recognize the extent of their error.
    
    
      Additionally, diligent readers can gain some useful insights.
    
  
  
    
      These three terms need to be distinguished because everything that is an image is also a likeness, but not everything that is a likeness is an image.
    
    
      While an image never lacks likeness, likeness can often lack image, and both likeness and image can sometimes lack equality.
    
    
      This equality can sometimes be linked with both image and likeness.
    
    
      Although these three terms belong to the same category, known as relation, they each have certain properties that others do not.
    
    
      For an image, it is always expressed from another; for likeness and equality, they remain in their own substance, not expressed from another but rather resembling or being equal to other things.
    
    
      An image does not admit degrees, while likeness and equality do.
    
    
      For example, one can say something is more or less similar or more or less equal, but not more or less an image.
    
    
      There is also a subtle contradiction in their interchange, known as antistrophe in Greek.
    
    
      Discussing all these details would be lengthy.
    
    
      However, to clearly understand the difference between these three terms, we must refer to the words of the blessed Augustine.
    
  
  
    
      Augustine says:
    
    
      "Where there is an image, there is likeness, but not necessarily equality. Where there is equality, there is likeness, but not necessarily an image. Where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image or equality."
    
    
      For example, a mirror shows an image of a person because it is expressed from that person.
    
    
      There is necessarily likeness, but not equality, because the image lacks many qualities of the person it reflects.
    
    
      Where there is equality, there is also likeness, but not necessarily an image, such as between two equal faces, where each has what the other has.
    
    
      However, they are not images of each other because neither is expressed from the other.
    
    
      Where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image or equality.
    
    
      For example, every egg is similar to every other egg, but an egg from a partridge, though similar to a hen’s egg, is not an image of it because it is not expressed from it, nor is it equal because it is shorter and belongs to a different kind of animal.
    
    
      However, the phrase "not necessarily" implies that it sometimes can be.
    
    
      Thus, there can be an image that also has equality, such as between parents and children, where there is image, equality, and likeness if the time difference is ignored.
    
    
      The child is rightly called an image of the parent because it is expressed from the parent and can have such likeness that it is also called equal, except for the time by which the parent precedes.
    
    
      Therefore, equality can sometimes have not only likeness but also image, as shown in the previous example.
    
    
      There can also be likeness and equality without an image, as mentioned with equal faces.
    
    
      There can be likeness and image without equality, as shown with the mirror example.
    
    
      There can also be likeness where there is both equality and image, as with children, except for the time by which parents precede.
    
  
  
    
      With these rules of difference briefly laid out, let us move on to what we have begun with appropriate order, and let the testimonies of divine law wrongly used by others be rightly proclaimed by the teachings of the venerable fathers, so that their flight may be grounded with these wings broken, which they have arrogantly taken for themselves.
    
  


  
    
      May the minds of the diligent readers, who wish to make good use of these things, ascend to higher understanding.
    
  



Chapter 9:About how to understand what is written: "Abraham worshipped the people of the land, the sons of Heth," or how Moses is said to have worshipped - from which examples, those who wrongly adore images make synods, fulfilling their error - and what Jacob, Pharaoh, and Daniel of Nebuchadnezzar are said to have worshipped.




  
    Those who are passionate about worshipping images particularly and familiarly use the example that Abraham is read to have worshipped the sons of Heth and Moses to have worshipped Jethro, the priest of Midian.
  
  
    The worship in these cases is as far removed from the worship of an image as a painted man is from a real man. Just as a real man is distinct from a painted one—rational from irrational, sensible from insensible, animated from inanimate in their definition—so too, without a doubt, is this worship distinct from that worship. For it is one thing to greet a man with the duty of salutation and the service of humanity by worshipping, and another to worship a picture composed of different colors, without movement, without voice, or other senses, with some unknown form of worship. Indeed, we are taught by the examples of almost all the holy Scriptures to love brotherhood and to show affection towards our neighbors and to embrace the step of humility, through which we greet each other with worship. But we are prohibited rather than instructed to worship or greet images or to venerate certain insensible trifles in almost all places of the divine Scriptures. For, to remain silent about the rest, the most sacred shepherd, upon whom the holy church is founded on the most solid rock, did not say: "love images," but: "love brotherhood," nor: "be subject to pictures," but: "be subject to every human creature," and he taught us to sanctify the Lord Christ not in images, but in our hearts.
  
  
    It is indeed utterly foolish and devoid of all reason to use as an example for establishing the worship of images that Abraham is read to have worshipped the people of the land and Moses to have worshipped Jethro, the priest of Midian. Holy men have worshipped out of humility, by which they pleased God, for the sake of salutation. Often they have humbly fled to avoid being worshipped by others, and often, standing firm in the rigor of their sanctity, they have despised worshipping the proud. But they have never attempted, even slightly, to worship images. For in that Abraham and Moses are read to have worshipped humble men necessary for their usefulness, and Mordecai is found to have despised worshipping Haman, an arrogant man aspiring to the destruction of God's people, it is clearly shown that holy men are companions to the humble, either to encourage them to better things or to not lose the gifts of the same supreme virtue. Against the wickedness of the wicked, either to avoid the company of the evil or to compel them to repent, they stand firmly. Therefore, in that John in the Apocalypse is restrained by an angel from worshipping him, the angel saying: "See that you do not do that; I am your fellow servant," and Peter, the shepherd of the church, gently avoided the worship of the centurion, saying: "Stand up, brother, I am also a man like you," and Paul, the chosen vessel, strongly rejected the worship of the Lycaonians with Barnabas, it is undoubtedly prohibited to give the worship due only to God, who alone is to be worshipped and revered, to any creature, except for the sake of salutation, through which humility is demonstrated.
  
  
    Let the most holy Augustine tell us what he thinks about this worship of Abraham or Moses. For he says: Here is also indicated an example of humility, that Moses, with whom God spoke, did not disdain or despise the advice of his foreign father-in-law, and whether Jethro himself, though he was not an Israelite, should be considered among the men who worship the true God and are religiously wise, just as it is rightly questioned about Job, though he was not from that people, or whether he sacrificed to the true God among His people when he saw his son-in-law, or whether Moses himself worshipped him, although even if worship was expressly mentioned, honor would seem to be due to his father-in-law.
  


  
    
      Added in the same way, as is customary for honor to be shown to people by their fathers, just as it is written about Abraham, that he bowed to the sons of Heth.
    
    
      But it should not be passed over in silence that they say Jacob bowed to Pharaoh or that Daniel bowed to King Nebuchadnezzar, which indeed is neither found in the Hebrew nor in our Latin texts, which were translated from Hebrew truth by the blessed Jerome.
    
    
      For it is read that Jacob was in Pharaoh's presence no more than once.
    
    
      This is how Scripture narrates it:
    
    
    
      After this, Joseph brought his father before the ruler and placed him before him.
    
    
      Jacob, blessing him, was asked by him, "How many are the days of your life?"
    
    
      Jacob replied, "The days of my pilgrimage and life are 130 years, few and evil, and they have not reached the days of my fathers, in which they sojourned."
    
    
      And having blessed the king, he went out.
    
    
      In these words, it is shown that he did not bow but blessed him.
    
    
      Even if he had done so, it would not be to set an example for the worship of images but to show the humility of the holy patriarch, fearing God, and honoring the king.
    
  
  
  
    
      Given these circumstances, I think that those who consider divine Scripture to use their familiar way of speaking, which some call anachronism, and thus use 'bless' for 'bow'.
    
    
      This manner of speaking is peculiar to them to such an extent that they use 'have', 'salute', 'kiss', and 'venerate' for 'bow', and others do the same, and, so to speak, almost all such words are turned into 'bow' for them.
    
    
      But Holy Scripture, like other errors, also rejects this manner of speaking, always using pure, proper, fixed, and prudent words or sentences, as the prophet attests, who says: "The law of the Lord is perfect."
    
    
      If it used 'bless' for 'bow', it would use improper words.
    
    
      If it used improper words, it would be reprehensible.
    
    
      But it is perfect, therefore it did not use 'bless' for 'bow'.
    
  
  
  
    
      So say, Daniel, say, holy Daniel, say, man of desires, say, investigator of secrets, say, prophet, who is proven to have spoken more openly about the Redeemer of the world, because you not only write that he is to come, which is common to you with others, but also teach the time he is to come, arrange kings in order, and enumerate years and predict very clear signs, say, did you bow to Nebuchadnezzar, as they babble?
    
    
      In my book, I do not read that I did this.
    
    
      Even if I had done so, their assertion would not be supported in any way.
    
  
  
  
    
      I proposed in my heart not to defile myself with his food or the wine he drank, and they say I bowed to him.
    
    
      Thus, falling on his face and bowing to me and ordering sacrifices and incense to be offered to me and confessing the God of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of mysteries, who can open secrets, and addressing me with flattering words for the greatness of the signs of which I am the dwelling, rather than me bowing, and always asking him to exercise mercy towards the people of Israel, or to appoint my fellow captives, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, over the works of the province of Babylon, I did not bow in flattery.
    
    
      Even if I had bowed, I would not have worshipped something senseless but, remaining submissive to a higher power out of humility, I would have honored a rational man, knowing that there is no power except from God.
    
  
  
  
    
      For since I once had such a fortunate way of life that when occasions were sought by the king's side by my envious accusers, I was accused of nothing except my lawful duties to my God, and I was thrown into the lion's den, and now I am accused of bowing to someone I did not bow to, and am said by false witnesses to have done what I did not do, it remains, as David exclaimed: "False witnesses have risen against me, and iniquity has lied to itself."
    
  
  
  
    
      Therefore, since they accuse both the patriarch Jacob and the prophet Daniel because of their love for images and attempt to twist the meanings of divine Scriptures to strange interpretations and advance their own...
    
  


    
        If successors or parents disregard the law's command, it remains that they are content only with these things and their protection, unwilling to correct their error, just as they believe themselves to be fortified.
    
    
        And let them take pride in images, but we will take pride in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to us and we to the world.
    



Chapter 10:About how John the Presbyter and the legates of the Eastern Church said in a certain synod about adoring statues: "Erecting Jacob with a staff, whom God blessed."




  
    
      It's not a minor foolishness to use this example to support the veneration of images, as John the Presbyter and ambassador of the Easterners mentioned in the same synod, which was convened for the purpose of venerating images, because that stone is not believed to be the image or likeness of any past thing.
    
  
  
    
      If it had been set up by the holy patriarch to be worshipped and was an image representing a past event, it might perhaps give some support to those who did not fear to face the danger of such a great error.
    
    
      But while one thing is to be made by the patriarch as a foreshadowing of future things, another thing is to be painted by an artist to remember past deeds.
    
    
      One thing is to be filled with the Holy Spirit, another to be imbued with artistic skill.
    
    
      One thing is to be endowed with heavenly grace, another to be created through the skill of workmanship.
    
    
      One thing is Jacob setting up a stone as a pillar, another is an artist placing an image on a wall.
    
    
      One thing is to pour oil over it according to a symbolic figure, another is to command worship according to a vain assertion.
    
  
  
    
      It is useless and more than useless to propose this as an example to support anything, as it seems to differ in every way from that matter.
    
    
      Did Jacob set up that stone to be worshipped or did he paint an image of anything on it?
    
  
  
    
      For while images have almost no other purpose than to bring memory to minds through their sight, the stone set up by the patriarch is believed to have had three significant and highly honorable functions.
    
  
  
    
      First, it supported the head of Israel and acted as a pillow for the patriarch who lacked one, and it was burdened by his head, who not only saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven and angels ascending and descending on it, but also the Lord himself promising good things to him.
    
  
  
    
      Second, it was set up as a sign and a marker so that the holy patriarch could remember that holy place, and upon returning, gladdened by the affection of his offspring and wives and enriched with great wealth, he could fulfill his vows to the Lord who had granted him all these things.
    
  
  
    
      Third, it bore the figure of our Mediator, who became the cornerstone and is marvelous in our eyes.
    
    
      He was anointed by the Father with the oil of gladness above his companions.
    
    
      Daniel also calls him the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, born from the virgin's womb without human intercourse and seed.
    
    
      David also calls him the rock, saying: The Lord is my rock and my strength and my savior.
    
    
      About whom it is also written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.
    
  
  
    
      Hence he is called the cornerstone, as he joins two walls coming from opposite directions, namely circumcision and uncircumcision, or even the two Testaments, in himself, the chief, chosen, precious stone, and unites them in one assembly of the holy church, of which he is the head.
    
    
      About whom it is also said by the prophet Zechariah with the paternal voice: Behold, I will bring my servant, the Branch, because the stone I have set before Joshua has seven eyes.
    
    
      In these seven eyes, the sevenfold grace of the Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is clearly shown and is called by the prophet Isaiah the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of the Lord.
    
  
  
    
      About this cornerstone, the rock of the church says: Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good, to whom you come, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious.
    
    
      And shortly after: To you who believe, this stone is precious, but to those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
    
  


  
    He is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to those who stumble because of the word and do not believe, as they were destined to. This document shows that He is both an honor of strength to believers and a stumbling block of hardness to unbelievers.
  
  
    This was also foretold by the just Simeon in this sense. For he said: This one is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, for the fall of unbelievers and the rise of believers.
  
  
    He is also called fire, either because He illuminates believers with the eternal light or because He will burn unbelievers with the eternal fire.
  
  
    Concerning the anointing of this stone, it was mentioned a little earlier in the oracles of David, and now it must be brought forth by the testimony of the aforementioned shepherd of the church, who says: Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and power.
  
  
    Since the Holy Spirit is often signified by the name of oil in the divine Scriptures, the apostle John is a witness who says: As His anointing teaches us about all things.
  
  
    Those who are anointed with the inexpressible nectar should not agitate synods or misuse the holy Scriptures to support the worship of images.
  



Chapter 11:About what St. John wrote: "The people are pleased when they are like God, and they adore and worship the true God."




  
    
      But even that statement by the same John, presbyter and envoy of the Easterners, is not free from criticism.
    
    
      Among other ramblings, he is said to have declared about Jacob: "He wrestled with him in the form of a man and called him Israel, which means 'the mind seeing God.'"
    
    
      This statement is far from the intended meaning and omits a more common interpretation of the name.
    
  
  
    
      While some interpret the name as "Man seeing God," others as "Strong with God," and yet others more accurately as "Prince with God," it is uncertain if any of those accepted in the canon ever interpreted it as "the mind seeing God."
    
    
      Therefore, not only should he be criticized for presenting an almost unheard-of interpretation while disregarding more common ones, but also the entire synod that supported his delusions should be criticized.
    
    
      This synod not only did not resist his claim but even recorded it in a volume.
    
  
  
    
      Thus, since the holy church, according to the teachings of the holy fathers, accepts everything that is irreproachable and rejects everything that is reprehensible, it must also reject this synod, which is undoubtedly reprehensible.
    
    
      If it does not reject this reprehensible synod, it neither accepts those that are irreproachable.
    
    
      Therefore, it should utterly reject this one, as it is open to criticism.
    
    
      The holy and universal church accepts those synods that, for various reasons of faith or religion, were celebrated by learned and Catholic men at different places and times and do not deviate in any way from sound and sober doctrine.
    
  
  
    
      Moreover, the wrestling of such a great patriarch with an angel is said to prefigure not some veneration of images but the Lord's passion among the same people.
    
    
      This people prevailed against Him by wrestling because they crucified Him, and they received a blessing from Him in those who believed in Him, but they remained lame in those who despised belief in Him.
    
    
      As the blessed Augustine says: "Jacob desired to be blessed by that angel, whom he prevailed against by wrestling; this is a great prophecy about Christ."
    
    
      For he indicates something mystical, since every man wants to be blessed by a greater one.
    
    
      How then did he want to be blessed by the one he prevailed against by wrestling? Jacob prevailed over Christ, or rather seemed to prevail through those Israelites by whom Christ was crucified, and yet He blesses them in those Israelites who believed in Christ, of whom it was said: 'For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.'"
    
  
  
    
      Thus, Jacob is both lame and blessed.
    
    
      Lame in the breadth of his thigh, as in the multitude of his descendants, about whom it was said: "And they limped out of their paths," but blessed in those about whom it was said: "The remnant chosen by grace will be saved."
    
  



Chapter 12:About how the adoration of images does not pertain to our beliefs, nor is it found in our codes, but it is discovered that those in the synod said: "Jacob, accepting his sons, took his garment and worshipped Joseph, kissing him with tears and placing his own eyes on him."




  
    It is not surprising if Jacob is accused by them of kissing Joseph's tunic and placing it on his eyes, just as they accuse Pharaoh of worshipping.
    It often happens that someone who begins to be deceived once is frequently deceived, and someone who once strays from the path and neglects to follow the guide of his journey is carried away by error through rough and pathless places.
  
  
  
    For Joseph's tunic is not said to have been kissed or placed on the eyes by his father in either the Hebrew or Latin books translated from Hebrew truth.
    Even if it were said to have happened, in no way would the worship of images be even slightly implied in this act, since it is one thing to worship and another to kiss—something they mistakenly think is the same—and another to worship a painted image, and another to place the robe of a son, believed to be dead, on the eyes out of fatherly affection and compelled by grief, with eyes wet with tears.
    It is one thing to bow to a certain likeness, and another to give a kiss of internal devotion to the robe of a beloved son.
  
  
  
    Thus, the holy patriarch was so troubled by the storm of his disturbed mind that not only did he kiss the robe of his son, whom he believed to have been taken by the cruelty of death, or place it on his eyes, but he also, disregarding consolation, exaggerated his misfortunes with funereal words, declaring that he would descend to hell after him.
    How then can it be believed that blessed Jacob did not kiss or place on his eyes the tunic of his son, but only saw and recognized it?
    This order is commemorated by the holy Scripture.
    It says:
    "They took his robe, and dipping it in the blood of a goat they had killed, sent it to their father and said: 'We found this, see whether it is your son's robe or not.'
    When the father recognized it, he said: 'It is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him, Joseph has been torn to pieces.'"
  
  
  
    Finally, let us briefly explain what this robe of that holy man prefigured in typical sacraments and implied in silent mysteries, so that their vain assertion is refuted and the reader's mind is soothed.
    For Joseph, whose name means "increase" and who was called "Savior of the world" by the Egyptians, typified him who saved the human race by his death, nourished the world with spiritual food, and made the seed of his faith grow so much that it filled the whole world and connected earthly things with heavenly ones through the same faith.
    His robe was dipped in the blood of a goat, because he appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh according to the Apostle and condemned sin in the flesh, or also, having become a sacrifice for sins, bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that being freed from evil, we might live with righteousness.
    By whose wound we are healed, who, like sheep, had gone astray.
  
  
  
    His robe is also the holy church, which is the body of Christ, as Paul testifies, who says:
    "I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of his body, which is the church."
    This robe is described as multicolored or varied, because the holy church is gathered from the variety of different nations or languages, as the psalmist teaches, who says:
    "The queen stood at your right hand in gold of Ophir, surrounded by variety."
    The same robe, described as reaching to the ankles, often signifies the perfection of holy men, who, being members of Christ, carry out the garment of good works to the end, that is, to the ankles.
  



Chapter 13:About how they ignorantly and disorderly say: "If you slander me for adoring the wood of the cross, why don't you slander Jacob for adoring the top of Joseph's staff?" But it is clear that he did not adore the wood seeing it, but the wood of Joseph, just as we adore Christ on the cross.




    
        Indeed, the claim that Jacob worshipped the top of Joseph's staff should not be omitted, because they boast of having a great example for worshiping images in this matter. Although in Latin texts it does not read: "He worshipped the top of Joseph's staff," but in some: "He worshipped over the head of his staff," and in the Hebrew truth, which must be given the most credence, it makes no mention of a staff at all but simply states: Israel worshipped God, turning toward the head of the bed.
        In this, as Blessed Augustine says, the old man lay and was positioned in such a way that he could pray without effort whenever he wanted.
        Since, as we mentioned earlier, some Latin texts have: "He worshipped over the top of the staff," we need to explain how this should be understood according to the teachings of the aforementioned doctor. He says: What the Latin texts have: "And he worshipped over the head of his staff," some correcting it have: "He worshipped over the head of his staff," or: "on the head of his staff," or "on the top" or "over the top."
        For they are mistaken by a Greek word, which is written with the same letters, either "his" or "his own," but the accents are different and were not observed in the manuscripts by those who moved these things.
        For they are capable of a great distinction, although it could have one more letter if it were "his own," so it would not be "autu," but "eautu."
        Thus, it is rightly questioned what was said. For it would be easily understood that the old man, who carried a staff in the manner that age usually does, when he bowed to worship God, did so over the top of his own staff, which he carried in such a way that he bowed his head over it to worship God.
        What, then, does it mean: "He worshipped over the top of his staff," that is, his son Joseph's? Perhaps he had taken the staff from him when his son swore to him, and while holding it after the words of the oath were spoken, he immediately worshipped God? For he was not ashamed to carry for a while the insignia of his son's authority, where signs of a great future event were prefigured.
        So, let them say, let them say what they will against these things, who do not fear to accuse the patriarch for worshiping images and seek to change the Holy Scriptures with a mad mind. Behold, the Hebrew truth proclaims that the same patriarch worshipped God at the head of the bed. Behold, the library of the Latins declares that he worshipped either over the head of the staff or on the head or on the top or over the top. Behold, the very learned man Augustine, inspired by the divine gift, declares with diligent investigation that he worshipped God at the top of his own or his son's staff, not the staff itself nor the son himself.
        Let them say who the translator of the holy law is that translated it as worshipping the top of the son's staff and worshipping the son in the same staff, who the most diligent investigator of the holy law is that treated it as worshipping the son's staff or the son rather than God?
        And when they cannot find this, they should realize that their understanding of the divine Scriptures is more corrupting or opposing than investigating.
        Since almost the entire series of divine law is either mutilated or changed by them for the worship of images, it is necessary that a new writing of the law be given after Moses, a new restoration of the law be found after Ezra, a new translation of the law be sought after the seventy interpreters, Theodotion, and Symmachus and Aquila or even Blessed Jerome, a new examination be conducted after the apostles and apostolic men filled with the Holy Spirit, which could so oppose the divine Scriptures that it binds all who disdain the worship of images with the chain of anathema.
        Moreover, what is the difference between the cross of Christ and images painted by the art of painters, or by what great mystery the cross surpasses images, or how the human race is redeemed not by images but by the cross of Christ - which they think of as either equal or equal in themselves -
    


    With the Lord's favor, we will explain these things in their proper place.



Chapter 14:About how the adoration of images does not pertain to them, and they say what is written: "Jacob blessed Pharaoh."




    
        It has already been said above that the often-remembered patriarch Jacob did not worship Pharaoh but blessed him.
        Now, because in another passage of the same very vain synod, "blessing" is somehow put in place of "worship," it must be briefly explained.
        For indeed, the writing of that vanity is so overrun with the darkness of ignorance that neither the following seems to agree with the preceding, nor the preceding with the following.
        As vanity holds lies, always fleeting, always falling, and always slipping away, as Solomon says: "He who relies on lies feeds on the winds, and he himself follows flying birds."
        Therefore, to establish the worship of images, in the love of which their mind hangs, and it is the purpose of all holiness, they strive to change many words or meanings, which pertain to something else, into "worship."
    
    
        For they do not think that the blessing of the same holy man to Pharaoh pertains to the same kind of blessing that exiles often give to citizens, subordinates to superiors, the poorer to the richer, and especially the old, who bestow certain benefits on them, but to some kind of painting of worshipped images, which is indeed useless, as it can in no way declare its effectiveness by speaking.
        For they say: "Jacob blessed Pharaoh, but he did not bless him as God; we worship the image, but we do not worship it as God."
        Oh, what an inappropriate comparison! Oh, what a dull guess! Oh, what a most foolish statement!
        You call it a similar blessing, which the holy patriarch gave to the king, who bestowed a mark of power on his most beloved son above others, who granted him and his entire offspring a fertile land to inhabit, who did not give him a portion of any province but the option of the entire land of his empire, to the worship you give to images, which can offer nothing to the worshippers except the memory of what they are!
        So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, not as God, whom every creature blesses and praises, nor as a painting, which the hand of an artist fits together, but as a man, to whom honor is due because of the power granted by God.
        He blessed him, I say, not as an insensate image, but as a rational man; not as something put together by the skill of a painter, but as someone created in the image and likeness of God; not as standing immobile on walls, but as someone who provides prosperity to himself or his offspring; and, so to speak, Israel blessed the king, who was imbued with the nectar of the same spirit, who later through the Apostle would say: "Bless and do not curse," who should pray not only for the one who enriched him and his offspring with the wealth of things but also for those who slandered and persecuted him.
        Therefore, this kind of blessing, which indeed was celebrated for the sake of good recompense, does not fit the worship of images; which can neither bring any recompense to those who worship them nor to those who disdain to worship them.
    

Chapter 15:How absurdly those act who, confirming images as parts of the divine law, bring forth the propitiatory and the two golden cherubim from the Ark of the Testament, which our Lord Moses made.




  
    Some people absurdly use examples from divine law to justify images, saying that Moses made the mercy seat, two golden cherubim, and the Ark of the Covenant by God's command.
  
  
    Moses indeed made the mercy seat, the Ark of the Covenant, and the two golden cherubim by God's command, and he also carved the stone tablets.
    But he did not command anyone to worship them.
    He is believed to have made these things not to remember past events but to prefigure sacred future mysteries.
  
  
    Given this, how absurd and insane are those who try to equate these sacred and highly revered objects commanded by God to images and attempt to establish their worship using these examples?
    Neither an iron voice nor our understanding can fully explain or comprehend this, especially since these sacred objects are filled with profound meanings and mysteries, while images have little use beyond reminding us of their subject.
  
  
    Since the Ark of the Covenant was made of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and contained the tablets of the covenant, manna, and Aaron's rod by God's order through the legislator, and since the mercy seat was to be made of gold in the same length and width as the Ark so that it could cover the Ark, and two golden cherubim were to be placed on the mercy seat facing each other with their wings overshadowing it, and from there God would speak to Moses from between the cherubim—who could be so dull and insane as to use the comparison of these significant and terrifying mysteries to justify not only having images but also worshiping them?
  
  
    These examples sometimes merely indicate the order of past events, sometimes even lie about events that never occurred, while the sacred objects always shine with holy and excellent mysteries and sacraments.
  
  
    The Ark of the Covenant, according to some, represents our Lord and Savior, in whom alone we have the covenant of peace with the Father.
    After His resurrection, He ascended to heaven and placed the flesh He took from the Virgin at the Father's right hand.
    This Ark contains the two tablets of the law, representing the two Testaments.
    It also contains Aaron's rod that budded, signifying that He is both King and Priest—King, as it is written: The Lord will send the rod of your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of your enemies, and Priest, as it is written: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
    The Ark also contains manna, the heavenly food, of which David the great prophet says: He gave them bread from heaven, and Man ate the bread of angels, and of which Jesus Himself says in the Gospel: I am the living bread that came down from heaven.
  
  
    The mercy seat is placed above it because the mercy of the Mediator surpasses the legal or evangelical commandments founded on it.
    We are saved not by the works of the law that we did, nor by our willing or running, but by His mercy, as the Father says: My truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
    And through the prophet, He says: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and through the psalmist: Your mercy is great, O Lord, and according to the apostle, He is the propitiation for our sins.
  
  
    The two cherubim represent the fullness of knowledge revealed in the two Testaments.
    They face each other because the law and the gospel are in great harmony, as the Lord says: I did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it.
    The cherubim face the mercy seat because the two Testaments always commend placing hope in God's mercy.
    From above the mercy seat, that is, from between the cherubim, God speaks because the Son is the Word of the Father through whom all things were made.
  


    
        Right with the Father in substance, as he himself says in the gospel: "I and the Father are one," or as he said to Philip: "He who sees me, sees the Father." The voice of God the Father is always heard in him between the two Testaments.
    
    
        According to many teachers of divine law, who treat these things morally, gold signifies wisdom, and the ark signifies the secret of God. In the ark, the law and manna and the rod of Aaron were commanded to be placed. The rod signifies power, the manna signifies grace, because without grace, there is no power to carry out commandments. However, because the law is not fully completed by anyone progressing, the mercy seat is above it; for this reason, it is needed for God to be merciful; and therefore it is placed above because mercy triumphs over judgment.
    
    
        The two cherubim overshadow the mercy seat with their wings, that is, they honor it by covering it, because these are mysteries, and they look at each other because they are in agreement—indeed, the two Testaments are represented there—and their faces are towards the mercy seat because they greatly commend the mercy of God, in which our only hope lies. Finally, God promised to speak to Moses from above the mercy seat between the cherubim.
    
    
        Furthermore, if rational creatures in the multitude of knowledge—because this is the interpretation of cherubim—are signified by those two animals, there are two of them to commend the fellowship of charity, and they overshadow the mercy seat with their wings because they attribute their wings to God, not to themselves, that is, they honor God with the virtues they excel in. And their faces are only towards the mercy seat because there is no hope for anyone's progress in a multitude of knowledge except in God's mercy.
    
    
        Therefore, the tablets, which signify the two Testaments as we said above, are given without any terror, without the noise of fires, without the shaking of clouds, without the sound of trumpets, unlike those which were given by the Lord and broken by Moses, when the people said to Moses: "Speak to us yourself, and let not God speak to us, lest we die." This clearly indicates that the former ones signified the Old Testament, in which there was terror, while the latter ones signify the New Testament, in which there is love. The former ones were the work of God, the latter the work of man, and the former were inscribed by the finger of God, the latter are said to be written by man.
    
    
        This clearly shows that in the former, as we said before, the Old Testament was signified, because God commanded there, but man did not do it. The law was given in the Old Testament to convict transgressors. Hence, the illustrious preacher says: "The law came in to increase the trespass." For it was not fulfilled out of fear but only out of love. Therefore, it is called the work of God because God established the law and inscribed it; it is not the work of man because man did not obey God, and the law rather made him guilty. However, in the second tablets, man makes and writes the tablets with the help of God because the love of the New Testament fulfills the law. Hence, the Mediator of God and men came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. The same illustrious preacher also says: "Love is the fulfillment of the law," and "faith working through love."
    
    
        Thus, it became easy for man in the New Testament what was difficult in the Old, having faith that works through love and with the finger of God, that is, the Spirit of God, writing it in the heart, not on stone. Hence, the Apostle says: "Not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts," because the love of God, through which the commandment is truly fulfilled, is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
    
    
        Therefore, the law was first given, signifying the Old Testament, which is the work of God alone and the inscription of the finger of God, as the Apostle says: "The law indeed is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good." The law, therefore, is holy and good, the work of God, where man does nothing because he does not obey but is rather oppressed by the threatening and condemning law. "For sin," he says, "to appear as sin, worked death in me through what is good." Blessed indeed is the man who fulfills this holy, just, and good commandment. It is also his work, but through the grace of God. This is the sense fitted...
    


  
    In the old translation, it is mentioned that the second tablets were written by the lawgiver. However, in the Hebrew truth, both the first and the second were written by God. This signifies that both the Old and New Testaments were written by the grace of the Holy Spirit, who is called the finger of God.
  
  
    In the former, the spirit of servitude in fear is received because God imposes the yoke of the law on man, which man cannot bear. In the latter, where the tablets are made by man but written by God, man receives the spirit of adoption by obeying.
  
  
    Therefore, these symbols, namely the Ark and what is in it, the mercy seat or cherubim, should always be observed by us with spiritual insight and sought with the full intention of the mind. Let us not seek them in painted tablets or walls, but let us view them in the innermost parts of our hearts with the eye of the mind.
  
  
    And as the Apostle says, with unveiled face beholding the glory of God, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord, who is the Spirit. We do not walk in craftiness or adulterate the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth, we no longer seek truth through images and pictures.
  
  
    Through hope, faith, and love, we reach the same truth, which is Christ, with His help.
  



  
    Some people absurdly use examples from divine law to justify images, saying that Moses made the mercy seat, two golden cherubim, and the Ark of the Covenant by God's command.
  
  
    Moses indeed made the mercy seat, the Ark of the Covenant, and the two golden cherubim by God's command, and he also carved the stone tablets.
    But he did not command anyone to worship them.
    He is believed to have made these things not to remember past events but to prefigure sacred future mysteries.

    These examples sometimes merely indicate the order of past events, sometimes even lie about events that never occurred, while the sacred objects always shine with holy and excellent mysteries and sacraments.
  
  
    The Ark of the Covenant, according to some, represents our Lord and Savior, in whom alone we have the covenant of peace with the Father.
    After His resurrection, He ascended to heaven and placed the flesh He took from the Virgin at the Father's right hand.

    The mercy seat is placed above it because the mercy of the Mediator surpasses the legal or evangelical commandments founded on it.
    We are saved not by the works of the law that we did, nor by our willing or running, but by His mercy, as the Father says: My truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
    And through the prophet, He says: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and through the psalmist: Your mercy is great, O Lord, and according to the apostle, He is the propitiation for our sins.
  
  
    The two cherubim represent the fullness of knowledge revealed in the two Testaments.
    They face each other because the law and the gospel are in great harmony, as the Lord says: I did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it.
    The cherubim face the mercy seat because the two Testaments always commend placing hope in God's mercy.
    From above the mercy seat, that is, from between the cherubim, God speaks because the Son is the Word of the Father through whom all things were made.
  


    
        Right with the Father in substance, as he himself says in the gospel: "I and the Father are one," or as he said to Philip: "He who sees me, sees the Father." The voice of God the Father is always heard in him between the two Testaments.

However, because the law is not fully completed by anyone progressing, the mercy seat is above it; for this reason, it is needed for God to be merciful; and therefore it is placed above because mercy triumphs over judgment.

        Therefore, the tablets, which signify the two Testaments as we said above, are given without any terror, without the noise of fires, without the shaking of clouds, without the sound of trumpets, unlike those which were given by the Lord and broken by Moses, when the people said to Moses: "Speak to us yourself, and let not God speak to us, lest we die." This clearly indicates that the former ones signified the Old Testament, in which there was terror, while the latter ones signify the New Testament, in which there is love. The former ones were the work of God, the latter the work of man, and the former were inscribed by the finger of God, the latter are said to be written by man.
    
    
        This clearly shows that in the former, as we said before, the Old Testament was signified, because God commanded there, but man did not do it. The law was given in the Old Testament to convict transgressors. Hence, the illustrious preacher says: "The law came in to increase the trespass." For it was not fulfilled out of fear but only out of love. Therefore, it is called the work of God because God established the law and inscribed it; it is not the work of man because man did not obey God, and the law rather made him guilty. However, in the second tablets, man makes and writes the tablets with the help of God because the love of the New Testament fulfills the law. Hence, the Mediator of God and men came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. The same illustrious preacher also says: "Love is the fulfillment of the law," and "faith working through love."
    
    
        Thus, it became easy for man in the New Testament what was difficult in the Old, having faith that works through love and with the finger of God, that is, the Spirit of God, writing it in the heart, not on stone. Hence, the Apostle says: "Not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts," because the love of God, through which the commandment is truly fulfilled, is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
    
    
        Therefore, the law was first given, signifying the Old Testament, which is the work of God alone and the inscription of the finger of God, as the Apostle says: "The law indeed is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good." The law, therefore, is holy and good, the work of God, where man does nothing because he does not obey but is rather oppressed by the threatening and condemning law. "For sin," he says, "to appear as sin, worked death in me through what is good." Blessed indeed is the man who fulfills this holy, just, and good commandment. It is also his work, but through the grace of God. This is the sense fitted...
    


  
    In the old translation, it is mentioned that the second tablets were written by the lawgiver. However, in the Hebrew truth, both the first and the second were written by God. This signifies that both the Old and New Testaments were written by the grace of the Holy Spirit, who is called the finger of God.
  
  
    In the former, the spirit of servitude in fear is received because God imposes the yoke of the law on man, which man cannot bear. In the latter, where the tablets are made by man but written by God, man receives the spirit of adoption by obeying.

    And as the Apostle says, with unveiled face beholding the glory of God, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord, who is the Spirit. We do not walk in craftiness or adulterate the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth, we no longer seek truth through images and pictures.
  
  
    Through hope, faith, and love, we reach the same truth, which is Christ, with His help.
  



Chapter 16:About how the adoration of images does not pertain, and they foolishly and irrationally think, which is written by the legislator: "See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and have filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding to accomplish all manner of workmanship in gold and silver and brass."




    
        
            The law, as the Apostle says, is spiritual.
            
            It is given to us by God in this dark journey of the present world to guide the steps of our minds, illuminated by its light, so that we may perceive the secrets of mystical meanings.
        
        
            For the commandment of the Lord is clear, says the prophet, enlightening the eyes; and the same:
            
            Your word is a lamp to my feet, Lord, and a light to my paths.
        
        
            Therefore, it is said through a certain wise man:
            
            The commandment of the law is a lamp and the light of life and correction and discipline.
        
        
            And Isaiah says: "From the night my spirit watches for you, God, because your commandments are a light on the earth."
        
        
            Since not all understand this light correctly, those who try to twist it to their senses for some unknown veneration of images and seek to support their error with it, even though they bring forth testimonies from it that do not pertain to the matter, are believed to be entirely devoid of this light.
        
    
    
        
            Therefore, because Bezalel was chosen by the Lord to make works of gold and silver and filled with the spirit of wisdom and understanding and knowledge, they draw this as a testimony to support their great error, as if the things made by him at the Lord's command and which symbolized the figures of mysteries were to be venerated.
        
        
            Bezalel, then, is interpreted as "in the shadow of God."
            
            Uri means "fire," and Hur is understood as "light."
        
        
            So whose type did this Bezalel, who, as we said, is interpreted "in the shadow of God," represent except that of him to whom the church always cries out:
            
            "Protect me under the shadow of your wings," and:
            
            "I will hope under the shadow of your wings until wickedness passes," and of whom the bride in the Song of Songs says:
            
            "I sat under his shadow, which I desired."
        
    
    
        
            For he is called the son of Uri, the son of Hur, because he is the indescribable radiance, God from God, light from light, of whom it is said through the prophet Habakkuk:
            
            "His radiance will be like the light."
        
        
            For God, as Moses says, is a consuming fire, which the Apostle Paul also affirms in the Epistle to the Hebrews with the same words, and the same Lord says through the prophet Zechariah:
            
            "Jerusalem will dwell without walls because of the multitude of people and livestock, and I will be a wall of fire around it."
        
        
            He, being of the same substance as the Father, spoke to Moses in the fire and said to the disciples in the gospel:
            
            "I have come to bring fire on the earth, and what do I desire except that it be kindled?"
        
        
            Were not their hearts burning within them when he spoke to them on the way and opened the Scriptures to them?
        
    
    
        
            Therefore, Bezalel is called by name because it is said to him by the paternal voice through the prophet Isaiah:
            
            "I have called you by your name; you are mine," and of whom it is said through Moses:
            
            "See, I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and bring you to the place I have prepared. Be attentive to him and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your transgression, for my name is in him."
        
    
    
        
            But neither is the lineage of this Bezalel, who was called by name, omitted.
            
            For the Scripture says:
            
            "The son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah."
        
        
            This is he, of whom it was previously said with the voice of Israel:
            
            "Judah is a lion's cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up," that is, to plunder hell on the cross; "he stooped down, he crouched as a lion," that is, in the sepulcher; and "as a lioness, who will rouse him?"
        
        
            For by the power of the Father, he rose from the dead on the third day.
        
        
            Hear the Apostle saying that it was by the power of the Father that he rose:
            
            "God raised him on the third day and made him manifest, not to all the people."
        
        
            Tell me, I ask you, Saint John, who reclined on the breast of the Mediator between God and men, drawing from the source of eternal light the cups of light-bearing wisdom, from which you daily offer the nectar of ambrosial liquid to the minds of Christians, if you know from where this Bezalel draws his lineage, whose type that one...
        
    


    
        The legal horse that once belonged to Bezalel? "I saw," I said, "in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne, a scroll written on the inside and outside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice: 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?' And no one in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look at it. And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look at it. Then one of the elders said to me: 'Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the scroll and its seven seals.'
    
    
        For while this Bezalel, whom we said foreshadowed Christ, is adorned with such prerogatives of virtues that he is chosen by God, called by name, filled with the Holy Spirit, and whose lineage is described, he is in vain taken as an example to confirm the adoration of images, as he is believed to have been superior to all painters and all artisans forming images. If the pictures or works of any craftsman are to be likened to his works, then those painters or any other craftsmen forming images are also to be likened. And if those painters or craftsmen forming images are to be likened, their works indeed bear notable prefiguration of the future. However, neither painters nor craftsmen nor their works bear any prefiguration of the future. Therefore, the pictures or works of any craftsman are not to be likened to his works.
    
    
        But since this new Bezalel, the Redeemer of the human race, possesses the spirit of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, who is indeed of one substance with the Father and the Son and proceeds from the Father and the Son, the prophet Isaiah is a witness. For he says:  'A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.'  And the same Lord says through the same prophet: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me.'
    
    
        Therefore, what he makes from gold and silver, he makes in the ornaments of the tabernacle, namely, holy men shining with gold, that is, with interior understanding, and gleaming with silver, that is, adorned with divine words, and, so to speak, having gold in their hearts according to 'For with the heart one believes unto righteousness,' and silver in the confession of the mouth according to 'With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation,' he establishes them in the tabernacle of God, that is, the holy church, to pass into the eternal homeland. These two, gold and silver, that is, faith and confession, the Apostle sought when he said: 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, because if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved.' These also Moses sought to adorn the tabernacle when he said: 'Take from among you an offering for the Lord. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as an offering to the Lord: gold, silver, and bronze.' He who is the wisdom of God the Father is known to dwell in holy men abounding in spiritual sense, as Scripture says: 'The wisdom of God is above precious stones, and its habitation is in golden vessels.' Of this wisdom, it is also said through Solomon: 'Blessed is the man who finds wisdom and gains understanding, for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her gain better than fine gold; she is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.'
    
    
        Because the brightness of divine words is understood in the silver, it is to be confirmed by the testimony of the psalmist saying: 'The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.'
    
    
        To this Bezalel, to accomplish the work, Aholiab is given as an assistant. Who does this Aholiab, who provides assistance to Christ, signify but the holy apostles and apostolic men, who, by the diligence of preaching and the examples of good works, guide people into...
    


  They make the church's embrace and virtues shine and lead to the eternal homeland, becoming helpers of Christ. Indeed, it was about these that he said:  
  We are God's helpers, you are God's field, you are God's building.
  
  Therefore, while all these things are full of allegorical meanings and presented through figures by the lawgiver, it is not only most foolish but also utterly insane to try to liken them to images that any craftsman, according to their own understanding, has created as they wished, or rather, as they were able to.




Chapter 17:About how they do not correctly understand, who say: "According to Moses' legitimate tradition, purple cloth is to be thrown on the tent in the wilderness with extreme vestments and for memory and observance of commandments, much more for us, through apostolic tradition, we see the pictures of saints as examples for our conversations, as we are commanded to imitate them."




  
    
      This entire chapter must be carefully examined piece by piece and each part individually addressed.
    
    
      Although it aims at a single error, it is composed of many errors pieced together.
    
  
  
    
      First, it must be discussed why they mention blue purple in the same chapter, when clearly one color is purple and another is blue.
    
    
      Just as it cannot be correctly said that red is white or white is red, as if one were to say silver gold or golden silver, so too it cannot be correctly said blue purple, nor can it be said purple blue in reverse, because such a derivation reciprocally will not remain with any sense of strength unshaken.
    
  
  
    
      As we have previously stated, one color is blue and another is purple, and the law given by the Lord through Moses, which specifically designates these four - blue, purple, scarlet, and linen - to make the priest's garments or other offerings for the sanctuary, bears witness to this.
    
    
      Our elders said that these four materials signify the four elements from which the world and the human body are made, and they taught that each one represents a specific virtue allegorically.
    
    
      They refer blue to the air, which the color itself indicates, scarlet to fire, purple to water because it takes its dye from water, and linen to earth because it grows from the ground.
    
  
  
    
      Secondly, it must be discussed that they try to support the use of images by the example of blue fringes, especially since the old law commands these fringes to be placed at the ends of garments as a mystery, but does not command images to be placed in sanctuaries to be worshiped, either in the Old or New Testament.
    
    
      For such madness cannot be supported by this example, since what was instituted by the lawgiver was to indicate certain signs of hidden meanings, and no well-commanded and well-done thing can be compared to such madness.
    
  
  
    
      Therefore, among the commands of the law given through Moses, the Lord added: "Tie them on your hand, and they shall be immovable before your eyes."
    
    
      Spiritually, we hold them immovable in our hands when we fulfill them in action, and we carry them before our eyes when we meditate on them day and night.
    
  
  
    
      He also commanded blue fringes to be made on the four corners of garments, either to distinguish the people of Israel or as a sign on the garment, like circumcision as a sign on the body, or so that we, who are the spiritual Israel, may have righteousness and holy conduct as our garment, with the ends of this garment adorned with blue fringes, so that our life may be instructed by the testimonies of the holy Scriptures.
    
  
  
    
      This is the good use of fringes well granted by the lawgiver to both carnal Israel and us, the spiritual Israel, but it was rather abused than held by them.
    
    
      About them, the Truth says in the Gospel: "They broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes."
    
    
      Whose example, I ask, do these people follow, except that of the Pharisees, who, while wanting to be called Rabbi by men and seeking the first greetings in the marketplace, the first seats in the synagogues, and longing to pass on their words or deeds to posterity out of vain glory, images that were well placed by some in the decoration of basilicas, compel others to worship them through foolish and useless councils?
    
  
  
    
      They magnify the fringes for vain glory, and similarly, these people worship images out of vanity.
    
    
      They broaden well-instituted fringes for vain glory, and these people exalt well-made images by worshiping them wrongly.
    
    
      They think they are obeying Moses' commandments by magnifying the fringes, and these people think they are pleasing all the saints by worshiping images.
    
  



They are known to be heading towards a madness destined for a single error, and not without reason, since the causes or effects of these actions are nothing but the glory of vain praise or arrogance.



Therefore, to more clearly discuss the error of this most vain chapter, which we have proposed to examine in detail, it is necessary to repeat the text in order:



‘For they babble: If, according to the lawful tradition of Moses, the people are commanded to place purple and blue in the fringes on the edges of their garments as a reminder and keeping of the commandments, how much more for us is it to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting.’



This phrase, ‘how much more' - which pertains to ‘it is commanded,’ should be understood as: ‘if it is commanded to the people, how much more to us’ - can have no sense at all, since it is not only not commanded much more, but not even equally or less, nor does this error seem to be commanded anywhere here.



What they say: ‘to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting,’ is almost infinitely absurd and insane, since in images the virtue of holy conversation cannot be seen, but only the material from which the images themselves are made. Can the virtues and insignia of merits, which were indeed in the subject, that is, in the mind, be seen in these as in some subject, when in these there is no soul which can be subject to virtues? But in these materials, that is, in the bodies, there are simply colors, and virtues cannot be in these as a subject or from a subject. Can we therefore discern the wisdom and eloquence in these, which many of them had?



Can we see the prudence in these, through which the recognition of true faith and the knowledge of divine things flourished in them, through which the threefold type of understanding is understood by the prudent in divine books?



The first is that by which certain things are accepted historically, setting aside enigmatic or allegorical figures, such as the Decalogue of the law.



The second, by which certain things in the Scriptures are mystically accepted both according to the faith of the deeds done and also according to the figure of allegorical senses, like the rock from which the lawgiver drew streams, which was historically a rock and produced water and allegorically bore the figure of Christ, who, as a rock founded on the foundation of Zion, satisfies the minds of believers with the honeyed cup of spiritual life.



The third type is that which is only spiritually accepted, such as in the Song of Songs, in which nothing is to be accepted historically but only spiritually.



Can justice be seen in these, through which the saints feared God, revered religion, took care to benefit all, harm none, embrace the bonds of brotherly love, either take on others' dangers or even help the wretched, and also repay the favor of received good or maintain fairness in judgments?



Can we perceive their fortitude in the colors of paintings, through which they patiently endured adversities with equanimity, bravely resisted temptations, fled from biting greed and glory, and wore the armor of which, being strong for labors, they prepared their minds against the wicked, yielding to no troubles? Can their temperance be seen in these images, through which they moderated the desire of the flesh? Since therefore none of these things which we have mentioned can be seen in these, it is great rashness to say: ‘to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting.’



The same vain chapter continues: ‘and to imitate their faith according to apostolic tradition.’ Can their faith, which according to the Apostle works through love, be imitated in images? Just as therefore the ‘outcome of the conversation of holy men’ cannot be seen in these, nor can faith be imitated, since those things which they lack cannot be seen in these nor imitated through these. Everything that lacks life lacks itself.



    Everything that lacks sense lacks faith.  Therefore, everything that lacks life lacks faith. Since hope, faith, and charity are invisible and incorporeal qualities according to their own substance, they cannot be seen in a true person who possesses them unless, perhaps, they are demonstrated in works.  For their seat, like that of other virtues, is in the soul, which is known to be invisible. And if they cannot be seen in a true person who undoubtedly has them, much less can they be seen in a painted one, who not only lacks these, as we have said before, but also lacks life.  And if they cannot be seen in these, much less can they be imitated in paintings.  From this, it is understood that the faith of those who claim they will imitate faith through images of saints is in vain.

Now, because they say 'according to apostolic tradition,' let them say where it was handed down by the apostles, either by example or by words, that through images we should see the outcome of the saints' conduct and imitate their faith.  The Apostle demonstrates the outcome of the saints' conduct in this way when he says:  "All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth" Hebrews 11:13, or when he says:  "By faith these people conquered kingdoms, administered justice, gained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle" Hebrews 11:33-34, and other things that follow.

Therefore, the Apostle very clearly shows what we ought to imitate when he says: "Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children" Ephesians 5:1; and in another place he says:  "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" First Corinthians 11:1.

From this, it is clearly evident that this is the apostolic tradition: that the outcome of the saints' conduct and their faith to be imitated can be seen not in paintings, but in virtues, not in images, but in good works.



Chapter 18:About how vain is the hope of those who place their salvation in images, saying: "As the Israelites looked upon the bronze serpent and were saved, so we are saved by beholding the images of saints."




    
        
            The hope of those who place their salvation in images is rejected by the Apostle, who argued that hope should not be in things that are seen but in things that are not seen.
        
        
            He said:
            
            "Hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what they see? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience."
        
    
    
        
            When the bronze serpent was made by Moses at the Lord's command and lifted up, it was not placed there to be worshipped but to temporarily counteract the venomous bites of fiery serpents.
        
        
            Those who believe they can be healed by looking at man-made images are deceived by false hope, just as the Israelites were healed by looking at the bronze serpent from deadly snake bites, especially since the Lord commanded Moses to make it, but no Scripture commands these images to be made.
        
    
    
        
            So what did that serpent signify, by whose inspection those bitten by snakes were healed?
        
        
            Our Redeemer Himself taught us when He said:
            
            "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up."
        
        
            When we look at Him with diligent minds and inner eyes, we overcome the deadly bites of the temptations of evil spirits and avoid the dangers of eternal death.
        
    
    
        
            Moreover, just as the words of divine law spoken by the Holy Spirit through the law, the prophets, the gospel, or the apostles are often misinterpreted by schismatics with perverse intentions, so too many things instituted or done by the fathers for our benefit are believed to have been misunderstood and perverted by later generations, such as phylacteries and fringes, as we have previously mentioned, or even the bronze serpent, which we now discuss.
        
        
            As we said before, it was necessary for a time to benefit those bitten by snakes, but later it became an object of excessive veneration.
        
    
    
        
            When the righteous King Hezekiah saw people burning incense to it and offering certain rituals, and that the people were greatly endangered by this error, he did not hesitate to break it.
        
        
            He knew it was made for their benefit by the lawgiver but saw it being worshipped vainly and superstitiously by the people.
        
        
            The praise of this same Hezekiah, the holy king, for removing vain superstitions and breaking the serpent, is recorded in divine scripture:
            
            "Hezekiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done. He removed the high places, broke the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it and called it Nehushtan. He trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him. He held fast to the Lord and did not depart from following Him; he kept the commandments that the Lord had given Moses. And the Lord was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered."
        
    
    
        
            Furthermore, such superstitions, which some believe they are doing out of love for God, like those who light candles to images of saints and worship them, are criticized by the blessed Jerome.
        
        
            While explaining the reading of the holy gospel about the fringes and phylacteries of the Pharisees, he said:
            
            "Among us, superstitious women practice these things with little gospels and pieces of the cross and similar items. They indeed have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel."
        
    
    
        
            Now, those who believe they can be saved by looking at images, just as the Israelites were healed by looking at the serpent, if they suffer some bodily affliction, they should turn to the images and look at them.
        
        
            If they are not healed by looking at them, they should turn back to the Lord and believe they will receive healing from Him through the intercessions of the saints.
        
    


    
        Who is the author of all health and life?
    



Chapter 19:About the great folly of those who say: "As the tables of the law, so the cross and the images of saints are to be adored by Christians."




  
    When they say, 
  
    For we, who do not follow the letter that kills but the spirit that gives life, who are not the carnal but the spiritual Israel, who, spurning visible things, contemplate the invisible, rejoice that we have received from the Lord symbols greater and more eminent than the tablets or two cherubim, which lack any mystery. The tablets and two cherubim were exemplars of future things, and while the Jews had these things carnally, which were covered in typical figures as prefigurations of future things, we have them spiritually in truth, which were prefigured by those carnal exemplars and prefigurations.
  
  
    As much as a body surpasses a shadow, truth surpasses an image, a deed surpasses a figure, so much does the New Testament surpass the Old; for the Old was dedicated by Moses when he had read all the commandments of the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves and goats "with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled the book itself and all the people, saying: 
  
    In the Old, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on the unclean sanctified them to the purification of the flesh. In the New, the blood of Christ, who through the Holy Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanses our consciences from dead works to serve the living and true God.
  
  
    In the Old, a lamb was killed for each family, and its flesh was used to celebrate Passover. In the New, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, who is the true unblemished lamb, was offered to God as a sacrifice, as the Apostle says: 
  
    In the Old, the kingdom of the Canaanites and the abundance of material things were promised. In the New, eternal life and the kingdom of heaven are granted.
  
  
    In the Old, a land flowing with milk and honey was promised. In the New, a heavenly homeland is promised, where it is given, what 
  
    In the Old, the beginnings of new moons were celebrated. In the New, a new creation in Christ is accepted, as attested by Paul, the chosen vessel, who says: 


  And rest was celebrated. In this rest of the Sabbath, rest in Christ is found, who said:
  "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you, and you will find rest for your souls."
  
  In the past, the sacrifice of animals involved the offering of flesh and blood. Now, the sacrifice of the flesh and blood of Christ is offered, which was symbolized by those animals.
  
  In the past, the heavy yoke of the law was placed upon the necks of the people, making them slaves. Now, the light yoke of Christ and the easy burden through the spirit of adoption makes them sons.
  
  Given these circumstances, it is perverse and extremely perverse that, by reversing the order, the superior is given to the inferior and the inferior to the superior, and the use of images is so magnified that it somewhat diminishes the affairs of Christians.



Chapter 20:About how no less all, and the people themselves, Tharasius declares and knows: "As the sacred altars of the divine propitiation are adorned, so are the images of our Lord Jesus Christ and the saints."






It is not inconsistent that Tarasius, who, as it is said, was extraordinarily promoted from a common life to the priestly summit, from military attire to religious garb, from the circus to the altar, from the chaos of the forum to preaching, from the clamor of arms to performing holy mysteries, compels the minds of his subordinates to revert from spiritual to carnal, from invisible to visible, from truth to image, from body to shadow, from life-giving spirit to the deadening letter, from the spirit of adoption to the spirit of fear.



Since he, having scorned the things that perhaps were not forbidden to him in his secular life, has flown to the degree of priestly summit, it follows that his subordinates, through his preaching, might fly from lawful spiritual observances to unlawful physical observances.



Therefore, since he encourages the use of worse things over better things, and because the ancients had cherubim made through Moses, from which God spoke overshadowing the mercy seat, he therefore urges the faithful to have images made by any craftsmen overshadowing the altar.



Let him make an ark, not from acacia wood, but from willow, not covered with gold, but with lead, which does not have golden rings, but bronze ones, in which there are no poles of acacia wood, but of beech; in which there are not the tablets with the Ten Commandments, but eleven, signifying the transgression of the law; in which there is not Aaron's rod, but any staff of his predecessors who were either anathematized by him or by whom he was anathematized; in which there is an urn, not with manna, but any grain seeds.



Let him also make a candlestick of pure lead and a table of the showbread, which is not called holy.
Let him write a book of the law, which commands anyone to quickly impose hands on it and to promote novices to bishoprics, which also teaches the making, worship, and adoration of images of things in heaven and on earth.



Having briefly gone over these things, why Tarasius did not preach correctly, because he did not ascend to the summit of the priesthood correctly, as it is said, and because he said: "Instead of cherubim, let us have images," using the same manner of speech which some call 'astismos,' let us now explain how the mercy seat is overshadowed by two cherubim within the holy church, either according to the tabernacle's design, which was set by Moses in the wilderness, or according to the temple's construction, which was built by Solomon in Jerusalem, comparing spiritual things with spiritual, with the Lord's help, so that we do not seem to derogate from the holy Scriptures in any way since we do not worship images.



First of all, we must ask why Moses, when he made the tabernacle, made two golden cherubim and placed them on the mercy seat which was on the ark, while Solomon added two much larger ones, which he placed in the temple with the ark in the middle under their wings, so that there were two cherubim in the tabernacle and four in the temple?
Both cases pertain to the same meaning, except that Solomon, who is interpreted as 'peaceful' and carried the figure of Christ, magnified the size of the two cherubim more grandly and broadly.
This act signifies that after the incarnation of the Lord, the church would be exalted more broadly through the gathering of various nations and coupled with heavenly citizens, who thus praise the Creator for the gift of bestowed happiness, rejoicing in our assumption and introduction to the same happiness.



For cherubim, as the prophet Ezekiel most clearly demonstrates, is the term for an angelic rank, and in singular it is called cherub, in plural cherubim.
Hence it is not inappropriate.


    In the figures of the cherubim, which were made in the inner sanctuary, the evangelical ministries are understood. They stand before their Creator in heaven and rejoice in their eternal happiness. They stretch their wings over the ark, attributing all the good they received to the praise of the Lord Savior.
  
  
    They extend their other wings to the walls of the sanctuary, rejoicing as they see holy men in their company, touching them with the tips of their wings, celebrating those who were their companions and followers in their purity in this life. They also touch the walls with their wings because they include the faithful of both peoples, Jews and Gentiles, in the heavenly hall. Not that there is a physical separation between the two peoples in that homeland, but because the joy of internal happiness is greater from the companionship of united brotherhood.
  
  
    Therefore, the cherubim extend their wings to both walls of the sanctuary, because in the heavenly homeland, they rejoice in the vision of the just from both peoples and excite praise to the Creator with their own glory.
  
  
    Not only do the heavenly hosts rejoice in the happiness of the just men they have with them inside, but they also care for us, who still cry out to the Lord from the depths. About these cherubim, it is well written in the book of Chronicles: "They stood with upright feet, and their faces were turned towards the outer house."
  
  
    The cherubim stood with upright feet because they are believed to have never deviated from the path of truth, where they were placed as soon as they were created. Their faces were turned towards the outer house because they desire us, rescued from the trials of this pilgrimage, to reach their company.
  
  
    Therefore, they stood with upright feet, their wings extended to the gold-covered walls of the sanctuary, and their faces turned towards the outer house, because the angels maintain their perpetual innocence and rejoice in the happiness of the holy souls in heaven, while also helping the chosen ones whom they see still wandering on earth, until they too are brought to the heavenly homeland.
  
  
    As we previously discussed in the earlier chapter, the two cherubim can also symbolize the two Testaments. They were made in the sanctuary because in the divine counsel of providence, which is inaccessible and incomprehensible to us, it was preordained before the ages when, how, and by which authors the sacred Scripture would be composed.
  
  
    They were made from olive wood, either because the divine books were written by men enlightened by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, or because they bring the light of knowledge aided by the flame of God's love, which is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.
  
  
    They are ten cubits tall because they preach that we should serve God through the observance of the Ten Commandments, showing that those who faithfully serve God will be rewarded with the heavenly kingdom. They have twin wings, indicating that the Testaments, through both hardships and prosperity, always reached and aspired to heavenly things with unwavering purpose, demonstrating that their authors should do the same.
  
  
    One wing of a cherub is five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub is five cubits, symbolizing that in all the changes of worldly things, the saints extend all their bodily senses in service to their Creator, always having their eyes on the Lord, desiring to hear His voice of praise and to narrate His universal wonders, finding His words sweeter to their mouths than honey and the honeycomb.
  
  
    They run in the fragrance of His ointments and, as long as they have breath and the spirit of God in their nostrils, they do not speak wickedness with their lips nor utter foolishness with their tongue, thus walking with the weapons of righteousness on the right and left to receive the heavenly reward promised by the supreme householder to the workers in His vineyard.
  
  
    Because the work was one in the two cherubim, it indicated that the writers of both instruments served God with the same purity of work and devotion of love, proclaiming God with one harmonious voice and faith.
  


    
        The testament of the Lord's incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension, calling of the nations, expulsion of the Jews, and the many tribulations of the church narrates what was foretold by the Old Testament, if understood correctly, as things to come.
    
    
        The advent of the Antichrist, the end of the world, the judgment, and the eternal glory of the good and the punishment of the wicked are truthfully proclaimed by both Testaments. 
    
    
        The inner wings of the cherubim touching over the ark symbolize the agreement of both Testaments in their testimony about the Lord. Likewise, their outer wings touching the walls signify that the Old Testament was written specifically for the ancient people of God, while the New Testament is for us, who have come to faith after the Lord's incarnation. Appropriately, we are compared to the second wall, the northern one, as we have been given the light of truth after the darkness of idolatry.
    
    
        For although the early church flourished mainly from the Jews, and it is believed that all Israel will be saved at the end of the age, many believers of this time are gathered from the nations to receive the sacraments of the gospel. It is also divinely granted to them to clearly understand, with the eyes of their hearts opened, that the letter of the Old Testament is full of the mysteries of evangelical grace.
    
    
        The faces of the cherubim are turned towards the outer house, because we, who still stand outside, are saved not in reality but in hope. The divine books are written because their authors, now reigning with the Lord and praising Him in heaven, are concerned for our salvation and intercede for our errors before His mercy. The cherubim are covered with gold because the authority of the Testaments is confirmed by the excellent works of their authors, and the knowledge of the divine Scriptures is manifested throughout the world, both by the internal glory of the heavenly hosts. 
    
    
        As we said, each cherub represents both angels and the Testaments.
    



Chapter 21:About how the Presbyter John also felt, and confirmed the adoration of images, saying: "And Jesus laid down the twelve stones in His memory."




  
    
      In the same synod, which was held for the adoration of images, and whose errors we have briefly discussed, no testimony from the divine scriptures was brought forth to support this matter.
    
    
      Nor does it pertain to this matter, what John the Presbyter and legate of the Easterners said: "Joshua set up twelve stones in memory of God."
    
  
  
    
      If we inquire historically why these stones were taken from the riverbed and placed in Gilgal, Joshua himself explains.
    
    
      He did not teach the Israelites to establish these stones for the adoration of images, but reminded them to remember the miraculous drying of the river.
    
    
      This silent message would be proclaimed to future generations: "We, whom you see, once inhabited the liquid element, but now we are exiles on dry land.
    
    
      We, who for so many ages were native to the Jordan, have now been brought up from its depths and become strangers on this land.
    
    
      When the ark of the Lord, or rather the face of the God of Jacob, approached with the priests' processions and the people marveling with great joy, the river parted in a new way.
    
    
      The lower part fled, submerging itself in the sea, and the upper part rose into the air, lifting the waters to the high mountains.
    
    
      The Israelites crossed on dry ground, and we were taken from our ancient seats and brought here on the Israelites' shoulders, where we will remain for a long time."
    
  
  
    
      If we inquire typologically what these stones prefigured, it is revealed by the new Joshua, namely our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who grants us the eternal homeland.
    
    
      To establish the sacrament of baptism, through which we reach the eternal homeland, He chose twelve apostles and said to them: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"  (Matthew 28:19).
    
    
      These apostles bear testimony to the holy church's posterity forever, calling it to the heavenly kingdom through the most sacred sacrament of baptism.
    
  
  
    
      Therefore, through the other twelve stones, which were placed in the riverbed of the Jordan, the figure of the holy patriarchs and prophets is indeed represented.
    
    
      Although they did not openly preach the sacrament of baptism, but hinted at it through mystical and obscure figures, they are as if submerged in the river's waves.
    
    
      For, although they did not openly institute baptism, they are believed not to have lacked its mystery.
    
    
      From these fathers, the sons of the holy church were born, that is, the apostles, whom He appointed as princes over all the earth  (Psalm 45:16), who remember the name of the Lord in every generation.
    
    
      Thus, through them and also through the patriarchs, the church, filled with the most sacred gifts and instructed by doctrines, does not cease to seek the Lord, not through images or any superstitious things, but through faith and works.
    
  



Chapter 22:About how not without equal adoration, they say, which is written: "And Nathan the prophet anointed David king before the image."




    It is not necessary to prove with many documents that the worship which the prophet Nathan showed to King David, the most holy prophet and king, is not equal to the worship that some show to images. This is proven by the most evident signs and does not need our disputation, as it is so clear and evident by reason. But lest we seem to have passed over this in silence, it is proper to briefly and concisely explain some points.
    The prophet Nathan, I say, worshipped King David not as an image made of colors, but as the power elevated by God to the throne of the kingdom. For he was filled with the same heavenly gift, by which he was to be filled, who was to say:
    "Let everyone be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore, whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore, you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake. For because of this, you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. Owe no one anything except to love one another."
    Concerning this matter, the chosen vessel instructs his disciple Titus through the Holy Spirit:
    "Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men."
    Thus, the prophet worshipped the king, filled with the Holy Spirit, relying on the gift of prophecy, shining with the insignia of merit. He did not worship some senseless thing with the superstitious cult of vanity, but a man found according to the heart of the Lord, a man anointed with the sacred oil, a man exercised above all others in the praises of God, a man who prophesied most excellently about the incarnation, passion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven of Christ. A man who not only prophesied the coming of the Son of God but also prefigured him. A man who not only prefigured him but also served according to the form of a servant's lineage, honored with the affection of love, the obedience of humility, the duty of praise, and reverent worship. If he did not honor him by subjecting himself and obeying his commands, he would seem to oppose the Spirit, who was to say through the pastor of the church:
    "Be subject to every human ordinance for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."
    Therefore, since kings are to be honored with so many signs and so many apostolic predictions, it is most absurd to want to compare the worship given to images to the worship shown to the most holy king by the prophet. The prophet worshipped him as a servant of God, and, so to speak, as the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and minister of the divine incarnation, while those who worship images worship nothing but the same materials of which they are made. For if the worship shown to David by the prophet is equal to the worship given to images, then David himself would be equal to images; and if he is equal to images, not only so many merits...


  
    
      He is not only believed to have lacked the marks of merit but also human reason itself.
    
    
    
      However, he is not believed to have lacked so many marks of merit and human reason itself.
    
    
    
      Therefore, the worship given to him by the prophet is not equal to the worship given to images.
    
  




Chapter 23:About what is written: "Let the light of Your countenance shine upon us, O Lord," and "Your face, O Lord, I will seek," and how images are made according to understanding.




    
        What the psalmist says, "The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us," and "I will seek your face, O Lord," has nothing to do with the faces of man-made images, as is falsely claimed in the reading of that most vain synod, which was made for the worship of images, whose text is nothing but a substance where foolishness has shown its magnitude.
    
    
        For if this face, whose light is signed upon us as the prophet sings, and which he declares he will seek, is to be understood in the faces of man-made images, it must be greatly questioned what sort of light they have, or how that light is signed upon us, or where the same prophet sought such a face.
        For this holy man sought God in his heart, not in man-made faces, when he said: "With my whole heart I have sought you, God, do not let me stray from your commandments."
    
    
        Therefore, the face of God is the knowledge of God, that is, the Son, through whom we come to the knowledge of divinity.
        He is also the image of God, as the Apostle says: "He is the image of the invisible God," that is, the image, because He is from Him.
        As the Apostle also states, "He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His being," that is, the radiance because, while the Father is light, so the Son proceeds inseparably from Him, like radiance from light; that is, the exact representation, because by taking the form of a servant, He designated in Himself the image and likeness of the Father's works and virtues.
        He is also the face of God because through Him the Father has manifested Himself to humans, as the same Lord Jesus Christ says: "He who sees me sees the Father."
    
    
        Therefore, David promised to seek this face, not man-made images, when he said: "I will seek your face, O Lord."
        He prayed for this divine clarity of knowledge when he said: "Shine your face upon your servant and teach me your statutes."
        He longed to reach this knowledge through the law, not through images, when he said: "Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of your law."
        He encouraged seeking this manifestation of divine majesty, not any assembly of paintings, when he said: "Seek the Lord and be strengthened, seek His face always."
        What benefit those who seek the Lord will obtain, he clearly shows in another psalm when he says: "Those who seek the Lord shall lack no good thing."
        As if we were to ask him how we should seek the Lord, he adds: "Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord."
        He taught to seek Him through the fear of the Lord, not through the worship of images; and he who desires life and wants to see good days, should not worship images, but restrain his lips from deceit and his tongue from evil.
        He taught not to worship pictures but to turn away from evil and do good, to seek peace and pursue it everywhere.
    
    
        Therefore, the light of the face of the Lord, which is signed upon us, is not to be understood in material images, which, like other dignities, lack light, but in the banner of the cross, which, when we receive the sacrament of baptism, is imprinted on our foreheads with the holy anointing oil, and through it, the Holy Spirit, who is the inexpressible light, who also appeared to the disciples in the form of fire, opens the way to come to us.
        For in the impression of the cross is the light of the face of God, that is, the Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, because He is always known to radiate in them, who do not allow their innocence or holiness to be violated by wicked deeds.
        Therefore, so that we do not violate His dwelling in us, the Apostle admonishes us, saying: "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
    
    
        Since they say "The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us" refers to an imaginary face, let them explain how it pertains to what is written in the same passage: "Many say, 'Who will show us any good?'" for these two phrases are so closely connected in meaning and words that one can hardly be understood without the other.
        It is a figure of speech, which...
    


  
    And by rhetoricians, it is called interrogation, that is, questioning, to which an immediate answer is given without the introduction of characters. It is also called by some soliloquy, when one answers questions posed by oneself. As if asking: 
    Who will show us good things?
    They answer themselves: 
    The light of Your face, O Lord, is set upon us.
    Meaning: Many still thinking carnally say, which not even a few should have said, 
    'Who will show us good things?' namely, those which the church always proclaims: that the resurrection is to come, in which the righteous will obtain eternal rewards.
  
  
    For what is promised to us is something we do not see at all; we desire what we cannot achieve here. To which, in response, a benefit is indicated, which is also possessed in the present age: 
    'The light of Your face, O Lord, is set upon us,'
    because we are fortified by the sign of the cross and the light of the Holy Spirit, so that the deceptive machinations and monstrous cunning of the ancient enemy cannot overcome those tempted, whom he had captured through the persuasion of the first man.
  



Chapter 24:About how no one ever made a picture to be adored, which is written: "And they adored the golden calf which the people had made."




  
    But neither is it to be understood that the phrase "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor" refers to any man-made face, especially since man-made faces should not be sought for favor because they cannot hear.
    Everything that seeks favor does so to be heard: and everything that hears must not be irrational.
    Therefore, everything that seeks favor must not be irrational.
    If it should not seek favor, much less should it be worshiped, since worship is greater than seeking favor.
    For if man-made faces are to be sought for favor and worshiped, as they chatter, it is necessary to believe that they can hear those who seek favor and favor those who worship.
    And if it is believed that they can hear those who seek favor and favor those who worship, it is necessary to believe that they possess the capacity for life and sense.
    However, they do not possess the capacity for life and sense.
    Therefore, as they chatter, they should not be worshiped or sought for favor.
  
  
    For this sentence of two parts, which they call clauses, that is: "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor,” is not said by the prophet about God, whose image and face is the Son, but about the Church, which is the body of Christ.
    He had previously said through energy: "Listen, daughter, and see and incline your ear and forget your people and your father's house, for the king desires your beauty; since he is your Lord, and the daughters of Tyre will worship him with gifts.”
    And continuing in the same energy, he added to the one whose beauty the king desired, saying: "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor.”
  
  
    Therefore, the face of the Church is the education of spiritual doctrine.
    It is said to be sought for favor by the wealthy because many have renounced all the pomp and riches of the world for it, to reach it and through it, to fly to the eternal homeland.
    These are the daughters of Tyre worshiping with gifts, these are the wealthy of the people who seek its face.
    There is one Church, whose face is sought and by whom it is sought, namely the mother with her children, one bride, one queen.
    All belonging to one Christ, who is the eternal and immortal bridegroom.
    The friend of whom was the one who addressed the same wealthy of the people as follows: "Command those who are rich in this world not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.”
    These are always exhorted by holy preachings to lay up for themselves a good foundation for the future, to take hold of the true life by worshiping with gifts.
    Therefore, the wealthy of the people seek the favor of this queen when they come to her and make alms in her bosom, lest they be found outside her fellowship.
  
  
    Thus, the face of this queen is not sought by those who come to her with gifts, laying what they brought at the apostles' feet.
    They burned with desire for the face of this queen, not for any picture, and in their gifts, they did not seek any senseless image.
    Of them, it is written: "The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.”
    The bridegroom did not wish to decorate the face of this queen with the colors of any painting by the wealth of the rich, but said: "Sell what you possess, and give alms.
    Make yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
    For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
    Or when he said: "But give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you.”
  
  
    Therefore, since the wealthy should not come to this queen in hypocrisy with false gifts as if to seek her favor, the Truth itself prohibits it, saying: "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them.”
    But because it is pleasing for her face to always become clearer and more splendid in public, it is clearly shown when it says: "Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”
  


  
    In all these things, neither the adoration of images, nor their intercession, nor their glory is shown. 
    But either the bridegroom, who is the head, or the bride, who is the body, is undoubtedly revealed.
  
  
    From these senses and from the insignia of their decorations, how devoid are those who will implore your worship, 
    transferring all the riches of the people to the faces of manufactured images.
  
  
    It is not for us to judge, but it is left to the reader's discretion.
  



Chapter 25:About the extreme folly of those who say they are converted by the image and the Psalm which says: "And they turned their backs to me and not their faces."




  
    The inappropriate and nonsensical statement of Bishop Leo of Foca, who, having turned to the adoration of images, applies to himself a verse from the Psalmist saying: 
    
      "You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness."
    
  
  
    Since almost no divine testimony was appropriately placed in the frequently mentioned synod, it is also evident that this was not appropriately presented by Bishop Leo of Foca. If he had indeed offered something seasoned with wisdom or relevant to the matter, it would have appeared to others as dissimilar, and he would have stood out against the opinions of all. But while he confessed that he had wept in vain and rejoiced that he had turned to the adoration of images in vain, it is evident how deluded he was and how he was detached from the company of the others. As he himself said, he had grief without harm, joy without profit, tears without loss, laughter without gain, anger without accusations, and reconciliations without honors.
  
  
    Like a child eager to play certain games, if restrained by the nurse, he wails with words interrupted by sobs; but if granted the freedom by the nurse to perform those actions, he exults with half-spoken words. Thus, whether restrained or permitted, he has vain tears and equally vain laughter, since neither prohibition provided a cause for weeping nor permission a cause for laughing.
  
  
    The verse he applied to himself in this part in vain is: 
    
      "You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness."
    
    This was said by the prophet in the person of the whole church through a rhetorical device, indicating that while it dwells in the mortality and miseries of this world, it is said to weep; but when it reaches eternal reward, it will be clothed with gladness.
  
  
    Hence, the same most holy prophet said a little earlier in the same Psalm: 
    
      "Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning."
    
    'Night' signifies this age of ours, in which the ends of the ages have come, or the day of final judgment, while 'morning' means the time of resurrection and the rewards of the saints. This is also promised to the saints through the prophet Isaiah:
    
      "In their land, they will possess a double portion," meaning that after the resurrection, they will enjoy the happiness of both soul and body in the eternal homeland.
    
    And it is added:
    
      "Everlasting joy will be theirs," when I give "the work of their hands in truth."
    
  
  
    Thus, our sackcloth will be torn, and we will be clothed with gladness when, as the Apostle says, this perishable body has been clothed with imperishability and this mortal body with immortality, and the saying that is written will come true:
    
      "Death has been swallowed up in victory,"
    
    or when in these members, which we now mortify on earth, we too will appear with Christ in glory when he appears, our life.
  



Chapter 26:About how it does not pertain to the adoration of images, which is contemptuous, as the Psalmist sang: "They speak vanity everyone with his neighbor, with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak."



    
    Everything that is without benefit is useless; and everything that is useless is vain. Therefore, everything that is without benefit is vain. And everything that is unhelpful lacks benefit; and everything that lacks benefit is not without vanity. Therefore, everything that is unhelpful is not without vanity. Where there is no usefulness, there is no profit; where there is no profit, there is utmost vanity. Where, therefore, there is no usefulness, there is utmost vanity. In the worship of images, where there is no benefit, no profit, no usefulness, there is utmost vanity to be believed.
    
    For establishing and defending this, whoever makes assemblies and gathers councils and establishes the worship of them without doubt "speaks lies each one to his neighbor"; for neither are they separated from vanity in that they try to violently twist the testimonies of divine scriptures to their own senses, just as they do with this verse of the psalm, which the psalmist, inspired by the divine Spirit, sang with one meaning, but they, inflated with the pride of vanity, understand with another.
    
    If, therefore, we seek whom the prophet spoke about: "They speak lies each one to his neighbor, with deceitful lips," speaking evil in heart and from the heart, let us read the text of the holy gospels, and we will find that the Pharisees and Sadducees, or other groups of Jews, always tempted the Lord and entered into vain plots against him. While they stubbornly refused to believe in Christ, they did not cease to "speak lies." About whom it is also read in another psalm: "For they have sharpened their tongues like a sword, they have bent their bow to shoot in secret at the blameless: suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear" (Psalms 64:3-4).
    
    For "sharpening their tongues" and "having deceitful lips" is one and the same, because it is said in one style of speech, where either by that which contains, that which is contained, or by that which is contained, that which contains, is demonstrated. Likewise, in another psalm, it is written about them: "Their throat is an open sepulcher, they deal deceitfully with their tongues, the venom of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness" (Psalms 5:9). Therefore, "an open sepulcher" said their lying mouths, who, speaking deadly evil against the Lord, wished to inflict death upon him, which is why it is called "open" due to their obvious wickedness, which rather increased stench than odor. For it is a comparison made of dissimilar things by a trope, which is called a parable by grammarians.
    
    "They speak lies each one to his neighbor." This is therefore vanity surpassing all vanities, this is deceit stronger than all deceits, when the Redeemer of the world is not believed in, and by the same wicked men, although for the salvation of others, yet to their own damnation, he is crucified.
    
    This verse can also be understood about heretics or schismatics, who, while being imbued with worldly cunning and more inclined to vain investigations and superfluous contentions than to believing, "speak lies each one to his neighbor," because, while they think ill of Christ or the church, they do not cease to invite their neighbors, that is, other heretics, to the same error, so that they might demolish the church, which is the vineyard of Christ, with greater attack. About whom it is said in the Song of Songs: "Catch for us the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, for our vineyards are in bloom" (Song of Solomon 2:15), because, evidently, while heresies or their followers, disciples of heresies or heretics, are caught in their errors by holy and catholic men, the vineyard of the Lord, that is, the church, always thrives more and more with sacred gifts, so that it may forever offer cups of nectarous fragrance to its farmer, who shed his blood for it.



Chapter 27:About how it does not pertain to their ancestors, as they say: "May the Lord destroy all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks proud things."




  The verse that the psalmist spoke about the deceitful lips and boastful tongues of the treacherous Jews, who plotted to capture and kill the Savior of the world with deceit, they attribute to their own parents in their synod. Although they may have been somewhat reckless in removing images from the church decorations, they were far greater and incomparably more, I won't say reckless, but cruel in crucifying the Lord.

  These people had zeal for God but according to knowledge, as they completely rejected images; those, pretending to have zeal for the law, had zeal for malice and the most treacherous wickedness, as they nailed the Lord to the cross. These people indiscriminately destroyed the decorations of churches; those maliciously broke themselves against the Lord, despising Him.

  Therefore, the treacherous cohort of Jews had "deceitful lips and boastful tongues" when they said: "We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from." Didn't they have boastful and, so to speak, malicious tongues when they said: "We have a law, and according to the law, he must die because he made himself the Son of God"? Didn't they have boastful tongues when they said: "We know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from"? Didn't they have boastful tongues when they said: "Do not write 'King'; we have no king but Caesar"?

  Therefore, it is clear that they are driven by a disgraceful love of images, who, because of their abolition, do not blush to attach to their parents the things that were spoken by the prophet about the treacherous Jews, and to pierce their fellow citizens with the same weapons with which the prophet is known to have pierced the enemies of the church, indeed of Christ.



Chapter 28:About how it is not fulfilled in their ancestors, as they say, which is written: "The enemies have failed in their sword forever and the cities you have destroyed."




    
        But neither was the prophecy of this verse, as they say, fulfilled in their ancestors or parents because they renounced idols.
        Even if they stripped the ornaments from places dedicated to divine worship, they were still far removed from the malice of the ancient enemy, about whom this prophecy is.
        For the malice that happens to the human race through his persuasion is less than the malice of the one who is both the author of his own and human wickedness and a deceitful craftsman.
        Being subtler by nature, he is also more cunning and not burdened by the frailty of the body, sharpening the perversity of his wickedness.
    

    
        Therefore, 'the enemies' sword has perished,' because the most wicked temptations, as soon as they are brought to Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, who is the end without end, to whom when we come, we have nothing further to seek, they completely perish.
        And so the prophet rightly says, who strikes irrational thoughts, which he calls parents, against the stone, namely, against Christ, who is the cornerstone.
        Or, as some wish, 'the enemies have perished with the sword,' when the sword with which the ancient enemy rages will be destroyed at the end of the world by the sword of the almighty God, about which it is said in another psalm: Unless you turn back, he will sharpen his sword, and about which it is said through the prophet Ezekiel: I live, says the Lord, I will sharpen my sword like lightning and bring vengeance on my enemies.
        'Sword' is indeed a Hebrew term, by which in this place the sword of the ancient enemy is implied.
    

    
        'Enemies' therefore in this place is not a nominative plural, as many think, but a genitive singular, that is: 'the sword of the enemy [devil] has perished,' and it is a figure of speech called prolepsis, that is, anticipation or presumption, by which things that ought to follow are placed before.
        This is also found at the beginning of the prophet Ezekiel, when he says: And it happened in the thirtieth year, and it is found in the psalm, when it says: His foundation is in the holy mountains.
    

    
        Therefore, the psalmist does not sing about the cities destroyed in this place, as they think, that their ancestors or parents were overthrown for the abolition of images, but about the unbelieving peoples or the followers of evil deeds, whom the devil inhabits like the walls of a city, he says were destroyed by the manifestation of Christ.
        Therefore, the vain and empty love of images has invaded their hearts, who, to establish their worship, think that what was prophesied about the ancient enemy or the unbelieving Jews was spoken about their parents or ancestors.
    



Chapter 29:About how it should be understood, which is written: "Lord, I have loved the habitation of Your house," which beauty they understand as images.




  
    The house of God, according to allegory, is the church, or according to anagogy, the heavenly homeland, or according to tropology, the soul of a person.
    Therefore, in many places of the Holy Scriptures, when the house of God is read, it is not walls or some material construction that should be understood, but the spiritual and incomprehensible dwelling of God.
    The minds of those who do not consider the virtues of the church but material images to be the 'beauty of the house' of the Lord truly lack insight into these senses.
  
  
    Did the same distinguished prophet see certain images or indeed the beauty of walls or the most precious furnishings of ministries when he said: 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the place where your glory dwells'?
    Is the place of the Lord's glory believed to be in any man-made things?
  
  
    Therefore, the holy church has beauty, which the prophet loved, that is, spiritual virtues.
    It has 'gold', which is faith or inner understanding.
    It has 'silver', which is confession or the beauty of speech.
    It has 'silver-plated columns', which are holy men adorned with reasonable patience and the beauty of speech.
    These columns have 'silver bases' when they are placed upon the stability of God's word, which is handed down to us through the prophets and apostles.
    They also have 'golden heads', because the golden head is the faith of Christ, as the Apostle attests, saying: For the head of every man is Christ.
  
  
    It also has 'incorruptible wood', which is knowledge that comes through the wood, or the incorruptibility of chastity, which knows no old age.
    It has 'fine linen' for virginity, 'scarlet' for the glory of confession, 'purple' for the splendor of love, 'hyacinth' for the hope of the kingdom of heaven.
    In these materials, its priests are clothed according to the voice of David, who said: Your priests shall be clothed with righteousness.
    And Paul exhorts them in these words, saying: Put on compassion.
    The priests also have other more noble garments, which the same chosen vessel indicates when he says: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the flesh in its lusts.
  
  
    It has a 'library', that is, holy men educated in the documents of divine law, of whom the prophet says: Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord.
    Blessed are those who seek his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart.
    And again he calls them blessed, who keep his commandments in memory, to do them.
  
  
    It has 'ten extended courts', not limited to one word of the law or two or three, but expanded in the whole Decalogue of the spiritual law's understanding, or with the fruits of the spirit, that is, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control, and added, which is the greatest of all, love.
  
  
    It also has an 'altar', that is, the firmness of faith, on which it offers the sacrifices of prayers and the victims of mercy to God, on which it immolates pride as if it were a bull with the knife of chastity, slaughters anger as if it were a ram, and sacrifices every luxury and lust as if they were goats and kids.
    From these, it separates the right arm, the breast, and the jaws for the priests, that is, good works, right works, in which nothing sinister is found.
  
  
    It also has a 'lampstand of light', either because the Lord is its light or because the holy men, whose lamps are burning and their loins girded, who wait for their Lord when he returns from the wedding, pour forth the light-giving teachings of their preaching.
    This lampstand of lamps is placed in the south to face the north, that is, so that holy men may always vigilantly and carefully watch the cunning of the devil and observe with a fearful mind where the temptation will come from.
    For the prophet also said he saw a boiling pot facing from the north.
    And in another place, he says: For out of the north, evil will break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
    And the Apostle Peter says: Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
  
  
    It also has the 'table of the showbread'.
  


  
      
        Having twelve loaves, placed on the northern side, which looks towards the south, that is, the twelve apostles, who are commanded to be placed daily without ceasing: which looks towards the south, because they daily await the coming of the Lord. For the prophet says, "The Lord shall come from the south."
      
      
        It has "the altar of incense," because the smoke of the holy prayers always ascends before the Lord from the firmness of its faith, and daily it cries out with David: "Let my prayer be directed as incense before You." Or because, according to the Apostle, Christ is a sweet fragrance before God.
      
      
        It has "the mercy seat" and "the ark" and "the two cherubim," which were discussed in detail in a previous chapter.
      
    
    
      
        It also has "the high priest," of whom the Apostle Paul says: "But Christ, who came as the high priest of the good things to come through a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption." Or as it is said through the psalmist: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek, who is clothed in a linen robe. With His saints, who surely adhere to Him, they are clothed with the lamp of chastity."
      
      
        It also has "a jeweled shoulder piece," because His chosen ones shine with the brilliance of their works, whose works make men glorify their Father who is in heaven. He has on His breast the "rationale," which is called the "breastplate of judgment," distinguished by a fourfold order of stones, in which the evangelical word is signified, which in its fourfold order explains to us the truth of faith and the manifestation of the Trinity.
      
      
        It also has "a gold plate on the forehead," called the "petalon," that is, divinity, because He is of the same substance with the Father. Just as nothing in metals can be compared to gold, so nothing in creation can be compared to the Creator.
      
      
        This high priest also has his inner garments, because the mystery of His incarnation is difficult to investigate, as John attests, who says: "I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal."
      
      
        It also has "bells around the hem of the garment," which are placed at the edge of the robe to always make a sound; because holy preachers, who are indeed His garment, do not cease to speak of the end times and the end of the world, but always warn us of the future, remembering what a certain wise man said: "In all your works, remember your last end, and you will never sin."
      
    
    
      
        This house of God, that is, the church, whose beauty we briefly enumerated, also has the "Holy of Holies," because in the present age it has a holy way of life for "the holy ones," for "the holy ones" true "Holy of Holies," into which one enters only once, the passage to heaven, when, despising the visible, it passes to the invisible. Of these, the Apostle says: "Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
      
      
        Therefore, this most excellent man loved the beauty of the heavenly homeland, not the false colors of images, not the likenesses of material paintings. For this beauty, not for material figures, he was dissolved in an almost intolerable desire, when he said: "I remembered these things and poured out my soul within me, for I used to go with the multitude, leading them to the house of God." Of this house, not of these visible walls, the Apostle said: "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
      
      
        This beauty Isaiah considered, not the works of painters, when he said: "Look upon Zion, the city of our feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful habitation, a tent that will not be moved." Of this house, David says: "Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still be praising You forever and ever."
      
      
        Did not the holy fathers, to name a few, Paul, Antony, Hilarion, or the whole company of anchorites and hermits, who did not consider the beauty of basilicas or painted images...
      
    
  
    They lived in small huts, but they dedicated their souls to God. Therefore, are they not saints? And did they not love the beauty of the Lord's house or desire to contemplate the place of God's glory with a burning heart because they neither had nor worshipped images?
  
  
    For within them, like other holy souls, they had the temple of God and the place of His glory, as the chosen vessel says:  "For the temple of God is holy, which you are."
  
  
    Furthermore, from the golden meadows of the Holy Scriptures, many ambrosial flowers could be gathered, which would show the beauty of the holy church both according to tropology, allegory, and anagogy.
  
  
    If we were not constrained by brevity, we could explore more. Therefore, these few examples suffice for the many, and the diligent reader will seek out the rest, which are not presented here, and will see that the beauty of the house of God shines not in material images but in spiritual virtues.
  



Chapter 30:About how it is not for the manifestation of images by the Psalmist, as they say, it is written: "As we have heard, so we have seen."




  
    
      Since they have congratulated themselves on seeing man-made images, they have appropriated the verse from the psalmist, saying: "As we have heard, so we have seen."
    
    
      I ask them to say where they heard before what they now see in images.
    
    
      Let them say which of the patriarchs, prophets, or apostles brought this to their hearing, which is now evident to their sight.
    
    
      Let them say who predicted this privilege for them, that they would not only see images but also worship them, and thus, by merit, become recipients of this promise: "As we have heard, so we have seen."
    
  
  
    
      However, we, who understand the prophecy of the psalms spiritually with the help of God, believe that this phrase was not said about man-made images but prophesied about more significant and eminent mysteries.
    
    
      Just as we heard in the law about Christ's coming, we see in the gospel;
    
    
      just as we learned from the prophets about His incarnation, we now see in the sequence of the New Testament;
    
    
      just as we saw it prefigured in the sacred writings and all holy literature concerning His birth, passion, resurrection, and ascension to heaven through symbolic mysteries, we now see all these things accomplished in the holy gospels.
    
  
  
    
      We also believe that, with God's approval, we will come to the eternal homeland and see there what we heard in the struggles of this mortal life about His happiness.
    
    
      We will say: "As we have heard, so we have seen," meaning: as we heard as mortals, we now see as immortals; as we heard as corruptible beings, we now see as incorruptible; as we heard in a sorrowful pilgrimage, we now see in the most blissful region of the living.
    
    
      What we heard while enduring the most stormy tempests of the world, we now see, for we enjoy the sweetest security of paradise.
    
    
      What we heard while fearing the most dangerous shipwreck, we now see, for we have arrived at the safest and most long-desired harbor.
    
  
  
    
      In this context, we thought it appropriate to conclude this first book here, since we have mentioned the harbor, to also bring this book to a harbor, so that, having been fatigued by the previous navigation, we can rest and regain our strength in the harbor, and with the Lord's help, set sail for the navigation of the second book.
