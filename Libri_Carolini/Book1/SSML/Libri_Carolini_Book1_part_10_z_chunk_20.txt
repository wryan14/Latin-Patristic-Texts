      It's not a minor foolishness to use this example to support the veneration of images, as John the Presbyter and ambassador of the Easterners mentioned in the same synod, which was convened for the purpose of venerating images, because that stone is not believed to be the image or likeness of any past thing.

      If it had been set up by the holy patriarch to be worshipped and was an image representing a past event, it might perhaps give some support to those who did not fear to face the danger of such a great error.

      But while one thing is to be made by the patriarch as a foreshadowing of future things, another thing is to be painted by an artist to remember past deeds.

    <s>
      One thing is to be filled with the Holy Spirit, another to be imbued with artistic skill.

      One thing is to be endowed with heavenly grace, another to be created through the skill of workmanship.

      One thing is Jacob setting up a stone as a pillar, another is an artist placing an image on a wall.

    <s>
      One thing is to pour oil over it according to a symbolic figure, another is to command worship according to a vain assertion.

      It is useless and more than useless to propose this as an example to support anything, as it seems to differ in every way from that matter.

      Did Jacob set up that stone to be worshipped or did he paint an image of anything on it?

      For while images have almost no other purpose than to bring memory to minds through their sight, the stone set up by the patriarch is believed to have had three significant and highly honorable functions.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      First, it supported the head of Israel and acted as a pillow for the patriarch who lacked one, and it was burdened by his head, who not only saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven and angels ascending and descending on it, but also the Lord himself promising good things to him.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Second, it was set up as a sign and a marker so that the holy patriarch could remember that holy place, and upon returning, gladdened by the affection of his offspring and wives and enriched with great wealth, he could fulfill his vows to the Lord who had granted him all these things.

      Third, it bore the figure of our Mediator, who became the cornerstone and is marvelous in our eyes.

      He was anointed by the Father with the oil of gladness above his companions.

      Daniel also calls him the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, born from the virgin's womb without human intercourse and seed.

      David also calls him the rock, saying: The Lord is my rock and my strength and my savior.

      About whom it is also written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.

    <s>
      Hence he is called the cornerstone, as he joins two walls coming from opposite directions, namely circumcision and uncircumcision, or even the two Testaments, in himself, the chief, chosen, precious stone, and unites them in one assembly of the holy church, of which he is the head.
    </s>
    <s>
      About whom it is also said by the prophet Zechariah with the paternal voice: Behold, I will bring my servant, the Branch, because the stone I have set before Joshua has seven eyes.
    </s>
    <s>
      In these seven eyes, the sevenfold grace of the Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is clearly shown and is called by the prophet Isaiah the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of the Lord.

    <s>
      About this cornerstone, the rock of the church says: Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good, to whom you come, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious.
    </s>
    <s>
      And shortly after: To you who believe, this stone is precious, but to those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

    He is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to those who stumble because of the word and do not believe, as they were destined to. This document shows that He is both an honor of strength to believers and a stumbling block of hardness to unbelievers.

  <s>
    This was also foretold by the just Simeon in this sense. For he said: This one is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, for the fall of unbelievers and the rise of believers.
  </s>
  <s>
    He is also called fire, either because He illuminates believers with the eternal light or because He will burn unbelievers with the eternal fire.

  <s>
    Concerning the anointing of this stone, it was mentioned a little earlier in the oracles of David, and now it must be brought forth by the testimony of the aforementioned shepherd of the church, who says: Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and power.

  <s>
    Since the Holy Spirit is often signified by the name of oil in the divine Scriptures, the apostle John is a witness who says: As His anointing teaches us about all things.

    Those who are anointed with the inexpressible nectar should not agitate synods or misuse the holy Scriptures to support the worship of images.
