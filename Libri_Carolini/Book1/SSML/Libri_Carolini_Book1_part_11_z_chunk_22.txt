      But even that statement by the same John, presbyter and envoy of the Easterners, is not free from criticism.

      Among other ramblings, he is said to have declared about Jacob: "He wrestled with him in the form of a man and called him Israel, which means 'the mind seeing God.'"

    <s>
      This statement is far from the intended meaning and omits a more common interpretation of the name.

    <s>
      While some interpret the name as "Man seeing God," others as "Strong with God," and yet others more accurately as "Prince with God," it is uncertain if any of those accepted in the canon ever interpreted it as "the mind seeing God."

    <s>
      Therefore, not only should he be criticized for presenting an almost unheard-of interpretation while disregarding more common ones, but also the entire synod that supported his delusions should be criticized.
    </s>
    <s>
      This synod not only did not resist his claim but even recorded it in a volume.

      Thus, since the holy church, according to the teachings of the holy fathers, accepts everything that is irreproachable and rejects everything that is reprehensible, it must also reject this synod, which is undoubtedly reprehensible.
    </s>
    <s>
      If it does not reject this reprehensible synod, it neither accepts those that are irreproachable.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, it should utterly reject this one, as it is open to criticism.
    </s>
    <s>
      The holy and universal church accepts those synods that, for various reasons of faith or religion, were celebrated by learned and Catholic men at different places and times and do not deviate in any way from sound and sober doctrine.

      Moreover, the wrestling of such a great patriarch with an angel is said to prefigure not some veneration of images but the Lord's passion among the same people.

      This people prevailed against Him by wrestling because they crucified Him, and they received a blessing from Him in those who believed in Him, but they remained lame in those who despised belief in Him.

    <s>
      As the blessed Augustine says: "Jacob desired to be blessed by that angel, whom he prevailed against by wrestling; this is a great prophecy about Christ."

    <s>
      For he indicates something mystical, since every man wants to be blessed by a greater one.

    <s>
      How then did he want to be blessed by the one he prevailed against by wrestling? Jacob prevailed over Christ, or rather seemed to prevail through those Israelites by whom Christ was crucified, and yet He blesses them in those Israelites who believed in Christ, of whom it was said: 'For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.'"

      Thus, Jacob is both lame and blessed.
    </s>
    <s>
      Lame in the breadth of his thigh, as in the multitude of his descendants, about whom it was said: "And they limped out of their paths," but blessed in those about whom it was said: "The remnant chosen by grace will be saved."
