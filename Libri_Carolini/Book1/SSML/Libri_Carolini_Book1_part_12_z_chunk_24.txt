    <s>It is not surprising if Jacob is accused by them of kissing Joseph's tunic and placing it on his eyes, just as they accuse Pharaoh of worshipping.</s>
    <s>It often happens that someone who begins to be deceived once is frequently deceived, and someone who once strays from the path and neglects to follow the guide of his journey is carried away by error through rough and pathless places.</s>

    <s>For Joseph's tunic is not said to have been kissed or placed on the eyes by his father in either the Hebrew or Latin books translated from Hebrew truth.</s>
    <s>Even if it were said to have happened, in no way would the worship of images be even slightly implied in this act, since it is one thing to worship and another to kiss—something they mistakenly think is the same—and another to worship a painted image, and another to place the robe of a son, believed to be dead, on the eyes out of fatherly affection and compelled by grief, with eyes wet with tears.</s>
    <s>It is one thing to bow to a certain likeness, and another to give a kiss of internal devotion to the robe of a beloved son.</s>

    <s>Thus, the holy patriarch was so troubled by the storm of his disturbed mind that not only did he kiss the robe of his son, whom he believed to have been taken by the cruelty of death, or place it on his eyes, but he also, disregarding consolation, exaggerated his misfortunes with funereal words, declaring that he would descend to hell after him.</s>
    <s>How then can it be believed that blessed Jacob did not kiss or place on his eyes the tunic of his son, but only saw and recognized it?</s>
    <s>This order is commemorated by the holy Scripture.</s>
    <s>It says:</s>
    <s>"They took his robe, and dipping it in the blood of a goat they had killed, sent it to their father and said: 'We found this, see whether it is your son's robe or not.'</s>
    <s>When the father recognized it, he said: 'It is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him, Joseph has been torn to pieces.'"</s>

    <s>Finally, let us briefly explain what this robe of that holy man prefigured in typical sacraments and implied in silent mysteries, so that their vain assertion is refuted and the reader's mind is soothed.</s>
    <s>For Joseph, whose name means "increase" and who was called "Savior of the world" by the Egyptians, typified him who saved the human race by his death, nourished the world with spiritual food, and made the seed of his faith grow so much that it filled the whole world and connected earthly things with heavenly ones through the same faith.</s>
    <s>His robe was dipped in the blood of a goat, because he appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh according to the Apostle and condemned sin in the flesh, or also, having become a sacrifice for sins, bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that being freed from evil, we might live with righteousness.</s>
    <s>By whose wound we are healed, who, like sheep, had gone astray.</s>

    <s>His robe is also the holy church, which is the body of Christ, as Paul testifies, who says:</s>
    <s>"I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of his body, which is the church."</s>
    <s>This robe is described as multicolored or varied, because the holy church is gathered from the variety of different nations or languages, as the psalmist teaches, who says:</s>
    <s>"The queen stood at your right hand in gold of Ophir, surrounded by variety."</s>
    <s>The same robe, described as reaching to the ankles, often signifies the perfection of holy men, who, being members of Christ, carry out the garment of good works to the end, that is, to the ankles.</s>
