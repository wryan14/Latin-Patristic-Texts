        <s>Indeed, the claim that Jacob worshipped the top of Joseph's staff should not be omitted, because they boast of having a great example for worshiping images in this matter. Although in Latin texts it does not read: "He worshipped the top of Joseph's staff," but in some: "He worshipped over the head of his staff," and in the Hebrew truth, which must be given the most credence, it makes no mention of a staff at all but simply states: Israel worshipped God, turning toward the head of the bed.</s>
        <s>In this, as Blessed Augustine says, the old man lay and was positioned in such a way that he could pray without effort whenever he wanted.</s>
        <s>Since, as we mentioned earlier, some Latin texts have: "He worshipped over the top of the staff," we need to explain how this should be understood according to the teachings of the aforementioned doctor. He says: What the Latin texts have: "And he worshipped over the head of his staff," some correcting it have: "He worshipped over the head of his staff," or: "on the head of his staff," or "on the top" or "over the top."</s>
        <s>For they are mistaken by a Greek word, which is written with the same letters, either "his" or "his own," but the accents are different and were not observed in the manuscripts by those who moved these things.</s>
        <s>For they are capable of a great distinction, although it could have one more letter if it were "his own," so it would not be "autu," but "eautu."</s>
        <s>Thus, it is rightly questioned what was said. For it would be easily understood that the old man, who carried a staff in the manner that age usually does, when he bowed to worship God, did so over the top of his own staff, which he carried in such a way that he bowed his head over it to worship God.</s>
        <s>What, then, does it mean: "He worshipped over the top of his staff," that is, his son Joseph's? Perhaps he had taken the staff from him when his son swore to him, and while holding it after the words of the oath were spoken, he immediately worshipped God? For he was not ashamed to carry for a while the insignia of his son's authority, where signs of a great future event were prefigured.</s>
        <s>So, let them say, let them say what they will against these things, who do not fear to accuse the patriarch for worshiping images and seek to change the Holy Scriptures with a mad mind. Behold, the Hebrew truth proclaims that the same patriarch worshipped God at the head of the bed. Behold, the library of the Latins declares that he worshipped either over the head of the staff or on the head or on the top or over the top. Behold, the very learned man Augustine, inspired by the divine gift, declares with diligent investigation that he worshipped God at the top of his own or his son's staff, not the staff itself nor the son himself.</s>
        <s>Let them say who the translator of the holy law is that translated it as worshipping the top of the son's staff and worshipping the son in the same staff, who the most diligent investigator of the holy law is that treated it as worshipping the son's staff or the son rather than God?</s>
        <s>And when they cannot find this, they should realize that their understanding of the divine Scriptures is more corrupting or opposing than investigating.</s>
        <s>Since almost the entire series of divine law is either mutilated or changed by them for the worship of images, it is necessary that a new writing of the law be given after Moses, a new restoration of the law be found after Ezra, a new translation of the law be sought after the seventy interpreters, Theodotion, and Symmachus and Aquila or even Blessed Jerome, a new examination be conducted after the apostles and apostolic men filled with the Holy Spirit, which could so oppose the divine Scriptures that it binds all who disdain the worship of images with the chain of anathema.</s>
        <s>Moreover, what is the difference between the cross of Christ and images painted by the art of painters, or by what great mystery the cross surpasses images, or how the human race is redeemed not by images but by the cross of Christ - which they think of as either equal or equal in themselves -</s>
