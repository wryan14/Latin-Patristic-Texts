        <s>It has already been said above that the often-remembered patriarch Jacob did not worship Pharaoh but blessed him.</s>
        <s>Now, because in another passage of the same very vain synod, "blessing" is somehow put in place of "worship," it must be briefly explained.</s>
        <s>For indeed, the writing of that vanity is so overrun with the darkness of ignorance that neither the following seems to agree with the preceding, nor the preceding with the following.</s>
        <s>As vanity holds lies, always fleeting, always falling, and always slipping away, as Solomon says: "He who relies on lies feeds on the winds, and he himself follows flying birds."</s>
        <s>Therefore, to establish the worship of images, in the love of which their mind hangs, and it is the purpose of all holiness, they strive to change many words or meanings, which pertain to something else, into "worship."</s>

        <s>For they do not think that the blessing of the same holy man to Pharaoh pertains to the same kind of blessing that exiles often give to citizens, subordinates to superiors, the poorer to the richer, and especially the old, who bestow certain benefits on them, but to some kind of painting of worshipped images, which is indeed useless, as it can in no way declare its effectiveness by speaking.</s>
        <s>For they say: "Jacob blessed Pharaoh, but he did not bless him as God; we worship the image, but we do not worship it as God."</s>
        <s>Oh, what an inappropriate comparison! Oh, what a dull guess! Oh, what a most foolish statement!</s>
        <s>You call it a similar blessing, which the holy patriarch gave to the king, who bestowed a mark of power on his most beloved son above others, who granted him and his entire offspring a fertile land to inhabit, who did not give him a portion of any province but the option of the entire land of his empire, to the worship you give to images, which can offer nothing to the worshippers except the memory of what they are!</s>
        <s>So Jacob blessed Pharaoh, not as God, whom every creature blesses and praises, nor as a painting, which the hand of an artist fits together, but as a man, to whom honor is due because of the power granted by God.</s>
        <s>He blessed him, I say, not as an insensate image, but as a rational man; not as something put together by the skill of a painter, but as someone created in the image and likeness of God; not as standing immobile on walls, but as someone who provides prosperity to himself or his offspring; and, so to speak, Israel blessed the king, who was imbued with the nectar of the same spirit, who later through the Apostle would say: "Bless and do not curse," who should pray not only for the one who enriched him and his offspring with the wealth of things but also for those who slandered and persecuted him.</s>
        <s>Therefore, this kind of blessing, which indeed was celebrated for the sake of good recompense, does not fit the worship of images; which can neither bring any recompense to those who worship them nor to those who disdain to worship them.</s>
