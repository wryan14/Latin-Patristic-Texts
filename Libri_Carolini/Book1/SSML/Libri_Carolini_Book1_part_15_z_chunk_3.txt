    Some people absurdly use examples from divine law to justify images, saying that Moses made the mercy seat, two golden cherubim, and the Ark of the Covenant by God's command.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moses indeed made the mercy seat, the Ark of the Covenant, and the two golden cherubim by God's command, and he also carved the stone tablets.
    But he did not command anyone to worship them.
    He is believed to have made these things not to remember past events but to prefigure sacred future mysteries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given this, how absurd and insane are those who try to equate these sacred and highly revered objects commanded by God to images and attempt to establish their worship using these examples?
    Neither an iron voice nor our understanding can fully explain or comprehend this, especially since these sacred objects are filled with profound meanings and mysteries, while images have little use beyond reminding us of their subject.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the Ark of the Covenant was made of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and contained the tablets of the covenant, manna, and Aaron's rod by God's order through the legislator, and since the mercy seat was to be made of gold in the same length and width as the Ark so that it could cover the Ark, and two golden cherubim were to be placed on the mercy seat facing each other with their wings overshadowing it, and from there God would speak to Moses from between the cherubim—who could be so dull and insane as to use the comparison of these significant and terrifying mysteries to justify not only having images but also worshiping them?
  </p>
  <p>
    These examples sometimes merely indicate the order of past events, sometimes even lie about events that never occurred, while the sacred objects always shine with holy and excellent mysteries and sacraments.

    The Ark of the Covenant, according to some, represents our Lord and Savior, in whom alone we have the covenant of peace with the Father.
    After His resurrection, He ascended to heaven and placed the flesh He took from the Virgin at the Father's right hand.
    This Ark contains the two tablets of the law, representing the two Testaments.
    It also contains Aaron's rod that budded, signifying that He is both King and Priest—King, as it is written: The Lord will send the rod of your strength out of Zion; rule in the midst of your enemies, and Priest, as it is written: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
    The Ark also contains manna, the heavenly food, of which David the great prophet says: He gave them bread from heaven, and Man ate the bread of angels, and of which Jesus Himself says in the Gospel: I am the living bread that came down from heaven.

  <p>
    The mercy seat is placed above it because the mercy of the Mediator surpasses the legal or evangelical commandments founded on it.
    We are saved not by the works of the law that we did, nor by our willing or running, but by His mercy, as the Father says: My truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name his horn shall be exalted.
    And through the prophet, He says: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and through the psalmist: Your mercy is great, O Lord, and according to the apostle, He is the propitiation for our sins.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two cherubim represent the fullness of knowledge revealed in the two Testaments.
    They face each other because the law and the gospel are in great harmony, as the Lord says: I did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it.
    The cherubim face the mercy seat because the two Testaments always commend placing hope in God's mercy.
    From above the mercy seat, that is, from between the cherubim, God speaks because the Son is the Word of the Father through whom all things were made.
  </p>


    <p>
        Right with the Father in substance, as he himself says in the gospel: "I and the Father are one," or as he said to Philip: "He who sees me, sees the Father." The voice of God the Father is always heard in him between the two Testaments.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to many teachers of divine law, who treat these things morally, gold signifies wisdom, and the ark signifies the secret of God. In the ark, the law and manna and the rod of Aaron were commanded to be placed. The rod signifies power, the manna signifies grace, because without grace, there is no power to carry out commandments. However, because the law is not fully completed by anyone progressing, the mercy seat is above it; for this reason, it is needed for God to be merciful; and therefore it is placed above because mercy triumphs over judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two cherubim overshadow the mercy seat with their wings, that is, they honor it by covering it, because these are mysteries, and they look at each other because they are in agreement—indeed, the two Testaments are represented there—and their faces are towards the mercy seat because they greatly commend the mercy of God, in which our only hope lies. Finally, God promised to speak to Moses from above the mercy seat between the cherubim.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, if rational creatures in the multitude of knowledge—because this is the interpretation of cherubim—are signified by those two animals, there are two of them to commend the fellowship of charity, and they overshadow the mercy seat with their wings because they attribute their wings to God, not to themselves, that is, they honor God with the virtues they excel in. And their faces are only towards the mercy seat because there is no hope for anyone's progress in a multitude of knowledge except in God's mercy.
    </p>

        Therefore, the tablets, which signify the two Testaments as we said above, are given without any terror, without the noise of fires, without the shaking of clouds, without the sound of trumpets, unlike those which were given by the Lord and broken by Moses, when the people said to Moses: "Speak to us yourself, and let not God speak to us, lest we die." This clearly indicates that the former ones signified the Old Testament, in which there was terror, while the latter ones signify the New Testament, in which there is love. The former ones were the work of God, the latter the work of man, and the former were inscribed by the finger of God, the latter are said to be written by man.
    </p>
    <p>
        This clearly shows that in the former, as we said before, the Old Testament was signified, because God commanded there, but man did not do it. The law was given in the Old Testament to convict transgressors. Hence, the illustrious preacher says: "The law came in to increase the trespass." For it was not fulfilled out of fear but only out of love. Therefore, it is called the work of God because God established the law and inscribed it; it is not the work of man because man did not obey God, and the law rather made him guilty. However, in the second tablets, man makes and writes the tablets with the help of God because the love of the New Testament fulfills the law. Hence, the Mediator of God and men came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. The same illustrious preacher also says: "Love is the fulfillment of the law," and "faith working through love."
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, it became easy for man in the New Testament what was difficult in the Old, having faith that works through love and with the finger of God, that is, the Spirit of God, writing it in the heart, not on stone. Hence, the Apostle says: "Not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts," because the love of God, through which the commandment is truly fulfilled, is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the law was first given, signifying the Old Testament, which is the work of God alone and the inscription of the finger of God, as the Apostle says: "The law indeed is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good." The law, therefore, is holy and good, the work of God, where man does nothing because he does not obey but is rather oppressed by the threatening and condemning law. "For sin," he says, "to appear as sin, worked death in me through what is good." Blessed indeed is the man who fulfills this holy, just, and good commandment. It is also his work, but through the grace of God. This is the sense fitted...

  <p>
    In the old translation, it is mentioned that the second tablets were written by the lawgiver. However, in the Hebrew truth, both the first and the second were written by God. This signifies that both the Old and New Testaments were written by the grace of the Holy Spirit, who is called the finger of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the former, the spirit of servitude in fear is received because God imposes the yoke of the law on man, which man cannot bear. In the latter, where the tablets are made by man but written by God, man receives the spirit of adoption by obeying.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, these symbols, namely the Ark and what is in it, the mercy seat or cherubim, should always be observed by us with spiritual insight and sought with the full intention of the mind. Let us not seek them in painted tablets or walls, but let us view them in the innermost parts of our hearts with the eye of the mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    And as the Apostle says, with unveiled face beholding the glory of God, we are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Lord, who is the Spirit. We do not walk in craftiness or adulterate the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth, we no longer seek truth through images and pictures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through hope, faith, and love, we reach the same truth, which is Christ, with His help.
