        The legal horse that once belonged to Bezalel? "I saw," I said, "in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne, a scroll written on the inside and outside, sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice: 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?' And no one in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look at it. And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look at it. Then one of the elders said to me: 'Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the scroll and its seven seals.'

        For while this Bezalel, whom we said foreshadowed Christ, is adorned with such prerogatives of virtues that he is chosen by God, called by name, filled with the Holy Spirit, and whose lineage is described, he is in vain taken as an example to confirm the adoration of images, as he is believed to have been superior to all painters and all artisans forming images. If the pictures or works of any craftsman are to be likened to his works, then those painters or any other craftsmen forming images are also to be likened. And if those painters or craftsmen forming images are to be likened, their works indeed bear notable prefiguration of the future. However, neither painters nor craftsmen nor their works bear any prefiguration of the future. Therefore, the pictures or works of any craftsman are not to be likened to his works.

        But since this new Bezalel, the Redeemer of the human race, possesses the spirit of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, who is indeed of one substance with the Father and the Son and proceeds from the Father and the Son, the prophet Isaiah is a witness. For he says: <break time="500ms"/> 'A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him—the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord—and he will delight in the fear of the Lord.' <break time="500ms"/> And the same Lord says through the same prophet: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me.'

        Therefore, what he makes from gold and silver, he makes in the ornaments of the tabernacle, namely, holy men shining with gold, that is, with interior understanding, and gleaming with silver, that is, adorned with divine words, and, so to speak, having gold in their hearts according to 'For with the heart one believes unto righteousness,' and silver in the confession of the mouth according to 'With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation,' he establishes them in the tabernacle of God, that is, the holy church, to pass into the eternal homeland. These two, gold and silver, that is, faith and confession, the Apostle sought when he said: 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, because if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved.' These also Moses sought to adorn the tabernacle when he said: 'Take from among you an offering for the Lord. Whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it as an offering to the Lord: gold, silver, and bronze.' He who is the wisdom of God the Father is known to dwell in holy men abounding in spiritual sense, as Scripture says: 'The wisdom of God is above precious stones, and its habitation is in golden vessels.' Of this wisdom, it is also said through Solomon: 'Blessed is the man who finds wisdom and gains understanding, for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her gain better than fine gold; she is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.'
