      This entire chapter must be carefully examined piece by piece and each part individually addressed.
    </s>
    <s>
      Although it aims at a single error, it is composed of many errors pieced together.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      First, it must be discussed why they mention blue purple in the same chapter, when clearly one color is purple and another is blue.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as it cannot be correctly said that red is white or white is red, as if one were to say silver gold or golden silver, so too it cannot be correctly said blue purple, nor can it be said purple blue in reverse, because such a derivation reciprocally will not remain with any sense of strength unshaken.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      As we have previously stated, one color is blue and another is purple, and the law given by the Lord through Moses, which specifically designates these four - blue, purple, scarlet, and linen - to make the priest's garments or other offerings for the sanctuary, bears witness to this.
    </s>
    <s>
      Our elders said that these four materials signify the four elements from which the world and the human body are made, and they taught that each one represents a specific virtue allegorically.
    </s>
    <s>
      They refer blue to the air, which the color itself indicates, scarlet to fire, purple to water because it takes its dye from water, and linen to earth because it grows from the ground.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Secondly, it must be discussed that they try to support the use of images by the example of blue fringes, especially since the old law commands these fringes to be placed at the ends of garments as a mystery, but does not command images to be placed in sanctuaries to be worshiped, either in the Old or New Testament.
    </s>
    <s>
      For such madness cannot be supported by this example, since what was instituted by the lawgiver was to indicate certain signs of hidden meanings, and no well-commanded and well-done thing can be compared to such madness.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, among the commands of the law given through Moses, the Lord added: "Tie them on your hand, and they shall be immovable before your eyes."
    </s>
    <s>
      Spiritually, we hold them immovable in our hands when we fulfill them in action, and we carry them before our eyes when we meditate on them day and night.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      He also commanded blue fringes to be made on the four corners of garments, either to distinguish the people of Israel or as a sign on the garment, like circumcision as a sign on the body, or so that we, who are the spiritual Israel, may have righteousness and holy conduct as our garment, with the ends of this garment adorned with blue fringes, so that our life may be instructed by the testimonies of the holy Scriptures.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      This is the good use of fringes well granted by the lawgiver to both carnal Israel and us, the spiritual Israel, but it was rather abused than held by them.
    </s>
    <s>
      About them, the Truth says in the Gospel: "They broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes."
    </s>
    <s>
      Whose example, I ask, do these people follow, except that of the Pharisees, who, while wanting to be called Rabbi by men and seeking the first greetings in the marketplace, the first seats in the synagogues, and longing to pass on their words or deeds to posterity out of vain glory, images that were well placed by some in the decoration of basilicas, compel others to worship them through foolish and useless councils?
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      They magnify the fringes for vain glory, and similarly, these people worship images out of vanity.
    </s>
    <s>
      They broaden well-instituted fringes for vain glory, and these people exalt well-made images by worshiping them wrongly.
    </s>
    <s>
      They think they are obeying Moses' commandments by magnifying the fringes, and these people think they are pleasing all the saints by worshiping images.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
They are known to be heading towards a madness destined for a single error, and not without reason, since the causes or effects of these actions are nothing but the glory of vain praise or arrogance.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, to more clearly discuss the error of this most vain chapter, which we have proposed to examine in detail, it is necessary to repeat the text in order:
</p>

<p>
‘For they babble: If, according to the lawful tradition of Moses, the people are commanded to place purple and blue in the fringes on the edges of their garments as a reminder and keeping of the commandments, how much more for us is it to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting.’
</p>

<p>
This phrase, ‘how much more' - which pertains to ‘it is commanded,’ should be understood as: ‘if it is commanded to the people, how much more to us’ - can have no sense at all, since it is not only not commanded much more, but not even equally or less, nor does this error seem to be commanded anywhere here.
</p>

<p>
What they say: ‘to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting,’ is almost infinitely absurd and insane, since in images the virtue of holy conversation cannot be seen, but only the material from which the images themselves are made. Can the virtues and insignia of merits, which were indeed in the subject, that is, in the mind, be seen in these as in some subject, when in these there is no soul which can be subject to virtues? But in these materials, that is, in the bodies, there are simply colors, and virtues cannot be in these as a subject or from a subject. Can we therefore discern the wisdom and eloquence in these, which many of them had?
</p>

<p>
Can we see the prudence in these, through which the recognition of true faith and the knowledge of divine things flourished in them, through which the threefold type of understanding is understood by the prudent in divine books?
</p>

<p>
The first is that by which certain things are accepted historically, setting aside enigmatic or allegorical figures, such as the Decalogue of the law.
</p>

<p>
The second, by which certain things in the Scriptures are mystically accepted both according to the faith of the deeds done and also according to the figure of allegorical senses, like the rock from which the lawgiver drew streams, which was historically a rock and produced water and allegorically bore the figure of Christ, who, as a rock founded on the foundation of Zion, satisfies the minds of believers with the honeyed cup of spiritual life.
</p>

<p>
The third type is that which is only spiritually accepted, such as in the Song of Songs, in which nothing is to be accepted historically but only spiritually.
</p>

<p>
Can justice be seen in these, through which the saints feared God, revered religion, took care to benefit all, harm none, embrace the bonds of brotherly love, either take on others' dangers or even help the wretched, and also repay the favor of received good or maintain fairness in judgments?
</p>

<p>
Can we perceive their fortitude in the colors of paintings, through which they patiently endured adversities with equanimity, bravely resisted temptations, fled from biting greed and glory, and wore the armor of which, being strong for labors, they prepared their minds against the wicked, yielding to no troubles? Can their temperance be seen in these images, through which they moderated the desire of the flesh? Since therefore none of these things which we have mentioned can be seen in these, it is great rashness to say: ‘to see the outcome of the conversation of holy men through a similar painting.’
</p>

<p>
The same vain chapter continues: ‘and to imitate their faith according to apostolic tradition.’ Can their faith, which according to the Apostle works through love, be imitated in images? Just as therefore the ‘outcome of the conversation of holy men’ cannot be seen in these, nor can faith be imitated, since those things which they lack cannot be seen in these nor imitated through these. Everything that lacks life lacks itself.
</p>


    Everything that lacks sense lacks faith. <break time="500ms"/> Therefore, everything that lacks life lacks faith. Since hope, faith, and charity are invisible and incorporeal qualities according to their own substance, they cannot be seen in a true person who possesses them unless, perhaps, they are demonstrated in works. <break time="500ms"/> For their seat, like that of other virtues, is in the soul, which is known to be invisible. And if they cannot be seen in a true person who undoubtedly has them, much less can they be seen in a painted one, who not only lacks these, as we have said before, but also lacks life. <break time="500ms"/> And if they cannot be seen in these, much less can they be imitated in paintings. <break time="500ms"/> From this, it is understood that the faith of those who claim they will imitate faith through images of saints is in vain.

<p>Now, because they say 'according to apostolic tradition,' let them say where it was handed down by the apostles, either by example or by words, that through images we should see the outcome of the saints' conduct and imitate their faith. <break time="500ms"/> The Apostle demonstrates the outcome of the saints' conduct in this way when he says: <break time="500ms"/> "All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɪˈbɹuːz">Hebrews</phoneme> 11:13, or when he says: <break time="500ms"/> "By faith these people conquered kingdoms, administered justice, gained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɪˈbɹuːz">Hebrews</phoneme> 11:33-34, and other things that follow.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Apostle very clearly shows what we ought to imitate when he says: "Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="iˈfiːʒənz">Ephesians</phoneme> 5:1; and in another place he says: <break time="500ms"/> "Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɜrst kəˈɹɪnθiənz">First Corinthians</phoneme> 11:1.</p>

<p>From this, it is clearly evident that this is the apostolic tradition: that the outcome of the saints' conduct and their faith to be imitated can be seen not in paintings, but in virtues, not in images, but in good works.</p>
