            The hope of those who place their salvation in images is rejected by the Apostle, who argued that hope should not be in things that are seen but in things that are not seen.

            When the bronze serpent was made by Moses at the Lord's command and lifted up, it was not placed there to be worshipped but to temporarily counteract the venomous bites of fiery serpents.

            Those who believe they can be healed by looking at man-made images are deceived by false hope, just as the Israelites were healed by looking at the bronze serpent from deadly snake bites, especially since the Lord commanded Moses to make it, but no Scripture commands these images to be made.

            Moreover, just as the words of divine law spoken by the Holy Spirit through the law, the prophets, the gospel, or the apostles are often misinterpreted by schismatics with perverse intentions, so too many things instituted or done by the fathers for our benefit are believed to have been misunderstood and perverted by later generations, such as phylacteries and fringes, as we have previously mentioned, or even the bronze serpent, which we now discuss.

            The praise of this same Hezekiah, the holy king, for removing vain superstitions and breaking the serpent, is recorded in divine scripture:
            <break time="500ms"/>
            "Hezekiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done. He removed the high places, broke the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it and called it Nehushtan. He trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him. He held fast to the Lord and did not depart from following Him; he kept the commandments that the Lord had given Moses. And the Lord was with him; wherever he went out, he prospered."

            Now, those who believe they can be saved by looking at images, just as the Israelites were healed by looking at the serpent, if they suffer some bodily affliction, they should turn to the images and look at them.

            If they are not healed by looking at them, they should turn back to the Lord and believe they will receive healing from Him through the intercessions of the saints.
