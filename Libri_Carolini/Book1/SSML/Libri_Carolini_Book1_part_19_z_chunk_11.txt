    For we, who do not follow the letter that kills but the spirit that gives life, who are not the carnal but the spiritual Israel, who, spurning visible things, contemplate the invisible, rejoice that we have received from the Lord symbols greater and more eminent than the tablets or two cherubim, which lack any mystery. The tablets and two cherubim were exemplars of future things, and while the Jews had these things carnally, which were covered in typical figures as prefigurations of future things, we have them spiritually in truth, which were prefigured by those carnal exemplars and prefigurations.

    As much as a body surpasses a shadow, truth surpasses an image, a deed surpasses a figure, so much does the New Testament surpass the Old; for the Old was dedicated by Moses when he had read all the commandments of the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves and goats "with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled the book itself and all the people, saying: </p>
  <p>
    In the Old, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on the unclean sanctified them to the purification of the flesh. In the New, the blood of Christ, who through the Holy Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanses our consciences from dead works to serve the living and true God.

    In the Old, a land flowing with milk and honey was promised. In the New, a heavenly homeland is promised, where it is given, what </p>

    In the Old, the beginnings of new moons were celebrated. In the New, a new creation in Christ is accepted, as attested by Paul, the chosen vessel, who says: </p>


  <p>And rest was celebrated. In this rest of the Sabbath, rest in Christ is found, who said:</p>
  <s>"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you, and you will find rest for your souls."</s>
  
  <p>In the past, the sacrifice of animals involved the offering of flesh and blood. Now, the sacrifice of the flesh and blood of Christ is offered, which was symbolized by those animals.</p>
  
  <p>In the past, the heavy yoke of the law was placed upon the necks of the people, making them slaves. Now, the light yoke of Christ and the easy burden through the spirit of adoption makes them sons.</p>
  
  <p>Given these circumstances, it is perverse and extremely perverse that, by reversing the order, the superior is given to the inferior and the inferior to the superior, and the use of images is so magnified that it somewhat diminishes the affairs of Christians.</p>
