      Therefore, since our being is so different from God's being and our living from His living and our reigning from His reigning, the madness of those who, among other things they indiscriminately usurp for themselves, even say that God reigns with them is more to be mourned than admired.

      Hence it is written in the prophets: "I live, says the Lord," and some of the saints dared to say: "The Lord lives," that is: He lives in that life which neither began nor is moved by change nor is interrupted by an end.

      Our living, however, suffers birth, decline, and change; although the soul is immortal, it is still known to be "changeable," which changeability is often ascribed to it as death.

      Hence it was said to the first man: "On the day you eat from it, you will surely die," not that he was immediately punished with the death of the flesh as soon as he transgressed the command of the Lord, but because he distanced himself far from that holiness in which he stood close to God through the changeability of his soul.

      Given these facts, it is a great presumption for anyone to say that God reigns with them, something even David did not dare to say, of whom the Lord said: "I have found a man after my own heart," and "I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him."

      Meanwhile, the syllable 'con' in composing words, according to those who are not ignorant of the skill of literary discipline, signifies almost nothing else than 'together,' as in: "Let all the congregation of Israel gather together"; and: "Let them come together for the festival day," that is: let them gather together in a flock, let them come together.

      And the Apostle: "If indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together," that is: be glorified together; and: "Both sat down beside the edge of the fountain," that is: they sat together; and 'consessor' is said to be 'sitting together.'

      'Together' is said in three ways by those who most keenly investigate the secrets of logic: in time, nature, and kind.
    </s>
    <s>
      In time, as Saint Augustine says, when things exist or appear together at the same time, so that neither of the two is before or follows the other, but both seem to have a common origin.

  <p>
      In the same way, we can't rule together with Him. He is eternal, without beginning, while we have a beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      By nature, some things exist together without one ruling over the other. For example, a simple number and a double number exist together naturally. But a double number doesn't cause a simple number to exist, nor does a simple number cause a double number to exist. In the same way, we can't rule together with Him, because His nature is so different from ours and He is the Creator, while we are the created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever things of the same kind seem to exist together by nature, but are distinguished by species, like animals on land and in water, neither is prior to the other. All of them come from the same kind, which is the animal. This third way also shows that we can't rule together with Him, because our nature is entirely different from His nature. Even though He exists everywhere through His divine power, He can't rightly be said to rule together with anyone. Being everywhere is one thing, but being with someone is another; ruling ineffably is one thing, but ruling together with someone is another.
    </p>
    <p>
      If 'ruling together' and 'sitting together' are used absolutely, it means two or more rule or sit together. If someone is said to rule or sit together with someone else, it means one precedes the other, and the other becomes a participant with the one who rules and sits. As the chosen vessel Paul says: "You were buried with Christ;" and again: "If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above." This shows that the one who is buried and rises precedes, while those who are buried and rise with Him become participants with Him. If the Redeemer of humanity had not been buried and risen for us, we couldn't be buried and rise with Him. This shows that God, who is the author of all, precedes everyone in existence, living, and ruling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone argues that the words about the only Son of God in the form of a servant mean He rules with us because we suffer, are buried, are made alive, and rise with Him, and because we are co-heirs, co-body members, and co-participants in the same Jesus Christ through the gospel, in which God raised us up and made us sit in the heavenly places, and because the evangelist says: "While eating with them, He was lifted up," and again: "They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them," let them understand that this is not from His divinity, but from our humanity, in which we suffer, are buried, and are made alive with Him. Just as suffering, being buried, and eating, in which we suffer and are buried with Him, and He is said to eat with us, are properly human, so ruling is properly divine, as the psalmist attests: "His name alone is exalted;" and again: "The Lord reigns and He will rule the nations;" and the same: "Your kingdom, Lord, is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      We are said to rule, but in a borrowed sense, not in a proper sense. Ruling, being immortal, and being true are natural to Him; for others who achieve these things, it is attributed by His generosity, who truly rules, is the only immortal, and is true, as the teacher of the nations preaches, who says: "God is true, and every human is a liar;" and again: "He alone has immortality." Not that, as Saint Jerome says, angels and other rational creatures don't have immortality and love truth, but He alone is naturally immortal and true, while others achieve immortality and truth from His generosity. Having something by oneself is different from having it by the power of the one who gives it.
    </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, we can rightly say that we die with and suffer with God, who is immortal and impassible. Likewise, it can be rightly said that God reigns with us. If the former is denied by clear reason, the latter is also rejected by prudent investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we suffer with Christ when, in His love, who endured the suffering of the cross for us, we crucify our flesh—that is, the world—with its vices and desires. We die to the world and die with Christ, thus crucifying the flesh, that is, the body, so that we trample its desires.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we are buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the power of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life. Thus, we are baptized and buried with Him, so that we may follow this life in which Christ was raised. Baptism is the pledge and image of the resurrection, so that by remaining in the commandments of Christ, we do not turn back to past things.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are made alive and rise with Him if we are united with the likeness of His death—that is, if in baptism, laying aside all vices, we are transferred into a new life and no longer sin. "For the likeness of death has provided a similar resurrection." We are co-heirs and co-participants with Him, not because some possession is divided among us, but because He Himself is our Lord, inheritance, and possession.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord indeed says, "The Lord is your inheritance"; and elsewhere, "The Lord is my portion and my inheritance." We are one body with Him, for although those who believe in Christ have different graces, they are nevertheless united in one body of the church. Therefore, He has made the saints sit together with Christ in heavenly places, not that the saints sit with Him as long as they are in this world and are pilgrims from Him, but according to the opinion of the aforementioned doctor, this is the manner of the Scriptures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes future events are spoken of in the past tense—by a figure of speech called prolepsis—for example, concerning the cross of the Lord: "They pierced my hands and my feet"; and elsewhere concerning His passion: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter." Certainly, according to the spiritual sense, the saints are not in the flesh, although they live in the flesh and have their conversation in heaven. While they walk on the earth, ceasing to be flesh, striving entirely in the spirit, they sit in heavenly places with Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the kingdom of God is within us, and where our treasure is, there will our heart be also. We sit firm and stable with Christ in wisdom, word, justice, and truth. The apostles were preaching with the Lord cooperating, providing them support to perform good works. Therefore, their work had such great power that thousands of people believed at their preaching. With the natural forces broken, the dead received life, the blind received sight, and the deaf received hearing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord cooperates with all the saints according to the Apostle, who says: "I became a minister according to the gift of God's grace given to me by the effect of His power." But for sinners, insofar as they sin, He is neither believed to cooperate nor reign with them in any way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, if what the Apostle says: "If we endure, we will also reign with Him," thinks to provide some support in this part, let him understand that this differs from what he says in three ways: by person, by time, and by merit.
  </p>
  <p>
    By person, because it is not said that He reigns with the saints, but that the saints will reign with Him; by time, because it is not said that He has reigned or is reigning, but that He will reign; by merit, because it is not anyone, but only the saints who will reign with Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    For he says: "If we endure, we will also reign with Him," that is: if we endure in this age, we will reign in the future or certainly after judgment, when we will no longer see Him through a mirror, dimly, but face to face. For if we are still in this world, we are still enduring; if we are still enduring, we are not yet reigning. Therefore, if we are still in this world, we are not yet reigning with Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then if we reign with Him, what is perfect has already come; if what is perfect has already come, what is partial is already done away with. But what is partial is not done away with; therefore, we are not yet reigning with Him.
  </p>


    <p>
        He rules over them less than the one to whom the kingdom and power belong, and whose kingdom will have no end. If he does not rule with the saints, he certainly cannot be said to rule with sinners. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We learn from the Apostle John when the saints will rule with him; he says: <break time="500ms"/> "Beloved, it has not yet been revealed what we shall be; but we know that when he is revealed, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." <break time="500ms"/> This means that when he appears, we will be immortal and glorious, in which we will be "like him." He said "like," not equal. Like, evidently not in bodily similarity, but in the inner person, as Blessed Augustine says in his letter to the virgin Italica: "Who would be so insane as to say that we are or will be like God in body?" <break time="500ms"/> Therefore, this likeness is in the inner person. <break time="500ms"/> "We shall see him as he is," when, according to his promise, he reveals himself to those who love him, eternally, in which we will see God, infinitely celebrating the perpetual Sabbath feast. As the Lord tells us: "Be still, and know that I am God." 
    </p>
    <p>
        All these things will not be completed in the saints until, according to the Apostle, this mortal body puts on immortality and this corruptible body puts on incorruption. <break time="500ms"/> For if we rule with him, it has already appeared what we shall be; if it has already appeared what we shall be, we are already like him; if we are already like him, we already see him as he is. <break time="500ms"/> But we do not yet see him as he is, so we do not yet rule with him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, he rules in us, but does not "co-rule" with us. He rules, according to the opinion of Blessed Augustine, in believers because he was weakened until the cross and death. <break time="500ms"/> In this way, the Son properly rules in the faith of believers; for the Father cannot be said or believed to have been incarnate, judged, or crucified. <break time="500ms"/> But in the form in which he is equal to the Father, he rules in those who contemplate the truth, not co-ruling with us because he does not share with us in the kingdom. <break time="500ms"/> It is his own kingdom, as we discussed earlier. <break time="500ms"/> We do not yet co-rule with him as long as we are clothed with this mortal body. <break time="500ms"/> We hope, through his mercy, that we will do so when, according to the contemplation of the supreme truth, to obtain blessedness, no movement of the mind, no part of the body resists, and no one loves their own power. Then God will be all in all.
