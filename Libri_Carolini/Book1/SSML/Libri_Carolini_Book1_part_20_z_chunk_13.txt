<s>It is not inconsistent that Tarasius, who, as it is said, was extraordinarily promoted from a common life to the priestly summit, from military attire to religious garb, from the circus to the altar, from the chaos of the forum to preaching, from the clamor of arms to performing holy mysteries, compels the minds of his subordinates to revert from spiritual to carnal, from invisible to visible, from truth to image, from body to shadow, from life-giving spirit to the deadening letter, from the spirit of adoption to the spirit of fear.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Since he, having scorned the things that perhaps were not forbidden to him in his secular life, has flown to the degree of priestly summit, it follows that his subordinates, through his preaching, might fly from lawful spiritual observances to unlawful physical observances.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Therefore, since he encourages the use of worse things over better things, and because the ancients had cherubim made through Moses, from which God spoke overshadowing the mercy seat, he therefore urges the faithful to have images made by any craftsmen overshadowing the altar.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Let him make an ark, not from acacia wood, but from willow, not covered with gold, but with lead, which does not have golden rings, but bronze ones, in which there are no poles of acacia wood, but of beech; in which there are not the tablets with the Ten Commandments, but eleven, signifying the transgression of the law; in which there is not Aaron's rod, but any staff of his predecessors who were either anathematized by him or by whom he was anathematized; in which there is an urn, not with manna, but any grain seeds.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Let him also make a candlestick of pure lead and a table of the showbread, which is not called holy.</s>
<s>Let him write a book of the law, which commands anyone to quickly impose hands on it and to promote novices to bishoprics, which also teaches the making, worship, and adoration of images of things in heaven and on earth.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Having briefly gone over these things, why Tarasius did not preach correctly, because he did not ascend to the summit of the priesthood correctly, as it is said, and because he said: "Instead of cherubim, let us have images," using the same manner of speech which some call 'astismos,' let us now explain how the mercy seat is overshadowed by two cherubim within the holy church, either according to the tabernacle's design, which was set by Moses in the wilderness, or according to the temple's construction, which was built by Solomon in Jerusalem, comparing spiritual things with spiritual, with the Lord's help, so that we do not seem to derogate from the holy Scriptures in any way since we do not worship images.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>First of all, we must ask why Moses, when he made the tabernacle, made two golden cherubim and placed them on the mercy seat which was on the ark, while Solomon added two much larger ones, which he placed in the temple with the ark in the middle under their wings, so that there were two cherubim in the tabernacle and four in the temple?</s>
<s>Both cases pertain to the same meaning, except that Solomon, who is interpreted as 'peaceful' and carried the figure of Christ, magnified the size of the two cherubim more grandly and broadly.</s>
<s>This act signifies that after the incarnation of the Lord, the church would be exalted more broadly through the gathering of various nations and coupled with heavenly citizens, who thus praise the Creator for the gift of bestowed happiness, rejoicing in our assumption and introduction to the same happiness.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>For cherubim, as the prophet Ezekiel most clearly demonstrates, is the term for an angelic rank, and in singular it is called cherub, in plural cherubim.</s>
<s>Hence it is not inappropriate.</s>

<p>
    In the figures of the cherubim, which were made in the inner sanctuary, the evangelical ministries are understood. They stand before their Creator in heaven and rejoice in their eternal happiness. They stretch their wings over the ark, attributing all the good they received to the praise of the Lord Savior.
  </p>
  <p>
    They extend their other wings to the walls of the sanctuary, rejoicing as they see holy men in their company, touching them with the tips of their wings, celebrating those who were their companions and followers in their purity in this life. They also touch the walls with their wings because they include the faithful of both peoples, Jews and Gentiles, in the heavenly hall. Not that there is a physical separation between the two peoples in that homeland, but because the joy of internal happiness is greater from the companionship of united brotherhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the cherubim extend their wings to both walls of the sanctuary, because in the heavenly homeland, they rejoice in the vision of the just from both peoples and excite praise to the Creator with their own glory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only do the heavenly hosts rejoice in the happiness of the just men they have with them inside, but they also care for us, who still cry out to the Lord from the depths. About these cherubim, it is well written in the book of Chronicles: "They stood with upright feet, and their faces were turned towards the outer house."
  </p>
  <p>
    The cherubim stood with upright feet because they are believed to have never deviated from the path of truth, where they were placed as soon as they were created. Their faces were turned towards the outer house because they desire us, rescued from the trials of this pilgrimage, to reach their company.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, they stood with upright feet, their wings extended to the gold-covered walls of the sanctuary, and their faces turned towards the outer house, because the angels maintain their perpetual innocence and rejoice in the happiness of the holy souls in heaven, while also helping the chosen ones whom they see still wandering on earth, until they too are brought to the heavenly homeland.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we previously discussed in the earlier chapter, the two cherubim can also symbolize the two Testaments. They were made in the sanctuary because in the divine counsel of providence, which is inaccessible and incomprehensible to us, it was preordained before the ages when, how, and by which authors the sacred Scripture would be composed.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were made from olive wood, either because the divine books were written by men enlightened by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, or because they bring the light of knowledge aided by the flame of God's love, which is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are ten cubits tall because they preach that we should serve God through the observance of the Ten Commandments, showing that those who faithfully serve God will be rewarded with the heavenly kingdom. They have twin wings, indicating that the Testaments, through both hardships and prosperity, always reached and aspired to heavenly things with unwavering purpose, demonstrating that their authors should do the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    One wing of a cherub is five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub is five cubits, symbolizing that in all the changes of worldly things, the saints extend all their bodily senses in service to their Creator, always having their eyes on the Lord, desiring to hear His voice of praise and to narrate His universal wonders, finding His words sweeter to their mouths than honey and the honeycomb.
  </p>
  <p>
    They run in the fragrance of His ointments and, as long as they have breath and the spirit of God in their nostrils, they do not speak wickedness with their lips nor utter foolishness with their tongue, thus walking with the weapons of righteousness on the right and left to receive the heavenly reward promised by the supreme householder to the workers in His vineyard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the work was one in the two cherubim, it indicated that the writers of both instruments served God with the same purity of work and devotion of love, proclaiming God with one harmonious voice and faith.
  </p>


    <p>
        The testament of the Lord's incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension, calling of the nations, expulsion of the Jews, and the many tribulations of the church narrates what was foretold by the Old Testament, if understood correctly, as things to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        The advent of the Antichrist, the end of the world, the judgment, and the eternal glory of the good and the punishment of the wicked are truthfully proclaimed by both Testaments. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The inner wings of the cherubim touching over the ark symbolize the agreement of both Testaments in their testimony about the Lord. Likewise, their outer wings touching the walls signify that the Old Testament was written specifically for the ancient people of God, while the New Testament is for us, who have come to faith after the Lord's incarnation. Appropriately, we are compared to the second wall, the northern one, as we have been given the light of truth after the darkness of idolatry.
    </p>
    <p>
        For although the early church flourished mainly from the Jews, and it is believed that all Israel will be saved at the end of the age, many believers of this time are gathered from the nations to receive the sacraments of the gospel. It is also divinely granted to them to clearly understand, with the eyes of their hearts opened, that the letter of the Old Testament is full of the mysteries of evangelical grace.
    </p>
    <p>
        The faces of the cherubim are turned towards the outer house, because we, who still stand outside, are saved not in reality but in hope. The divine books are written because their authors, now reigning with the Lord and praising Him in heaven, are concerned for our salvation and intercede for our errors before His mercy. The cherubim are covered with gold because the authority of the Testaments is confirmed by the excellent works of their authors, and the knowledge of the divine Scriptures is manifested throughout the world, both by the internal glory of the heavenly hosts. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As we said, each cherub represents both angels and the Testaments.
