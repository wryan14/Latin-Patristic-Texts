    <p>It is not necessary to prove with many documents that the worship which the prophet Nathan showed to King David, the most holy prophet and king, is not equal to the worship that some show to images. This is proven by the most evident signs and does not need our disputation, as it is so clear and evident by reason. But lest we seem to have passed over this in silence, it is proper to briefly and concisely explain some points.</p>
    <p>The prophet Nathan, I say, worshipped King David not as an image made of colors, but as the power elevated by God to the throne of the kingdom. For he was filled with the same heavenly gift, by which he was to be filled, who was to say:</p>
    <s>"Let everyone be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore, whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore, you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake. For because of this, you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor. Owe no one anything except to love one another."</s>
    <p>Concerning this matter, the chosen vessel instructs his disciple Titus through the Holy Spirit:</p>
    <s>"Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men."</s>
    <p>Thus, the prophet worshipped the king, filled with the Holy Spirit, relying on the gift of prophecy, shining with the insignia of merit. He did not worship some senseless thing with the superstitious cult of vanity, but a man found according to the heart of the Lord, a man anointed with the sacred oil, a man exercised above all others in the praises of God, a man who prophesied most excellently about the incarnation, passion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven of Christ. A man who not only prophesied the coming of the Son of God but also prefigured him. A man who not only prefigured him but also served according to the form of a servant's lineage, honored with the affection of love, the obedience of humility, the duty of praise, and reverent worship. If he did not honor him by subjecting himself and obeying his commands, he would seem to oppose the Spirit, who was to say through the pastor of the church:</p>
    <s>"Be subject to every human ordinance for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."</s>
    <p>Therefore, since kings are to be honored with so many signs and so many apostolic predictions, it is most absurd to want to compare the worship given to images to the worship shown to the most holy king by the prophet. The prophet worshipped him as a servant of God, and, so to speak, as the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit and minister of the divine incarnation, while those who worship images worship nothing but the same materials of which they are made. For if the worship shown to David by the prophet is equal to the worship given to images, then David himself would be equal to images; and if he is equal to images, not only so many merits...</p>
