        <s>What the psalmist says, "The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us," and "I will seek your face, O Lord," has nothing to do with the faces of man-made images, as is falsely claimed in the reading of that most vain synod, which was made for the worship of images, whose text is nothing but a substance where foolishness has shown its magnitude.</s>

        <s>For if this face, whose light is signed upon us as the prophet sings, and which he declares he will seek, is to be understood in the faces of man-made images, it must be greatly questioned what sort of light they have, or how that light is signed upon us, or where the same prophet sought such a face.</s>
        <s>For this holy man sought God in his heart, not in man-made faces, when he said: "With my whole heart I have sought you, God, do not let me stray from your commandments."</s>

        <s>Therefore, the face of God is the knowledge of God, that is, the Son, through whom we come to the knowledge of divinity.</s>
        <s>He is also the image of God, as the Apostle says: "He is the image of the invisible God," that is, the image, because He is from Him.</s>
        <s>As the Apostle also states, "He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His being," that is, the radiance because, while the Father is light, so the Son proceeds inseparably from Him, like radiance from light; that is, the exact representation, because by taking the form of a servant, He designated in Himself the image and likeness of the Father's works and virtues.</s>
        <s>He is also the face of God because through Him the Father has manifested Himself to humans, as the same Lord Jesus Christ says: "He who sees me sees the Father."</s>

        <s>Therefore, David promised to seek this face, not man-made images, when he said: "I will seek your face, O Lord."</s>
        <s>He prayed for this divine clarity of knowledge when he said: "Shine your face upon your servant and teach me your statutes."</s>
        <s>He longed to reach this knowledge through the law, not through images, when he said: "Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of your law."</s>
        <s>He encouraged seeking this manifestation of divine majesty, not any assembly of paintings, when he said: "Seek the Lord and be strengthened, seek His face always."</s>
        <s>What benefit those who seek the Lord will obtain, he clearly shows in another psalm when he says: "Those who seek the Lord shall lack no good thing."</s>
        <s>As if we were to ask him how we should seek the Lord, he adds: "Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord."</s>
        <s>He taught to seek Him through the fear of the Lord, not through the worship of images; and he who desires life and wants to see good days, should not worship images, but restrain his lips from deceit and his tongue from evil.</s>
        <s>He taught not to worship pictures but to turn away from evil and do good, to seek peace and pursue it everywhere.</s>

        <s>Therefore, the light of the face of the Lord, which is signed upon us, is not to be understood in material images, which, like other dignities, lack light, but in the banner of the cross, which, when we receive the sacrament of baptism, is imprinted on our foreheads with the holy anointing oil, and through it, the Holy Spirit, who is the inexpressible light, who also appeared to the disciples in the form of fire, opens the way to come to us.</s>
        <s>For in the impression of the cross is the light of the face of God, that is, the Spirit, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, because He is always known to radiate in them, who do not allow their innocence or holiness to be violated by wicked deeds.</s>
        <s>Therefore, so that we do not violate His dwelling in us, the Apostle admonishes us, saying: "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."</s>

    <p>
        <s>Since they say "The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us" refers to an imaginary face, let them explain how it pertains to what is written in the same passage: "Many say, 'Who will show us any good?'" for these two phrases are so closely connected in meaning and words that one can hardly be understood without the other.</s>

    And by rhetoricians, it is called <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌɪntəˈrɒɡəˌʃən">interrogation</phoneme>, that is, questioning, to which an immediate answer is given without the introduction of characters. It is also called by some <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="səˈlɪləkwi">soliloquy</phoneme>, when one answers questions posed by oneself. As if asking: 
    <s>Who will show us good things?</s>
    They answer themselves: 
    <s>The light of Your face, O Lord, is set upon us.</s>
    Meaning: Many still thinking carnally say, which not even a few should have said, 
    <s>'Who will show us good things?' namely, those which the church always proclaims: that the resurrection is to come, in which the righteous will obtain eternal rewards.</s>

    For what is promised to us is something we do not see at all; we desire what we cannot achieve here. To which, in response, a benefit is indicated, which is also possessed in the present age: 
    <s>'The light of Your face, O Lord, is set upon us,'</s>
    because we are fortified by the sign of the cross and the light of the Holy Spirit, so that the deceptive machinations and monstrous cunning of the ancient enemy cannot overcome those tempted, whom he had captured through the persuasion of the first man.
