    <s>But neither is it to be understood that the phrase "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor" refers to any man-made face, especially since man-made faces should not be sought for favor because they cannot hear.</s>
    <s>Everything that seeks favor does so to be heard: and everything that hears must not be irrational.</s>
    <s>Therefore, everything that seeks favor must not be irrational.</s>
    <s>If it should not seek favor, much less should it be worshiped, since worship is greater than seeking favor.</s>
    <s>For if man-made faces are to be sought for favor and worshiped, as they chatter, it is necessary to believe that they can hear those who seek favor and favor those who worship.</s>
    <s>And if it is believed that they can hear those who seek favor and favor those who worship, it is necessary to believe that they possess the capacity for life and sense.</s>
    <s>However, they do not possess the capacity for life and sense.</s>
    <s>Therefore, as they chatter, they should not be worshiped or sought for favor.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For this sentence of two parts, which they call clauses, that is: "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor,” is not said by the prophet about God, whose image and face is the Son, but about the Church, which is the body of Christ.</s>
    <s>He had previously said through energy: "Listen, daughter, and see and incline your ear and forget your people and your father's house, for the king desires your beauty; since he is your Lord, and the daughters of Tyre will worship him with gifts.”</s>
    <s>And continuing in the same energy, he added to the one whose beauty the king desired, saying: "All the wealthy of the people will seek your favor.”</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the face of the Church is the education of spiritual doctrine.</s>
    <s>It is said to be sought for favor by the wealthy because many have renounced all the pomp and riches of the world for it, to reach it and through it, to fly to the eternal homeland.</s>
    <s>These are the daughters of Tyre worshiping with gifts, these are the wealthy of the people who seek its face.</s>
    <s>There is one Church, whose face is sought and by whom it is sought, namely the mother with her children, one bride, one queen.</s>
    <s>All belonging to one Christ, who is the eternal and immortal bridegroom.</s>
    <s>The friend of whom was the one who addressed the same wealthy of the people as follows: "Command those who are rich in this world not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.”</s>
    <s>These are always exhorted by holy preachings to lay up for themselves a good foundation for the future, to take hold of the true life by worshiping with gifts.</s>
    <s>Therefore, the wealthy of the people seek the favor of this queen when they come to her and make alms in her bosom, lest they be found outside her fellowship.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, the face of this queen is not sought by those who come to her with gifts, laying what they brought at the apostles' feet.</s>
    <s>They burned with desire for the face of this queen, not for any picture, and in their gifts, they did not seek any senseless image.</s>
    <s>Of them, it is written: "The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.”</s>
    <s>The bridegroom did not wish to decorate the face of this queen with the colors of any painting by the wealth of the rich, but said: "Sell what you possess, and give alms.</s>
    <s>Make yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</s>
    <s>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”</s>
    <s>Or when he said: "But give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you.”</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, since the wealthy should not come to this queen in hypocrisy with false gifts as if to seek her favor, the Truth itself prohibits it, saying: "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them.”</s>
    <s>But because it is pleasing for her face to always become clearer and more splendid in public, it is clearly shown when it says: "Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    In all these things, neither the adoration of images, nor their intercession, nor their glory is shown. 
    But either the bridegroom, who is the head, or the bride, who is the body, is undoubtedly revealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    From these senses and from the insignia of their decorations, how devoid are those who will implore your worship, 
    transferring all the riches of the people to the faces of manufactured images.
