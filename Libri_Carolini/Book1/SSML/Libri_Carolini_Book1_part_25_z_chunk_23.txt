    The inappropriate and nonsensical statement of Bishop Leo of Foca, who, having turned to the adoration of images, applies to himself a verse from the Psalmist saying: 
    <s>
      "You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since almost no divine testimony was appropriately placed in the frequently mentioned synod, it is also evident that this was not appropriately presented by Bishop Leo of Foca. If he had indeed offered something seasoned with wisdom or relevant to the matter, it would have appeared to others as dissimilar, and he would have stood out against the opinions of all. But while he confessed that he had wept in vain and rejoiced that he had turned to the adoration of images in vain, it is evident how deluded he was and how he was detached from the company of the others. As he himself said, he had grief without harm, joy without profit, tears without loss, laughter without gain, anger without accusations, and reconciliations without honors.

    Like a child eager to play certain games, if restrained by the nurse, he wails with words interrupted by sobs; but if granted the freedom by the nurse to perform those actions, he exults with half-spoken words. Thus, whether restrained or permitted, he has vain tears and equally vain laughter, since neither prohibition provided a cause for weeping nor permission a cause for laughing.

    The verse he applied to himself in this part in vain is: 
    <s>
      "You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness."
    </s>
    This was said by the prophet in the person of the whole church through a rhetorical device, indicating that while it dwells in the mortality and miseries of this world, it is said to weep; but when it reaches eternal reward, it will be clothed with gladness.

    Hence, the same most holy prophet said a little earlier in the same Psalm: 
    <s>
      "Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning."
    </s>
    'Night' signifies this age of ours, in which the ends of the ages have come, or the day of final judgment, while 'morning' means the time of resurrection and the rewards of the saints. This is also promised to the saints through the prophet Isaiah:
    <s>
      "In their land, they will possess a double portion," meaning that after the resurrection, they will enjoy the happiness of both soul and body in the eternal homeland.
    </s>
    And it is added:
    <s>
      "Everlasting joy will be theirs," when I give "the work of their hands in truth."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, our sackcloth will be torn, and we will be clothed with gladness when, as the Apostle says, this perishable body has been clothed with imperishability and this mortal body with immortality, and the saying that is written will come true:
    <s>
      "Death has been swallowed up in victory,"
    </s>
    or when in these members, which we now mortify on earth, we too will appear with Christ in glory when he appears, our life.
