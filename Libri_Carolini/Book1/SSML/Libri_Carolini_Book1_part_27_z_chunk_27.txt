  <p>The verse that the psalmist spoke about the deceitful lips and boastful tongues of the treacherous Jews, who plotted to capture and kill the Savior of the world with deceit, they attribute to their own parents in their synod. Although they may have been somewhat reckless in removing images from the church decorations, they were far greater and incomparably more, I won't say reckless, but cruel in crucifying the Lord.</p>

  <p>These people had zeal for God but according to knowledge, as they completely rejected images; those, pretending to have zeal for the law, had zeal for malice and the most treacherous wickedness, as they nailed the Lord to the cross. These people indiscriminately destroyed the decorations of churches; those maliciously broke themselves against the Lord, despising Him.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the treacherous cohort of Jews had "deceitful lips and boastful tongues" when they said: "We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from." Didn't they have boastful and, so to speak, malicious tongues when they said: "We have a law, and according to the law, he must die because he made himself the Son of God"? Didn't they have boastful tongues when they said: "We know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from"? Didn't they have boastful tongues when they said: "Do not write 'King'; we have no king but Caesar"?</p>

  <p>Therefore, it is clear that they are driven by a disgraceful love of images, who, because of their abolition, do not blush to attach to their parents the things that were spoken by the prophet about the treacherous Jews, and to pierce their fellow citizens with the same weapons with which the prophet is known to have pierced the enemies of the church, indeed of Christ.</p>
