        <s>But neither was the prophecy of this verse, as they say, fulfilled in their ancestors or parents because they renounced idols.</s>
        <s>Even if they stripped the ornaments from places dedicated to divine worship, they were still far removed from the malice of the ancient enemy, about whom this prophecy is.</s>
        <s>For the malice that happens to the human race through his persuasion is less than the malice of the one who is both the author of his own and human wickedness and a deceitful craftsman.</s>
        <s>Being subtler by nature, he is also more cunning and not burdened by the frailty of the body, sharpening the perversity of his wickedness.</s>

        <s>Therefore, 'the enemies' sword has perished,' because the most wicked temptations, as soon as they are brought to Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, who is the end without end, to whom when we come, we have nothing further to seek, they completely perish.</s>
        <s>And so the prophet rightly says, who strikes irrational thoughts, which he calls parents, against the stone, namely, against Christ, who is the cornerstone.</s>
        <s>Or, as some wish, 'the enemies have perished with the sword,' when the sword with which the ancient enemy rages will be destroyed at the end of the world by the sword of the almighty God, about which it is said in another psalm: Unless you turn back, he will sharpen his sword, and about which it is said through the prophet <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛzɪˈkiːəl">Ezekiel</phoneme>: I live, says the Lord, I will sharpen my sword like lightning and bring vengeance on my enemies.</s>
        <s>'Sword' is indeed a Hebrew term, by which in this place the sword of the ancient enemy is implied.</s>

    <p>
        <s>'Enemies' therefore in this place is not a nominative plural, as many think, but a genitive singular, that is: 'the sword of the enemy [devil] has perished,' and it is a figure of speech called prolepsis, that is, anticipation or presumption, by which things that ought to follow are placed before.</s>
        <s>This is also found at the beginning of the prophet <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛzɪˈkiːəl">Ezekiel</phoneme>, when he says: And it happened in the thirtieth year, and it is found in the psalm, when it says: His foundation is in the holy mountains.</s>

        <s>Therefore, the psalmist does not sing about the cities destroyed in this place, as they think, that their ancestors or parents were overthrown for the abolition of images, but about the unbelieving peoples or the followers of evil deeds, whom the devil inhabits like the walls of a city, he says were destroyed by the manifestation of Christ.</s>
        <s>Therefore, the vain and empty love of images has invaded their hearts, who, to establish their worship, think that what was prophesied about the ancient enemy or the unbelieving Jews was spoken about their parents or ancestors.</s>
