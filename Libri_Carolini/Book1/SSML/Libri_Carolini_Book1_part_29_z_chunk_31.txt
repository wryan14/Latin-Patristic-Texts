    <s>The house of God, according to allegory, is the church, or according to anagogy, the heavenly homeland, or according to tropology, the soul of a person.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in many places of the Holy Scriptures, when the house of God is read, it is not walls or some material construction that should be understood, but the spiritual and incomprehensible dwelling of God.</s>
    <s>The minds of those who do not consider the virtues of the church but material images to be the 'beauty of the house' of the Lord truly lack insight into these senses.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Did the same distinguished prophet see certain images or indeed the beauty of walls or the most precious furnishings of ministries when he said: 'Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the place where your glory dwells'?</s>
    <s>Is the place of the Lord's glory believed to be in any man-made things?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the holy church has beauty, which the prophet loved, that is, spiritual virtues.</s>
    <s>It has 'gold', which is faith or inner understanding.</s>
    <s>It has 'silver', which is confession or the beauty of speech.</s>
    <s>It has 'silver-plated columns', which are holy men adorned with reasonable patience and the beauty of speech.</s>
    <s>These columns have 'silver bases' when they are placed upon the stability of God's word, which is handed down to us through the prophets and apostles.</s>
    <s>They also have 'golden heads', because the golden head is the faith of Christ, as the Apostle attests, saying: For the head of every man is Christ.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It also has 'incorruptible wood', which is knowledge that comes through the wood, or the incorruptibility of chastity, which knows no old age.</s>
    <s>It has 'fine linen' for virginity, 'scarlet' for the glory of confession, 'purple' for the splendor of love, 'hyacinth' for the hope of the kingdom of heaven.</s>
    <s>In these materials, its priests are clothed according to the voice of David, who said: Your priests shall be clothed with righteousness.</s>
    <s>And Paul exhorts them in these words, saying: Put on compassion.</s>
    <s>The priests also have other more noble garments, which the same chosen vessel indicates when he says: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the flesh in its lusts.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It has a 'library', that is, holy men educated in the documents of divine law, of whom the prophet says: Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord.</s>
    <s>Blessed are those who seek his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart.</s>
    <s>And again he calls them blessed, who keep his commandments in memory, to do them.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It has 'ten extended courts', not limited to one word of the law or two or three, but expanded in the whole Decalogue of the spiritual law's understanding, or with the fruits of the spirit, that is, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control, and added, which is the greatest of all, love.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It also has an 'altar', that is, the firmness of faith, on which it offers the sacrifices of prayers and the victims of mercy to God, on which it immolates pride as if it were a bull with the knife of chastity, slaughters anger as if it were a ram, and sacrifices every luxury and lust as if they were goats and kids.</s>
    <s>From these, it separates the right arm, the breast, and the jaws for the priests, that is, good works, right works, in which nothing sinister is found.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It also has a 'lampstand of light', either because the Lord is its light or because the holy men, whose lamps are burning and their loins girded, who wait for their Lord when he returns from the wedding, pour forth the light-giving teachings of their preaching.</s>
    <s>This lampstand of lamps is placed in the south to face the north, that is, so that holy men may always vigilantly and carefully watch the cunning of the devil and observe with a fearful mind where the temptation will come from.</s>
    <s>For the prophet also said he saw a boiling pot facing from the north.</s>
    <s>And in another place, he says: For out of the north, evil will break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</s>
    <s>And the Apostle Peter says: Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It also has the 'table of the showbread'.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
      <s>
        Having twelve loaves, placed on the northern side, which looks towards the south, that is, the twelve apostles, who are commanded to be placed daily without ceasing: which looks towards the south, because they daily await the coming of the Lord. For the prophet says, "The Lord shall come from the south."
      </s>
      <s>
        It has "the altar of incense," because the smoke of the holy prayers always ascends before the Lord from the firmness of its faith, and daily it cries out with David: "Let my prayer be directed as incense before You." Or because, according to the Apostle, Christ is a sweet fragrance before God.
      </s>
      <s>
        It has "the mercy seat" and "the ark" and "the two cherubim," which were discussed in detail in a previous chapter.
      </s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>
        It also has "the high priest," of whom the Apostle Paul says: "But Christ, who came as the high priest of the good things to come through a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption." Or as it is said through the psalmist: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek, who is clothed in a linen robe. With His saints, who surely adhere to Him, they are clothed with the lamp of chastity."
      </s>
      <s>
        It also has "a jeweled shoulder piece," because His chosen ones shine with the brilliance of their works, whose works make men glorify their Father who is in heaven. He has on His breast the "rationale," which is called the "breastplate of judgment," distinguished by a fourfold order of stones, in which the evangelical word is signified, which in its fourfold order explains to us the truth of faith and the manifestation of the Trinity.
      </s>
      <s>
        It also has "a gold plate on the forehead," called the "petalon," that is, divinity, because He is of the same substance with the Father. Just as nothing in metals can be compared to gold, so nothing in creation can be compared to the Creator.
      </s>
      <s>
        This high priest also has his inner garments, because the mystery of His incarnation is difficult to investigate, as John attests, who says: "I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal."
      </s>
      <s>
        It also has "bells around the hem of the garment," which are placed at the edge of the robe to always make a sound; because holy preachers, who are indeed His garment, do not cease to speak of the end times and the end of the world, but always warn us of the future, remembering what a certain wise man said: "In all your works, remember your last end, and you will never sin."
      </s>

    <p>
      <s>
        This house of God, that is, the church, whose beauty we briefly enumerated, also has the "Holy of Holies," because in the present age it has a holy way of life for "the holy ones," for "the holy ones" true "Holy of Holies," into which one enters only once, the passage to heaven, when, despising the visible, it passes to the invisible. Of these, the Apostle says: "Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
      </s>
      <s>
        Therefore, this most excellent man loved the beauty of the heavenly homeland, not the false colors of images, not the likenesses of material paintings. For this beauty, not for material figures, he was dissolved in an almost intolerable desire, when he said: "I remembered these things and poured out my soul within me, for I used to go with the multitude, leading them to the house of God." Of this house, not of these visible walls, the Apostle said: "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
      </s>
      <s>
        This beauty Isaiah considered, not the works of painters, when he said: "Look upon Zion, the city of our feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful habitation, a tent that will not be moved." Of this house, David says: "Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still be praising You forever and ever."
      </s>
      <s>
        Did not the holy fathers, to name a few, Paul, Antony, Hilarion, or the whole company of anchorites and hermits, who did not consider the beauty of basilicas or painted images...

  <p>
    They lived in small huts, but they dedicated their souls to God. Therefore, are they not saints? And did they not love the beauty of the Lord's house or desire to contemplate the place of God's glory with a burning heart because they neither had nor worshipped images?
  </p>
  <p>
    For within them, like other holy souls, they had the temple of God and the place of His glory, as the chosen vessel says: <break time="500ms"/> "For the temple of God is holy, which you are."
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, from the golden meadows of the Holy Scriptures, many ambrosial flowers could be gathered, which would show the beauty of the holy church both according to tropology, allegory, and anagogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were not constrained by brevity, we could explore more. Therefore, these few examples suffice for the many, and the diligent reader will seek out the rest, which are not presented here, and will see that the beauty of the house of God shines not in material images but in spiritual virtues.
