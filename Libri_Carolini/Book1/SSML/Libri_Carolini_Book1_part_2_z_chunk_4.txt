<p>According to the Truth's declaration, he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. Those who have fervently worshipped images seem to seek and embrace their own glory to such an extent that they do not fear to scorn their predecessors or parents along with their deeds. Indeed, disregarding and despising them, they claim to seek God's glory in truth, rightly scorning those who have deviated from that Truth which said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life."</p>

<p>He is called "the way" because through His incarnation, He provides a living example. Christ is called "truth" because of the judgment He exercises in truth and because no falsehood can be found in Him; "life" because of His divinity, from which the origin of life comes and by which all things live. He is indeed the path leading the righteous to eternal life; from this path, the prophet advises us not to stray, saying: "Embrace discipline, lest the Lord become angry, and you perish from the righteous way." Of this path, the same saint says: "For the Lord knows the way of the righteous," the opposite of the author of death, about whom it is added: "And the way of the wicked will perish."</p>

<p>For if they have strayed from the truth, they have adhered to falsehood, and if they have adhered to falsehood, they have become liars. Therefore, if they have strayed from the truth, they have become liars. Accordingly, by the rule of derivatives, just as from truth comes "truthful," from justice "just," from piety "pious," from goodness "good," so conversely, from falsehood comes "false."</p>

<p>For liars can hardly or scarcely teach the truth. It is astonishing, then, how those who, according to their own opinion, are taught and born from liars have become such true and passionate followers of the truth. Therefore, they do not seek God's grace in that truth about which pious Truth and true Piety said: "If you remain in my word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free," but in images crafted by the skill of artisans, which often lead their viewers into admiration due to the memory of the acts represented, but always lead worshippers into error. It is no small error, for something other than the one who said: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" is worshipped with religious devotion.</p>

<p>Truth, always pure and unviolated, remains of one kind, but these images, according to the artist's will, seem to perform many actions, while in reality, they do nothing. For they seem to be men when they are not, to fight when they do not, to speak when they do not, to hear when they do not, to see when they do not, to gesture when they do not, to touch when they do not, and so forth. It is evident that they are the fabrications of artisans, not the truth, about which it is said: "And the truth will set you free." For it is true that images are without sense and reason, while it is false that they are men.</p>

<p>And if anyone, according to the principle of equivocation, affirms that they can be called men, like saying "Augustine was a great philosopher," and "Augustine should be read," and "Augustine stands in the church," and "Augustine is buried in that place," let him consider that all these statements, though they spring from one source, Augustine, only one was the true Augustine, about whom it was said: "a great philosopher," while the others refer to a book, an image, or a buried body. The principal difference between a living man and a true one is that one is real, while the other is false, and they are only united in the commonality of the name. For if one is true, defined as a rational, mortal animal capable of laughter and senses, then necessarily, the one who lacks these features must be considered false. And if the one who lacks all these is not false, then the one who possesses all these rules is not true.</p>

<p>Behold, many images are seen standing, some composed of colored pigments, some cast in gold or silver, some carved in wood by the sculptor's chisel, some engraved in marble, some formed in plaster or clay, in which, as much as in any other...</p>


    <p>
        The likeness and inscription of the name are the same, for example, the image of Paul and the inscription: Saint Paul. We must avoid those who err so greatly that they call them true and holy images at their own discretion, rather than according to the tradition of the venerable fathers. Among all, the holiest or most truthful is to be believed, for reason does not permit us to call them equal in terms of materials, sizes, or workmanship. Some are admitted to be holier than others.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are compelled to acknowledge, according to the reasoning of truth, that they should not be called true or holy, as they are unequal in price and are preferred over one another in degrees of comparison. They are equal in merit of holiness and truth, which they entirely lack. Just as a precious image admits a more precious and most precious one, so a holy and true one could admit a holier and more truthful, most holy and most truthful, if there were a positive degree from which the comparative and superlative could emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Granted, an image may contain holiness. But where was it before it was made? Was it in the wood taken from the forest for use, whose remnants are consigned to fire? Or in the colors, often made from impure substances? Or in the wax, which can hold both colors and dirt? 
    </p>
    <p>
        If in the wood, why does it perish when it is carved with an axe, planed with a chisel, or burned to ashes? Or in the colors dissolved by the artist's hand, or in the wax melted by excessive heat and dripping away, when holiness cannot perish? If holiness is not in these things we have mentioned, we must ask where it comes from after the image is assembled from various materials. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since it cannot be found to be added through the laying on of hands or any canonical consecration, it should not be believed to be present. If it were present, we could ask whether it would decay with age or transfer to another image made from remnants. If it were present, it would come from somewhere else; if from somewhere else, it would transfer to another. But it does not transfer, so it should not be believed to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given this, anyone who says they seek the glory of God in these images has strayed far from the truth. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="deɪvɪd">David</phoneme> did not feel the glory of God in man-made images when he said, "His glory is above the heavens," nor did the heavenly host when they sang, "Glory to God in the highest," nor did the glory of the Lord appear to the people of God in the vast wilderness in an image, when it is said, "The glory of the Lord appeared," and "The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."

        Much could be said against this chapter's considerable folly according to the authority of the Holy Scriptures and the investigation of the truth, but let these brief remarks suffice for now, lest they hinder those hurrying on to other matters.
