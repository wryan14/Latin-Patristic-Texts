    <s>
      An outdated error from ancient paganism, repelled by the advent of Christ, seems to have left a trace among those who boast of retaining the pinnacle of Christian faith and religion.
    </s>
    <s>
      These individuals boldly attempt to establish new and foolish rules within the church and do not fear to call themselves 'divine' and their deeds 'divine' in a pagan manner.
    </s>
    <s>
      This has led to a situation where, just as the first humans were enticed by the promise of the venomous serpent in the flourishing garden and committed sin, these people, deceived by the old enemy's trickery, commit similar acts within the church.
    </s>
    <s>
      They do not shy away from calling themselves 'divine' out of a desire for empty glory, and through their greed, they attempt to introduce something new to the church.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, whoever desires to be higher than their rank allows and wishes to be more extraordinary than they should be, will be cast down by the one who regards the humble and recognizes the lofty from afar, and will end up being less than they are.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      This can be confirmed by the examples of those whose fates we should avoid: one who, planning to place his throne in the north, lost angelic honor and companionship and was assigned to the darkness of this world.
    </s>
    <s>
      And another who, disobeying divine commands and wishing to be like God, was cast out from the most delightful place, lost immortality, and was destined for the labors and hardships of this mortal life.
    </s>
    <s>
      If their fates should be avoided, their actions should be shunned; if their actions should be shunned, the practice of humility must be embraced.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, if their fates should be avoided, the practice of humility must be embraced, through which, along with other instruments of good works, we can become like the one to whom it was said: “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme> 7:1), and the sons of God, according to what is written: “Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 1:12).
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For while God is essentially called the creator of all, according to: “For the Lord is a great God, the great King above all gods” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɑm">Psalm</phoneme> 95:3), there is another way in which gods and supreme powers and men are called gods abusively, as the Apostle says: “For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, yet for us there is but one God, the Father” (First Corinthians 8:5-6), and the psalmist: “I said, ‘You are gods’” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɑm">Psalm</phoneme> 82:6).
    </s>
    <s>
      In the third way, according to sacrilegious superstition, aerial powers are called gods, according to: “For all the gods of the nations are idols” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɑm">Psalm</phoneme> 96:5).
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For in the first way, no one can be called God essentially except the one who is ineffable, unchangeable, eternal, omnipotent, who is the highest good, the singular pinnacle, three in persons, one in nature, who is God above all, blessed forever.
    </s>
    <s>
      In the second way, both angels and men can be called gods.
    </s>
    <s>
      To reach this title of dignity, it is necessary to obey God, embrace humility, despise arrogance, and cling to Him through good works.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      The third way has several types.
    </s>
    <s>
      The demons were called gods by the pagans, as were the stars or many other created things of the world.
    </s>
    <s>
      Inventors of certain worldly arts and founders of cities or holders of imperial scepters were believed to be transferred to the status of gods after death and were called divinities, and their images were called gods.
    </s>
    <s>
      These names, arrogantly usurped by demonic or human pride, should be despised by a true Christian, just as they despise their author.
    </s>
    <s>
      For whoever spurns the author of lies must also despise the lie; and whoever despises the lie must also despise the name of the liar.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, whoever spurns the author of lies must also despise the name of the liar.
    </s>
    <s>
      The author of lies is the one about whom it was said: “He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth” (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 8:44).
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      The deceitful name 'divine' is not undeservedly applied to those sinners who, meriting eternal punishment, strive to claim divinity for themselves.
    </s>
    <s>
      If the lovers of this name admit that it does not truly pertain to divinity, they should listen to the pagans themselves, who used this name more familiarly in their writings and often used 'divine' almost interchangeably with 'god' and 'divine' for 'gods'.
    </s>
    <s>
      For example:
    </s>
    <s>
      “You grant to recline at the feasts of the gods”
    </s>
    <s>
      and again,
    </s>
    <s>
      “What are those dire powers asking for?”
    </s>

  <p>
    It is about the gods. "Gods," however, refers to the divine, as in this line:
    <s>
      "Or does the god of the boundless sea reign, and your sailors worship only his powers."
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This was said of Octavian, whom they believed was made divine after his death.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let the ambition for false names cease, let the trace of ancient error be abandoned, let the term of blind superstition fade away, let the arrogance of the presumptuous name be rejected, let the falsehood of men being transferred to gods be expelled from the faithful.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now the truth has risen from the earth, now the sun of righteousness has risen for the faithful, now those who sat in darkness have seen a great light, now a light has risen for those dwelling in the shadow of death. All falsehoods are nullified with the coming of the Truth.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For if the pagan belief in false gods is false, then the story of men being transferred to gods after death is also false. But if the story of men being transferred to gods after death is false, then the designation "divine" is empty.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So if the pagan belief in false gods is false, the designation "divine" is also empty. It is clearly evident that a false thing has a false name, and those who are disciples of the Truth should not be called by a false name.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For even if some Catholics have been found to call the deceased "of divine memory," it is clear that they followed the practice of paganism, just as the names of days and months are often named after pagan vanities. But these and similar things were admitted more by Roman ambition than by apostolic tradition.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We, who are both followers of the Truth and redeemed by the Truth itself, as we have rejected the falsehood of pagan gods, should also reject pagan terms, as the Apostle teaches, who says:
    <s>
      "What partnership has light with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?"
    </s>
    From which agreement may we be freed, with His help, who has delivered us from the darkness and shadow of death and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
