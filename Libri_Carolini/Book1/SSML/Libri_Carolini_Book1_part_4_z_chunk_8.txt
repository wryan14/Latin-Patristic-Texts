    <s>Whoever dares to impudently claim that God reigns with them and boastfully and arrogantly speak of their deeds as divine, will undoubtedly also dare to say that God, whose kingdom and rule it is, requests something from someone.</s>
    <s>While extending their reckless pride, they seek to diminish the command of divine majesty.</s>
    <s>It is not surprising they presume to elevate themselves when they strive to lower divine matters with their unlearned words.</s>
    <s>For it is recorded that God created light by commanding it and separated the waters from the waters, establishing a firmament to prevent them from mixing again, and made the earth fertile with various seeds.</s>
    <s>He adorned the sky with the splendid lights of stars, filled the waters with swimming creatures and the air with flying ones, and created man, the creation of all things.</s>
    <s>And they say: "We ask your paternal care, and most importantly, God asks, who wishes no man to perish."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It is recorded about Moses that he did what the Lord commanded; and he also writes: At the command of the Lord, the Israelites moved their camps, and at the command of the Lord, they set them up.</s>
    <s>And this person says: "most importantly, God asks," as if God, who is unchangeable, ineffable, and eternal, who created and governs the nature of all visible and invisible things with His command, would start asking.</s>
    <s>Indeed, the word "ask" is not one of power but of entreaty, not of authority but of necessity, not of commanding but of pleading.</s>
    <s>Since there is no need in God, and "asking" pertains to one pleading, and "pleading" pertains to one in need, whoever says that God asks for something undoubtedly attributes need to Him.</s>
    <s>If He has need, then He has necessity.</s>
    <s>If He has necessity, then omnipotence is lacking.</s>
    <s>However, omnipotence belongs to Him, therefore need is lacking.</s>
    <s>For it is written: The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If they perhaps say that "asking" can apply to Him because of the person of the Son, who, according to the Apostle, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, let them hear Him saying: Lazarus, come out; and again: Take up your bed and walk; and again: Talitha cumi; and again: Young man, I say to you, arise; and other such things, which are not the words of one asking but of one commanding, not of one requesting but of one ordering.</s>
    <s>We read that even the apostles had this power of command in His name.</s>
    <s>For example, the shepherd of the church says when he healed Aeneas: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise and walk.</s>
    <s>See, Peter commands in the name of Jesus, and they say Jesus ought to ask.</s>
    <s>The servant gives health to the sick by the command of the Lord's name, and they say He ought to ask the priest.</s>
    <s>This is not to be attributed to prudence but to utter foolishness.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If they perhaps want to use in defense of their error what the Truth Himself says: I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, and this: Father, glorify Your name, let them consider that He did not say this according to His divinity, in which He remains of one substance with the Father and equal to the Father, about which He says: I and the Father are one, but according to His humanity, in which the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and about which He says: The Father is greater than I.</s>
    <s>While He is lesser than the Father in the form of a servant, He is undoubtedly believed to be equal to Him in the form of God.</s>
    <s>Hence the Apostle says: He did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, that is, it was not like robbery to Him, as if He were seeking something foreign, who, being co-eternal, is also co-equal with the Father.</s>
    <s>The same Apostle confesses Him as true man and true God, saying: Whose are the fathers, and from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever.</s>
    <s>If, according to their foolishness, He needs to ask someone for something, then He is subject to someone.</s>
    <s>If He is subject to someone, He is not over all.</s>
    <s>But He is over all; therefore, He does not need to ask anyone for anything.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Let those who authored this saying, therefore, hear what blessed Ambrose said against some enemies of the faith about this word:</s>
    <s>"But it is read that He asked. Learn the distinction: He asks as the Son of Man, commands as the Son of God."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      As the Son of God. Do you not grant this to the Son of God, which even the devil granted, and do you diminish it with even greater sacrilege?
    </s>
    <s>
      He says: If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.
    </s>
    <s>
      He believes that at the command of the Son of God, the nature of things and elements will change; you believe that, unless the Son of God pleads, even His own will cannot be fulfilled.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Indeed, armed with the shield of faith, the preacher of the church fought against the enemies of faith with this sword.
    </s>
    <s>
      Among those whom anyone fears to be counted, let such madness be avoided.
    </s>

    <s>
      Meanwhile, let the holy evangelist say what the Lord did to the disciples, who were afraid as the boat was being covered by waves.
    </s>
    <s>
      Then, rising, he says, he commanded the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
    </s>
    <s>
      Let him also say what the centurion said to the Lord when he was about to go to his house and heal his servant: Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Oh, unfortunate speech! Oh, accursed error! Oh, pride that brings swelling rather than strength, and inflation rather than power!
    </s>
    <s>
      The centurion believes that by a mere word, he can heal the servant who was to be mocked, scourged, to suffer, to taste death, to descend into hell, and you say that he who sits at the right hand of the Father in the heavens, above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come, should plead with anyone!
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, it is not necessary for Him to plead, who is believed to have power over the heavenly, earthly, and infernal realms.
