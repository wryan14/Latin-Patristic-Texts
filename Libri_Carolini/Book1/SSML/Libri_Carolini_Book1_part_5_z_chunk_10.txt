We learned from the sacred law's teaching that when the rock was struck, water flowed out for the thirsty people, and we are taught by the apostolic document that this rock should be understood as Christ. He is the rock from which the thirsty hearts are watered, the river whose streams bring joy to the city of God, the fountain of life from which eternal life flows to believers, and the heavenly bread that eradicates eternal hunger from the hearts of the faithful. Whoever receives His spiritual drink and food differently than He gives them, that is, interprets the divine Scriptures in a sense other than that given by the Holy Spirit, is shown to be alien to His pastures. For the words of the Lord, says the prophet, are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace. Without a doubt, he seeks to corrupt their purity with adulterous stains who tries to mix them with strange meanings.

For whoever, out of arrogance and a desire for vain praise, tries to use the testimony of the divine Scriptures to support his error, what else does he do but shamefully captivate the purity of the divine word in adultery and drag the silver refined by the divine Spirit into the contamination of other metals, that is, strange meanings? Of such people, the Lord complains through the prophet: 'I gave them silver and gold, and they made Baal,' that is, they turned the dignity of spiritual understanding and the beauty of the word into the monstrosity of perverse meanings and empty glory. For when the lawgiver says: 'A fiery law in the right hand of the Lord,' it is amazing how dull they are who are neither charmed by its brightness nor terrified by its heat. For just as those who approach it with pure senses and a devoted mind are pierced by the splendor of its brightness, so on the contrary, those who approach it rashly to usurp it are burned by the greatness of its heat. Thus, those who adhere to it with a humble mind and sacred senses have their steps fortified in the race of this life by its lamp's illumination; but those who seek it with strange and rash senses are burned by the fire of eternity, as was symbolized in the four sons of Aaron. For while Eleazar and Ithamar, offering the sanctuary's fire to the Lord according to <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈmoʊzɪz">Moses</phoneme>' instruction, attained the dignity of the priestly crown, Nadab and Abihu, attempting to offer strange fire to the Lord, were most fearfully punished with a terrible death. Whoever wants to avoid this danger must flee from their example.

Whom, therefore, do those who misinterpret well-spoken words imitate in this act other than him who, trying to interpret what was said about a simple righteous man as referring to the Mediator between God and men, said: 'For it is written: He will command His angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' For to make his temptation stronger, he drew an example from the divine writings, thinking that his temptation's drink would be more eagerly accepted if it had the flavor of the Holy Scriptures. For if he is to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures, he should also be followed in deceitful temptations. And if he is to be followed in deceitful temptations, he should be embraced in other behaviors. But he is not to be embraced in other behaviors; therefore, he is not to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures. For the blessed Jerome says: 'The devil interprets the Scriptures badly.' Indeed, heretics and schismatics, who are his followers, understand the divine Scriptures badly, interpret them worse, and observe them in the worst way. But Catholics, taught by the examples of Truth, resist the temptations of the ancient enemy, oppose the machinations of heresies, and, receiving the manna of the divine word with pure and sound sense, are nourished by its sweet food, in which, when collected improperly, worms do not breed, that is, conscience is not corrupted.
