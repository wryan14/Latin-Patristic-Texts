    Before we enter the forest of testimonies to be discussed, which the Easterners have criticized in their synod, we thought it appropriate to explain how the holy Roman church is preferred over other churches by the Lord and should be consulted by the faithful. Especially since the testimonies are to be taken not from other scriptures but from those which it accepts as canonical, nor the teachings of other doctors but those accepted by Pope Gelasius the Second or other pontiffs of that holy see. These teachings are to be understood not according to anyone's whims but sensibly and soberly, as they were stated by them. For the blessed Augustine says, when instructing which scriptures should be received or how they should be understood: "Therefore, the most diligent investigator of the divine Scriptures will first read all the known Scriptures and have familiarity with them, and even if not in understanding, at least in reading, especially those called canonical. For the others, he will read more safely, instructed by the faith of truth, so that harmful falsehoods and illusions do not preoccupy the weak mind and prejudge anything against sound understanding. In the canonical Scriptures, however, he should follow the authority of the many Catholic churches, among which those are undoubtedly to be included which have merited to have the apostolic sees and receive the letters."

    For when he generally prefers the apostolic sees to all the sees established throughout the world, much more must that one be preferred to all, which has been preferred to the other apostolic sees as well. Therefore, just as Peter stands out among the other disciples and all the apostles, so the Roman see is known to stand out among the other apostolic sees. This one is preferred to the other churches not by any synodical decrees, but by the authority of the Lord himself, who said: "You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:18-19). To whom, not incongruously, the companionship of the blessed Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, is attributed so that the authority of that holy church might be completely strengthened, one chosen from a fisherman to fish for souls, the other from a persecutor to build the church, so that in one the true confession of the Son of God might appear, and in the other the sacred preaching of the divine word. For the same Son of God granted to one the keys of the kingdom of heaven, to the other the key to opening the words of the law, yet to both the power of signs, so that one going to him by the cross, the other by the sword, leaving to the faithful the pledge of the bodily burden, they might dedicate the above-mentioned Roman church to him with the splendor of example, the beauty of the word, and the holy blood; the church built on the most solid rock that neither coming floods nor blowing winds could drive to ruin.

    Thus, armed with the spiritual weapons of the holy faith and nourished by the saving streams from the source of light and the origin of goodness, it stands against the horrendous and atrocious monsters of heresies and provides the sweet drinks of preaching to the Catholic churches throughout the world. For the most blessed Jerome, a man learned in divine laws and skilled in many languages, while staying in the fields of Bethlehem and being consulted by the blessed Pope Damasus in Rome regarding difficult questions, is known to have consulted him in turn for reasons of faith, and whether to speak of the substances to be kept silent or to be spoken, or with whom he should communicate in the Eastern parts, he humbly begs for approval to receive his approval. A wondrous thing and worthy of great praise! He asks the one who asks him, consults the one who consults him, who feels himself a master in interpreting the divine Scriptures, unhesitatingly shames himself as a disciple of the venerable pontiff in matters of faith, and unravels the knots of sacred law questions, asking whether he should speak of 'substance' or with whom to communicate in the East.

    From this, it is understood...

        Learned and wise men, shining with the lamp of preaching and knowledge in various parts of the world, have not only not departed from the holy Roman Church but have also, in times of necessity, sought help from it to strengthen their faith. As we have regularly mentioned and shown by examples, all Catholics should observe the rule of the church to seek help from it after Christ to defend their faith. The Roman Church, which has no stain or wrinkle, crushes the monstrous heads of heresies and strengthens the minds of the faithful in faith.

        Although many have departed from its holy and venerable communion, our church has never left it. Instead, guided by its apostolic teaching and receiving all good and perfect gifts from Him from whom they come, it has continually accepted revered gifts. From the earliest times of faith, our church has remained united with it in the sacred union of religion. Even when separated slightly, which is not against the faith, in the celebration of services, through the care and diligence of our illustrious and excellent father, King Pepin, and the arrival in Gaul of the most reverend and holy man, Stephen, bishop of the city of Rome, it was united in the order of chanting, so that the order of chanting would not differ from the order of believing, and those united by one sacred law in sacred reading would also be united by one venerable tradition of chanting. The varied celebration of services should not separate those whom the pious devotion of one faith had united.

        We, too, having been granted the kingdom of Italy by God, have sought to elevate the prestige of the holy Roman Church and to heed the salutary exhortations of the most reverend Pope Adrian. Thus, many churches in that part, which once refused to accept the tradition of the apostolic see in chanting, now embrace it with all diligence. Those who adhered to the gift of faith now also adhere to the order of chanting. Not only are all the provinces of Gaul, Germany, and Italy doing this, but also the Saxons and some people from the northern regions, who have been converted to the rudiments of true faith through us with God's favor, are known to do this. They take care to follow the seat of blessed Peter in all things, as they desire to reach the place where he, the key-bearer, resides.

        May He, who deigned to found His church on Peter and through whose intervention we are followers of his chair, make us worthy to attain the kingdom of heaven, of which he was made the key-bearer, and persevere in the union and fellowship of the holy church.
