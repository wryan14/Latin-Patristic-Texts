      I hear them speaking, I recognize them creating, but I also read one image and one likeness of the Father and the Son.

      For man cannot be in the image of God except through the image of God.

    <s>
      Therefore, the image of God is to be considered by the movement of the inner man.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as God is one, always, everywhere whole, quickening, moving, and governing all things, as the Apostle confirms, 'in Him we live, move, and have our being,' so too the soul is whole in its body, quickening it, moving it, and governing it everywhere.

      It is not greater in the larger parts of its body and smaller in the smaller parts, but whole in the smallest and whole in the largest.

      It also has a certain image of the holy Trinity.

    <s>
      Just as God is, lives, and knows, so too the soul in its highest form is, lives, and knows.

      There is also another trinity in it, which is made in the image of its creator, the perfect and highest Trinity, which is in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

    <s>
      And although it is less than that nature, it still has three dignities in itself, namely intellect, will, and memory.
    </s>
    <s>
      The same is indicated in the Gospel, though in different words, when it says: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,' that is, with all your intellect, all your will, and all your memory.
    </s>
    <s>
      For just as the Son is generated from the Father, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, so too will is generated from intellect, and memory proceeds from both of them, as any wise person can easily understand.

    <s>
      Nor can the soul be perfect without these three, nor can any one of these three be complete without the other two as far as its happiness is concerned.

    <s>
      And just as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are, not three gods, but one God with three persons, so too the soul is intellect, the soul is will, the soul is memory, not three souls in one body, but one soul with three dignities.
    </s>
    <s>
      And in these three, our inner man wonderfully bears His image in its nature.
    </s>
    <s>
      The likeness, however, should be seen in morals, so that just as God the Creator, who created man in His own likeness, is love, goodness, justice, patience, and meekness, pure and merciful, and other virtues of the saints that are read about Him, so too man was created to have love, to be good and just, patient and meek, pure and merciful.

    <s>
      The more someone has these virtues within themselves, the closer they are to God and the greater their likeness to their Creator.

      The blessed Augustine also discussed how man was made in the image and likeness of God.
    </s>
    <s>
      When divine Scripture mentions both the outer and inner man and makes such a distinction, and the Apostle said, 'Even though our outer man is perishing, yet the inner man is being renewed day by day,' one might ask which of these was made in the image and likeness of God?
    </s>
    <s>
      It is foolish to ask if it is one, which one?
    </s>
    <s>
      For who doubts that it is rather the one...
    </s>
  </p>


    <p>
        Who is renewed, whom he, who is corrupted, speaks of? However, whether both are, is a great question. For if the outer man is Adam and the inner man is Christ, then both are understood well. But since Adam, as he was made by God, did not remain good and became carnal through loving carnal things, it cannot absurdly be said that this very thing was his fall, losing the image and likeness of God. Therefore, he himself is renewed and he himself is the inner man.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how is he both the inner and the outer man? Is it according to the body, so that he is the inner man according to the soul and the inner man is the resurrection and renewal, which happens according to the death of the previous life, that is, of sin, and according to the regeneration of the new life, that is, of righteousness? These same two men he calls, so that one is the old man, whom we ought to put off, the other the new man whom we should put on. Again, he calls one the image of the earthly man because it is carried according to the sin of the first man, who is Adam; the other the image of the heavenly man because it is carried according to the righteousness of the second man, who is Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
        The outer man, who is now corrupted, will be renewed in the future resurrection, when he has paid this death, which he owes to nature by that law, which was given in paradise through a commandment. How it is not incongruous to say that even the body was made in the likeness of God is easily understood by those who carefully attend to what was said: "And God made everything very good." For no one doubts that it was originally good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things can be said to be like God in many ways: some according to virtue and wisdom, because in Him is virtue and uncreated wisdom; others inasmuch as they exist, because He is supremely and primarily existing; others inasmuch as they live, because He is supremely and primarily living. Therefore, those things that only exist, yet do not live or have wisdom, are not perfectly, but slightly in His likeness, because they are good in their own order, since He is above all good, and they are good. Moreover, all things that live and do not have wisdom participate a bit more in the likeness. For what lives, exists, but not all that exists, lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now those that have wisdom are so near in likeness to Him that there is nothing nearer in creation. For what participates in wisdom lives and exists; but what lives must exist, it does not need to have wisdom. Therefore, since man can participate in wisdom according to the inner man, he is so made in the image of God that no nature is formed in between, and for this reason, nothing is closer to God, for he has wisdom, lives, and exists, which no creature is better.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the outer man is taken as that life by which we perceive through the body with the five most well-known senses, which we have in common with animals—for this too can be corrupted by sensible troubles, which are brought on by persecutions—it is not without reason that this man too is said to be a partaker of the likeness of God, not only because he lives, which also appears in animals, but moreover because he is turned towards the mind governing him, which wisdom illuminates, which cannot happen in animals lacking reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, the body of man, because among earthly animal bodies it alone is not prone to any prostration, since it is visible and stands upright to look at the sky, which is the beginning of visible things. Although it is known to live not by itself but by the presence of the soul, yet it is not only good because it exists, but also because it is such that it is more apt for contemplating the sky. It can rightly be considered more made in the image and likeness of God than other animal bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, because man is not rightly called without life, not the body alone is the outer man nor the life alone, which is in the sense of the body, but both together perhaps are better understood as the outer man. Nor is it unwisely distinguished that one thing is the image and likeness of God, who is also called the Son, another thing is made in the image and likeness of God as man is accepted. There are also those who do not understand without reason that the two are said to be in the image and likeness, since if it were one thing, one name would have sufficed, but they want the mind to be made in the image, which is from the very truth with no intervening substance.
    </p>


    <p>
        The soul, which is also called the spirit, is not the Holy Spirit, who is of the same substance as the Father and the Son, but the spirit of man. For the Apostle distinguishes them in this way: 
        <s>
            "No one knows what is going on in a man except the spirit of the man, and no one knows what is going on in God except the Spirit of God."
        </s>
        Similarly, about the spirit of man, he says: 
        <s>
            "May your spirit, soul, and body be kept safe."
        </s>
        And this spirit was created by God just like the rest of creation. For it is written in Proverbs in this way: 
        <s>
            "Know that the Lord knows the hearts of men and who formed the spirit of man, He knows all things."
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, this spirit is understood to be made in the image of God, without any doubt, in which there is understanding of truth. For truth is associated with no creature in between: the rest of man is seen to be made in likeness, because every image is similar, but not everything that is similar is properly an image, though it can perhaps be said abusively. 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        But one must be careful in such matters, so nothing is overly assumed beyond what should be properly kept, lest, because any body is extended through local spaces, anything like that is believed to be the substance of God. For a thing that is lesser in part than in whole does not suit the dignity of the soul, how much less the majesty of God?
    </p>
    <p>
        See how subtly and healthily holy men have discussed that man is made in the image and likeness of God, namely the image in the soul, in which there is intellect, will, and memory, and likeness in morals, that is, in love, justice, goodness, and holiness, all of which are incorporeal! 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        How far removed are those who apply this testimony to images shaped by the hands of artists from the sense and teaching of these holy men, it is not for us to discuss here, but rather it is reserved for the judgment of the reader, so that his own sense may warn how foolish they are in this part, not our pen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoever therefore believes that man is made in the image and likeness of God in the same way that an image shaped by an artist is made in the image of man, shows that he believes something corporeal in God, which is a blasphemous belief. 
        <s>
            For if what is made in the image and likeness of God is applicable to man-made images, then man is made in the image of God according to bodily form; and if man is made in the image of God according to bodily form, then God is corporeal.
        </s>
        <break time="500ms"/>
        But God is incorporeal, therefore what is made in the image and likeness of God is not applicable to man-made images.
