      Since, with God's help, we have followed sound and sober teachings of the holy fathers to understand how God created man in His image and likeness, it is now worth examining briefly the difference between image, likeness, and even equality.

    <s>
      This is so that those who worship images and are carried away by boundless assertions can understand these three terms, which they often consider as one, and recognize the extent of their error.
    </s>
    <s>
      Additionally, diligent readers can gain some useful insights.

      These three terms need to be distinguished because everything that is an image is also a likeness, but not everything that is a likeness is an image.
    </s>
    <s>
      While an image never lacks likeness, likeness can often lack image, and both likeness and image can sometimes lack equality.
    </s>
    <s>
      This equality can sometimes be linked with both image and likeness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Although these three terms belong to the same category, known as relation, they each have certain properties that others do not.
    </s>
    <s>
      For an image, it is always expressed from another; for likeness and equality, they remain in their own substance, not expressed from another but rather resembling or being equal to other things.
    </s>
    <s>
      An image does not admit degrees, while likeness and equality do.
    </s>
    <s>
      For example, one can say something is more or less similar or more or less equal, but not more or less an image.
    </s>
    <s>
      There is also a subtle contradiction in their interchange, known as antistrophe in Greek.
    </s>
    <s>
      Discussing all these details would be lengthy.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, to clearly understand the difference between these three terms, we must refer to the words of the blessed Augustine.
    </s>

    <s>
      Augustine says:
    </s>
    <s>
      "Where there is an image, there is likeness, but not necessarily equality. Where there is equality, there is likeness, but not necessarily an image. Where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image or equality."
    </s>
    <s>
      For example, a mirror shows an image of a person because it is expressed from that person.
    </s>
    <s>
      There is necessarily likeness, but not equality, because the image lacks many qualities of the person it reflects.
    </s>
    <s>
      Where there is equality, there is also likeness, but not necessarily an image, such as between two equal faces, where each has what the other has.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, they are not images of each other because neither is expressed from the other.
    </s>
    <s>
      Where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image or equality.
    </s>
    <s>
      For example, every egg is similar to every other egg, but an egg from a partridge, though similar to a henâ€™s egg, is not an image of it because it is not expressed from it, nor is it equal because it is shorter and belongs to a different kind of animal.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, the phrase "not necessarily" implies that it sometimes can be.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, there can be an image that also has equality, such as between parents and children, where there is image, equality, and likeness if the time difference is ignored.
    </s>
    <s>
      The child is rightly called an image of the parent because it is expressed from the parent and can have such likeness that it is also called equal, except for the time by which the parent precedes.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, equality can sometimes have not only likeness but also image, as shown in the previous example.
    </s>
    <s>
      There can also be likeness and equality without an image, as mentioned with equal faces.
    </s>
    <s>
      There can be likeness and image without equality, as shown with the mirror example.
    </s>
    <s>
      There can also be likeness where there is both equality and image, as with children, except for the time by which parents precede.
    </s>

      With these rules of difference briefly laid out, let us move on to what we have begun with appropriate order, and let the testimonies of divine law wrongly used by others be rightly proclaimed by the teachings of the venerable fathers, so that their flight may be grounded with these wings broken, which they have arrogantly taken for themselves.
