    Those who are passionate about worshipping images particularly and familiarly use the example that Abraham is read to have worshipped the sons of Heth and Moses to have worshipped Jethro, the priest of Midian.

  <p>
    The worship in these cases is as far removed from the worship of an image as a painted man is from a real man. Just as a real man is distinct from a painted one—rational from irrational, sensible from insensible, animated from inanimate in their definition—so too, without a doubt, is this worship distinct from that worship. For it is one thing to greet a man with the duty of salutation and the service of humanity by worshipping, and another to worship a picture composed of different colors, without movement, without voice, or other senses, with some unknown form of worship. Indeed, we are taught by the examples of almost all the holy Scriptures to love brotherhood and to show affection towards our neighbors and to embrace the step of humility, through which we greet each other with worship. But we are prohibited rather than instructed to worship or greet images or to venerate certain insensible trifles in almost all places of the divine Scriptures. For, to remain silent about the rest, the most sacred shepherd, upon whom the holy church is founded on the most solid rock, did not say: "love images," but: "love brotherhood," nor: "be subject to pictures," but: "be subject to every human creature," and he taught us to sanctify the Lord Christ not in images, but in our hearts.

    It is indeed utterly foolish and devoid of all reason to use as an example for establishing the worship of images that Abraham is read to have worshipped the people of the land and Moses to have worshipped Jethro, the priest of Midian. Holy men have worshipped out of humility, by which they pleased God, for the sake of salutation. Often they have humbly fled to avoid being worshipped by others, and often, standing firm in the rigor of their sanctity, they have despised worshipping the proud. But they have never attempted, even slightly, to worship images. For in that Abraham and Moses are read to have worshipped humble men necessary for their usefulness, and Mordecai is found to have despised worshipping Haman, an arrogant man aspiring to the destruction of God's people, it is clearly shown that holy men are companions to the humble, either to encourage them to better things or to not lose the gifts of the same supreme virtue. Against the wickedness of the wicked, either to avoid the company of the evil or to compel them to repent, they stand firmly. Therefore, in that John in the Apocalypse is restrained by an angel from worshipping him, the angel saying: "See that you do not do that; I am your fellow servant," and Peter, the shepherd of the church, gently avoided the worship of the centurion, saying: "Stand up, brother, I am also a man like you," and Paul, the chosen vessel, strongly rejected the worship of the Lycaonians with Barnabas, it is undoubtedly prohibited to give the worship due only to God, who alone is to be worshipped and revered, to any creature, except for the sake of salutation, through which humility is demonstrated.

    Let the most holy Augustine tell us what he thinks about this worship of Abraham or Moses. For he says: Here is also indicated an example of humility, that Moses, with whom God spoke, did not disdain or despise the advice of his foreign father-in-law, and whether Jethro himself, though he was not an Israelite, should be considered among the men who worship the true God and are religiously wise, just as it is rightly questioned about Job, though he was not from that people, or whether he sacrificed to the true God among His people when he saw his son-in-law, or whether Moses himself worshipped him, although even if worship was expressly mentioned, honor would seem to be due to his father-in-law.

      Given these circumstances, I think that those who consider divine Scripture to use their familiar way of speaking, which some call anachronism, and thus use 'bless' for 'bow'.
    </s>
    <s>
      This manner of speaking is peculiar to them to such an extent that they use 'have', 'salute', 'kiss', and 'venerate' for 'bow', and others do the same, and, so to speak, almost all such words are turned into 'bow' for them.
