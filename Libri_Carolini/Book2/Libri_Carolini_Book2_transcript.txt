Chapter 1:"That 'How the enemy has acted wickedly in Your holy places' was not written for those who despise worshiping images"
It is also sheer madness to interpret things that were predicted long ago about those who destroyed the city of Jerusalem and burned the Lord's temple as referring to those who despise worshiping images.
Especially since it is one thing to remove the bronze sea, the two cherubim, and the other vessels and ornaments from the temple, and another thing not to worship man-made images; it is one thing to cruelly destroy the beauty of the temple with fire, and another to avoid the worship of images; it is one thing to cruelly demolish the Holy of Holies, and another to wisely prohibit bowing to pictures.
Finally, anyone who wants to know what the psalmist was talking about when he said, "How the enemy has acted wickedly in Your holy places," is not only instructed by the histories of the books of Kings and the deeds of the Romans, which narrate the past destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the temple, but also by the prophecy of the illustrious prophet David, who, through a figure of speech called prolepsis, described future calamities and the destruction of that most sacred temple as if they had already happened.
He said: "God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, they have defiled Your holy temple, they have laid Jerusalem in ruins, and so on."
And in the psalm from which this verse is taken, which we are now discussing, he says: "How the enemy has acted wickedly in Your holy places! They have boasted, all who hate You, in the midst of Your court. They have set up their standards as signs, and did not recognize them as in the topmost place, as in a forest of trees they cut down its gates with axes and hatchets. They have burned Your sanctuary with fire, they have defiled the dwelling place of Your name on the ground."
Which is also more clearly stated in another psalm: "The boar from the forest ravages it, and the wild beast feeds on it."
But let no one be troubled that it does not say, "How the enemies have acted wickedly," but, "How the enemy has acted wickedly." Note that this was said through a figure of speech called enallage, where the singular is used for the plural, as in the Gospel: "And the robbers who were crucified with Him also reviled Him," or: "For those who sought the child's life are dead," and the plural is used for the singular, as is read in Exodus: "Pray to the Lord to take away the serpent from us," and in the psalm: "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them."
Even if someone examines this more subtly according to mystical understanding, they will not inappropriately recognize the holy church and the heretics who maliciously attack it with corrupt doctrines.
Nevertheless, no one who has a sound and sober understanding will interpret it about those who despise the worship of images.
Therefore, the more those who think this verse was said about them lack sound judgment, the more those who do not worship images remain steadfast in their good sense.
Chapter 2: That 'For there is no longer a prophet, and he will no longer recognize' does not pertain to this matter
For this verse is also incorrectly placed in the reading of the same synod, for it is neither our voice, who worship the Father in spirit and truth, nor theirs, who attempt to worship God and his saints in images.
Because we have a great prophet, Jesus Christ, our Lord; about whom it is said through Moses:
"The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you. You will listen to him";
whom we also have as an advocate with the Father, according to the apostle: whom we daily behold with spiritual eyes, and we are diligently taught by his prophecies.
But the destruction and dispersions and calamities and deaths of the Jewish people, not even the destruction of the temple, the abolition of ceremonies, the recession from prophecy and the knowledge of God, bewailing and saying:
"For there is no longer a prophet, and he will no longer recognize."
This was also predicted through the prophet Hosea, who said:
"For many days the children of Israel will sit without king and without prince and without sacrifice and without altar and without ephod and without teraphim."
He also added their conversion to faith, which we believe will happen near the end of the world:
"And after this, the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king, and they will come trembling to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days."
Chapter 3: How to understand: 'Lord, in your city you will reduce their image to nothing'
The City of God is sometimes figuratively understood in sacred scriptures as the soul of a person, which is inhabited by God, as the Scripture says: "I will dwell in them," and again: "The soul is the seat of wisdom." Sometimes it is understood as the church of the present time, which is nourished by the stream of grace, to which it is said through the prophet: "If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand wither." Often it is understood as the heavenly Jerusalem, which is built by the ranks of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, and other faithful. About this, it is said by the Apostle: "But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother." To which also the Lord promises through the prophet Isaiah: "For your sun shall no more go down, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for the Lord will be your everlasting light." This city, which John in the Apocalypse says he saw descending from heaven, adorned with its jewels. About whose happiness almost innumerable things could be said, which this brief style cannot digest.
In this city, the images of the wicked will be reduced to nothing, because their appearance cannot appear before the divine sights; but just as they polluted the image of the Lord in the course of this present life, so in the heavenly Jerusalem their image will not appear, who indeed will be consigned to eternal fire. About whom it is said elsewhere by the Psalmist: "And man, when he was in honor, did not understand; he was compared to the senseless animals and became like them," because, although he was in such honor that he was created in the image and likeness of God, by not understanding he was so degraded by vices that he was not unjustly compared to irrational animals.
Therefore, the images of the wicked are reduced to nothing, when the Truth itself withdraws from them, and they are alienated from its light, unable to retain the likeness, whose happiness they are known to lack entirely. Because of their deceitfulness, he said the evils appointed to them above, because God, the just judge, renders to each according to his works. He also said they were cast down, that they might not be lifted up, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. He said they suddenly failed and perished because of their iniquity, like a dream upon waking, because as in some illusions mortals' hearts are deceived in dreams and they rejoice as if they suddenly possess desired things - whether one attains a desired kingdom, or someone is raised to a coveted office, or someone is suddenly enriched, fleeing poverty, or someone enjoys a desired marriage, or a sick person rejoices to have regained lost limbs, or a criminal rejoices to be considered honorable, or an ignoble person to be noble, or a foolish person to consider himself wise, and upon waking, they suddenly lose what they acquired while sleeping, and they grieve to find their eyes open and not see what they rejoiced to see with them closed - so the happiness of the wicked seems in a way like a dream, because after a short time it will not be seen; and just as upon waking they lose what they had acquired through a dream, so upon dying they lose what they seemed to have, because the deceptive joy they obtained vanishes in a moment, and they cannot hold onto the vain and, so to speak, smoky joys of the world for long.
Because of their impieties, the prophet, kindled with a certain severity, added: "Lord, in your city you will reduce their image to nothing," meaning that those who polluted the beauty of your character with evil works, their faces will not be seen in your city, where there is eternal happiness, supreme blessedness, perpetual joy; in whose palaces reigns the king, whose kingdom will have no end, whose seats shine with the council of patriarchs, whose court glows with the assembly of prophets, whose walls are adorned with the numerous army of martyrs, whose gates are decorated with the gatherings of apostles, whose streets overflow with choirs of virgins, whose domiciles are filled with the legions of confessors, which does not need the sun, because the Lord.
The light is His, through whom all paths are sung with Alleluia.
Chapter 4: How to understand: 'Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other'
This has been recklessly and flatteringly claimed by John the Presbyter and delegate of the Easterners to have been fulfilled in the presence of the venerable Pope Adrian and Patriarch Tarasius!
David, the most eloquent of the prophets, elegantly sings that mercy and truth have met together, and righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
This is ultimately confirmed to be fulfilled when, after the incarnation of the Lord, the two Testaments were brought together in the union of one covenant.
Although they may seem different in some ways, they are known to converge in Christ, who is our peace and who made both one.
In this context, mercy is where humanity is liberated by grace, and truth is where the proclamation of the law and the prophets is contained.
These two are said to have met not to create opposition but to fulfill the grace of the promised perfection.
It is understood as one act, which is shown to be divided by time.
To express this covenant clearly, David doubled this very concept with various repetitions, indicating that righteousness and peace immediately came into mutual agreement through a kind of love.
This verse, based on its attribution to the body somatopoeia, is understood to be spoken as if giving bodies to incorporeal things and by metaphor.
Metaphor is the transfer of words and things, often transferring from animate to inanimate, inanimate to animate, and vice versa.
These two figures of speech differ in that one attributes bodies to incorporeal things, and the other attributes members, movements, and forms to both corporeal and incorporeal things.
John the Presbyter recklessly and flatteringly uttered this verse in the presence of the venerable Pope Adrian and Tarasius, the Bishop of Constantinople.
Although he was of lesser honor than the bishops present in the same synod, he is nevertheless read as not being lesser in error.
Even if they surpassed him in the rank of dignity, he exceeded them in verbose impudence and could not be surpassed by superiors in reckless talkativeness, though he was surpassed by them in pontifical dignity.
He is believed to have committed a double offense: either because he tried to twist the words full of the mysteries spoken by the Holy Spirit into human matters with a superstitious intention of worshiping images, or because he fell into the miserable vice of flattery with a perverse intention.
This vice of flattery was feared by the most noble of the prophets who said: "Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. But let the oil of the sinner not anoint my head."
Therefore, another scripture also rightly says: "It is better to be chastised by a righteous person than to be praised by a sinner," and again: "Those who call you happy lead you astray," because flatterers praise to seduce, not to provoke to eternal happiness, which indeed needs no good.
Chapter 5: That 'Exalt the Lord our God and worship at His footstool, for He is holy' is not about image worship
With this verse from the Psalms, the error that has grown so strong in some people's hearts—to the extent that they hold councils to establish it and try to support it with testimonies from the Holy Scriptures—believes it can defend itself when it hears that the footstool of the Lord is to be worshiped.
They think they have a helmet protecting the head so it does not feel the sword's strikes; they believe they have a breastplate protecting the rest of the body so it does not suffer from arrows; they think they have a shield that guards them from harmful flying missiles.
But either by succumbing or hiding, they will find themselves stripped of these defenses, as they have misused them in vain and uselessly, and will feel the force of the spiritual sword wielded by holy men, to the point where they will not even believe they have any strength left.
Is it because the prophet says to worship the "footstool of the Lord" that the worship of images should be established?
What is the similarity between the footstool of the Lord and material images?
Or what connection is there between the indescribable works of God and images created by any artists?
Or what association is there between such an excellent and splendid mystery and lifeless figures made by human ingenuity?
Or where is it established that images should be worshiped, just as it is established that the footstool of the Lord should be worshiped?
David does not say: "Worship images of certain saints," as he says: "Worship the footstool of the Lord"; nor does the Lord say: "The works of human hands are my seat, and images are the footstool of my feet": but he says: "Heaven is my seat, and the earth is the footstool of my feet."
Listen then, most foolish and rather insane error, listen, incomparable madness, listen, ridiculous sluggishness, listen to the blessed Ambrose teaching what the footstool of the Lord's feet is or how it should be worshiped.
The apostles worshiped the Lord because they bore witness to faith and received the teaching of faith.
The angels also worshiped, of whom it is written: "Let all God's angels worship him."
They worship not only His divinity but also the footstool of His feet, for He is holy.
And a little later: But lest someone mock the proposed example by escaping it, let us consider by what reason it seems to refer to the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, which the prophet says: "Worship the footstool of His feet."
We should not evaluate the footstool according to human use.
For God is not corporeal or limited, as if we should think of a footstool placed under His feet; nor do we read that anything should be worshiped except God, for it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him."
How then could the prophet, who was brought up and educated in the law, command something contrary to the law?
Therefore, it is not a trivial question, and we should carefully consider what the footstool is.
We read elsewhere: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet."
But we are not to worship the earth, because it is God's creation.
Yet, let us see if the prophet means that the earth which the Lord Jesus took upon Himself in His incarnation should be worshiped.
Therefore, by the footstool, the earth is understood; by the earth, the flesh of Christ, which we worship today in the mysteries and which the apostles worshiped in the Lord Jesus, as we said above.
For Christ is not divided, but one; nor, when He was worshiped as the Son of God, was He denied to be born of a virgin.
Since, therefore, the sacrament of the incarnation is to be worshiped, and the incarnation is the work of the Holy Spirit, as it is written: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God."
This footstool of the Lord's feet, Saint Augustine, a most diligent inquirer, asserted should be understood as the body of the Lord, which He took from the Virgin Mary, as the footstool of His divinity, due to the nature of the humanity He deigned to assume, which is certainly subject to and protected by that power.
It is evident to all creatures that it is higher, as the Apostle says, 'What is foolish of God is stronger than men.'
And elsewhere, about the same Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, the Apostle says: 'For this reason, God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.'
Therefore, by the majesty of the Lord's feet in this verse, the stability of divinity, which always remains in its own omnipotent glory like the unwavering firmness of the feet, is understood.
The feet of the Lord can also be understood metaphorically as the final times when the Lord deigned to become incarnate. Hence, the evangelist John says: 'Little children, it is the last hour.'
Paul the Apostle also says: 'When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.'
It should be noted, certainly, that it does not say: 'because it is holy,' but: 'because he is holy,' namely, that the body of the Lord should not be separated from divinity, keeping the properties of each nature intact, but referred to the person. Hence, the Gospel says: 'The Word became flesh and lived among us.'
These brief statements about the footstool of the Lord's feet are sufficient. Now let us move on to the other matters.
Chapter 6: That 'Worship at his holy mountain' does not justify image worship
Even if he commanded worship at the mountain, it would not mean the worship of images, but the understanding of the Lord Jesus Christ by sane minds, who is a mountain higher than all other mountains. His height and virtue surpass the heights and virtues of all saints. About Him, it is said through the prophet Isaiah:  'In the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it, and many peoples will come.'
Therefore, it is said:  'Worship at his holy mountain,'  because it is not the mountain itself but the Lord whom the prophet commands to be worshiped at the holy mountain, which can be referred to Mount Zion, which is the church. It can be said that this is the highest and holiest of mountains, whose inhabitant is Christ. Hence, the holy Lord commands worship on the holy mountain because, just as His praise is sung in perfect harmony, so too can no disgrace be appropriate in His worship.
We therefore worship at His holy mountain, not images or certain superstitious things, but the Lord Himself, who is the head of that mountain. To acquire the same mountain, He deemed it worthy not only to be born but also to die. About this, it is said through the prophet:  'He led them into the mountain of His holiness, this mountain which His right hand acquired,'  and about this, it is said through the lawgiver:  'Bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, Lord, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. The Lord will reign forever and ever.'
Chapter 7: That 'The Lord will not leave the rod of the wicked upon the lot of the righteous' is not about image worship
It's no wonder if they are mistaken in small things, those who are mistaken in big things, nor is their error more admirable in that they boast they are righteous because they worship images, while we, who scorn to worship them, admit we are sinners.
Since, out of love for those images, they attempt to violate the purity of divine Scriptures and chiefly believe that the benefit of their faith lies in these things.
They strive with stubborn minds to anathematize those who, despising these and other such vanities, serve God alone and worship Him.
How then the text of this verse pertains to the same matter for which it was proclaimed by them, or how it is believed to oppose their sense, and how much it differs from their opinions, is clear not only to simple readers but also to the unlearned.
Indeed, it plainly demonstrates, without enigmatic or allegorical coverings, that the Lord will not allow the righteous to be scourged by the wicked for long, lest they fall into the pit of despair, afflicted by prolonged scourging.
But if He subjects them to adversity for a time for testing, He then lifts them up with favorable times after a period, so that their innocence remains unshaken.
Chapter 8: That 'Those who turn to sin will be led by the Lord to those who commit iniquity' is not about those who scorn image worship
We wanted to include this verse individually in our work because, although it is part of a single psalm with the previous verse, it has a different meaning. And although it has been brought up by some to support a particular error, it is clearly placed in a different context in the often-mentioned synod reading. Therefore, those who turn to sin are not those who scorn the superstitious worship of images, but those who are ensnared by the bonds of the ancient enemy, becoming more prone to iniquity.
The more they are known to sin, the more tightly they are bound by diabolic spirits. Hence, a wise person says: "Each one is bound by the ropes of their sins."
The holy prophet Isaiah also speaks of this bondage: "Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as if with cart ropes!"
So those who turn to this bondage will be led by the Lord to those who commit iniquity, because they will be condemned in the future along with those they sin with in this world. They will go to the eternal fire, which is prepared for the author of crimes and his angels, as they neglected to break the bonds of sin in this world.
May He, who redeemed us into freedom and showed a great light to us sitting in darkness, make us free from this bondage. To those dwelling in the shadow of death, He rose as the true light. May He also make us free from this severe condemnation, who made us followers of His clear faith, hope, and love.
Chapter 9: That Solomon's work in the temple does not justify image worship
Solomon is said to have made oxen and lions in the temple, but we who understand the law spiritually, as the Apostle says, are instructed by certain hidden mysteries in their creation.
However, those who love the worship of images try to justify their empty foolishness.
We are taught by mystical meanings, while they are confirmed in their great error.
We seek the truth through symbols, but they are deceived by something well-made and take it as authority for something that should not be done.
Why then, O descendant of David, O king of Israel, O wisest of the wise, did you make them?
"I made them," I say, "not to be worshipped but to signify certain mystical things; not to support error, but to reveal the secrets of mysteries; not to be a stumbling block to blind minds, but to subtly hint at something great to those who scrutinize deeply."
If he should therefore be blamed for something well done being misused for evil by the wicked, then the lawgiver should also be blamed for raising something necessary to the sight of many in the wilderness, which the wicked later used wrongly.
Therefore, we do not reject images made in memory of past events and for the beauty of the basilicas, since we know through Moses and Solomon that they were made, albeit in symbolic figures.
However, we restrain their most insolent or rather most superstitious worship, a practice we have not found established by patriarchs, prophets, apostles, or apostolic men.
But to return to the subject, Solomon made oxen and lions in the temple because Christ also established apostles and their successors in the church.
According to the blessed Gregory, they are humble companions to those who do good and stand firm against the vices of the wrongdoers with the zeal of justice.
Thus, the meekness of the ox sustains the former, and the fierceness of the lion spurs on the latter.
This can be gathered from the example of the pastor of the church, who gently won over Cornelius by humility and vehemently stood against Ananias and Sapphira when they acted deceitfully.
Therefore, holy men sometimes have the meekness of oxen and sometimes the fierceness of lions, as they hold the staff to rule the strong firmly and the rod to support the weaknesses of the infirm.
Chapter 10: That the passage 'Show me your face and let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely' has been misused regarding image worship
The face of the church, which Christ addresses with various affectionate names, calling her a dove, beautiful, and a friend, instructing her to rise (that is, to believe), to hurry, to grow in good works, to return, and to come to eternal reward, is not physical but spiritual. For everything written about her in the same Song of Songs must be understood spiritually, not carnally. If this verse can be applied to some physical matter, as those who misuse it for the vision of images dream, then everything written about the members of Christ's bride, the church, must be believed to be physical. And if all these things correspond not to visible members but to invisible virtues, then the face must be understood as an invisible virtue rather than the vision of some image.
Therefore, the face of the church is the knowledge of her virtues, whose beauty is loved by the bridegroom and to whom it is well said through the prophet: "Because the king desired your beauty." Christ, therefore, encourages the church to show her face to him, that is, to always contemplate him with faith and works, so that she can say with Elijah: "As the Lord lives, in whose presence I stand"; and not be among those whom he denotes through the prophet, saying: "They turned their backs to me and not their faces." He also encourages her to let her voice sound in his ears, because he is ready to listen to his saints, as the psalmist testifies, saying: "The righteous cried out, and the Lord heard them and delivered them out of all their troubles." He says her voice is sweet and her face is lovely because the prayers of the saints are always acceptable to God, and their presence is pleasing, as they have received from Christ's light to remain in the beauty of righteousness.
Granted, it may be possible to apply this verse to the vision of images: "Show me your face" or "Your face is lovely"; but what can be said about the voice, which the prophet declares to be sweet and encourages to be heard? If souls are not enlivened, they certainly do not enjoy a voice. And if they do not enjoy a voice, much less do they enjoy the sweetness of the voice. Therefore, if souls are not enlivened, they do not enjoy the sweetness of the voice. Hence, it is clear that just as in other assertions from this matter, their words are irrelevant, so also in this part they are thwarted, especially since it cannot be rightly said of the vision of their faces: "Show me your face," nor of their voice, which they entirely lack: "Let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely."
Chapter 11: How to understand Isaiah's prophecy: 'There will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt', which some misapply to image worship
Josephus narrates that this prophecy was fulfilled when Onias the priest, who fled to Egypt surrounded by many groups of Jews, built an altar and temple there.
But we, who hold and believe devoutly that the prophecies about Christ's coming and the calling of the Gentiles are not future events but past ones, do not think this prophecy was fulfilled by Onias the priest, but by Christ the Lord, the Mediator between God and humans, who established faith in this world, often symbolized by the name Egypt.
In this faith, sacrifices of prayers and offerings of holy merits are made to the Lord by the faithful, in accordance with the title placed, that is, the gospel or apostolic doctrine, which instructs the minds of the faithful to perform good works.
Furthermore, when it is added: "And it will be a sign and testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt," it was meant to be understood as the mystery of the Lord's passion.
Then, when the time of persecution comes, those who believe will implore the Lord's mercy.
Immediately, the Savior will come, that is, Jesus, which is what His name means in our language, and the Lord will be known by the Egyptians.
They will know Him, either as those who were defeated or as believers saved by present help.
Since this is the meaning of the prophetic words and the understanding of the title and altar, who would use this to support the worship of images except someone blinded by their own foolishness?
Who would dare to use a Spirit-inspired prophetic message to support an error, except someone entirely devoted to that error?
How then can the worship of images find any support from these words of the holy prophet, when it is clear that these words were not meant to be fulfilled historically in a specific altar or title, but spiritually in the faith of Christ and the gospel held by the faithful?
Even if these words were historically about a physical altar or title, they would not support the worship of images, since the prophet did not say they should be worshiped, but only predicted their existence.
There is a difference between "will be" and "will be worshiped"; between "altar of the Lord" and "any image"; between "title near the boundaries" and "likeness in any material."
Therefore, he did not say, "There will be a time when no one will please God unless they worship images"; nor did he say, "Such a cult of images will arise that whoever does not worship them or honor them with incense, lights, or certain offerings will be worthy of anathema," but he said, "There will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a title near its boundary, and it will be a sign and testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt."
This clearly means: "There will be faith in the world and the preaching of the gospel, through which the manifestation of the Lord's passion and our redemption will be declared."
Chapter 12: That the gospel testimony 'No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket' has been misused by those who worship images
Oh, what an inconsistent and laughable thing, that certain writings, I don't know with what sense, are about us, who scorn the worship of images.
These writings are taken from what the Lord instructed the disciples when sending them to preach, so that they would have great confidence in preaching and, not terrified by the fear of persecutors, would not hide like a lamp under a basket.
Instead, putting aside all fear, would show themselves with all the marks of freedom and proclaim from the rooftops what they had heard in the rooms.
Therefore, let them place their lamp, that is, the worship of images, adorning it on the summit of their faith.
But as for us, if we have any splendor of knowledge, let us place it in Christ, who is the source of light, so that we may be able to exhibit the splendor of word and example to those remaining with us in the house of the holy church.
Chapter 13: That some cite blessed Sylvester, bishop of Rome, to support their error
Often in this particular work of ours on images, we are compelled to confess that they should not be held, but rather that adoration of them is forbidden by us.
Neither should the vision of them in basilicas' ornaments and records of historical events be avoided, but the most insolent or rather superstitious adoration should be condemned.
Thus, as in other cases, so in this example, the assertion will be frustrated for those who attempt to support their great error in the adoration of images by claiming that Sylvester, the bishop of the Roman church, is said to have brought images of the apostles to Emperor Constantine.
He brought them to him to be seen, not to be adored.
He brought them, not to be worshipped, but to encourage him to turn away from the worship of idols and to urge him to worship God alone.
He wanted the emperor to recognize the faces of those whom he had seen in dreams through their depiction in paintings.
He brought them not to teach him to surrender to the adoration of images while fleeing from the worship of idols, nor to destroy him with the sword of internal strife after liberating him from hostile weapons, but to elevate his mind from known things to unknown ones so that he could perceive with his physical eyes the images of those he could not yet see with the eye of the mind, not yet cleansed from the stains of paganism by spiritual miracles.
Therefore, if he had commanded him to adore them, though he did not, perhaps he would have ordered it to lead him, who was a worshipper of visible things, through visible things to the invisible, not to turn us from the invisible to the visible.
Nor should we, who have received the strength to grasp solid food, return to milk like infants.
If he, who could not yet be given solid food due to the tenderness of his faith, was given milk without deceit to desire and grow on.
Thus, the Apostle gave spiritual milk and the food of vegetables to the young church coming from circumcision and paganism, meaning easier teachings to understand and lighter commandments to fulfill, so that the carnal minds, nurtured in a certain tenderness of infancy, might become capable of receiving the food of spiritual mysteries.
Therefore, in the book of the acts of blessed Sylvester, where it is written about the images brought to Emperor Constantine, it can be resisted because, although it is read by many Catholics, it is not considered fully reliable for affirming those matters in question.
This is more clearly demonstrated in the book of blessed Gelasius, the bishop of the city of Rome, which is titled: "Decretals on Receiving or Not Receiving Books".
Chapter 14: That the statement of blessed Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, should not be understood as some think
The statement of blessed Athanasius, bishop of the city of Alexandria, which they have inconsistently used, just like other testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, to support their error, is revealed to be completely unrelated to this matter.
It does not mention at all any kind of image worship, but rather compares the subject he was discussing, admitting that images can be restored in the same material and element.
He says: Just as those that are written on wood, once the external dirt is removed, must be restored to the same form, and the image can be renewed in the same material and element.
For by its form, the material itself, on which it is inscribed, is not destroyed, but rather shaped into the same form.
Therefore, let them say that this statement provides support for them.
Let them say where it teaches to worship images.
Since they cannot assert this, it remains to be understood by sound minds in the way the venerable man expressed it.
Chapter 15: That the quote from blessed Ambrose, bishop of Milan, is misused to support a major error
Those who want to use the quote from Blessed Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, which they falsely claim is from Book 3, Chapter 9, to support the worship of images, are easily able to twist the words of holy preachers.
They do not hesitate to distort the divine law and the prophecies, nor do they fear to introduce violence into the teachings of the young to support their error.
They do not even hesitate to insult the teachings of the elders.
Therefore, they are accused of disturbing the order, meaning, and words of the opinion of Blessed Ambrose, priest of the Church of Milan, to favor their error.
In terms of order, because it is not found in Book 3, Chapter 9, as they dream, but in Book 9.
In terms of meaning, because when he said, "Do we worship both His divinity and His flesh and divide Christ?" they said, "Do we worship both His divinity and His flesh and divide Christ?"
The addition of the word "ne" changes the meaning so much that it compels the sentence to confess what it intended to deny.
In terms of words, because in the following clause, where he said "we venerate," they are found to have said "we worship."
To make the meaning of our discussion clearer, let us explain how this opinion, spoken by the famous and eloquent man with spiritual sense, was falsified by them.
He, to affirm the one person of the Lord, true God and true man, in the properties of two natures, said:
"Do we worship both His divinity and His flesh and divide Christ? Do we venerate in Him the image of God and the cross and divide them?"
Those who attempt to support the worship of images from this sentence said:
"Do we worship both His divinity and His flesh and divide Christ? Or, when we worship both the image of God and the cross in Him, do we divide them?"
By the image of God, which is Christ, and by His cross, which in this context is placed for the mortality of His flesh, they obstinately want to introduce the worship of images.
Chapter 16: That non-material images are not adored, but as Augustine said: 'What is the image of God, if not the face of God in which the people of God are sealed?'
John the Apostle says, "No one has ever seen God, except the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father."
And the same supreme majesty said to Moses: "No human can see me and live."
If He is invisible, or rather because He is invisible, it is necessary that He is incorporeal; and if He is incorporeal, it is necessary that He cannot be painted physically.
So, if He is invisible and incorporeal, He cannot be depicted with physical materials at all.
Therefore, we must diligently seek to understand what the image of God is or what His 'face' is, in which the people of God are marked.
Let us ask the distinguished preacher.
Perhaps, being taught by him, we may be able to know what the image of God is.
Tell us, chosen vessel, tell us, teacher of the nations, what the image of God is.
"Thanks be to God the Father," I say, "who has made us worthy to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light, who has delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God."
I spoke about the image, and I also speak about the figure: "In these last days, God has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the worlds, who is the brightness of His glory and the express image of His substance, and upholds all things by the word of His power."
Behold, the Apostle Paul teaches us that Christ is the image of God, and they urge that material images should be understood in this way.
He says that the same Son, who is one in substance with the Father, is the image of God and the brightness of glory and the express image of His substance, while they say that figures prepared by craftsmen are the image of God.
Oh, what a detestable error!
Oh, shameless madness!
Oh, reckless folly, burning with such a love for images that you do not blush to compare what is said of the only-begotten Son of God to material figures!
Let the most holy Augustine also say what the 'image of God' is, who is accused by them of stating that this is material.
For he says: "In God, the condition of time does not apply; for it cannot be rightly said that God generated His Son in time, through whom He created time; and it follows that not only is He His image because He is from Him and His likeness because He is His image, but also equality so great that not even an interval of time is a hindrance."
So you too, most holy Ambrose, tell us what is known to you about this image.
Defend blessed Augustine, who was converted by you to the rudiments of faith through the favor of God, whom you now see being infamously accused by the worshipers of images.
Provide him support so that he may be freed from the burden of such a great accusation, who was once freed by you from the error of heretical dogma.
The prophets, I say, declared that Christ, who is the image of the invisible Father and the figure of His substance, is the brightness of eternal light and the spotless mirror of God’s majesty and the image of His goodness.
Therefore, I will strive to compare my Augustine, indeed a true worshiper of God, with the prophets and apostles in this way.
See how great are the things said: 'brightness,' because the clarity of the paternal light is in the Son; 'spotless mirror,' because the Father is seen in the Son, 'image of goodness,' because not a body in a body, but the virtue is entirely seen in the Son.
The image teaches that He is not dissimilar, the character signifies that He is an exact expression, the brightness signifies eternal light.
Therefore, the image of God is not a physical face, not made up of colors, not of wax, but simple from God, proceeding from the Father, expressed from the source.
Through this image, the Lord showed the Father to Philip, saying, "Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the Father, and how can you say, 'Show us the Father?' Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?"
For he saw the Father in the image, who saw the Son.
See what image he speaks of: this image is clarity, this image is truth, this image is the virtue of God; not mute, because it is the Word; not insensible, but meaningful; not empty, because it is power; not dead, because it is life; not mortal, because it is resurrection.
You see, therefore, that when the image is mentioned, it signifies the Father, whose image is the Son, who is not made by human hands.
It is an image of itself. Since we have approved the image of God not as material images, as some babble, but as the Son of God according to the teachings of the holy fathers, it remains for us to briefly explain how we are marked in Him.
We are therefore marked in Him when, according to the Apostle, we are baptized into His death, anointed with the sacred oil, and receive the privilege of the Christian name, as it is said in the Song of Songs:
"Your name is oil poured out."
Thus, the divine prophecy proclaimed through Isaiah is fulfilled, which says:
"My servants will be called by a new name."
We are therefore marked in Him who, according to the Apostle, has sealed us and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. We are also marked by the Spirit as a guarantee for the day of redemption, and we are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God.
So that both our spirit and soul are impressed with the seal of God, and we receive that image in which we were created in the beginning. Though we have not completely lost it by sinning, it has not remained entirely pure in us, because if we had completely lost it, it would never be said:
"Although man walks in an image, he is still troubled in vain."
And if we had kept it completely pure, the Apostle would never say:
"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
and
"We are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."
Chapter 17: That Gregory of Nyssa's life and preaching are unknown to us, yet his testimonies are used to support their error
What we should observe in this matter, we are taught by the warnings of the apostle Paul, who says:
"Test the spirits to see whether they are from God" (First Corinthians 4:1); and again:
"Do not believe every spirit, but test the mind" (First Corinthians 4:1).
For since, as we have previously stated, the life and preaching of Gregory of Nyssa, bishop, are unknown to us, the testimonies brought forth from his works are seen as less suitable for confirming doubtful matters.
Therefore, his teachings should neither be highly praised by us nor excessively criticized, but his doctrine, along with the doctrines of others whom we do not know, should be set aside.
Instead, after the prophetic and evangelic or apostolic scriptures, we should be content with the doctrines of illustrious Latin teachers whose life and preaching are known to us, or of the Greeks who were also Catholic and were translated by Catholics into our language.
Chapter 18: That the testimony from the Sixth Council does not pertain to image worship
The text of the testimony that they brought from the Sixth Council, in the same nonsensical collection written in favor of worshipping images, is as follows:
In certain paintings of venerable images, the finger of John the Baptist is shown pointing to the lamb, which is a sign left by grace, prefiguring through the law the Lamb, our Lord Christ.
However, although it was not brought forward by them exactly as it appears in that council, nor even as they claimed, it is mentioned that some form of image worship is acknowledged.
But since it has almost no strength in Latin integrity, is weak in meaning, and lacks charm in words and some reason, it is shown to provide no support for their error.
Chapter 19: That John, Bishop of Constantinople's opinion does not support image veneration as claimed
For in that case, there is no mention of those images that are usually found in basilicas, but of those that Roman emperors, through pagan and superstitious rites, arrogantly ordered to be worshiped to show their favor.
We indeed find that none of the ancient kings practiced such sacrilegious impiety, and almost no nation was so subjected to the service of idols and such cruelty, as we read anywhere.
Therefore, it was a great and truly significant cruelty and strength, which was foretold by the prophet Daniel in the interpretation of the four-part statue, which was a prediction of the four strongest kingdoms of the world.
After the golden head, which signified the kingdom of the Assyrians or Chaldeans, the silver chest, which represented the kingdom of the Medes and Persians, the bronze thighs, which showed the Macedonian kingdom, were designated by the iron legs.
And just as iron breaks and subdues everything, so this nearly subdued all kingdoms.
This was also seen by the aforementioned prophet in the vision of the four beasts: after the lion, which showed the Babylonian kingdom, and the bear, which represented the succession of the Medes and Persians, and the leopard, which symbolized the Macedonian kingdom, in the fourth place, just as in the statue with the iron legs, there is also a certain terrifying and dreadful beast described with iron teeth.
It is long to discuss now, in which there are not, as in the other beasts, individual features, but all the signs of cruelty found in the previous ones, devouring the nations it destroyed and trampling underfoot those it subjected to tributes.
It served the worship of demons to such an extent that it miserably adored the idols of some nations it had conquered, joining them with its own idols.
Hence, it is utterly vain and unreasonable to take examples within the holy church from that matter, which is believed by Catholics to be entirely discarded due to the stain of paganism.
Unless perhaps in this part, it is conceded that error is supported by error, and a vain thing has a similarly vain thing as an example, and an oblique matter is thought to obtain sanction from a non-righteous matter.
Therefore, the text of John's opinion - if it is indeed John's - is quoted in the same demented synod reading in this way:
"Do you not know that if someone insults the image of the emperor, the injury is primarily directed at the emperor's dignity?
Do you not know that if someone removes an image made of wood or color, it is not judged as mere material without a soul, but as if an image of the emperor were torn apart, it brings injury to the emperor?
And again, the same father, on the fifth Thursday of Easter:
'All things were made for the glory of God, and for our use: clouds to serve for rain, the earth for abundant fruits, the sea for navigation, and everything serves man without fail, especially the image of God.
Likewise, the imperial cult and images are introduced into cities, and the judges or people obey with praise, not honoring the tablet itself nor the letters inscribed on wax but the figure of the emperor.
So too, creation on earth is not honored for its appearance, but the same figure represents the heavenly Creator.'
This opinion, although it may lack the embellishment of words and the refinement of expressions, and is believed to wander far from the matter to which it is applied, neither provides solace to their assertion nor brings any harm to our side, nor inculcates any division in the senses of Christian religion, especially since we should not stain the character of the divine image in us with evil deeds nor defile it, to whose image and likeness we are made."
We were created in His image and likeness, but by sinning and polluting that image and likeness, we bring injury to it. This can be compared to someone who injures the image of an emperor; it is considered an injury to the emperor himself, not just to his image.
When it is said that the clouds, land, or sea serve the image of the Lord, it does not refer to a man-made, irrational image—if indeed this is what is being said, either by those who claim it or by any Catholic—but rather it refers either to Christ, who is the image of God, to whom every knee in heaven, on earth, and under the earth bends, or to mankind, who was created in the image of God and placed above almost all visible creatures.
If anyone argues that this was said about insensible images, let them explain how and in what manner the clouds, land, and sea serve these images, and they will soon find their assertion largely unsupported. Therefore, if the common people sometimes honor the images of emperors with empty and harmful praises—driven by wild enthusiasm, the novelty of secular pomp, a desire for inflated honor, the vice of flattery, or fear of public authorities—what does that matter to us, who glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to us, and we to the world? Our conversation is in heaven, and with the Apostle we say: "To us, for whom Christ was crucified, what does it matter?" We should resist such error rather than agree with it. We should not only refrain from taking this as an example to worship images, but we should also utterly detest it and those who follow it.
Chapter 20: That Cyril's exposition of Matthew's Gospel does not pertain to image worship
In addition, they claim that the blessed Cyril, bishop of the city of Alexandria, said:
"For faith is depicted, that the Word exists in the form of God, just as in the redemption of our life He was offered to God, in the likeness of man and became human.
Although due to either the inexperience of the interpreter or the fault of the scribe, this seems to have a partial meaning, yet it does not somehow suggest the worship of images.
Nor is there in this any affirmation or even mention of this error, for they say that he later said:
'Images fulfill for us the role of parables signifying virtue, to which both the eyes and tactile marks are applied, holding invisibly in the mind the vision.'"
Since, therefore, this book is not with us, which is said to have been published in Greek by the aforementioned doctor, the meaning of this chapter must be sought by conjecture in the disorganized and improper words, as if one were to seek coins wrapped in dust or in the filth of any material.
For this, as we conjecture, seems to signify the text of this chapter:
that while Christ, existing in the form of God, clothed in the likeness of our flesh and became human and was offered to God for the redemption of our life, in Himself, the true image of the Father, showed us the vision of the same Father according to this:
"Whoever sees me, sees the Father"; and in the imagination of parables, He signified mysteries to our senses in such a way that in the images of those things, the imagination of which they are is somehow shown.
This indeed according to the ambiguity of conjecture.
However, excluding the ambiguities of doubt, it is clear that no worship of images is designated here.
Chapter 21: That those who do not adore images do not contradict the Christian religion
The instruments of the Christian religion are indeed great.
Although they depend on the solidity of faith and the love of God and neighbor, it would take too long to list them all.
Among these, the worship and adoration of images hold no place whatsoever.
This is because they are established by no ancient document or supported by any example, but are almost entirely rejected by the words of the Holy Scriptures.
The powerful trumpet of the entire divine Scripture thunders that we should worship, adore, and glorify only God.
Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious and to fear in every way that, while attempting to introduce the worship and adoration of images into the Christian religion, they might seem to frustrate the unique worship and adoration of the one God.
These two are so mutually opposed that if one stands, the other cannot.
For if the unique worship owed solely to the one God remains unshaken—and indeed it will remain unshaken—then the worship of images will be nullified in every way.
If the worship of images is not overturned, the worship owed solely to the one God will not be unique.
Thus, if the stronghold or defense and glorious insignia of the Christian religion is the worship and adoration of the one God, indeed because it is, to offer this to images or any other things is against the Christian religion.
If not worshiping or venerating these is against the Christian religion, as they claim, then to worship or venerate only God and to acknowledge His worship and adoration as unique would be against the Christian religion.
Therefore, only God is to be worshiped, only He is to be adored, only He is to be glorified, as the prophet says: "His name alone is exalted."
To His saints, who, having triumphed over the devil, now reign with Him either because they fought bravely so that the unshaken state of the Church might reach us, or because they are known to help the same Church with constant prayers and intercessions, veneration should be shown.
But as for images, with all their worship and adoration excluded, whether they are in churches for the memory of events and decoration or not, they can bring no pretext for Catholic faith, since they are known to have no role whatsoever in carrying out the mysteries of our salvation.
Chapter 22: That the good memory of the saints argues against images
"But as for me," says the prophet, "it is good to be near God." Since God is spirit, as it is written: "The Lord God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth," one can only adhere to him spiritually, not physically, and can join him not with bodily senses, but with the rational gaze of the soul. Therefore, as the most holy Augustine says, we are most healthily reminded to turn away from this world, which is indeed material and perceptible, and to turn to God, that is, the truth, which is grasped by the intellect and the inner mind, which always remains the same and does not have a false image that cannot be distinguished from the truth, with all eagerness.
To contemplate Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, or to behold the virtues that are derived from him in his saints, we need not a physical vision, which we share with irrational animals, but a spiritual vision, which the prophet asked the Lord to grant him when he said: "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law." Therefore, when the Lord said: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear," he was seeking this spiritual hearing, not physical ears. The people of Israel were ordered to be deprived of these senses due to the sin of unbelief, not to be physically impaired, when he said to the prophet Isaiah: "Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart."
Given these conditions, those who admit to being overwhelmed by great blindness confess that their memory, called the soul's eye, is so impaired that it needs the support of visual images to prevent them from being diverted from the service of God and the veneration of his saints. They do not consider themselves capable of lifting the eye of the mind above material creation to grasp the eternal light without the aid of physical creation. But lest they attempt to defend their error with these excuses, claiming that we also allow images to be kept for the memory of events, their argument will be shattered by the battering rams of truth. There is a difference between having images out of fear of forgetting, and having them out of love for decoration; between having images willingly and having them out of necessity; between looking at them to avoid forgetting God and his saints, and looking at them to remember past events; between seeing things that, if not seen, do no harm, and those that, if not seen, hinder salvation, since a person can be saved without looking at images, but not without knowledge of God.
Therefore, the human mind should adhere to God, in whose image it was created, without any material intermediaries, to be shaped by the truth, which is Christ. It is most foolish to think that it needs to be reminded with material images to avoid forgetting him, as this indicates a flaw of weakness, not a sign of freedom. As the apostle Paul testifies, the descent of Christ to the underworld, his ascent to heaven, and the fruits of our hope are to be sought not in visible things, but in the heart, when he says: "Hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience." And again: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down) or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does the Scripture say? 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart' (that is, the word of faith which we preach); because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."
Many other relevant and necessary things could be said on this matter in this chapter if brevity, to which we are committed, allowed.
Chapter 23: That Gregory, bishop of Rome, said to adore and not to break images
"Images, whose excessive worship was promoted by Constantine and his mother Helena, as well as Tharasius, the Bishop of Constantinople, and which led to the convening of synods, have provided us with the subject of our current discussion.
Blessed Gregory, Bishop of the city of Rome, prohibited both their worship and their destruction.
He conveyed this clearly and without any ambiguous language to Serenus, Bishop of Marseille, explaining what should be observed and followed in this matter.
For while some are noted for condemning their predecessors or parents who broke these images in an execrable manner, and others are believed to have abominably condemned those who worship these images, the aforementioned bishop positioned himself between these two opposing errors.
He armed both sides in their mutual conflict, striking both those who worship these images and those who broke them with the pointed zeal of his episcopal authority.
By rejecting both the worshippers and the destroyers, he established our church on a moderate path that allows images as ornaments and for remembrance, without worshipping them.
It is reported that the venerable Pope Gregory praised Serenus for prohibiting the worship of images but criticized him for breaking them.
He said: 'It has been reported to me that you, with ill-considered zeal, broke the images of the saints under the pretext that they should not be worshipped.
While we commend you for refusing to worship them, we criticize you for breaking them.'
And further: 'Images should not be broken, as they are placed in churches not for worship but solely to instruct the minds of those who are ignorant.
Since the tradition has reasonably allowed for the depiction of saints' stories in holy places, if you had tempered your zeal with discretion, you could have used these images beneficially for instruction without scattering your gathered flock, but rather bringing them together.'
The same venerable bishop believed that breaking images disturbed the minds of the common people and thus feared causing scandal among the weak.
Therefore, he later instructed that images should be allowed in any church, but worship of them should be avoided at all costs.
He said: 'The diverse members of the church should be gathered and shown the testimony of Holy Scripture, which states that it is not permissible to worship anything made by human hands, as it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve."
Then explain that these images, originally created for the instruction of the unlearned people who could learn from the visual history, have unfortunately become objects of worship, and therefore you were compelled to order their breaking.
Tell them that, if they are used for the original purpose of instruction, which was the reason for their creation, they should be allowed in churches.
However, make it clear that it was not the visual history itself that displeased you, but the inappropriate worship given to these images.
Soften their minds with these words, bring them to your understanding, and if anyone wishes to make images, do not prohibit it, but absolutely avoid the worship of images.'
Thus, we follow the teachings and instructions of the venerable pontiff Gregory, who allows images in churches but absolutely rejects their worship.
Anyone who either breaks or worships images should recognize that they are opposing his teachings."
Chapter 24: That only blessed Peter said to adore images, and that images are adored with charity and salvation
Since nothing other than God alone should be worshiped, it's one thing to honor a person out of love and respect, and another to honor man-made images.
We must believe that God loved the human race so much that, at the very beginning of its creation, He made it not just anyhow, but in His own image and likeness.
He gave humans priority over other creatures and, even though they were transferred from the joy of paradise to the troubles of this mortal life due to sin, He did not cease to instruct them through amazing miracles and clear prophecies over time.
He did this even for the angels who had fallen away from Him by sinning and were punished with eternal damnation, in order to once again join humans with the heavenly citizens they were meant to be with.
The Apostle says: “For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants.”
From this, it is clear that it is one thing to honor a person out of respect, given their many merits, and another to honor images, which lack such merits.
It's one thing to show respect to a person, a work of God, and another to an image, a work of an artist.
It's one thing to honor the nature that angels and archangels worship in the King of Heaven, and another to honor something used by humans and animals.
Just as God’s works surpass human works, and rational beings surpass irrational ones, so too does the act of honoring people out of humility and respect surpass the act of worshiping images superstitiously and unnecessarily.
God commanded us to love people, not images.
He sent His Son into the world for people, not for images.
He wants to be called Father by people, not by images.
And the Lord in the Gospel does not say: “Do not cause one of these images to stumble,” but “one of these little ones,” because their angels always see the face of my Father in heaven.
The Apostle urges us to honor each other, not to honor images.
Since the creator is higher than his creation and the maker is superior to his works, the Book of Wisdom testifies: “For no human being can create a god like himself; since he is mortal, he creates something dead with wicked hands. He is better than what he worships because he lives, even though he is mortal, while the other never lives.”
And blessed Augustine says: “I admit that those who believe human works to be gods are more deeply misguided than those who believe God's works to be gods.”
This concerns idols and their worshipers.
But as for those within the holy church who preach that only God should be worshiped according to sacred scripture and yet call councils to worship images, they should be careful not to disturb domestic peace with internal conflict and to stain our prosperity with this error like a civil war.
They can easily avoid this by staying within the boundaries of prophetic, evangelical, and apostolic preaching and being content with the teachings of the holy fathers without introducing new doctrines.
Chapter 25: That the apostles never established image worship
The standard of ecclesiastical instruction from the prophets and apostles, or from the Lord Himself, is sometimes recommended to us by words, sometimes shown by examples, sometimes revealed by hidden, sometimes by open oracles, and sometimes taught by figurative, sometimes by straightforward speeches. Among all these, the worship of all things is prohibited, except for prayer, with which we mutually greet each other, and the worship of God alone is instituted.
For those who are consumed by the love of images claim that this worship was handed down by the apostles, they must say by what examples it was established and by what teachings it is proven to have been promulgated. Did Peter establish this worship, who gently restrained Cornelius from worshipping him? Did John, who, desiring to worship the angel, was told not to do so, but to worship God instead? Did Paul, who was horrified by the Lycaonians' superstitious attempts to worship him? Or Barnabas, who, along with Paul, rejected it? Since angels and apostles forbid being worshipped, who is so foolish and insane to dare to say that they instituted the worship of images, especially considering that, even if they should be worshipped, angels and humans are of different merits and definitions, and so are their images.
If, therefore, angels or humans, as the reason of the present example teaches, are not to be worshipped, except for the worship exhibited in the duty of charity and greeting, much less are images, which lack reason and are neither worthy of greeting nor worship because they are insensate, to be worshipped. If they are not to be worshipped, indeed because they are not, those who do so commit a double fault, whether because they worship them or because they falsely claim that this was handed down by the apostles.
The apostle Paul - the evangelical innkeeper who received from the guardian of all the task of healing the human race, which had departed from the vision of the heavenly homeland and fallen into the pits of this defection and been wounded by evil spirits, with gentle and stern words of preaching, to whom the Redeemer granted the money of double knowledge, that is, of the two Testaments, and promised to repay him if he gave any advice for the formation of the redeemed people - neither in the commands he freely gave nor in the advice he gave beyond the commands, as he is said to have done regarding virgins, is found to have instituted or commanded anything about the worship of images, as they dream.
For the same teacher of the nations, when writing to his disciples Timothy and Titus, instructing and teaching them about the ordination of bishops, presbyters, and deacons and all ecclesiastical discipline, or about spiritual conduct and avoiding heretics, did not institute the worship of images because he recognized it to be alien to Christian religion. And in the other letters he wrote to the whole world, teaching what should be avoided and what should be followed, he completely disregarded this matter, believing it neither a mistake to be denied nor a virtue to be established.
Therefore, those who claim that not worshipping these images is a crime, but that worshipping them was among the first sacraments of faith instituted by the apostles, should consider that the same vessel of election neither counts despising them among sins, when he says:  "The works  of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, impurity, indecency, luxury, idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife, jealousy, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like, of which I forewarn you, as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God," nor does he count worshipping them among the spiritual fruits, when he says: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law." And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
Deriving from a rhetorical flow, he begins by distributing through various streams, across the body, in both broken and graceful circuits, starting from the anaphora and running through the concatenation of names. He contrasts opposites with opposites through the argumentation of topics, which philosophers call "from contraries," adorning his speech with the most beautiful antitheses.
Here, he declares this life’s acceptable time, suitable for penance, and the day of salvation, that is, suitable for doing good, making, among other virtues he enumerates, a slight or brief mention of the adoration of images.
For he says:
"Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed, but in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; in purity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
In this catalog of virtues, as we have stated before, the same distinguished preacher would have included the adoration of images if he deemed it beneficial and profitable to the church. However, he refrained from listing it because he did not perceive it to be useful.
Chapter 26: That equating man-made images with the Ark of the Covenant is a significant error
It is a great absurdity, indeed rashness, to attempt to equate images with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
For they are known to differ by many signs of mysteries, and to compare a thing that was made by the command of the Lord with things that are made by the will of any craftsman.
For the Ark was made by the command of the Lord, while these things are made with the help of art; the Ark by the holy man Moses, these by any artisan; the Ark by a lawgiver, these by a painter; the Ark is full of mysteries, these only with the colors of paint:
The Ark was a source of wonder at present miracles and signified certain mystical and secret things about the future, while these things, devoid of both present miracles and future significations, only bring to mind the memory of the things they represent.
The typical prefigurations of the Ark and its contents were shown in the previous book: now, however, it must be briefly explained how much it differs from man-made images.
Therefore, those who try to equate the material images made by any craftsmen with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, which was made by the command of the Lord and the obedience of Moses, should find, if they can, a craftsman who can equal Moses in merit.
Moses, who was exposed to the river's currents, whose safety was left to God alone among the flowing waters, who was taken up and returned to his mother and then cared for most luxuriously by those who had ordered his death.
He was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, who saw the branches of a tree burning but not consumed, who admired the fragile material enduring a marvelous fire without any damage, or rather from which a voice called out to him by name and gave him mystical commandments and the hope of freeing his people and attaining the paternal promise.
He was amazed at his rod turning into a serpent, whose administration inflicted ten prodigious plagues upon the Nile-dwellers, who, enriched with the wealth of the Egyptians, led those crossing the sea dry-shod.
He turned bitter waters into sweet flavor and compelled a dry rock to pour out abundant water with a strike of his rod, who by raising his hands caused hostile tumult to be defeated and granted victory to his people.
He, terrified and trembling amid the terrifying sound of trumpets, lightning flashes, dense cloud cover, and crackling fires, ascended the mountain, received the law, and showed the people the commandments promulgated by the Lord as a true mediator between God and men.
He made the tabernacle according to the pattern shown to him on the mountain, which, when he entered, was covered by the glory of the Lord, who was the meekest of all who dwell on the earth, to whom God spoke face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.
For forty days, he lacked all food and drink, whose face shone with such brightness that it could hardly be looked at, who triumphed marvelously over two kings, who, even after 120 years, did not suffer dimmed eyesight or loss of dental vigor.
He could make an image from any material that overflows with mysteries and sacraments, from whose surface dreadful oracles are heard, before whom hostile armies quake with terror and rivers dry up to provide a path for those crossing.
The walls of an ancient city fall instantly to provide entry to the conquering legions, which is called the footstool of our God, at whose entrance the region of enemies is struck with terrifying scourges, which untamed cows, leaving their calves behind, drag to the land of Israel in the yoke of a new cart, at whose return the natives are terrified by astounding miracles.
Before which the noble prophet and crowned king dances with great exultation without shame and brings it to the destined place with musical harmonies and sweet hymns.
Although the smith and the workman have displayed such remarkable skills in crafting so many signs, it is not unreasonable to compare it to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
Since neither a craftsman of such great merit nor a work of such glory can be found, it follows that people of our age should place the lawgiver and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, with its handmade images, above all else and not try to compare such worthless things, so devoid of mysteries, to something so sublime and rich with the signs of so many mysteries.
For if, as they have said, the images can be likened to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, it is necessary that there be something around them that could be likened to the mercy seat. And it is necessary that fearful oracles be issued from there. However, no oracles are issued from there; therefore, as they foolishly claim, the images cannot be likened to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
Chapter 27: That equating images to the body and blood of the Lord is a great rashness and absurdity
When the Lord says in the Gospel: "True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth," we are amazed by the madness of those who have become so foolish in worshiping images that, although it is evident that they neither have spirit nor truth, they not only worship them but also dare to equate them with the body and blood of the Lord, saying:
"Just as the body and blood of the Lord transition from the fruits of the earth to a significant mystery, so too do images crafted by the skill of artists transition to the veneration of the persons whose likeness they embody."
Clearly, the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord, given to us by the same Mediator of God and men, is made by the hand of the priest and the invocation of the divine name for the commemoration of His passion and our salvation.
Images, however, needing no mystery of imposition or consecration by any hand, are only formed and crafted by those experienced in the art of painting or skilled in the creation of colors, or by those who, with known expertise in some form of craft, shape the likeness of faces by understanding the material.
Surely, for the consecration of these, the priest, with the prayers of the surrounding people, adds his own prayers with an internal groan, commemorating the Lord's passion, resurrection from the dead, and most glorious ascension into heaven.
He asks that these be carried by the hand of an angel to the sublime altar of God and before the sight of majesty.
The painter, however, seeking a suitable place for completing his work, looks only for the beauty of colors and the completion of the work in the formation of these.
Therefore, it is far, very far from the path of truth, reason, and discretion to attempt to equate images with the body and blood of the Lord.
For Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, is read to have offered not an image but bread and wine in the type of the Lord's body and blood.
And by the mouth of Moses, in the prefiguration of our Redeemer, whose flesh we take for the remission of sins and whose blood we use to evade the blow of the striking angel, the lamb is commanded to be eaten by families, and the use of images to be worshiped or adored is entirely rejected.
The Psalmist likewise sang with a sweet melody about the bread of angels—that is, Christ—to be eaten by men, and the creators of images to be similar to those images they create.
The Author of the human race Himself, who for our salvation did not disdain to take on flesh for our sake, when establishing the end of the Old Testament and the saving beginning of the New as His most sacred passion approached, and connecting the two opposing walls in Himself as the cornerstone, and making both one according to the Apostle, took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave this saving command to His disciples:
"Take and eat; this is my body."
Similarly, after supper, He took the cup, gave it to His disciples, saying:
"Take and drink. This is the cup of my blood, of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me."
Therefore, since the Church holds the clear and most sacred mystery of this, both through the mystical figures of the Old Testament and the saving institution of the New, the most insolent use of worshiping images is not to be equated with it.
This practice is not only not commanded but is even forbidden by the pages of the Old Testament and not only not allowed but also reproved in the New Testament.
For He who said: "My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink" and "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him" did not say: "My image is true life" and "The painting attributed to my name is true salvation," nor did He say: "Whoever paints my likeness and worships my image."
Manufactured, in me finance and I in him.
And he said: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. He did not say: Unless you paint my image and adore the likeness made by painting, you will not have life in you.
He who said: I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats of this bread will not die, but will have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day:
And again: As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me:
And again: This is the true bread of God, which came down from heaven and gives life to the world. Whoever eats it will live forever, and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.
Whoever believes in me will never be hungry or thirsty.
Nothing like this is said about images, when obviously, he established the commemoration of his most holy passion not in the works of art, but in the consecration of his body and blood. Nor did he decree faith and confession to be made in pictures, but in the mouth and heart, as the Scripture says: With the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
For when he says: If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, he clearly shows that it is not images that should remain in us and we in images, but we in him through faith and his words in us through the study of reading and the completion of works.
Paul, the apostle, a chosen vessel, seeing that the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood should not be equated with every sacrament but should be preferred above almost all, says: Let a person examine themselves and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
For whoever eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment upon themselves.
Therefore, when he shows that those who come to partake of these things should be examined with such diligence, and that those who come negligently and unworthily to receive these things are struck with such a great penalty, he does not bring forth anything similar about those who avoid the worship of images, but on the contrary, he says about those who misuse images: And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image resembling corruptible man, and so on.
Therefore, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood differs greatly and beyond what can be comprehended by the mind's eye from images painted by the art of painters.
Since the former is made by the invisible working of the Spirit of God, while the latter is visibly made by the hand of an artist;
The former is consecrated by a priest with the invocation of the divine name, while the latter are painted by a painter with human artistic skill;
The former is carried on high to God's altar by angelic hands, while the latter are set on a wall by human hands for the gaze of admirers;
Through the former, sins are forgiven, through the latter, if used carelessly, they are increased;
The former has a power that neither grows nor diminishes in any way, while the latter increase in beauty according to the artist's skill and also diminish in a certain way;
The former is confirmed by new antiquity and ancient newness, while the latter are often corrupted by decaying old age;
The former is life and nourishment for souls, while the latter are only food for the eyes;
The former leads through faith to the entrance of the heavenly kingdom, while the latter bring the memory of past deeds through sight;
The former could not be abolished by the church even in persecutions, while the latter sometimes have their color washed away by rain;
And since without the reception of the former no one can be saved, while without the observation of the latter all who have the right faith can be saved, it is clear that they are not to be equated with such a great mystery by anyone who has a sound mind.
Therefore, those who strive to bind all who lack the worship of images with the bond of anathema must be asked what they think of the apostles, whom no series of Catholic Scripture teaches to have worshipped images anywhere.
And yet no faithful person doubts that they not only entered the heavenly kingdoms, but even surpassed them.
What then of the martyrs, who immediately after baptism through the hands of executioners migrated to the heavenly kingdoms without the worship of images?
What then of infants, who, freed from original sin?
Through the washing of regeneration, they were cleansed. Even though they were not yet able to do anything of the sort through their bodily senses, they almost desired the heavenly kingdom before seeking the ability of earthly steps.
If, according to their very false opinion, all who lack the worship of images perish, infants who have been washed in the waters of baptism and fed with the body and blood of the Lord, who have not yet been able to worship images and thus depart from the world, perish.
And if they perish, the word of Truth is void, which says:
"Let the little children come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
However, the word of Truth promising the kingdom of heaven to infants is not void. Therefore, not all who lack the worship of images perish.
Chapter 28: How the Mystery of the Lord's Cross differs from images
It is worth briefly explaining how vastly the mystery of the Lord's cross, in its many excellences and notable virtues, surpasses man-made images, which some people rashly try to equate with it, even though it cannot be fully expressed by our words.
For it was by this banner, not by images, that the ancient enemy was defeated.
It was with these weapons, not with colors, that the devil was overcome.
By this cross, not by paintings, the gates of hell were left desolate.
By this cross, not by those images, humanity was redeemed.
On the cross, not in images, the price of the world was paid.
It was the cross, not an image, that served as the instrument for the Lord's sacrifice.
This is the insignia of our king, not some painting, which our armies gaze upon without ceasing.
This is the sign of our emperor, not a combination of colors, which our cohorts follow into battle.
Therefore, it is not a mere material image but the mystery of the Lord's cross that is the banner we must follow on the battlefield so that we may fight more valiantly.
The armor by which we can protect our freedom; the fortification by which we can avoid the attacks of hostile enemies.
It is the helmet that deflects the blows of the devil's sword; the shield that opposes his missile darts; the breastplate that frustrates the fiery impact of his spears or arrows.
This is the wisdom by which we can see through his winding deceptions and cunning devices, so that he cannot overcome those he tempts, whom he once held captive by the persuasion of the first man.
It is through the wood of the cross, not through images, that the ancient crime, contracted through the use of wood in the first man, is washed away.
On the cross, not in some painting, the author of sin was captured and, not by domination but by reason, not by power but by justice, was compelled to vomit the prey he had long held.
Therefore, it is not through material images created by craftsmen, but through the mystery of the cross—considered a scandal by Jews and foolishness by Gentiles—that the proud and inflated wisdom of the world is overthrown.
It was not through some painting but through the cross that it was revealed how much wiser the foolishness of God is than human wisdom, and how much stronger the weakness of God is than human strength.
Let us, then, ask the teacher of the Gentiles, let us ask the distinguished preacher, whether he glories in images or in the cross of Christ.
"Far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world," he says.
Let him also declare whether he has been crucified to images or to the cross to live for God.
"I have been crucified with Christ," he says; "it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
Let him also tell us whether, to comprehend the breadth and length, height and depth of the cross, we need to have untainted eyes of the heart, rather than understanding the hues of colors and forms of images or the qualities of materials.
"That you may comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth," he says.
In explaining these words of such a great preacher, we should neither presumptuously display our own understanding nor steal from others, but should adopt the interpretations we find in the books of blessed Augustine on Christian doctrine.
Therefore, the breadth is the transverse wood to which the hands are extended; the height is the part that extends upward from the transverse wood, where the head was; the length is the part that begins from the transverse wood and goes down to the ground; and the depth is that part which is fixed into the ground and hidden.
From this wood of the cross, the entire life of the saints is described, who, taking up their cross and mortifying their earthly members, follow Christ.
As their outer man perishes, their inner man is renewed day by day, and rejoicing in the hope of eternal rest, they persist with joy in good works.
This joy is signified by the breadth of the cross at the transverse wood, where the hands are fixed.
For through the hands, work is understood; through the breadth, joy.
The clarity of the one working, because sadness creates distress. Moreover, by the height of the cross, which has a head attached, the expectation of eternal reward from God's lofty judgment is signified. Good works are believed to be done not for earthly and temporal benefits from God, but rather for what faith hopes for from above, which works through love.
By the length through which the entire body is extended, patience is signified, so that we remain patient, from which those who endure are called patient. By the depth, that is, the part of the wood that is fixed in the hidden earth, but from there arises everything that is prominent, the unfathomable judgments of God are indicated. Through His hidden will, man is called to the participation of such grace, one in this way, another in that.
But why do we spend so much time on the words of the apostles? Why do we wander so much through the vast fields of their meanings? Let us come to the Lord, let us sit with Mary at His feet, let us hear the word from His mouth. Let us hear Him in Himself, whom we have heard speaking through the Apostle until now!
We have heard, therefore, what the teacher of the nations has said about the cross. Let us hear what the Creator of the nations says. We have heard the distinguished preacher, let us hear the Creator of all things! He said, "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
Oh, wondrous command! Oh, life-giving exhortation! Oh, vital thunder! You said it, O source of light. You said it, O origin of goodness, that by putting off the old man with his deeds, we deny ourselves and each take up his cross and crucify ourselves to the world and the world to us. Through bodily afflictions and the mortification of our members, which are on the earth, we live for you or rather you live in us. You exalted the mystery of the cross so much, that you, through it, emptied principalities and powers and all the arrogance of the world. In the name of the cross, which is to be carried by those who follow you daily, you designated the ardor of your love and the rewards of other virtues!
Also, say what is commanded about images, which indeed the sacred cross strives to equal, "Render," I say, "to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." Therefore, if we must take up the cross and follow you, who through the cross triumphantly joined earthly things to heavenly things, and render the image of Caesar to Caesar, images are not to be equated with the cross, not worshiped, not revered, but left to this world with other things that are of the world. You alone are to be worshiped, you alone are to be followed, you alone are to be revered, who reigns perpetually in the unity of substance with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
Chapter 29: That Tarasius presumptively equates images with sacred vessels
Anyone who is easily deceived in great matters will certainly be deceived in small ones; nor is it surprising if he inevitably suffers the blows of very small and almost invisible errors, who cannot avoid the large and easily avoidable impulses of errors. So why is it surprising if Tarasius and the synod, over which he presided, try to equate images with sacred vessels, since they attempt to equate them with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and everything in and around it, as well as with the mystery of the Lord's Cross and the most evident and fitting sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord for our salvation?
Indeed, this error of equating these sacred vessels could greatly astonish him if he were not already so far gone in error. Therefore, the divine instruments of the law show how much more excellent the vessels dedicated to divine worship are than images. For these were instituted and established by the Lord’s command through Moses in the Tabernacle of Testimony, and later established and dedicated in the Temple of Jerusalem by the most holy David through Solomon, signifying the hidden meanings of types and bearing the duty of long service in matters pertaining to the worship of God.
However, these images, whether cherubim or oxen and lions, which were not made for worship but for the signification of future things, were not only not instituted or dedicated by any of the saints but are almost universally repudiated by the testimonies of nearly all the oracles of divine law. These vessels, which the holy Church holds for performing the mysteries of our redemption, are always necessary for the faithful and always useful in divine worship.
Therefore, sacrifices are offered to God in vessels, not in images. Incense, lamps, and other things fitting for divine worship are dedicated in vessels, not in images. Even if there are some images on the vessels, they are not there to be worshiped or because the gift of sacred charismata could become worthless without them, but to make the appearance of the materials more beautiful.
Finally, without images, the water of baptism and the anointing of sacred oil can be received, incense can be burned, holy places can be illuminated by lamps, and the consecration of the body and blood of the Lord can be effected. But without vessels, never. For even the author of our salvation, when he set the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New, is said to have taken not an image but a cup; and through the prophet, the Lord does not say, "Be clean, you who bear images," but "Be clean, you who bear the vessels of the Lord."
Therefore, the king of Babylon was not reproved for any offense against an image, but because he took the vessels used in divine worship, which his ancestor had brought from Judea and placed in the temples of his idols, out of the temples during a feast and used them for human purposes, and, struck with the astonishment of a prophetic miracle, heard what was to come to him and felt the loss of his life and kingdom among the hostile forces. Those who know the prophets understand what we are saying.
Chapter 30: Against those who equate images with divine Scripture for veneration and faith
If this error, which tries to equate images with the books of divine Scripture, is compared to their other errors, although it is of great enormity in itself, it is undoubtedly found to be lesser when compared to others, by which they have tried to equate images with the Ark of the Lord, the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord, and the mystery of the cross.
Especially since neither the former nor the latter can rightly be equated; since the former were preordained before ages by the highest and secret foreknowledge of God, and through the moments of ages were granted for the benefit of human salvation by the manifestation of elements, having holy and venerable men as authors, shining with the lamps of virtues and the insignia of miracles, or certainly the Lord Himself, who granted the mystery of His body and blood or the sacrament of the cross for our salvation.
But the latter were brought forth by the vanity of pagan authors and provide no manifestation of salvation, no sacramental prerogative for mortals, but only please the eyes, through which the memory of past deeds is entrusted to the heart, as through certain messengers.
At that time when Moses lived with the people of God in the wilderness, and at the command of the Lord was teaching the doctrine of the sacred law and the most sacred rites of ceremonies to the people, and was educating the human race in the worship of God, Cecrops the Fifth, a certain king of the Athenians, seduced by demonic poison, incited the minds of the pagan ignorant to the worship of images and idols and the cults of false gods.
While the people of God received the commandments of life, he was preparing the souls of the deceived with the cup of eternal death and the seeds of long-lasting error.
About whom Sedulius says:
"To those whom deadly evil, to those given over to vain cares, the harmful doctrine of Cecrops' Athens creeps in."
Hence the use of images, which grew from pagan traditions, ought not and cannot be equated with the books of sacred law, because in these books, not in images, we learn the instruction of spiritual doctrine.
For the Apostle Paul does not say: "Whatever is painted is painted for our instruction," but says: "Whatever is written is written for our instruction, so that through the patience and consolation of the Scriptures we might have hope in God."
Nor does he say: "All painting," but: "All Scripture is divinely inspired and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."
Finally, on the fiftieth day after the sacrifice of the lamb and the crossing of the Red Sea, the Lord, descending on Mount Sinai, gave the law to Moses, not painted, but written, and on stone tablets delivered not images, but letters, which are considered to be signs of things or symbols of words.
Likewise, Moses taught the origin of the world not by painting but by writing, and all that he learned through the spirit of prophecy, whether about past events, such as the beginning of the world, the creation of man, the flood, or other patriarchal histories in order, or about things happening in his present time, such as those things done by Balaam and Balak or others who were absent from him, or about future events inspired by the Holy Spirit, such as the transgression of the Jewish people, their captivity, or the coming of Christ, he recorded in five books not by painting but by writing, as commanded by the Lord for future ages.
Nor is it written about him: "Moses received paintings," but: "Moses received the book and read it in the ears of the people."
Hence the Apostle writes: "For when every command of the law had been read by Moses to all the people," and shortly after: "He also sprinkled the book and all the people," so that we may know that the lawgiver used not deceitful paintings but most beneficial Scriptures.
Joshua also, the successor of Moses, who crossed the Jordan with the people of God on dry ground and, after overthrowing the kings of the Canaanite people, divided the land of promise by lot to the children of Israel, and bore the figure of the Mediator between God and men...
When the rites of the old law had been completed, through baptism, he led the people of God to the promised land. With the tyrannies of sins or aerial powers overthrown, he granted the faithful the estates of the heavenly homeland. He recorded all the things that happened to him or the people he led in his time, committing them to the memory of posterity by writing rather than painting.
Samuel, too, a man of great sanctity and excellence, who was granted to his mother after persistent prayer and served in the Lord's tabernacle from his infancy in the prophetic ministry, left a model in appointing kings. He recorded the histories of the Judges, Ruth, and even the Kings up to David not with images but with writings.
And after him, the deeds of David and other kings were written down, either by kings or by prophets of that time, up to Jeremiah. Jeremiah collected all the histories of the kings into one, producing the Book of Kings, which has come down to us not through paintings but through writings.
Likewise, each of the prophets who have books recorded their prophecies not in pictures but in writings for future generations.
Daniel, too, understood in books the number of years that the people of God would be held in Babylonian captivity. He said, "I, Daniel, understood in the books the number of years about which the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet."
David, the saintly prophet, who spoke about Christ's incarnation, birth, passion, death, resurrection, glory, and kingdom, was preferred to the other fathers in the genealogy of the Lord's humanity so that the Lord might be called the Son of David. He sang about Christ more abundantly and openly than the others. It is written, "In the scroll of the book, it is written about me." He did not say "painted" but "written," nor "on the walls" or "on tablets," but "in the scroll of the book."
In the beginning of the book of Genesis, which is certainly the head of all books, it is written: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." By "beginning," it means the Son. He indeed responded to the Jews who asked who he was: "I am the beginning, who also speaks to you."
This can also be understood in the verse of the first psalm, which starts with the incarnation of Christ. Through the definition of the eighth species, which dialecticians call "apophasis" or "denial of the contrary," it demonstrates that Christ did not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, meaning he did not have the detestable thoughts that humanity claims for itself. He did not stand in the way of sinners, meaning he completely avoided sinful actions. Coming into the world, he passed through the world's vices with an immaculate life. He did not sit in the seat of pestilence, meaning he did not spread the venom of pestilential doctrines but healed the wounds of the world with his medicinal preaching.
This psalm, which is the head of the book and in whose head it is written about Christ, is without a title, either because nothing should be put before our head, which is Christ, who is the true beginning, or because this psalm holds the place of the title and preface for the other psalms. Although other psalms say much about Christ, none speaks so fully about his incarnation as this one.
In times past, his behavior on earth speaks so clearly. Anyone who defines him through the eighth type of definitions, by what he did not do, will immediately move to the second type of definitions, called "notion" by the artigraphis enneomatiee+, and by what he did, as if by certain signs called into knowledge, not what he is, but what he did, specifically indicating by saying: But his delight was in the law of the Lord, and so forth.
However, since we have been led astray from the cause by the sweetness of the chapter of the book a little further along, it remains that we return to the topic at hand.
Let us now come to the Gospels! Let us see whether the evangelists or the Lord himself mentioned images or Scriptures? For the evangelist says: As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet. He said "written," not "painted." And in a book, not "on some material." And the same Lord and our Redeemer, while destroying the schemes of the ancient enemy or in many places of his preaching, is said to have presented examples of Scriptures, not paintings.
And when a woman caught in the act of adultery was brought to him by a crowd, and the Pharisees, full of deceitful reasoning, which is called inevitable by the teachers of secular letters, avoiding the horns of the dilemma, who neither would be cruel and consent to the shedding of blood by ordering the stoning of the adulteress according to the severity of the legal rigor, nor a transgressor of the law and supporter of sinners by ordering her to be released contrary to the sentence of the law. But just and gentle, he gravely struck them with the weapon of his proposition as a heavenly philosopher. They, fearing to hear their own crimes, left one after another, and it is said that he did not paint with his finger in the earth, but wrote, so that, with whose finger the law was written on stone to signify the hardness of the hearts of the Jews, with the same finger the evangelical law would be written in the hearts of the Gentiles, which, receiving the seeds of the divine word, bring forth worthy fruits daily to their Creator.
Thus, through the stone tablets, the rigor of the Old Testament and the hardness of the Israelite nation, and through the earth written by the Lord's finger, the soft hearts of the Gentiles and the sweetness of the New Testament were indicated.
Finally, the apostles, about whom it was said through the prophet: How beautiful are the feet of those who announce peace and preach salvation. They went forth weeping, sowing their seeds, who, through many temporal tribulations, sowed the seeds of the divine word and will return with rejoicing at the general judgment, bringing sheaves – that is, the peoples converted to the teachings of faith through their preaching. They are read to have sent letters to various parts of the world, not images; nor did they call back humankind from the worship of idols to the purity of true faith through paintings, but through writings, by which the Redeemer opened their understanding, not to understand paintings, but scriptures.
For it is written: Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. It is also read in the gospel: Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that, believing, you may have life in his name. John, who, drawing the heavenly nectar streams from the bosom of the Lord, offered the heavenly cups to thirsty hearts, when he was exiled to the island of Patmos by Caesar’s orders and received the taste of the Lord’s cup promised to him before, and, filled with heavenly mysteries, heard or saw certain secrets revealed by the Lord, was ordered to write these in a book, not to paint them. And he admonished the seven churches, representing one holy, catholic, and apostolic church, filled with the sevenfold grace of the Spirit, not by painting, but by writing. For it was said to him by the thunderous voice from above: What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches.
Hence, it is understood that writings, not paintings, are given for the instruction of our faith. How then it is unwise and irrational to...
Just as we keep the books of the Holy Scriptures for remembrance and veneration,
so too do we keep images for the same purpose.
Anyone who has knowledge of the Holy Scriptures can easily understand this.
In them are found the weapons with which we fight against adversities,
suppress vices, raise virtues, control the desires of gluttony through vigilance and heartfelt compunction,
restrain fornication with contrition of heart and bodily affliction,
through the insistence of prayers, exercise of labor, fear of punishments, or the love of the eternal homeland;
overcome envy with the love of brotherly affection and the desire for the heavenly kingdom,
which can only be attained by those who are in harmony;
break anger with the seriousness of the most modest patience and the power of reason and equanimity;
drive out avarice with alms and the hope of eternal reward;
dispel sadness with brotherly conversations, constant readings, and prayers;
ward off arrogance with the fear of losing virtues, without which they cannot be held,
and the approach of vain glory, which is the enemy of virtues;
crush pride with the fear of diabolical ruin and the example of Christ's humility.
In them are found the tools of the fruits of justice, that is, charity, joy, peace, patience, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty, and self-control.
In them is found the remedy by which neither the wise, boasting in their wisdom, nor the strong, trusting in their strength, are lost,
nor the simple or weak are cast down in their inability;
by which neither excessive joy exalts the happy nor excessive grief affects the sad;
by which neither the wealth of the rich makes them proud nor the need of the poor crushes them.
In them is found the standard by which it is established how prelates should act towards their subjects and subjects towards their prelates,
how marriages are to be loved, how secular matters are to be handled with prudent deliberation,
how the homeland is to be defended, enemies repelled, and the administration of both foreign and domestic affairs conducted.
To sum it up briefly, in them are contained both the perpetual nourishment of the soul and the teachings and wisdom for present life,
which are the adornment of life, and the instructions for eternal life.
It is indeed a treasure lacking no good, overflowing with all goods, to which anyone who devoutly approaches,
whatever they faithfully seek, they happily find they have acquired.
If anyone is delighted by the love of worldly wisdom and secular learning, let them come to the storerooms of the divine law.
Just as the wise of the world are distinguished by the height of their merits, so too does it precede in time and the depths of liberal studies.
What they know, they will be glad to have known, and what they do not know, they will be glad to have found.
There they will find the decorum of correct speech, the etymologies of names, the varieties of figures of speech, and the perplexities of tropes.
As the blessed Augustine says:
"Let the learned know the modes of speaking, which the grammarians call tropes by the Greek name, were used by the authors of the Holy Scriptures.
These tropes, that is, modes of speaking, when recognized, bring some help in understanding the holy letters.”
They will also find histories and meters, which all properly belong to the art of grammar.
But perhaps someone will say:
"I do not find the scansions of meters and the precise measures of times there.”
Let them recognize that there are many meters and many rhythms in the Holy Scriptures,
but the translation of language does not allow the intervals of times in the foreign language to be the same as in the original,
although it retains the same meanings and properties of things.
For if someone repays us gold, it does not matter much if it is not of the same coin as what was received,
as long as it is of the same weight and brightness.
As we have learned from the teachings of the blessed Jerome, an expert in the Hebrew language,
some of the Holy Scripture runs in dactyl and spondee, some in anapest, and some in iambic according to the strictness of the art.
There too, you will find the brilliance and abundance of eloquence, the types and statuses of causes;
there the beginnings, by which listeners become benevolent, teachable, or attentive;
there the narrations, both open and brief, closed and long, which are only...
When the Holy Spirit reveals, things are opened; there are conclusions where the nature of things is shown, arguments that stir the hearts of listeners to fulfill what is being said. There are laws or judgments, great things expressed grandly, small things modestly, and moderate things with restraint. There you will find personification, character portrayal, and all the figures of speech taught by rhetoricians, and many more, grander ones that you will be glad to have understood, which neither the schools of grammar nor rhetoric could reach.
There too you will find introductions that usefully guide the reader in investigating things; categories that excel in the usefulness of predicates for investigating things; definitions or ways of syllogisms that affirm with subtle investigation those things in doubt. Topics that, being sources of meanings and origins of words, provide arguments commonly to grammarians, poets, orators, and even philosophers, which not only adhere to scholarly speech but also to common and conversational speech.
For although speech may be conversational or common, if it is used for any practical purpose of life, it will come to topics. Through these, as through certain teachings, local rules are found by which one cannot or should not stray. In these too, you will recognize that you have found the limits that are difficult to transgress without loss of meaning. And to say it briefly, all speech, unless it comes to topics, will undoubtedly remain indefinite.
There you will find interpretations, whose intricate paths and detailed diversions reveal the depth of meanings and the affirmation of doubts, and from which arises the forest of syllogisms and other arguments, all of which are properly the art of dialectics. There, in numbers through the art of arithmetic, you will find the secrets and depths of meanings, since the same Scripture says that God made everything in measure, number, and weight.
There too you will find not only the harmonies of music and the instruments that many of the holy fathers used, but also the inventor. You will also find the locations and dimensions of lands, which are properly the art of geometry. Moreover, the courses and positions of some stars, the variations of times, months, and years, or the cycles of hours, even the day and cause of the condition of stars, which are properly the art of astronomy, will be found there by any diligent person.
But perhaps someone will say: Neither the names of the principal disciplines nor the individual parts of each discipline nor the members of each part are found in the sacred writings. To which it should be briefly replied that everything can be found in the vast fields of the holy Scriptures in parts, which writers of arts have placed in the rows of their gardens. They are found, I say, in the power of meanings, not in the proclamation of words; in the depths of roots, not in the falling of leaves. For in the depth of the divine Scriptures, the liberal arts are perceived by the diligent, just as wines in vines, crops in seeds, leaves in roots, fruits in branches, and the sizes of trees are contemplated in their cores.
Clearly, the divine Scripture is true, it is fixed, it is chaste, it is the instrument of heavenly teaching, and eternal proclamation shining with the purest eloquence. It is the light of mortals as the prophet says: "Your word is a lamp to my feet, Lord, and a light to my paths." It is living and knows no death as the Apostle says: "The word of God is living and effective, sharper than any double-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit." It is the dispeller of darkness as Solomon attests, who says: "The commandment of the law is a lamp and a light of life and reproof and discipline." About which it is said through Isaiah: “My spirit watches for you during the night, God, because your commands are light on the earth.” For it always commands vital things, forbids harmful things, removes earthly things, and persuades heavenly things.
It is, I say, a fountain springing from the heavenly margin, from which the more it is drawn, the less it is expended, and the more it is distributed into many parts. The more it increases in meanings; it is money...
The purse, from which neither the things given are lost nor does the constant use of giving bring about a decrease, but the more it is emptied with the devotion to giving, the more it is filled.
None of these things we have touched upon, nor of similar things which we have omitted for the sake of brevity, can be found in images, O worshiper of images, O devotee of senseless things. Since these things lack all the merits, you should be pitied rather than admired for trying to compare them to the books of divine Scripture, where so many good things are found. You, who say you preserve the purity of your faith in images, remember to stand before them with incense; let us seek diligently the precepts of the Lord in the holy law books! You examine the pictures in the lamps; let us frequent the holy Scriptures! You be a devotee of painted colors; let us be devotees and understanders of profound meanings! You soothe yourself with painted tablets: let us be soothed by divine speeches! You insist on the figures of things, which have neither sight nor hearing nor taste nor smell nor touch; let us insist on the divine law, which is irreproachable, in which the testimony of the Lord's righteousness and his precepts, fear, and judgments are found!
The psalmist beautifully defined each of these attributes through the figure of the seventh, which dialecticians call 'by translation', because it shows what a thing is with a brief description, under the perfection of the number six, which is considered perfect according to the experience of arithmetic because it is measured by its parts and when these are put back together into one, it returns to itself without any loss or increase. He thus defined it, saying:
"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting souls; the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether, more to be desired than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb."
All these are adorned by the perfection of the number six, because, although they seem somewhat different from each other, they all pertain to the perfection of the law, by which holy men are made perfect. Just as the number six is not fulfilled if one is subtracted, so the integrity of perfection is mutilated if anything is taken away.
For the law is irreproachable because it consists of perfect truth, which is not reproached but rather proven to be fulfilled by the Savior: "I did not come," he says, "to abolish the law, but to fulfill it." And so that we might understand that the gospel is also the law of the Lord and that the law consists of the two Testaments, both the new and the old, he added: "Converting souls," because the page of the Old Testament has the rigor of irreproachable severity, while the new has the calling and gentleness through which erring souls are corrected and converted to Christ's grace. Therefore, the testimony of the Lord is faithful, because whatever God promises is fulfilled with the utmost truth. This testimony gives wisdom to the simple, not to the proud nor to those boasting with swollen arrogance, but to those simple ones of whom the Apostle says: "Do not be children in your thinking, be infants in evil." Thus, the Father gives testimony, the Son gives testimony, and the Holy Spirit gives testimony; and just as they are of one essence and nature, so also they are sublime in giving testimony. It is read in the gospel that the Father gave testimony about the Son; the Apostle writes to Timothy about the Son: "I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate." The same Apostle says about the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit." Therefore, the statutes of the Lord are right because he is known to have done nothing other than what he taught, nor is there anything different in his words and his deeds. They rejoice the heart because they soothe the minds of the just with the promise of eternal rewards. This reward was hoped for by the one who said: "From now on, ."
There is a crown of righteousness reserved for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day.
For the commandment of the Lord is rightly called light, either because it proceeds from the Father of lights or because it makes people enlightened. It also illuminates the eyes, not the physical eyes, which animals share with us, but the inner eyes, which are spiritually enlightened by the divine gift.
The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring forever; love mixed with fear is called reverence in common usage. Therefore, anyone who is known to fear and love their judge lives in all holiness.
The difference between the fear of the Lord and human dread is that human dread changes with time—of which it is said: Perfect love casts out fear—but the fear of the Lord does not change with temporal conversion but persists in the same state with the sincerity of a good conscience.
Furthermore, the judgments of God, which are true and justified in themselves as described by the prophet, are His commandments, which are written in the Old and New Testaments because they are truly issued from judgment. True, I say, and justified because they make their observers truthful and justified.
The difference between God's judgment and His judgments is that the singular judgment is the general examination, while His judgments in the plural are the sacraments found in the two Testaments, not in images nor paintings.
The psalmist expressed this by a figure of speech called auxesis in Greek, meaning increase, as it gradually grows to higher things, saying: They are more desirable than gold and many precious stones and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Just as precious stones are valued higher than gold, so honey and the honeycomb are preferred in sweetness to gold and precious stones.
Through this figure, the same psalmist praises his protector, his glory, and the one who lifts up his head, saying: But you, Lord, are my protector, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
And the Apostle says: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or persecution? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or peril? Or sword? In which the greatness of the matter gradually increases through the accumulation of words.
Although a similar figure called climax in Greek and gradation in Latin is near, where certain steps are always added in praise or blame, it differs significantly because auxesis increases without any repetition of names, whereas climax repeats the last word of the first clause in the following member, thus linking one to another like a chain, as the Apostle says: Knowing that tribulation produces patience, and patience, character, and character, hope; and hope does not disappoint; likewise: For whom he foreknew, he also predestined; and whom he predestined, he also called; and whom he called, he also justified; and whom he justified, he also glorified.
But if perhaps you, a lover or rather an adorer of images, murmur inwardly with bitterness, saying: 'What is the need to wander so much through figures of speech?' you will recognize that these are more pleasant to us than your images or painted tablets, and that is why we have wandered through them. For we and other lovers of the Scriptures find these delights and refreshments in the Scriptures or their figures, which you and your companions do not find in images or tablets, where you claim to preserve the purity of your heart.
Chapter 31: That those who curse their predecessors act against the Lord's command and contradict their own origins
Ultimately, those who presume to equate these images to the body and blood of the Lord are driven by such love for them that they do not hesitate to anathematize their parents known to have despised these images, connecting error to error. They display inappropriate and disorderly adoration to the images and impose an improper curse on those from whom they were born through the flesh or by whose consecration and baptism they received other charisms.
If, according to their madness, all who lack the adoration of images are heretics, it is evident that their ancestors, who did not adore them, were heretics. If their ancestors were heretics, they neither had the power to perform consecrations nor to lay hands. If they did not have this power, those who believe they received this power from them neither possess consecration nor the laying on of hands.
Similarly, if their predecessors, as they say, were worthy of the bond of anathema, they did not have the power to bind and loose. If they did not have this power, everything they did in the church must be annulled. If everything must be denied, then their ranks and ordinations must be denied. If their predecessors were worthy of the bond of anathema, their ranks and ordinations must be annulled. For we read that the power to bind and loose was granted by the Lord not to those bound by schism and anathema, but to those who are qualified and Catholic.
Meanwhile, the legal, prophetic, apostolic, and even evangelical admonition teaches us to honor our parents, as the Lord says:  "Honor your father and your mother." For He who gave this saving commandment both through the text of the Old Testament and through His bodily presence also proclaimed through Moses saying:  "Blessed is he who honors his father and mother," and conversely:  "Cursed is he who does not honor his father and mother."
Hence, it must be carefully considered how arrogant and reckless, and I might say, criminal it is to anathematize one's parents if even he who is proven not to honor them is subject to a curse. For as the law says:  "Do not expose the nakedness of your father," and the Apostle says:  "Children, obey your parents." They seem to oppose both commandments by neither concealing the shame nor striving to impart honor.
Therefore, the sacred canons seem to have delivered this verdict about not despising parents, excluding every excuse:  "Whoever sons abandon their parents under the pretext of divine worship, let them be anathema." If those who do not show the due reverence to their parents are anathematized, with what binding of damnation do you think those who anathematize their parents are connected?
The most beneficial practice handed down by the holy fathers to the churches is to pray to the Lord for the souls of the deceased. Embracing this with the saints and the entire Catholic and universal church, we implore the most merciful compassion of the Lord not only for the souls of our parents but also for the souls of faithful friends who have gone before us in the Lord's peace.
Those who try not to aid the souls of their deceased parents with prayers but instead bind them with the bond of anathema seem to oppose this venerable and ecclesiastical constitution. Those who are commanded by apostolic teaching to pray even for their enemies refuse to do this for their own parents. We beseech pardon for our parents according to the ecclesiastical practice through the insistence of prayers and alms; they wish punishment for theirs through gatherings of useless councils. We seek rest for our parents through the solemnities of masses; they heap abuse on theirs through disorderly councils. We keep the memory of our parents in prayer.
They curse their own with a certain renunciation,  we pray for the rest of our spirits in the bosom of Abraham. They wish the souls of their own to be condemned with Arius, Sabellius, Dioscorus, Nestorius, and Eutyches. We ask for our parents to be placed among the ranks of the blessed,  they wish theirs among the stubborn crowds of heretics.
Since this is the case, it is clear that they commit a double offense in this matter, as they both dishonor their parents against the command of the Lord's voice, and against the Apostle's judgment, attempting to pass a reckless judgment on those who have passed from this world.
This is the judgment of the blessed Paul:  "None of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. It is written: 'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.' So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister."  (Romans 14:7-13)
Regarding this matter, the holy bishops of the Roman Church, Anastasius, are said to have written to Emperor Anastasius:  "It must be known to your tranquility that there should be no stumbling block in the church, as we attempt to judge those who have already passed away, which we cannot do."
Since parents should not be dishonored by their children and the dead should not be recklessly judged by the living, this is proclaimed in the pages of the holy Scriptures.
Now, with the eye of the mind, it must be carefully considered how much the error of children in the abolishment or veneration of the aforementioned images differs from the error of their parents, as the errors of both are in constant conflict. They judged these images to be torn down and despised by the church with perpetual renunciation; these people not only keep them but also strive to venerate them with humble adoration. They consigned these images to crackling fires; these people honor them with fragrant incense. They avoided even looking at them; these people do not cease to embrace them. They dug up images established in the walls for the ornament of the church by the ancients; these people illuminate recently established images with offered lights. They strove to completely abominate them; these people decree that they must be kissed. They anathematized those who possessed them; these people, on the contrary, anathematize those who do not adore them.
Since these two evils are opposed to each other and far removed from the right path, it remains for us, walking the royal road according to the Apostle, not to turn to the right or to the left, so that we neither decree them to be completely abolished nor to be adored, but only worship God and venerate His saints according to the ancient tradition of the fathers and the church, keeping them in the church as an ornament and a memorial of deeds if desired, and with justice despising on the one hand severity, on the other adulation, with prudence avoiding on the one hand cunning, on the other dullness, with temperance rejecting on the one hand lust, on the other insensitivity, with fortitude casting aside on the one hand timidity, on the other audacity.
With the holy fathers, who allowed these images only as ornaments of the church, disregarding those who adore on the one hand and those who abominate on the other, let us hold to the path of the Lord's commandments, so that, with His help, we may be able to reach Him who is the way, the truth, and the life.
