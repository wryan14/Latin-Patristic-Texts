<s>Josephus narrates that this prophecy was fulfilled when Onias the priest, who fled to Egypt surrounded by many groups of Jews, built an altar and temple there.</s>
<s>But we, who hold and believe devoutly that the prophecies about Christ's coming and the calling of the Gentiles are not future events but past ones, do not think this prophecy was fulfilled by Onias the priest, but by Christ the Lord, the Mediator between God and humans, who established faith in this world, often symbolized by the name Egypt.</s>
<s>In this faith, sacrifices of prayers and offerings of holy merits are made to the Lord by the faithful, in accordance with the title placed, that is, the gospel or apostolic doctrine, which instructs the minds of the faithful to perform good works.</s>

<p>
<s>Furthermore, when it is added: "And it will be a sign and testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt," it was meant to be understood as the mystery of the Lord's passion.</s>
<s>Then, when the time of persecution comes, those who believe will implore the Lord's mercy.</s>
<s>Immediately, the Savior will come, that is, Jesus, which is what His name means in our language, and the Lord will be known by the Egyptians.</s>
<s>They will know Him, either as those who were defeated or as believers saved by present help.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Since this is the meaning of the prophetic words and the understanding of the title and altar, who would use this to support the worship of images except someone blinded by their own foolishness?</s>
<s>Who would dare to use a Spirit-inspired prophetic message to support an error, except someone entirely devoted to that error?</s>
<s>How then can the worship of images find any support from these words of the holy prophet, when it is clear that these words were not meant to be fulfilled historically in a specific altar or title, but spiritually in the faith of Christ and the gospel held by the faithful?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Even if these words were historically about a physical altar or title, they would not support the worship of images, since the prophet did not say they should be worshiped, but only predicted their existence.</s>
<s>There is a difference between "will be" and "will be worshiped"; between "altar of the Lord" and "any image"; between "title near the boundaries" and "likeness in any material."</s>
<s>Therefore, he did not say, "There will be a time when no one will please God unless they worship images"; nor did he say, "Such a cult of images will arise that whoever does not worship them or honor them with incense, lights, or certain offerings will be worthy of anathema," but he said, "There will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a title near its boundary, and it will be a sign and testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt."</s>
<s>This clearly means: "There will be faith in the world and the preaching of the gospel, through which the manifestation of the Lord's passion and our redemption will be declared."</s>
