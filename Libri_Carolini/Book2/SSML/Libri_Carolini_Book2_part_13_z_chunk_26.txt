    <s>Often in this particular work of ours on images, we are compelled to confess that they should not be held, but rather that adoration of them is forbidden by us.</s>
    <s>Neither should the vision of them in basilicas' ornaments and records of historical events be avoided, but the most insolent or rather superstitious adoration should be condemned.</s>
    <s>Thus, as in other cases, so in this example, the assertion will be frustrated for those who attempt to support their great error in the adoration of images by claiming that Sylvester, the bishop of the Roman church, is said to have brought images of the apostles to Emperor Constantine.</s>

  <p>
    <s>He brought them to him to be seen, not to be adored.</s>
    <s>He brought them, not to be worshipped, but to encourage him to turn away from the worship of idols and to urge him to worship God alone.</s>
    <s>He wanted the emperor to recognize the faces of those whom he had seen in dreams through their depiction in paintings.</s>
    <s>He brought them not to teach him to surrender to the adoration of images while fleeing from the worship of idols, nor to destroy him with the sword of internal strife after liberating him from hostile weapons, but to elevate his mind from known things to unknown ones so that he could perceive with his physical eyes the images of those he could not yet see with the eye of the mind, not yet cleansed from the stains of paganism by spiritual miracles.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Therefore, if he had commanded him to adore them, though he did not, perhaps he would have ordered it to lead him, who was a worshipper of visible things, through visible things to the invisible, not to turn us from the invisible to the visible.</s>
    <s>Nor should we, who have received the strength to grasp solid food, return to milk like infants.</s>
    <s>If he, who could not yet be given solid food due to the tenderness of his faith, was given milk without deceit to desire and grow on.</s>
    <s>Thus, the Apostle gave spiritual milk and the food of vegetables to the young church coming from circumcision and paganism, meaning easier teachings to understand and lighter commandments to fulfill, so that the carnal minds, nurtured in a certain tenderness of infancy, might become capable of receiving the food of spiritual mysteries.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Therefore, in the book of the acts of blessed Sylvester, where it is written about the images brought to Emperor Constantine, it can be resisted because, although it is read by many Catholics, it is not considered fully reliable for affirming those matters in question.</s>
    <s>This is more clearly demonstrated in the book of blessed Gelasius, the bishop of the city of Rome, which is titled: "Decretals on Receiving or Not Receiving Books".</s>
