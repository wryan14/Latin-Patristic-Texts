    <s>The statement of blessed Athanasius, bishop of the city of Alexandria, which they have inconsistently used, just like other testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, to support their error, is revealed to be completely unrelated to this matter.</s>
    <s>It does not mention at all any kind of image worship, but rather compares the subject he was discussing, admitting that images can be restored in the same material and element.</s>
    <s>He says: Just as those that are written on wood, once the external dirt is removed, must be restored to the same form, and the image can be renewed in the same material and element.</s>
    <s>For by its form, the material itself, on which it is inscribed, is not destroyed, but rather shaped into the same form.</s>

    <s>Therefore, let them say that this statement provides support for them.</s>
    <s>Let them say where it teaches to worship images.</s>
    <s>Since they cannot assert this, it remains to be understood by sound minds in the way the venerable man expressed it.</s>
