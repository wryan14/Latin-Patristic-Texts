      If He is invisible, or rather because He is invisible, it is necessary that He is incorporeal; and if He is incorporeal, it is necessary that He cannot be painted physically.
    </s>
    <s>
      So, if He is invisible and incorporeal, He cannot be depicted with physical materials at all.

      Therefore, we must diligently seek to understand what the image of God is or what His 'face' is, in which the people of God are marked.

      Let us ask the distinguished preacher.

      Perhaps, being taught by him, we may be able to know what the image of God is.

      Tell us, chosen vessel, tell us, teacher of the nations, what the image of God is.

      "Thanks be to God the Father," I say, "who has made us worthy to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light, who has delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God."
    </s>
    <s>
      I spoke about the image, and I also speak about the figure: "In these last days, God has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the worlds, who is the brightness of His glory and the express image of His substance, and upholds all things by the word of His power."

      Behold, the Apostle Paul teaches us that Christ is the image of God, and they urge that material images should be understood in this way.
    </s>
    <s>
      He says that the same Son, who is one in substance with the Father, is the image of God and the brightness of glory and the express image of His substance, while they say that figures prepared by craftsmen are the image of God.

      Oh, reckless folly, burning with such a love for images that you do not blush to compare what is said of the only-begotten Son of God to material figures!

      Let the most holy Augustine also say what the 'image of God' is, who is accused by them of stating that this is material.
    </s>
    <s>
      For he says: "In God, the condition of time does not apply; for it cannot be rightly said that God generated His Son in time, through whom He created time; and it follows that not only is He His image because He is from Him and His likeness because He is His image, but also equality so great that not even an interval of time is a hindrance."

    <s>
      So you too, most holy Ambrose, tell us what is known to you about this image.
    </s>
    <s>
      Defend blessed Augustine, who was converted by you to the rudiments of faith through the favor of God, whom you now see being infamously accused by the worshipers of images.
    </s>
    <s>
      Provide him support so that he may be freed from the burden of such a great accusation, who was once freed by you from the error of heretical dogma.

      The prophets, I say, declared that Christ, who is the image of the invisible Father and the figure of His substance, is the brightness of eternal light and the spotless mirror of Godâ€™s majesty and the image of His goodness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, I will strive to compare my Augustine, indeed a true worshiper of God, with the prophets and apostles in this way.
    </s>
    <s>
      See how great are the things said: 'brightness,' because the clarity of the paternal light is in the Son; 'spotless mirror,' because the Father is seen in the Son, 'image of goodness,' because not a body in a body, but the virtue is entirely seen in the Son.
    </s>
    <s>
      The image teaches that He is not dissimilar, the character signifies that He is an exact expression, the brightness signifies eternal light.
    </s>

    <s>
      Therefore, the image of God is not a physical face, not made up of colors, not of wax, but simple from God, proceeding from the Father, expressed from the source.

    <s>
      Through this image, the Lord showed the Father to Philip, saying, "Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the Father, and how can you say, 'Show us the Father?' Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?"
    </s>
    <s>
      For he saw the Father in the image, who saw the Son.
    </s>
    <s>
      See what image he speaks of: this image is clarity, this image is truth, this image is the virtue of God; not mute, because it is the Word; not insensible, but meaningful; not empty, because it is power; not dead, because it is life; not mortal, because it is resurrection.
    </s>
    <s>
      You see, therefore, that when the image is mentioned, it signifies the Father, whose image is the Son, who is not made by human hands.

            It is an image of itself. Since we have approved the image of God not as material images, as some babble, but as the Son of God according to the teachings of the holy fathers, it remains for us to briefly explain how we are marked in Him.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are therefore marked in Him when, according to the Apostle, we are baptized into His death, anointed with the sacred oil, and receive the privilege of the Christian name, as it is said in the Song of Songs: 
            <s>
                "Your name is oil poured out."
            </s>
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the divine prophecy proclaimed through Isaiah is fulfilled, which says:
            <s>
                "My servants will be called by a new name."
            </s>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are therefore marked in Him who, according to the Apostle, has sealed us and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. We are also marked by the Spirit as a guarantee for the day of redemption, and we are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So that both our spirit and soul are impressed with the seal of God, and we receive that image in which we were created in the beginning. Though we have not completely lost it by sinning, it has not remained entirely pure in us, because if we had completely lost it, it would never be said:
            <s>
                "Although man walks in an image, he is still troubled in vain."
            </s>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if we had kept it completely pure, the Apostle would never say:
            <s>
                "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind," 
            </s>
            and 
            <s>
                "We are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."
            </s>
