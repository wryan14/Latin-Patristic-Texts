        The text of the testimony that they brought from the Sixth Council, in the same nonsensical collection written in favor of worshipping images, is as follows:
    </p>
    <s>
        In certain paintings of venerable images, the finger of John the Baptist is shown pointing to the lamb, which is a sign left by grace, prefiguring through the law the Lamb, our Lord Christ.
    </s>
    <s>
        However, although it was not brought forward by them exactly as it appears in that council, nor even as they claimed, it is mentioned that some form of image worship is acknowledged.
    </s>
    <s>
        But since it has almost no strength in Latin integrity, is weak in meaning, and lacks charm in words and some reason, it is shown to provide no support for their error.
