    <s>For in that case, there is no mention of those images that are usually found in basilicas, but of those that Roman emperors, through pagan and superstitious rites, arrogantly ordered to be worshiped to show their favor.</s>
    <s>We indeed find that none of the ancient kings practiced such sacrilegious impiety, and almost no nation was so subjected to the service of idols and such cruelty, as we read anywhere.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Therefore, it was a great and truly significant cruelty and strength, which was foretold by the prophet Daniel in the interpretation of the four-part statue, which was a prediction of the four strongest kingdoms of the world.</s>

  <p>
    <s>After the golden head, which signified the kingdom of the Assyrians or Chaldeans, the silver chest, which represented the kingdom of the Medes and Persians, the bronze thighs, which showed the Macedonian kingdom, were designated by the iron legs.</s>
    <s>And just as iron breaks and subdues everything, so this nearly subdued all kingdoms.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>This was also seen by the aforementioned prophet in the vision of the four beasts: after the lion, which showed the Babylonian kingdom, and the bear, which represented the succession of the Medes and Persians, and the leopard, which symbolized the Macedonian kingdom, in the fourth place, just as in the statue with the iron legs, there is also a certain terrifying and dreadful beast described with iron teeth.</s>

  <p>
    <s>It is long to discuss now, in which there are not, as in the other beasts, individual features, but all the signs of cruelty found in the previous ones, devouring the nations it destroyed and trampling underfoot those it subjected to tributes.</s>
    <s>It served the worship of demons to such an extent that it miserably adored the idols of some nations it had conquered, joining them with its own idols.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Hence, it is utterly vain and unreasonable to take examples within the holy church from that matter, which is believed by Catholics to be entirely discarded due to the stain of paganism.</s>
    <s>Unless perhaps in this part, it is conceded that error is supported by error, and a vain thing has a similarly vain thing as an example, and an oblique matter is thought to obtain sanction from a non-righteous matter.</s>

    <s>Therefore, the text of John's opinion - if it is indeed John's - is quoted in the same demented synod reading in this way:</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>"Do you not know that if someone insults the image of the emperor, the injury is primarily directed at the emperor's dignity?</s>
    <s>Do you not know that if someone removes an image made of wood or color, it is not judged as mere material without a soul, but as if an image of the emperor were torn apart, it brings injury to the emperor?</s>

    <s>And again, the same father, on the fifth Thursday of Easter:</s>
    <s>'All things were made for the glory of God, and for our use: clouds to serve for rain, the earth for abundant fruits, the sea for navigation, and everything serves man without fail, especially the image of God.</s>
    <s>Likewise, the imperial cult and images are introduced into cities, and the judges or people obey with praise, not honoring the tablet itself nor the letters inscribed on wax but the figure of the emperor.</s>
    <s>So too, creation on earth is not honored for its appearance, but the same figure represents the heavenly Creator.'</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>This opinion, although it may lack the embellishment of words and the refinement of expressions, and is believed to wander far from the matter to which it is applied, neither provides solace to their assertion nor brings any harm to our side, nor inculcates any division in the senses of Christian religion, especially since we should not stain the character of the divine image in us with evil deeds nor defile it, to whose image and likeness we are made."</s>

  <p>
    We were created in His image and likeness, but by sinning and polluting that image and likeness, we bring injury to it. This can be compared to someone who injures the image of an emperor; it is considered an injury to the emperor himself, not just to his image.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it is said that the clouds, land, or sea serve the image of the Lord, it does not refer to a man-made, irrational image—if indeed this is what is being said, either by those who claim it or by any Catholic—but rather it refers either to Christ, who is the image of God, to whom every knee in heaven, on earth, and under the earth bends, or to mankind, who was created in the image of God and placed above almost all visible creatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anyone argues that this was said about insensible images, let them explain how and in what manner the clouds, land, and sea serve these images, and they will soon find their assertion largely unsupported. Therefore, if the common people sometimes honor the images of emperors with empty and harmful praises—driven by wild enthusiasm, the novelty of secular pomp, a desire for inflated honor, the vice of flattery, or fear of public authorities—what does that matter to us, who glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to us, and we to the world? Our conversation is in heaven, and with the Apostle we say: "To us, for whom Christ was crucified, what does it matter?" We should resist such error rather than agree with it. We should not only refrain from taking this as an example to worship images, but we should also utterly detest it and those who follow it.
