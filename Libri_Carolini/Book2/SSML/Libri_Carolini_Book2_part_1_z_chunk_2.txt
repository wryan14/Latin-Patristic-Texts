      It is also sheer madness to interpret things that were predicted long ago about those who destroyed the city of Jerusalem and burned the Lord's temple as referring to those who despise worshiping images.

      Especially since it is one thing to remove the bronze sea, the two cherubim, and the other vessels and ornaments from the temple, and another thing not to worship man-made images; it is one thing to cruelly destroy the beauty of the temple with fire, and another to avoid the worship of images; it is one thing to cruelly demolish the Holy of Holies, and another to wisely prohibit bowing to pictures.

      Finally, anyone who wants to know what the psalmist was talking about when he said, "How the enemy has acted wickedly in Your holy places," is not only instructed by the histories of the books of Kings and the deeds of the Romans, which narrate the past destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the temple, but also by the prophecy of the illustrious prophet David, who, through a figure of speech called prolepsis, described future calamities and the destruction of that most sacred temple as if they had already happened.

      He said: "God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance, they have defiled Your holy temple, they have laid Jerusalem in ruins, and so on."

      And in the psalm from which this verse is taken, which we are now discussing, he says: "How the enemy has acted wickedly in Your holy places! They have boasted, all who hate You, in the midst of Your court. They have set up their standards as signs, and did not recognize them as in the topmost place, as in a forest of trees they cut down its gates with axes and hatchets. They have burned Your sanctuary with fire, they have defiled the dwelling place of Your name on the ground."

      Which is also more clearly stated in another psalm: "The boar from the forest ravages it, and the wild beast feeds on it."

      But let no one be troubled that it does not say, "How the enemies have acted wickedly," but, "How the enemy has acted wickedly." Note that this was said through a figure of speech called enallage, where the singular is used for the plural, as in the Gospel: "And the robbers who were crucified with Him also reviled Him," or: "For those who sought the child's life are dead," and the plural is used for the singular, as is read in Exodus: "Pray to the Lord to take away the serpent from us," and in the psalm: "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them."

      Even if someone examines this more subtly according to mystical understanding, they will not inappropriately recognize the holy church and the heretics who maliciously attack it with corrupt doctrines.

      Nevertheless, no one who has a sound and sober understanding will interpret it about those who despise the worship of images. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, the more those who think this verse was said about them lack sound judgment, the more those who do not worship images remain steadfast in their good sense.
