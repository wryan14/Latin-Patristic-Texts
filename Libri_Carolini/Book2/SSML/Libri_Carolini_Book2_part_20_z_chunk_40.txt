    <s>In addition, they claim that the blessed Cyril, bishop of the city of Alexandria, said:</s>
    <s>"For faith is depicted, that the Word exists in the form of God, just as in the redemption of our life He was offered to God, in the likeness of man and became human.</s>
    <s>Although due to either the inexperience of the interpreter or the fault of the scribe, this seems to have a partial meaning, yet it does not somehow suggest the worship of images.</s>
    <s>Nor is there in this any affirmation or even mention of this error, for they say that he later said:</s>
    <s>'Images fulfill for us the role of parables signifying virtue, to which both the eyes and tactile marks are applied, holding invisibly in the mind the vision.'</s>"

    <s>Since, therefore, this book is not with us, which is said to have been published in Greek by the aforementioned doctor, the meaning of this chapter must be sought by conjecture in the disorganized and improper words, as if one were to seek coins wrapped in dust or in the filth of any material.</s>
    <s>For this, as we conjecture, seems to signify the text of this chapter:</s>
    <s>that while Christ, existing in the form of God, clothed in the likeness of our flesh and became human and was offered to God for the redemption of our life, in Himself, the true image of the Father, showed us the vision of the same Father according to this:</s>
    <s>"Whoever sees me, sees the Father"; and in the imagination of parables, He signified mysteries to our senses in such a way that in the images of those things, the imagination of which they are is somehow shown.</s>
    <s>This indeed according to the ambiguity of conjecture.</s>
    <s>However, excluding the ambiguities of doubt, it is clear that no worship of images is designated here.</s>
