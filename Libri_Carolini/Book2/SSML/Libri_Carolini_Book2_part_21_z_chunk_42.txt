        <s>The instruments of the Christian religion are indeed great.</s>
        <s>Although they depend on the solidity of faith and the love of God and neighbor, it would take too long to list them all.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Among these, the worship and adoration of images hold no place whatsoever.</s>
        <s>This is because they are established by no ancient document or supported by any example, but are almost entirely rejected by the words of the Holy Scriptures.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The powerful trumpet of the entire divine Scripture thunders that we should worship, adore, and glorify only God.</s>
        <s>Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious and to fear in every way that, while attempting to introduce the worship and adoration of images into the Christian religion, they might seem to frustrate the unique worship and adoration of the one God.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>These two are so mutually opposed that if one stands, the other cannot.</s>
        <s>For if the unique worship owed solely to the one God remains unshaken—and indeed it will remain unshaken—then the worship of images will be nullified in every way.</s>
        <s>If the worship of images is not overturned, the worship owed solely to the one God will not be unique.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Thus, if the stronghold or defense and glorious insignia of the Christian religion is the worship and adoration of the one God, indeed because it is, to offer this to images or any other things is against the Christian religion.</s>
        <s>If not worshiping or venerating these is against the Christian religion, as they claim, then to worship or venerate only God and to acknowledge His worship and adoration as unique would be against the Christian religion.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Therefore, only God is to be worshiped, only He is to be adored, only He is to be glorified, as the prophet says: "His name alone is exalted."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>To His saints, who, having triumphed over the devil, now reign with Him either because they fought bravely so that the unshaken state of the Church might reach us, or because they are known to help the same Church with constant prayers and intercessions, veneration should be shown.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>But as for images, with all their worship and adoration excluded, whether they are in churches for the memory of events and decoration or not, they can bring no pretext for Catholic faith, since they are known to have no role whatsoever in carrying out the mysteries of our salvation.</s>
