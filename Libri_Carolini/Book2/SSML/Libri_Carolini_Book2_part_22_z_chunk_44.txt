    "But as for me," says the prophet, "it is good to be near God." Since God is spirit, as it is written: "The Lord God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth," one can only adhere to him spiritually, not physically, and can join him not with bodily senses, but with the rational gaze of the soul. Therefore, as the most holy Augustine says, we are most healthily reminded to turn away from this world, which is indeed material and perceptible, and to turn to God, that is, the truth, which is grasped by the intellect and the inner mind, which always remains the same and does not have a false image that cannot be distinguished from the truth, with all eagerness.

    To contemplate Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, or to behold the virtues that are derived from him in his saints, we need not a physical vision, which we share with irrational animals, but a spiritual vision, which the prophet asked the Lord to grant him when he said: "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law." Therefore, when the Lord said: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear," he was seeking this spiritual hearing, not physical ears. The people of Israel were ordered to be deprived of these senses due to the sin of unbelief, not to be physically impaired, when he said to the prophet Isaiah: "Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart."

    Given these conditions, those who admit to being overwhelmed by great blindness confess that their memory, called the soul's eye, is so impaired that it needs the support of visual images to prevent them from being diverted from the service of God and the veneration of his saints. They do not consider themselves capable of lifting the eye of the mind above material creation to grasp the eternal light without the aid of physical creation. But lest they attempt to defend their error with these excuses, claiming that we also allow images to be kept for the memory of events, their argument will be shattered by the battering rams of truth. There is a difference between having images out of fear of forgetting, and having them out of love for decoration; between having images willingly and having them out of necessity; between looking at them to avoid forgetting God and his saints, and looking at them to remember past events; between seeing things that, if not seen, do no harm, and those that, if not seen, hinder salvation, since a person can be saved without looking at images, but not without knowledge of God.

    Therefore, the human mind should adhere to God, in whose image it was created, without any material intermediaries, to be shaped by the truth, which is Christ. It is most foolish to think that it needs to be reminded with material images to avoid forgetting him, as this indicates a flaw of weakness, not a sign of freedom. As the apostle Paul testifies, the descent of Christ to the underworld, his ascent to heaven, and the fruits of our hope are to be sought not in visible things, but in the heart, when he says: "Hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience." And again: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down) or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does the Scripture say? 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart' (that is, the word of faith which we preach); because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."

    Many other relevant and necessary things could be said on this matter in this chapter if brevity, to which we are committed, allowed.
