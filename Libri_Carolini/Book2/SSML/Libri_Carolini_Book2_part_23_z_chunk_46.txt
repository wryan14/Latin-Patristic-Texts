      "Images, whose excessive worship was promoted by Constantine and his mother Helena, as well as Tharasius, the Bishop of Constantinople, and which led to the convening of synods, have provided us with the subject of our current discussion.
    </s>
    <s>
      Blessed Gregory, Bishop of the city of Rome, prohibited both their worship and their destruction.
    </s>
    <s>
      He conveyed this clearly and without any ambiguous language to Serenus, Bishop of Marseille, explaining what should be observed and followed in this matter.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For while some are noted for condemning their predecessors or parents who broke these images in an execrable manner, and others are believed to have abominably condemned those who worship these images, the aforementioned bishop positioned himself between these two opposing errors.
    </s>
    <s>
      He armed both sides in their mutual conflict, striking both those who worship these images and those who broke them with the pointed zeal of his episcopal authority.
    </s>
    <s>
      By rejecting both the worshippers and the destroyers, he established our church on a moderate path that allows images as ornaments and for remembrance, without worshipping them.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      It is reported that the venerable Pope Gregory praised Serenus for prohibiting the worship of images but criticized him for breaking them.
    </s>
    <s>
      He said: 'It has been reported to me that you, with ill-considered zeal, broke the images of the saints under the pretext that they should not be worshipped.
    </s>
    <s>
      While we commend you for refusing to worship them, we criticize you for breaking them.'
    </s>
    <s>
      And further: 'Images should not be broken, as they are placed in churches not for worship but solely to instruct the minds of those who are ignorant.
    </s>
    <s>
      Since the tradition has reasonably allowed for the depiction of saints' stories in holy places, if you had tempered your zeal with discretion, you could have used these images beneficially for instruction without scattering your gathered flock, but rather bringing them together.'
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      The same venerable bishop believed that breaking images disturbed the minds of the common people and thus feared causing scandal among the weak.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, he later instructed that images should be allowed in any church, but worship of them should be avoided at all costs.
    </s>
    <s>
      He said: 'The diverse members of the church should be gathered and shown the testimony of Holy Scripture, which states that it is not permissible to worship anything made by human hands, as it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve."
    </s>
    <s>
      Then explain that these images, originally created for the instruction of the unlearned people who could learn from the visual history, have unfortunately become objects of worship, and therefore you were compelled to order their breaking.
    </s>
    <s>
      Tell them that, if they are used for the original purpose of instruction, which was the reason for their creation, they should be allowed in churches.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, make it clear that it was not the visual history itself that displeased you, but the inappropriate worship given to these images.
    </s>
    <s>
      Soften their minds with these words, bring them to your understanding, and if anyone wishes to make images, do not prohibit it, but absolutely avoid the worship of images.'
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Thus, we follow the teachings and instructions of the venerable pontiff Gregory, who allows images in churches but absolutely rejects their worship.
    </s>
    <s>
      Anyone who either breaks or worships images should recognize that they are opposing his teachings."
