        Since nothing other than God alone should be worshiped, it's one thing to honor a person out of love and respect, and another to honor man-made images.

        We must believe that God loved the human race so much that, at the very beginning of its creation, He made it not just anyhow, but in His own image and likeness.

    <s>
        He gave humans priority over other creatures and, even though they were transferred from the joy of paradise to the troubles of this mortal life due to sin, He did not cease to instruct them through amazing miracles and clear prophecies over time.

        He did this even for the angels who had fallen away from Him by sinning and were punished with eternal damnation, in order to once again join humans with the heavenly citizens they were meant to be with.

        From this, it is clear that it is one thing to honor a person out of respect, given their many merits, and another to honor images, which lack such merits.

        It's one thing to show respect to a person, a work of God, and another to an image, a work of an artist.

        It's one thing to honor the nature that angels and archangels worship in the King of Heaven, and another to honor something used by humans and animals.

        Just as God’s works surpass human works, and rational beings surpass irrational ones, so too does the act of honoring people out of humility and respect surpass the act of worshiping images superstitiously and unnecessarily.

        God commanded us to love people, not images.

        He sent His Son into the world for people, not for images.

        Since the creator is higher than his creation and the maker is superior to his works, the Book of Wisdom testifies: “For no human being can create a god like himself; since he is mortal, he creates something dead with wicked hands. He is better than what he worships because he lives, even though he is mortal, while the other never lives.”

        But as for those within the holy church who preach that only God should be worshiped according to sacred scripture and yet call councils to worship images, they should be careful not to disturb domestic peace with internal conflict and to stain our prosperity with this error like a civil war.

        They can easily avoid this by staying within the boundaries of prophetic, evangelical, and apostolic preaching and being content with the teachings of the holy fathers without introducing new doctrines.
