    <p><s>The standard of ecclesiastical instruction from the prophets and apostles, or from the Lord Himself, is sometimes recommended to us by words, sometimes shown by examples, sometimes revealed by hidden, sometimes by open oracles, and sometimes taught by figurative, sometimes by straightforward speeches.</s> <s>Among all these, the worship of all things is prohibited, except for prayer, with which we mutually greet each other, and the worship of God alone is instituted.</s></p>
    <p><s>For those who are consumed by the love of images claim that this worship was handed down by the apostles, they must say by what examples it was established and by what teachings it is proven to have been promulgated.</s> <s>Did Peter establish this worship, who gently restrained Cornelius from worshipping him?</s> <s>Did John, who, desiring to worship the angel, was told not to do so, but to worship God instead?</s> <s>Did Paul, who was horrified by the Lycaonians' superstitious attempts to worship him?</s> <s>Or Barnabas, who, along with Paul, rejected it?</s> <s>Since angels and apostles forbid being worshipped, who is so foolish and insane to dare to say that they instituted the worship of images, especially considering that, even if they should be worshipped, angels and humans are of different merits and definitions, and so are their images.</s></p>
    <p><s>If, therefore, angels or humans, as the reason of the present example teaches, are not to be worshipped, except for the worship exhibited in the duty of charity and greeting, much less are images, which lack reason and are neither worthy of greeting nor worship because they are insensate, to be worshipped.</s> <s>If they are not to be worshipped, indeed because they are not, those who do so commit a double fault, whether because they worship them or because they falsely claim that this was handed down by the apostles.</s></p>
    <p><s>The apostle Paul - the evangelical innkeeper who received from the guardian of all the task of healing the human race, which had departed from the vision of the heavenly homeland and fallen into the pits of this defection and been wounded by evil spirits, with gentle and stern words of preaching, to whom the Redeemer granted the money of double knowledge, that is, of the two Testaments, and promised to repay him if he gave any advice for the formation of the redeemed people - neither in the commands he freely gave nor in the advice he gave beyond the commands, as he is said to have done regarding virgins, is found to have instituted or commanded anything about the worship of images, as they dream.</s></p>
    <p><s>For the same teacher of the nations, when writing to his disciples Timothy and Titus, instructing and teaching them about the ordination of bishops, presbyters, and deacons and all ecclesiastical discipline, or about spiritual conduct and avoiding heretics, did not institute the worship of images because he recognized it to be alien to Christian religion.</s> <s>And in the other letters he wrote to the whole world, teaching what should be avoided and what should be followed, he completely disregarded this matter, believing it neither a mistake to be denied nor a virtue to be established.</s></p>
    <p><s>Therefore, those who claim that not worshipping these images is a crime, but that worshipping them was among the first sacraments of faith instituted by the apostles, should consider that the same vessel of election neither counts despising them among sins, when he says:</s> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈwɜːrks"> "The works </phoneme> <s>of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, impurity, indecency, luxury, idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife, jealousy, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like, of which I forewarn you, as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God,"</s> <s>nor does he count worshipping them among the spiritual fruits, when he says:</s> <s>"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law."</s> <s>And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."</s></p>

        Deriving from a rhetorical flow, he begins by distributing through various streams, across the body, in both broken and graceful circuits, starting from the anaphora and running through the concatenation of names. He contrasts opposites with opposites through the argumentation of topics, which philosophers call "from contraries," adorning his speech with the most beautiful antitheses.

        Here, he declares this life’s acceptable time, suitable for penance, and the day of salvation, that is, suitable for doing good, making, among other virtues he enumerates, a slight or brief mention of the adoration of images.

        For he says: 
        <s>
            <break time="500ms"/>
            "Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry may not be blamed, but in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; in purity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love, in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."

        In this catalog of virtues, as we have stated before, the same distinguished preacher would have included the adoration of images if he deemed it beneficial and profitable to the church. However, he refrained from listing it because he did not perceive it to be useful.
