    <s>It is a great absurdity, indeed rashness, to attempt to equate images with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.</s>
    <s>For they are known to differ by many signs of mysteries, and to compare a thing that was made by the command of the Lord with things that are made by the will of any craftsman.</s>
    <s>For the Ark was made by the command of the Lord, while these things are made with the help of art; the Ark by the holy man Moses, these by any artisan; the Ark by a lawgiver, these by a painter; the Ark is full of mysteries, these only with the colors of paint:</s>
    <s>The Ark was a source of wonder at present miracles and signified certain mystical and secret things about the future, while these things, devoid of both present miracles and future significations, only bring to mind the memory of the things they represent.</s>
    <s>The typical prefigurations of the Ark and its contents were shown in the previous book: now, however, it must be briefly explained how much it differs from man-made images.</s>

    <s>Therefore, those who try to equate the material images made by any craftsmen with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, which was made by the command of the Lord and the obedience of Moses, should find, if they can, a craftsman who can equal Moses in merit.</s>
    <s>Moses, who was exposed to the river's currents, whose safety was left to God alone among the flowing waters, who was taken up and returned to his mother and then cared for most luxuriously by those who had ordered his death.</s>
    <s>He was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, who saw the branches of a tree burning but not consumed, who admired the fragile material enduring a marvelous fire without any damage, or rather from which a voice called out to him by name and gave him mystical commandments and the hope of freeing his people and attaining the paternal promise.</s>
    <s>He was amazed at his rod turning into a serpent, whose administration inflicted ten prodigious plagues upon the Nile-dwellers, who, enriched with the wealth of the Egyptians, led those crossing the sea dry-shod.</s>
    <s>He turned bitter waters into sweet flavor and compelled a dry rock to pour out abundant water with a strike of his rod, who by raising his hands caused hostile tumult to be defeated and granted victory to his people.</s>
    <s>He, terrified and trembling amid the terrifying sound of trumpets, lightning flashes, dense cloud cover, and crackling fires, ascended the mountain, received the law, and showed the people the commandments promulgated by the Lord as a true mediator between God and men.</s>
    <s>He made the tabernacle according to the pattern shown to him on the mountain, which, when he entered, was covered by the glory of the Lord, who was the meekest of all who dwell on the earth, to whom God spoke face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.</s>
    <s>For forty days, he lacked all food and drink, whose face shone with such brightness that it could hardly be looked at, who triumphed marvelously over two kings, who, even after 120 years, did not suffer dimmed eyesight or loss of dental vigor.</s>
    <s>He could make an image from any material that overflows with mysteries and sacraments, from whose surface dreadful oracles are heard, before whom hostile armies quake with terror and rivers dry up to provide a path for those crossing.</s>
    <s>The walls of an ancient city fall instantly to provide entry to the conquering legions, which is called the footstool of our God, at whose entrance the region of enemies is struck with terrifying scourges, which untamed cows, leaving their calves behind, drag to the land of Israel in the yoke of a new cart, at whose return the natives are terrified by astounding miracles.</s>
    <s>Before which the noble prophet and crowned king dances with great exultation without shame and brings it to the destined place with musical harmonies and sweet hymns.</s>

    Although the smith and the workman have displayed such remarkable skills in crafting so many signs, it is not unreasonable to compare it to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since neither a craftsman of such great merit nor a work of such glory can be found, it follows that people of our age should place the lawgiver and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, with its handmade images, above all else and not try to compare such worthless things, so devoid of mysteries, to something so sublime and rich with the signs of so many mysteries.

    For if, as they have said, the images can be likened to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, it is necessary that there be something around them that could be likened to the mercy seat. And it is necessary that fearful oracles be issued from there. However, no oracles are issued from there; therefore, as they foolishly claim, the images cannot be likened to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
