        <s>When the Lord says in the Gospel: "True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth," we are amazed by the madness of those who have become so foolish in worshiping images that, although it is evident that they neither have spirit nor truth, they not only worship them but also dare to equate them with the body and blood of the Lord, saying:</s>
        <s>"Just as the body and blood of the Lord transition from the fruits of the earth to a significant mystery, so too do images crafted by the skill of artists transition to the veneration of the persons whose likeness they embody."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Clearly, the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord, given to us by the same Mediator of God and men, is made by the hand of the priest and the invocation of the divine name for the commemoration of His passion and our salvation.</s>
        <s>Images, however, needing no mystery of imposition or consecration by any hand, are only formed and crafted by those experienced in the art of painting or skilled in the creation of colors, or by those who, with known expertise in some form of craft, shape the likeness of faces by understanding the material.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Surely, for the consecration of these, the priest, with the prayers of the surrounding people, adds his own prayers with an internal groan, commemorating the Lord's passion, resurrection from the dead, and most glorious ascension into heaven.</s>
        <s>He asks that these be carried by the hand of an angel to the sublime altar of God and before the sight of majesty.</s>
        <s>The painter, however, seeking a suitable place for completing his work, looks only for the beauty of colors and the completion of the work in the formation of these.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Therefore, it is far, very far from the path of truth, reason, and discretion to attempt to equate images with the body and blood of the Lord.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>For Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, is read to have offered not an image but bread and wine in the type of the Lord's body and blood.</s>
        <s>And by the mouth of Moses, in the prefiguration of our Redeemer, whose flesh we take for the remission of sins and whose blood we use to evade the blow of the striking angel, the lamb is commanded to be eaten by families, and the use of images to be worshiped or adored is entirely rejected.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The Psalmist likewise sang with a sweet melody about the bread of angels—that is, Christ—to be eaten by men, and the creators of images to be similar to those images they create.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The Author of the human race Himself, who for our salvation did not disdain to take on flesh for our sake, when establishing the end of the Old Testament and the saving beginning of the New as His most sacred passion approached, and connecting the two opposing walls in Himself as the cornerstone, and making both one according to the Apostle, took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave this saving command to His disciples:</s>
        <s>"Take and eat; this is my body."</s>
        <s>Similarly, after supper, He took the cup, gave it to His disciples, saying:</s>
        <s>"Take and drink. This is the cup of my blood, of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Therefore, since the Church holds the clear and most sacred mystery of this, both through the mystical figures of the Old Testament and the saving institution of the New, the most insolent use of worshiping images is not to be equated with it.</s>
        <s>This practice is not only not commanded but is even forbidden by the pages of the Old Testament and not only not allowed but also reproved in the New Testament.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>For He who said: "My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink" and "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him" did not say: "My image is true life" and "The painting attributed to my name is true salvation," nor did He say: "Whoever paints my likeness and worships my image."</s>

    <p>Manufactured, in me finance and I in him.</p>
    <p>And he said: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. He did not say: Unless you paint my image and adore the likeness made by painting, you will not have life in you.</p>
    <p>He who said: I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats of this bread will not die, but will have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day:</p>
    <p>And again: As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me:</p>
    <p>And again: This is the true bread of God, which came down from heaven and gives life to the world. Whoever eats it will live forever, and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.</p>
    <p>Whoever believes in me will never be hungry or thirsty.</p>
    <p>Nothing like this is said about images, when obviously, he established the commemoration of his most holy passion not in the works of art, but in the consecration of his body and blood. Nor did he decree faith and confession to be made in pictures, but in the mouth and heart, as the Scripture says: With the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</p>
    <p>For when he says: If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, he clearly shows that it is not images that should remain in us and we in images, but we in him through faith and his words in us through the study of reading and the completion of works.</p>
    <p>Paul, the apostle, a chosen vessel, seeing that the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood should not be equated with every sacrament but should be preferred above almost all, says: Let a person examine themselves and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</p>
    <p>For whoever eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment upon themselves.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when he shows that those who come to partake of these things should be examined with such diligence, and that those who come negligently and unworthily to receive these things are struck with such a great penalty, he does not bring forth anything similar about those who avoid the worship of images, but on the contrary, he says about those who misuse images: And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image resembling corruptible man, and so on.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood differs greatly and beyond what can be comprehended by the mind's eye from images painted by the art of painters.</p>
    <p>Since the former is made by the invisible working of the Spirit of God, while the latter is visibly made by the hand of an artist;</p>
    <p>The former is consecrated by a priest with the invocation of the divine name, while the latter are painted by a painter with human artistic skill;</p>
    <p>The former is carried on high to God's altar by angelic hands, while the latter are set on a wall by human hands for the gaze of admirers;</p>
    <p>Through the former, sins are forgiven, through the latter, if used carelessly, they are increased;</p>
    <p>The former has a power that neither grows nor diminishes in any way, while the latter increase in beauty according to the artist's skill and also diminish in a certain way;</p>
    <p>The former is confirmed by new antiquity and ancient newness, while the latter are often corrupted by decaying old age;</p>
    <p>The former is life and nourishment for souls, while the latter are only food for the eyes;</p>
    <p>The former leads through faith to the entrance of the heavenly kingdom, while the latter bring the memory of past deeds through sight;</p>
    <p>The former could not be abolished by the church even in persecutions, while the latter sometimes have their color washed away by rain;</p>
    <p>And since without the reception of the former no one can be saved, while without the observation of the latter all who have the right faith can be saved, it is clear that they are not to be equated with such a great mystery by anyone who has a sound mind.</p>
    <p>Therefore, those who strive to bind all who lack the worship of images with the bond of anathema must be asked what they think of the apostles, whom no series of Catholic Scripture teaches to have worshipped images anywhere.</p>
    <p>And yet no faithful person doubts that they not only entered the heavenly kingdoms, but even surpassed them.</p>
    <p>What then of the martyrs, who immediately after baptism through the hands of executioners migrated to the heavenly kingdoms without the worship of images?</p>
    <p>What then of infants, who, freed from original sin?</p>



    Through the washing of regeneration, they were cleansed. Even though they were not yet able to do anything of the sort through their bodily senses, they almost desired the heavenly kingdom before seeking the ability of earthly steps.

    If, according to their very false opinion, all who lack the worship of images perish, infants who have been washed in the waters of baptism and fed with the body and blood of the Lord, who have not yet been able to worship images and thus depart from the world, perish.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    And if they perish, the word of Truth is void, which says: 

    <break time="500ms"/>

    "Let the little children come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." 

    <break time="500ms"/>

    However, the word of Truth promising the kingdom of heaven to infants is not void. Therefore, not all who lack the worship of images perish.
