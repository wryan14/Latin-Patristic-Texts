      It is worth briefly explaining how vastly the mystery of the Lord's cross, in its many excellences and notable virtues, surpasses man-made images, which some people rashly try to equate with it, even though it cannot be fully expressed by our words.

      By this cross, not by those images, humanity was redeemed.

      On the cross, not in images, the price of the world was paid.

      It was the cross, not an image, that served as the instrument for the Lord's sacrifice.

      It is the helmet that deflects the blows of the devil's sword; the shield that opposes his missile darts; the breastplate that frustrates the fiery impact of his spears or arrows.

      This is the wisdom by which we can see through his winding deceptions and cunning devices, so that he cannot overcome those he tempts, whom he once held captive by the persuasion of the first man.

      It is through the wood of the cross, not through images, that the ancient crime, contracted through the use of wood in the first man, is washed away.

      On the cross, not in some painting, the author of sin was captured and, not by domination but by reason, not by power but by justice, was compelled to vomit the prey he had long held.

      Therefore, it is not through material images created by craftsmen, but through the mystery of the cross—considered a scandal by Jews and foolishness by Gentiles—that the proud and inflated wisdom of the world is overthrown.

    <s>
      It was not through some painting but through the cross that it was revealed how much wiser the foolishness of God is than human wisdom, and how much stronger the weakness of God is than human strength.

      Let us, then, ask the teacher of the Gentiles, let us ask the distinguished preacher, whether he glories in images or in the cross of Christ.

      "Far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world," he says.

    <s>
      Let him also declare whether he has been crucified to images or to the cross to live for God.
    </s>
    <s>
      "I have been crucified with Christ," he says; "it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
    </s>
    <s>
      Let him also tell us whether, to comprehend the breadth and length, height and depth of the cross, we need to have untainted eyes of the heart, rather than understanding the hues of colors and forms of images or the qualities of materials.
    </s>
    <s>
      "That you may comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth," he says.

      In explaining these words of such a great preacher, we should neither presumptuously display our own understanding nor steal from others, but should adopt the interpretations we find in the books of blessed Augustine on Christian doctrine.

      Therefore, the breadth is the transverse wood to which the hands are extended; the height is the part that extends upward from the transverse wood, where the head was; the length is the part that begins from the transverse wood and goes down to the ground; and the depth is that part which is fixed into the ground and hidden.

    <s>
      From this wood of the cross, the entire life of the saints is described, who, taking up their cross and mortifying their earthly members, follow Christ.

    <s>
      As their outer man perishes, their inner man is renewed day by day, and rejoicing in the hope of eternal rest, they persist with joy in good works.
    </s>
    <s>
      This joy is signified by the breadth of the cross at the transverse wood, where the hands are fixed.
    </s>
    <s>
      For through the hands, work is understood; through the breadth, joy.

    The clarity of the one working, because sadness creates distress. Moreover, by the height of the cross, which has a head attached, the expectation of eternal reward from God's lofty judgment is signified. Good works are believed to be done not for earthly and temporal benefits from God, but rather for what faith hopes for from above, which works through love.

  <p>
    By the length through which the entire body is extended, patience is signified, so that we remain patient, from which those who endure are called patient. By the depth, that is, the part of the wood that is fixed in the hidden earth, but from there arises everything that is prominent, the unfathomable judgments of God are indicated. Through His hidden will, man is called to the participation of such grace, one in this way, another in that.

    But why do we spend so much time on the words of the apostles? Why do we wander so much through the vast fields of their meanings? Let us come to the Lord, let us sit with Mary at His feet, let us hear the word from His mouth. Let us hear Him in Himself, whom we have heard speaking through the Apostle until now!
  </p>
  <p>
    We have heard, therefore, what the teacher of the nations has said about the cross. Let us hear what the Creator of the nations says. We have heard the distinguished preacher, let us hear the Creator of all things! He said, "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, wondrous command! Oh, life-giving exhortation! Oh, vital thunder! You said it, O source of light. You said it, O origin of goodness, that by putting off the old man with his deeds, we deny ourselves and each take up his cross and crucify ourselves to the world and the world to us. Through bodily afflictions and the mortification of our members, which are on the earth, we live for you or rather you live in us. You exalted the mystery of the cross so much, that you, through it, emptied principalities and powers and all the arrogance of the world. In the name of the cross, which is to be carried by those who follow you daily, you designated the ardor of your love and the rewards of other virtues!
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, say what is commanded about images, which indeed the sacred cross strives to equal, "Render," I say, "to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." Therefore, if we must take up the cross and follow you, who through the cross triumphantly joined earthly things to heavenly things, and render the image of Caesar to Caesar, images are not to be equated with the cross, not worshiped, not revered, but left to this world with other things that are of the world. You alone are to be worshiped, you alone are to be followed, you alone are to be revered, who reigns perpetually in the unity of substance with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
