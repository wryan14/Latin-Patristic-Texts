        Anyone who is easily deceived in great matters will certainly be deceived in small ones; nor is it surprising if he inevitably suffers the blows of very small and almost invisible errors, who cannot avoid the large and easily avoidable impulses of errors. So why is it surprising if Tarasius and the synod, over which he presided, try to equate images with sacred vessels, since they attempt to equate them with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and everything in and around it, as well as with the mystery of the Lord's Cross and the most evident and fitting sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord for our salvation?

        Indeed, this error of equating these sacred vessels could greatly astonish him if he were not already so far gone in error. Therefore, the divine instruments of the law show how much more excellent the vessels dedicated to divine worship are than images. For these were instituted and established by the Lordâ€™s command through Moses in the Tabernacle of Testimony, and later established and dedicated in the Temple of Jerusalem by the most holy David through Solomon, signifying the hidden meanings of types and bearing the duty of long service in matters pertaining to the worship of God.

        However, these images, whether cherubim or oxen and lions, which were not made for worship but for the signification of future things, were not only not instituted or dedicated by any of the saints but are almost universally repudiated by the testimonies of nearly all the oracles of divine law. These vessels, which the holy Church holds for performing the mysteries of our redemption, are always necessary for the faithful and always useful in divine worship.

        Therefore, sacrifices are offered to God in vessels, not in images. Incense, lamps, and other things fitting for divine worship are dedicated in vessels, not in images. Even if there are some images on the vessels, they are not there to be worshiped or because the gift of sacred charismata could become worthless without them, but to make the appearance of the materials more beautiful.

        Finally, without images, the water of baptism and the anointing of sacred oil can be received, incense can be burned, holy places can be illuminated by lamps, and the consecration of the body and blood of the Lord can be effected. But without vessels, never. For even the author of our salvation, when he set the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New, is said to have taken not an image but a cup; and through the prophet, the Lord does not say, "Be clean, you who bear images," but "Be clean, you who bear the vessels of the Lord."

        Therefore, the king of Babylon was not reproved for any offense against an image, but because he took the vessels used in divine worship, which his ancestor had brought from Judea and placed in the temples of his idols, out of the temples during a feast and used them for human purposes, and, struck with the astonishment of a prophetic miracle, heard what was to come to him and felt the loss of his life and kingdom among the hostile forces. Those who know the prophets understand what we are saying.
