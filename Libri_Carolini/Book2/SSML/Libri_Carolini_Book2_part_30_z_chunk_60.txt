      <s>If this error, which tries to equate images with the books of divine Scripture, is compared to their other errors, although it is of great enormity in itself, it is undoubtedly found to be lesser when compared to others, by which they have tried to equate images with the Ark of the Lord, the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord, and the mystery of the cross.</s>
      <s>Especially since neither the former nor the latter can rightly be equated; since the former were preordained before ages by the highest and secret foreknowledge of God, and through the moments of ages were granted for the benefit of human salvation by the manifestation of elements, having holy and venerable men as authors, shining with the lamps of virtues and the insignia of miracles, or certainly the Lord Himself, who granted the mystery of His body and blood or the sacrament of the cross for our salvation.</s>
      <s>But the latter were brought forth by the vanity of pagan authors and provide no manifestation of salvation, no sacramental prerogative for mortals, but only please the eyes, through which the memory of past deeds is entrusted to the heart, as through certain messengers.</s>

    <p>
      <s>At that time when Moses lived with the people of God in the wilderness, and at the command of the Lord was teaching the doctrine of the sacred law and the most sacred rites of ceremonies to the people, and was educating the human race in the worship of God, Cecrops the Fifth, a certain king of the Athenians, seduced by demonic poison, incited the minds of the pagan ignorant to the worship of images and idols and the cults of false gods.</s>
      <s>While the people of God received the commandments of life, he was preparing the souls of the deceived with the cup of eternal death and the seeds of long-lasting error.</s>
      <s>About whom Sedulius says:</s>
      <break time="500ms"/>
      <s>"To those whom deadly evil, to those given over to vain cares, the harmful doctrine of Cecrops' Athens creeps in."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>Hence the use of images, which grew from pagan traditions, ought not and cannot be equated with the books of sacred law, because in these books, not in images, we learn the instruction of spiritual doctrine.</s>
      <s>For the Apostle Paul does not say: "Whatever is painted is painted for our instruction," but says: "Whatever is written is written for our instruction, so that through the patience and consolation of the Scriptures we might have hope in God."</s>
      <s>Nor does he say: "All painting," but: "All Scripture is divinely inspired and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>Finally, on the fiftieth day after the sacrifice of the lamb and the crossing of the Red Sea, the Lord, descending on Mount Sinai, gave the law to Moses, not painted, but written, and on stone tablets delivered not images, but letters, which are considered to be signs of things or symbols of words.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>Likewise, Moses taught the origin of the world not by painting but by writing, and all that he learned through the spirit of prophecy, whether about past events, such as the beginning of the world, the creation of man, the flood, or other patriarchal histories in order, or about things happening in his present time, such as those things done by Balaam and Balak or others who were absent from him, or about future events inspired by the Holy Spirit, such as the transgression of the Jewish people, their captivity, or the coming of Christ, he recorded in five books not by painting but by writing, as commanded by the Lord for future ages.</s>
      <s>Nor is it written about him: "Moses received paintings," but: "Moses received the book and read it in the ears of the people."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>Hence the Apostle writes: "For when every command of the law had been read by Moses to all the people," and shortly after: "He also sprinkled the book and all the people," so that we may know that the lawgiver used not deceitful paintings but most beneficial Scriptures.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>Joshua also, the successor of Moses, who crossed the Jordan with the people of God on dry ground and, after overthrowing the kings of the Canaanite people, divided the land of promise by lot to the children of Israel, and bore the figure of the Mediator between God and men...</s>
    </p>
  <p>When the rites of the old law had been completed, through baptism, he led the people of God to the promised land. With the tyrannies of sins or aerial powers overthrown, he granted the faithful the estates of the heavenly homeland. He recorded all the things that happened to him or the people he led in his time, committing them to the memory of posterity by writing rather than painting.</p>

<p>Samuel, too, a man of great sanctity and excellence, who was granted to his mother after persistent prayer and served in the Lord's tabernacle from his infancy in the prophetic ministry, left a model in appointing kings. He recorded the histories of the Judges, Ruth, and even the Kings up to David not with images but with writings.</p>

<p>And after him, the deeds of David and other kings were written down, either by kings or by prophets of that time, up to Jeremiah. Jeremiah collected all the histories of the kings into one, producing the Book of Kings, which has come down to us not through paintings but through writings.</p>

<p>Likewise, each of the prophets who have books recorded their prophecies not in pictures but in writings for future generations.</p>

<p>Daniel, too, understood in books the number of years that the people of God would be held in Babylonian captivity. He said, "I, Daniel, understood in the books the number of years about which the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet."</p>

<p>David, the saintly prophet, who spoke about Christ's incarnation, birth, passion, death, resurrection, glory, and kingdom, was preferred to the other fathers in the genealogy of the Lord's humanity so that the Lord might be called the Son of David. He sang about Christ more abundantly and openly than the others. It is written, "In the scroll of the book, it is written about me." He did not say "painted" but "written," nor "on the walls" or "on tablets," but "in the scroll of the book."</p>

<p>In the beginning of the book of Genesis, which is certainly the head of all books, it is written: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." By "beginning," it means the Son. He indeed responded to the Jews who asked who he was: "I am the beginning, who also speaks to you."</p>

<p>This can also be understood in the verse of the first psalm, which starts with the incarnation of Christ. Through the definition of the eighth species, which dialecticians call "apophasis" or "denial of the contrary," it demonstrates that Christ did not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, meaning he did not have the detestable thoughts that humanity claims for itself. He did not stand in the way of sinners, meaning he completely avoided sinful actions. Coming into the world, he passed through the world's vices with an immaculate life. He did not sit in the seat of pestilence, meaning he did not spread the venom of pestilential doctrines but healed the wounds of the world with his medicinal preaching.</p>

<p>This psalm, which is the head of the book and in whose head it is written about Christ, is without a title, either because nothing should be put before our head, which is Christ, who is the true beginning, or because this psalm holds the place of the title and preface for the other psalms. Although other psalms say much about Christ, none speaks so fully about his incarnation as this one.</p>
<p>
        In times past, his behavior on earth speaks so clearly. Anyone who defines him through the eighth type of definitions, by what he did not do, will immediately move to the second type of definitions, called "notion" by the artigraphis enneomatiee+, and by what he did, as if by certain signs called into knowledge, not what he is, but what he did, specifically indicating by saying: But his delight was in the law of the Lord, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, since we have been led astray from the cause by the sweetness of the chapter of the book a little further along, it remains that we return to the topic at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us now come to the Gospels! Let us see whether the evangelists or the Lord himself mentioned images or Scriptures? For the evangelist says: As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet. He said "written," not "painted." And in a book, not "on some material." And the same Lord and our Redeemer, while destroying the schemes of the ancient enemy or in many places of his preaching, is said to have presented examples of Scriptures, not paintings.
    </p>
    <p>
        And when a woman caught in the act of adultery was brought to him by a crowd, and the Pharisees, full of deceitful reasoning, which is called inevitable by the teachers of secular letters, avoiding the horns of the dilemma, who neither would be cruel and consent to the shedding of blood by ordering the stoning of the adulteress according to the severity of the legal rigor, nor a transgressor of the law and supporter of sinners by ordering her to be released contrary to the sentence of the law. But just and gentle, he gravely struck them with the weapon of his proposition as a heavenly philosopher. They, fearing to hear their own crimes, left one after another, and it is said that he did not paint with his finger in the earth, but wrote, so that, with whose finger the law was written on stone to signify the hardness of the hearts of the Jews, with the same finger the evangelical law would be written in the hearts of the Gentiles, which, receiving the seeds of the divine word, bring forth worthy fruits daily to their Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, through the stone tablets, the rigor of the Old Testament and the hardness of the Israelite nation, and through the earth written by the Lord's finger, the soft hearts of the Gentiles and the sweetness of the New Testament were indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the apostles, about whom it was said through the prophet: How beautiful are the feet of those who announce peace and preach salvation. They went forth weeping, sowing their seeds, who, through many temporal tribulations, sowed the seeds of the divine word and will return with rejoicing at the general judgment, bringing sheaves – that is, the peoples converted to the teachings of faith through their preaching. They are read to have sent letters to various parts of the world, not images; nor did they call back humankind from the worship of idols to the purity of true faith through paintings, but through writings, by which the Redeemer opened their understanding, not to understand paintings, but scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
        For it is written: Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. It is also read in the gospel: Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that, believing, you may have life in his name. John, who, drawing the heavenly nectar streams from the bosom of the Lord, offered the heavenly cups to thirsty hearts, when he was exiled to the island of Patmos by Caesar’s orders and received the taste of the Lord’s cup promised to him before, and, filled with heavenly mysteries, heard or saw certain secrets revealed by the Lord, was ordered to write these in a book, not to paint them. And he admonished the seven churches, representing one holy, catholic, and apostolic church, filled with the sevenfold grace of the Spirit, not by painting, but by writing. For it was said to him by the thunderous voice from above: What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence, it is understood that writings, not paintings, are given for the instruction of our faith. How then it is unwise and irrational to...
    </p>


  <p>
    Just as we keep the books of the Holy Scriptures for remembrance and veneration, 
    so too do we keep images for the same purpose. 
    Anyone who has knowledge of the Holy Scriptures can easily understand this. 
    In them are found the weapons with which we fight against adversities, 
    suppress vices, raise virtues, control the desires of gluttony through vigilance and heartfelt compunction, 
    restrain fornication with contrition of heart and bodily affliction, 
    through the insistence of prayers, exercise of labor, fear of punishments, or the love of the eternal homeland; 
    overcome envy with the love of brotherly affection and the desire for the heavenly kingdom, 
    which can only be attained by those who are in harmony; 
    break anger with the seriousness of the most modest patience and the power of reason and equanimity; 
    drive out avarice with alms and the hope of eternal reward; 
    dispel sadness with brotherly conversations, constant readings, and prayers; 
    ward off arrogance with the fear of losing virtues, without which they cannot be held, 
    and the approach of vain glory, which is the enemy of virtues; 
    crush pride with the fear of diabolical ruin and the example of Christ's humility. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In them are found the tools of the fruits of justice, that is, charity, joy, peace, patience, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty, and self-control. 
    In them is found the remedy by which neither the wise, boasting in their wisdom, nor the strong, trusting in their strength, are lost, 
    nor the simple or weak are cast down in their inability; 
    by which neither excessive joy exalts the happy nor excessive grief affects the sad; 
    by which neither the wealth of the rich makes them proud nor the need of the poor crushes them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In them is found the standard by which it is established how prelates should act towards their subjects and subjects towards their prelates, 
    how marriages are to be loved, how secular matters are to be handled with prudent deliberation, 
    how the homeland is to be defended, enemies repelled, and the administration of both foreign and domestic affairs conducted. 
    To sum it up briefly, in them are contained both the perpetual nourishment of the soul and the teachings and wisdom for present life, 
    which are the adornment of life, and the instructions for eternal life. 
    It is indeed a treasure lacking no good, overflowing with all goods, to which anyone who devoutly approaches, 
    whatever they faithfully seek, they happily find they have acquired.
  </p>
  <p>
    If anyone is delighted by the love of worldly wisdom and secular learning, let them come to the storerooms of the divine law. 
    Just as the wise of the world are distinguished by the height of their merits, so too does it precede in time and the depths of liberal studies. 
    What they know, they will be glad to have known, and what they do not know, they will be glad to have found. 
    There they will find the decorum of correct speech, the etymologies of names, the varieties of figures of speech, and the perplexities of tropes. 
    As the blessed Augustine says: 
    <break time="500ms"/> 
    "Let the learned know the modes of speaking, which the grammarians call tropes by the Greek name, were used by the authors of the Holy Scriptures. 
    These tropes, that is, modes of speaking, when recognized, bring some help in understanding the holy letters.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    They will also find histories and meters, which all properly belong to the art of grammar. 
    But perhaps someone will say: 
    <break time="500ms"/> 
    "I do not find the scansions of meters and the precise measures of times there.” 
    Let them recognize that there are many meters and many rhythms in the Holy Scriptures, 
    but the translation of language does not allow the intervals of times in the foreign language to be the same as in the original, 
    although it retains the same meanings and properties of things. 
    For if someone repays us gold, it does not matter much if it is not of the same coin as what was received, 
    as long as it is of the same weight and brightness. 
    As we have learned from the teachings of the blessed Jerome, an expert in the Hebrew language, 
    some of the Holy Scripture runs in dactyl and spondee, some in anapest, and some in iambic according to the strictness of the art.
  </p>
  <p>
    There too, you will find the brilliance and abundance of eloquence, the types and statuses of causes; 
    there the beginnings, by which listeners become benevolent, teachable, or attentive; 
    there the narrations, both open and brief, closed and long, which are only...
  </p>


  <p>
    When the Holy Spirit reveals, things are opened; there are conclusions where the nature of things is shown, arguments that stir the hearts of listeners to fulfill what is being said. There are laws or judgments, great things expressed grandly, small things modestly, and moderate things with restraint. There you will find personification, character portrayal, and all the figures of speech taught by rhetoricians, and many more, grander ones that you will be glad to have understood, which neither the schools of grammar nor rhetoric could reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    There too you will find introductions that usefully guide the reader in investigating things; categories that excel in the usefulness of predicates for investigating things; definitions or ways of syllogisms that affirm with subtle investigation those things in doubt. Topics that, being sources of meanings and origins of words, provide arguments commonly to grammarians, poets, orators, and even philosophers, which not only adhere to scholarly speech but also to common and conversational speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    For although speech may be conversational or common, if it is used for any practical purpose of life, it will come to topics. Through these, as through certain teachings, local rules are found by which one cannot or should not stray. In these too, you will recognize that you have found the limits that are difficult to transgress without loss of meaning. And to say it briefly, all speech, unless it comes to topics, will undoubtedly remain indefinite.
  </p>
  <p>
    There you will find interpretations, whose intricate paths and detailed diversions reveal the depth of meanings and the affirmation of doubts, and from which arises the forest of syllogisms and other arguments, all of which are properly the art of dialectics. There, in numbers through the art of arithmetic, you will find the secrets and depths of meanings, since the same Scripture says that God made everything in measure, number, and weight.
  </p>
  <p>
    There too you will find not only the harmonies of music and the instruments that many of the holy fathers used, but also the inventor. You will also find the locations and dimensions of lands, which are properly the art of geometry. Moreover, the courses and positions of some stars, the variations of times, months, and years, or the cycles of hours, even the day and cause of the condition of stars, which are properly the art of astronomy, will be found there by any diligent person.
  </p>
  <p>
    But perhaps someone will say: Neither the names of the principal disciplines nor the individual parts of each discipline nor the members of each part are found in the sacred writings. To which it should be briefly replied that everything can be found in the vast fields of the holy Scriptures in parts, which writers of arts have placed in the rows of their gardens. They are found, I say, in the power of meanings, not in the proclamation of words; in the depths of roots, not in the falling of leaves. For in the depth of the divine Scriptures, the liberal arts are perceived by the diligent, just as wines in vines, crops in seeds, leaves in roots, fruits in branches, and the sizes of trees are contemplated in their cores.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly, the divine Scripture is true, it is fixed, it is chaste, it is the instrument of heavenly teaching, and eternal proclamation shining with the purest eloquence. It is the light of mortals as the prophet says: "Your word is a lamp to my feet, Lord, and a light to my paths." It is living and knows no death as the Apostle says: "The word of God is living and effective, sharper than any double-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit." It is the dispeller of darkness as Solomon attests, who says: "The commandment of the law is a lamp and a light of life and reproof and discipline." About which it is said through Isaiah: “My spirit watches for you during the night, God, because your commands are light on the earth.” For it always commands vital things, forbids harmful things, removes earthly things, and persuades heavenly things.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is, I say, a fountain springing from the heavenly margin, from which the more it is drawn, the less it is expended, and the more it is distributed into many parts. The more it increases in meanings; it is money...
  </p>


    <p>
        The purse, from which neither the things given are lost nor does the constant use of giving bring about a decrease, but the more it is emptied with the devotion to giving, the more it is filled.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of these things we have touched upon, nor of similar things which we have omitted for the sake of brevity, can be found in images, O worshiper of images, O devotee of senseless things. Since these things lack all the merits, you should be pitied rather than admired for trying to compare them to the books of divine Scripture, where so many good things are found. You, who say you preserve the purity of your faith in images, remember to stand before them with incense; let us seek diligently the precepts of the Lord in the holy law books! You examine the pictures in the lamps; let us frequent the holy Scriptures! You be a devotee of painted colors; let us be devotees and understanders of profound meanings! You soothe yourself with painted tablets: let us be soothed by divine speeches! You insist on the figures of things, which have neither sight nor hearing nor taste nor smell nor touch; let us insist on the divine law, which is irreproachable, in which the testimony of the Lord's righteousness and his precepts, fear, and judgments are found!
    </p>
    <p>
        The psalmist beautifully defined each of these attributes through the figure of the seventh, which dialecticians call 'by translation', because it shows what a thing is with a brief description, under the perfection of the number six, which is considered perfect according to the experience of arithmetic because it is measured by its parts and when these are put back together into one, it returns to itself without any loss or increase. He thus defined it, saying: 
        <break time="1s"/> "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting souls; the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether, more to be desired than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb."
        <break time="1s"/> All these are adorned by the perfection of the number six, because, although they seem somewhat different from each other, they all pertain to the perfection of the law, by which holy men are made perfect. Just as the number six is not fulfilled if one is subtracted, so the integrity of perfection is mutilated if anything is taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the law is irreproachable because it consists of perfect truth, which is not reproached but rather proven to be fulfilled by the Savior: "I did not come," he says, "to abolish the law, but to fulfill it." And so that we might understand that the gospel is also the law of the Lord and that the law consists of the two Testaments, both the new and the old, he added: "Converting souls," because the page of the Old Testament has the rigor of irreproachable severity, while the new has the calling and gentleness through which erring souls are corrected and converted to Christ's grace. Therefore, the testimony of the Lord is faithful, because whatever God promises is fulfilled with the utmost truth. This testimony gives wisdom to the simple, not to the proud nor to those boasting with swollen arrogance, but to those simple ones of whom the Apostle says: "Do not be children in your thinking, be infants in evil." Thus, the Father gives testimony, the Son gives testimony, and the Holy Spirit gives testimony; and just as they are of one essence and nature, so also they are sublime in giving testimony. It is read in the gospel that the Father gave testimony about the Son; the Apostle writes to Timothy about the Son: "I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate." The same Apostle says about the Holy Spirit: "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit." Therefore, the statutes of the Lord are right because he is known to have done nothing other than what he taught, nor is there anything different in his words and his deeds. They rejoice the heart because they soothe the minds of the just with the promise of eternal rewards. This reward was hoped for by the one who said: "From now on, <break time="1s"/>."
    </p>


  <p>
    There is a crown of righteousness reserved for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the commandment of the Lord is rightly called light, either because it proceeds from the Father of lights or because it makes people enlightened. It also illuminates the eyes, not the physical eyes, which animals share with us, but the inner eyes, which are spiritually enlightened by the divine gift.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring forever; love mixed with fear is called reverence in common usage. Therefore, anyone who is known to fear and love their judge lives in all holiness.
  </p>

  <p>
    The difference between the fear of the Lord and human dread is that human dread changes with time—of which it is said: Perfect love casts out fear—but the fear of the Lord does not change with temporal conversion but persists in the same state with the sincerity of a good conscience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, the judgments of God, which are true and justified in themselves as described by the prophet, are His commandments, which are written in the Old and New Testaments because they are truly issued from judgment. True, I say, and justified because they make their observers truthful and justified.
  </p>

  <p>
    The difference between God's judgment and His judgments is that the singular judgment is the general examination, while His judgments in the plural are the sacraments found in the two Testaments, not in images nor paintings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The psalmist expressed this by a figure of speech called auxesis in Greek, meaning increase, as it gradually grows to higher things, saying: They are more desirable than gold and many precious stones and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Just as precious stones are valued higher than gold, so honey and the honeycomb are preferred in sweetness to gold and precious stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this figure, the same psalmist praises his protector, his glory, and the one who lifts up his head, saying: But you, Lord, are my protector, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the Apostle says: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or persecution? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or peril? Or sword? In which the greatness of the matter gradually increases through the accumulation of words.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although a similar figure called climax in Greek and gradation in Latin is near, where certain steps are always added in praise or blame, it differs significantly because auxesis increases without any repetition of names, whereas climax repeats the last word of the first clause in the following member, thus linking one to another like a chain, as the Apostle says: Knowing that tribulation produces patience, and patience, character, and character, hope; and hope does not disappoint; likewise: For whom he foreknew, he also predestined; and whom he predestined, he also called; and whom he called, he also justified; and whom he justified, he also glorified.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if perhaps you, a lover or rather an adorer of images, murmur inwardly with bitterness, saying: 'What is the need to wander so much through figures of speech?' you will recognize that these are more pleasant to us than your images or painted tablets, and that is why we have wandered through them. For we and other lovers of the Scriptures find these delights and refreshments in the Scriptures or their figures, which you and your companions do not find in images or tablets, where you claim to preserve the purity of your heart.
