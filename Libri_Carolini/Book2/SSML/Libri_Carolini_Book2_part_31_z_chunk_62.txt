<p>Ultimately, those who presume to equate these images to the body and blood of the Lord are driven by such love for them that they do not hesitate to anathematize their parents known to have despised these images, connecting error to error. They display inappropriate and disorderly adoration to the images and impose an improper curse on those from whom they were born through the flesh or by whose consecration and baptism they received other charisms.</p>

<p>If, according to their madness, all who lack the adoration of images are heretics, it is evident that their ancestors, who did not adore them, were heretics. If their ancestors were heretics, they neither had the power to perform consecrations nor to lay hands. If they did not have this power, those who believe they received this power from them neither possess consecration nor the laying on of hands.</p>

<p>Similarly, if their predecessors, as they say, were worthy of the bond of anathema, they did not have the power to bind and loose. If they did not have this power, everything they did in the church must be annulled. If everything must be denied, then their ranks and ordinations must be denied. If their predecessors were worthy of the bond of anathema, their ranks and ordinations must be annulled. For we read that the power to bind and loose was granted by the Lord not to those bound by schism and anathema, but to those who are qualified and Catholic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the legal, prophetic, apostolic, and even evangelical admonition teaches us to honor our parents, as the Lord says: <break time="500ms"/> "Honor your father and your mother." For He who gave this saving commandment both through the text of the Old Testament and through His bodily presence also proclaimed through Moses saying: <break time="500ms"/> "Blessed is he who honors his father and mother," and conversely: <break time="500ms"/> "Cursed is he who does not honor his father and mother."</p>

<p>Hence, it must be carefully considered how arrogant and reckless, and I might say, criminal it is to anathematize one's parents if even he who is proven not to honor them is subject to a curse. For as the law says: <break time="500ms"/> "Do not expose the nakedness of your father," and the Apostle says: <break time="500ms"/> "Children, obey your parents." They seem to oppose both commandments by neither concealing the shame nor striving to impart honor.</p>

<p>Therefore, the sacred canons seem to have delivered this verdict about not despising parents, excluding every excuse: <break time="500ms"/> "Whoever sons abandon their parents under the pretext of divine worship, let them be anathema." If those who do not show the due reverence to their parents are anathematized, with what binding of damnation do you think those who anathematize their parents are connected?</p>

<p>The most beneficial practice handed down by the holy fathers to the churches is to pray to the Lord for the souls of the deceased. Embracing this with the saints and the entire Catholic and universal church, we implore the most merciful compassion of the Lord not only for the souls of our parents but also for the souls of faithful friends who have gone before us in the Lord's peace.</p>

<p>Those who try not to aid the souls of their deceased parents with prayers but instead bind them with the bond of anathema seem to oppose this venerable and ecclesiastical constitution. Those who are commanded by apostolic teaching to pray even for their enemies refuse to do this for their own parents. We beseech pardon for our parents according to the ecclesiastical practice through the insistence of prayers and alms; they wish punishment for theirs through gatherings of useless councils. We seek rest for our parents through the solemnities of masses; they heap abuse on theirs through disorderly councils. We keep the memory of our parents in prayer.</p>



    <p>They curse their own with a certain renunciation, <break time="500ms"/> we pray for the rest of our spirits in the bosom of Abraham. They wish the souls of their own to be condemned with Arius, Sabellius, Dioscorus, Nestorius, and Eutyches. We ask for our parents to be placed among the ranks of the blessed, <break time="500ms"/> they wish theirs among the stubborn crowds of heretics.</p>
    
    <p>Since this is the case, it is clear that they commit a double offense in this matter, as they both dishonor their parents against the command of the Lord's voice, and against the Apostle's judgment, attempting to pass a reckless judgment on those who have passed from this world.</p>
    
    <p>This is the judgment of the blessed Paul: <break time="500ms"/> "None of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone. If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. It is written: 'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.' So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister." <break time="500ms"/> (Romans 14:7-13)</p>
    
    <p>Regarding this matter, the holy bishops of the Roman Church, Anastasius, are said to have written to Emperor Anastasius: <break time="500ms"/> "It must be known to your tranquility that there should be no stumbling block in the church, as we attempt to judge those who have already passed away, which we cannot do."</p>
    
    <p>Since parents should not be dishonored by their children and the dead should not be recklessly judged by the living, this is proclaimed in the pages of the holy Scriptures.</p>
    
    <p>Now, with the eye of the mind, it must be carefully considered how much the error of children in the abolishment or veneration of the aforementioned images differs from the error of their parents, as the errors of both are in constant conflict. They judged these images to be torn down and despised by the church with perpetual renunciation; these people not only keep them but also strive to venerate them with humble adoration. They consigned these images to crackling fires; these people honor them with fragrant incense. They avoided even looking at them; these people do not cease to embrace them. They dug up images established in the walls for the ornament of the church by the ancients; these people illuminate recently established images with offered lights. They strove to completely abominate them; these people decree that they must be kissed. They anathematized those who possessed them; these people, on the contrary, anathematize those who do not adore them.</p>
    
    <p>Since these two evils are opposed to each other and far removed from the right path, it remains for us, walking the royal road according to the Apostle, not to turn to the right or to the left, so that we neither decree them to be completely abolished nor to be adored, but only worship God and venerate His saints according to the ancient tradition of the fathers and the church, keeping them in the church as an ornament and a memorial of deeds if desired, and with justice despising on the one hand severity, on the other adulation, with prudence avoiding on the one hand cunning, on the other dullness, with temperance rejecting on the one hand lust, on the other insensitivity, with fortitude casting aside on the one hand timidity, on the other audacity.</p>
    
    <p>With the holy fathers, who allowed these images only as ornaments of the church, disregarding those who adore on the one hand and those who abominate on the other, let us hold to the path of the Lord's commandments, so that, with His help, we may be able to reach Him who is the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
