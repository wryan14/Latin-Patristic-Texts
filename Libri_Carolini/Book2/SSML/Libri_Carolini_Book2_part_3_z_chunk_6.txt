<p>The City of God is sometimes figuratively understood in sacred scriptures as the soul of a person, which is inhabited by God, as the Scripture says: <s>"I will dwell in them,"</s> and again: <s>"The soul is the seat of wisdom."</s> Sometimes it is understood as the church of the present time, which is nourished by the stream of grace, to which it is said through the prophet: <s>"If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand wither."</s> Often it is understood as the heavenly Jerusalem, which is built by the ranks of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, and other faithful. About this, it is said by the Apostle: <s>"But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother."</s> To which also the Lord promises through the prophet Isaiah: <s>"For your sun shall no more go down, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for the Lord will be your everlasting light."</s> This city, which John in the Apocalypse says he saw descending from heaven, adorned with its jewels. About whose happiness almost innumerable things could be said, which this brief style cannot digest.</p>
<p>In this city, the images of the wicked will be reduced to nothing, because their appearance cannot appear before the divine sights; but just as they polluted the image of the Lord in the course of this present life, so in the heavenly Jerusalem their image will not appear, who indeed will be consigned to eternal fire. About whom it is said elsewhere by the Psalmist: <s>"And man, when he was in honor, did not understand; he was compared to the senseless animals and became like them,"</s> because, although he was in such honor that he was created in the image and likeness of God, by not understanding he was so degraded by vices that he was not unjustly compared to irrational animals.</p>
<p>Therefore, the images of the wicked are reduced to nothing, when the Truth itself withdraws from them, and they are alienated from its light, unable to retain the likeness, whose happiness they are known to lack entirely. Because of their deceitfulness, he said the evils appointed to them above, because God, the just judge, renders to each according to his works. He also said they were cast down, that they might not be lifted up, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. He said they suddenly failed and perished because of their iniquity, like a dream upon waking, because as in some illusions mortals' hearts are deceived in dreams and they rejoice as if they suddenly possess desired things - whether one attains a desired kingdom, or someone is raised to a coveted office, or someone is suddenly enriched, fleeing poverty, or someone enjoys a desired marriage, or a sick person rejoices to have regained lost limbs, or a criminal rejoices to be considered honorable, or an ignoble person to be noble, or a foolish person to consider himself wise, and upon waking, they suddenly lose what they acquired while sleeping, and they grieve to find their eyes open and not see what they rejoiced to see with them closed - so the happiness of the wicked seems in a way like a dream, because after a short time it will not be seen; and just as upon waking they lose what they had acquired through a dream, so upon dying they lose what they seemed to have, because the deceptive joy they obtained vanishes in a moment, and they cannot hold onto the vain and, so to speak, smoky joys of the world for long.</p>
<p>Because of their impieties, the prophet, kindled with a certain severity, added: <s>"Lord, in your city you will reduce their image to nothing,"</s> meaning that those who polluted the beauty of your character with evil works, their faces will not be seen in your city, where there is eternal happiness, supreme blessedness, perpetual joy; in whose palaces reigns the king, whose kingdom will have no end, whose seats shine with the council of patriarchs, whose court glows with the assembly of prophets, whose walls are adorned with the numerous army of martyrs, whose gates are decorated with the gatherings of apostles, whose streets overflow with choirs of virgins, whose domiciles are filled with the legions of confessors, which does not need the sun, because the Lord.</p>


  The light is His, through whom all paths are sung with <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌælɨˈluːjə">Alleluia</phoneme>.
