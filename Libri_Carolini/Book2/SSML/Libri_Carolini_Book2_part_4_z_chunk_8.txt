            This has been recklessly and flatteringly claimed by John the Presbyter and delegate of the Easterners to have been fulfilled in the presence of the venerable Pope Adrian and Patriarch Tarasius!

            David, the most eloquent of the prophets, elegantly sings that mercy and truth have met together, and righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

        <s>
            This is ultimately confirmed to be fulfilled when, after the incarnation of the Lord, the two Testaments were brought together in the union of one covenant.

            Although they may seem different in some ways, they are known to converge in Christ, who is our peace and who made both one.

            In this context, mercy is where humanity is liberated by grace, and truth is where the proclamation of the law and the prophets is contained.

            These two are said to have met not to create opposition but to fulfill the grace of the promised perfection.

            It is understood as one act, which is shown to be divided by time.

        <s>
            To express this covenant clearly, David doubled this very concept with various repetitions, indicating that righteousness and peace immediately came into mutual agreement through a kind of love.

            This verse, based on its attribution to the body <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="soʊˈmætəˌpiə">somatopoeia</phoneme>, is understood to be spoken as if giving bodies to incorporeal things and by metaphor.

            Metaphor is the transfer of words and things, often transferring from animate to inanimate, inanimate to animate, and vice versa.
        </s>
        <s>
            These two figures of speech differ in that one attributes bodies to incorporeal things, and the other attributes members, movements, and forms to both corporeal and incorporeal things.

            John the Presbyter recklessly and flatteringly uttered this verse in the presence of the venerable Pope Adrian and Tarasius, the Bishop of Constantinople. 
        </s>
        <s>
            Although he was of lesser honor than the bishops present in the same synod, he is nevertheless read as not being lesser in error.

        <s>
            Even if they surpassed him in the rank of dignity, he exceeded them in verbose impudence and could not be surpassed by superiors in reckless talkativeness, though he was surpassed by them in pontifical dignity.

        <s>
            He is believed to have committed a double offense: either because he tried to twist the words full of the mysteries spoken by the Holy Spirit into human matters with a superstitious intention of worshiping images, or because he fell into the miserable vice of flattery with a perverse intention.

        <s>
            This vice of flattery was feared by the most noble of the prophets who said: "Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. But let the oil of the sinner not anoint my head."
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, another scripture also rightly says: "It is better to be chastised by a righteous person than to be praised by a sinner," and again: "Those who call you happy lead you astray," because flatterers praise to seduce, not to provoke to eternal happiness, which indeed needs no good.
