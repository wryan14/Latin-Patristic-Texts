    <s>With this verse from the Psalms, the error that has grown so strong in some people's hearts—to the extent that they hold councils to establish it and try to support it with testimonies from the Holy Scriptures—believes it can defend itself when it hears that the footstool of the Lord is to be worshiped.</s>
    <s>They think they have a helmet protecting the head so it does not feel the sword's strikes; they believe they have a breastplate protecting the rest of the body so it does not suffer from arrows; they think they have a shield that guards them from harmful flying missiles.</s>
    <s>But either by succumbing or hiding, they will find themselves stripped of these defenses, as they have misused them in vain and uselessly, and will feel the force of the spiritual sword wielded by holy men, to the point where they will not even believe they have any strength left.</s>

    <s>Is it because the prophet says to worship the "footstool of the Lord" that the worship of images should be established?</s>
    <s>What is the similarity between the footstool of the Lord and material images?</s>
    <s>Or what connection is there between the indescribable works of God and images created by any artists?</s>
    <s>Or what association is there between such an excellent and splendid mystery and lifeless figures made by human ingenuity?</s>
    <s>Or where is it established that images should be worshiped, just as it is established that the footstool of the Lord should be worshiped?</s>

  <p>
    <s>David does not say: "Worship images of certain saints," as he says: "Worship the footstool of the Lord"; nor does the Lord say: "The works of human hands are my seat, and images are the footstool of my feet": but he says: "Heaven is my seat, and the earth is the footstool of my feet."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Listen then, most foolish and rather insane error, listen, incomparable madness, listen, ridiculous sluggishness, listen to the blessed Ambrose teaching what the footstool of the Lord's feet is or how it should be worshiped.</s>
    <s>The apostles worshiped the Lord because they bore witness to faith and received the teaching of faith.</s>
    <s>The angels also worshiped, of whom it is written: "Let all God's angels worship him."</s>
    <s>They worship not only His divinity but also the footstool of His feet, for He is holy.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>And a little later: But lest someone mock the proposed example by escaping it, let us consider by what reason it seems to refer to the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, which the prophet says: "Worship the footstool of His feet."</s>
    <s>We should not evaluate the footstool according to human use.</s>
    <s>For God is not corporeal or limited, as if we should think of a footstool placed under His feet; nor do we read that anything should be worshiped except God, for it is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him."</s>
    <s>How then could the prophet, who was brought up and educated in the law, command something contrary to the law?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, it is not a trivial question, and we should carefully consider what the footstool is.</s>
    <s>We read elsewhere: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet."</s>
    <s>But we are not to worship the earth, because it is God's creation.</s>
    <s>Yet, let us see if the prophet means that the earth which the Lord Jesus took upon Himself in His incarnation should be worshiped.</s>
    <s>Therefore, by the footstool, the earth is understood; by the earth, the flesh of Christ, which we worship today in the mysteries and which the apostles worshiped in the Lord Jesus, as we said above.</s>
    <s>For Christ is not divided, but one; nor, when He was worshiped as the Son of God, was He denied to be born of a virgin.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Since, therefore, the sacrament of the incarnation is to be worshiped, and the incarnation is the work of the Holy Spirit, as it is written: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God."</s>
    <s>This footstool of the Lord's feet, Saint Augustine, a most diligent inquirer, asserted should be understood as the body of the Lord, which He took from the Virgin Mary, as the footstool of His divinity, due to the nature of the humanity He deigned to assume, which is certainly subject to and protected by that power.</s>

    <p>
        It is evident to all creatures that it is higher, as the Apostle says, <s>'What is foolish of God is stronger than men.'</s> 
        And elsewhere, about the same Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, the Apostle says: <s>'For this reason, God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bend, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.'</s> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, by the majesty of the Lord's feet in this verse, the stability of divinity, which always remains in its own omnipotent glory like the unwavering firmness of the feet, is understood.
    </p>
    <p>
        The feet of the Lord can also be understood metaphorically as the final times when the Lord deigned to become incarnate. Hence, the evangelist John says: <s>'Little children, it is the last hour.'</s> 
        Paul the Apostle also says: <s>'When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law.'</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be noted, certainly, that it does not say: <s>'because it is holy,'</s> but: <s>'because he is holy,'</s> namely, that the body of the Lord should not be separated from divinity, keeping the properties of each nature intact, but referred to the person. Hence, the Gospel says: <s>'The Word became flesh and lived among us.'</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        These brief statements about the footstool of the Lord's feet are sufficient. Now let us move on to the other matters.
