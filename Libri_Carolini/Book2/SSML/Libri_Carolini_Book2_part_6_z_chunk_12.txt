        Even if he commanded worship at the mountain, it would not mean the worship of images, but the understanding of the Lord Jesus Christ by sane minds, who is a mountain higher than all other mountains. His height and virtue surpass the heights and virtues of all saints. About Him, it is said through the prophet Isaiah: <break time="500ms"/> 'In the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will stream to it, and many peoples will come.'

        Therefore, it is said: <break time="500ms"/> 'Worship at his holy mountain,' <break time="500ms"/> because it is not the mountain itself but the Lord whom the prophet commands to be worshiped at the holy mountain, which can be referred to Mount Zion, which is the church. It can be said that this is the highest and holiest of mountains, whose inhabitant is Christ. Hence, the holy Lord commands worship on the holy mountain because, just as His praise is sung in perfect harmony, so too can no disgrace be appropriate in His worship.

        We therefore worship at His holy mountain, not images or certain superstitious things, but the Lord Himself, who is the head of that mountain. To acquire the same mountain, He deemed it worthy not only to be born but also to die. About this, it is said through the prophet: <break time="500ms"/> 'He led them into the mountain of His holiness, this mountain which His right hand acquired,' <break time="500ms"/> and about this, it is said through the lawgiver: <break time="500ms"/> 'Bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance, in the place, Lord, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established. The Lord will reign forever and ever.'
