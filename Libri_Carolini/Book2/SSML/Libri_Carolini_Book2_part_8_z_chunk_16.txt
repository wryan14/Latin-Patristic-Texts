    We wanted to include this verse individually in our work because, although it is part of a single psalm with the previous verse, it has a different meaning. And although it has been brought up by some to support a particular error, it is clearly placed in a different context in the often-mentioned synod reading. Therefore, those who turn to sin are not those who scorn the superstitious worship of images, but those who are ensnared by the bonds of the ancient enemy, becoming more prone to iniquity.

    The more they are known to sin, the more tightly they are bound by diabolic spirits. Hence, a wise person says: "Each one is bound by the ropes of their sins."
  </p>
  <p>
    The holy prophet Isaiah also speaks of this bondage: "Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as if with cart ropes!"
  </p>
  <p>
    So those who turn to this bondage will be led by the Lord to those who commit iniquity, because they will be condemned in the future along with those they sin with in this world. They will go to the eternal fire, which is prepared for the author of crimes and his angels, as they neglected to break the bonds of sin in this world.

    May He, who redeemed us into freedom and showed a great light to us sitting in darkness, make us free from this bondage. To those dwelling in the shadow of death, He rose as the true light. May He also make us free from this severe condemnation, who made us followers of His clear faith, hope, and love.
