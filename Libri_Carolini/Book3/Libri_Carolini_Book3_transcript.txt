Chapter 1:The confession of the Catholic faith received from the holy fathers
We also believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created, the God of all things, the only-begotten Son of God, not made or adopted, but begotten and of one substance with the Father, so as to be equal in all things to God the Father, and cannot be inferior in time, rank, or power.
We confess that He is as great as the one who begot Him.
But we do not assign any time to the divine and ineffable generation of the Son from the Father, nor do we say that the Father or the Son ever began to exist.
We cannot confess the Father as eternal unless we also confess the Son as co-eternal: the Son is called the Son by the Father, and He who has always been the Father has always had the Son.
We also believe in the Holy Spirit, God proceeding from the Father, equal in all things to the Father and the Son in will, power, eternity, and substance.
There is absolutely no rank in the Trinity, nothing that can be said to be inferior or superior; but the whole divinity is equal in its perfection.
So, except for the terms that indicate the properties of the persons, whatever is said of one person can be worthily understood of the three.
And thus we confound Arius, saying that the substance of the Trinity is one and the same, and we confess one God in three persons.
This avoids the impiety of Sabellius by distinguishing three persons under their properties, not saying that the Father is Himself the Son, or Himself the Holy Spirit, but stating that the person of the Father is different from the Son and the Holy Spirit.
We confess not only the names but also the properties of the names, that is, the persons, or as the Greeks express it, hypostasis, that is, subsistences.
The Father does not exclude the person of the Son or the Holy Spirit; nor does the Son or the Holy Spirit receive the name or person of the Father.
But the Father is always the Father, the Son is always the Son, and the Holy Spirit is always the Holy Spirit.
Therefore, the substance of these things is one, but they are distinguished by persons and names.
However, we say that the Son of God, who possesses eternity without beginning with the Father and the Holy Spirit, at the end of the ages assumed perfect human nature from Mary, ever virgin, and became flesh, assuming man without changing His divinity.
Nor, as some very wickedly think, do we say that the Holy Spirit was the seed, but that He worked by the power and virtue of the Creator.
Thus we confess in Christ one person of the Son, saying that there are two perfect and complete substances, that is, divinity and humanity, which consists of soul and body.
And as we condemn Photinus, who confesses only a mere man in Christ, so we anathematize Apollinaris and his followers, who say that the Son of God assumed less of human nature, either in the flesh or in the soul or in the senses, and that the assumed man was unlike those for whom He was assumed, whom we confess to be like us except for the stain of sin, which is not natural.
We also similarly abhor the blasphemy of those who try to assert that from the time the flesh was assumed, all that belonged to divinity migrated into the man, and again, that all that belonged to humanity was transferred into God.
So that, which no heresy ever dared to say, by this confusion both substances, divinity and humanity, seem to be emptied and changed from their proper state into another, who confess both an imperfect God in the Son and an imperfect man, so that neither God is believed to be held nor man.
But we say that what was assumed by the Son of God was passible, while the divinity remained impassible.
For the Son suffered truly, not feignedly, all that Scripture testifies, that is, hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, death, and other such things; according to that which could suffer, that is, not according to that substance which assumed, but according to that which was assumed.
For the Son of God Himself, according to divinity, is as impassible as the Father, as incomprehensible as the Father, as invisible as the Father, and as unchangeable as the Father. And although the personal property of the Son, that is, the Word of God, assumed a passible man, yet by His indwelling, according to His supreme substance, the divinity of the Word suffered nothing, just as the whole Trinity, which we must confess to be impassible.
Therefore, the Son of God died according to the Scriptures in the way that He was able to die. He rose on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father, retaining the same nature of flesh in which He was born, suffered, and also rose again. The substance of humanity was not destroyed but glorified and will remain in the eternal kingdom of God. Having received from the Father power over all things in heaven and on earth, He will return to judge the living and the dead, to reward the righteous and punish sinners.
We believe in the resurrection of the flesh, so we say that we will be restored in the same reality of our bodies as we are now, and that we will remain forever as we will be made after the resurrection. There is one life for the saints, but different rewards for their labor; conversely, there are also punishments for sinners according to the measure of their sins.
We hold baptism, which should be celebrated with the same sacramental words in infants as in adults. We believe that a person, if they have fallen after baptism, can be saved through repentance. We accept the Old and New Testament in the number of books that the authority of the holy catholic church has handed down.
We believe that souls are given by God, which we say are made by Him, and we anathematize those who say that souls are a part of the divine substance of God. We also condemn the error that says souls existed and were conversing in heaven before they were sent into bodies.
We also detest the blasphemy that says it is impossible for a person to be commanded by God to do something, and that God's commandments can be kept not by individuals but by all in common, or that first marriages are condemned by the Manicheans or second marriages by the Cataphrygians.
We anathematize those who say that the Son of God sinned out of necessity due to the flesh and that He could not do all that He willed because He took on human nature. We also condemn the heresy of Jovinian, who says there will be no distinction between the merits of individuals in the future, and that we will not possess the virtues there that we neglected here.
We confess free will, and we say that we always need God's help, and we reject those who, with the Manicheans, say that humans cannot avoid sin, and those who, with the Jovinians, assert that humans can avoid sin. Both positions deny the freedom of will. We say that humans can always both sin and avoid sin, so we always confess our free will.
This is the true integrity of the faith of the catholic tradition, which we sincerely believe and confess, and we have expressed this in the words of blessed Jerome in this work. This is the true faith, this is the confession we preserve and hold. Whoever keeps this confession unwaveringly and unstained will have eternal salvation.
Chapter 2: That Tarasius attempted to cover one mistake with another
After moving from one ailment to another, suddenly going from a layman to a bishop, he tried to fix the mistake of his abrupt consecration by promoting image worship.
The old method of experienced doctors is to treat one ailment with frequent medications without causing another issue. Just as some treatments might weaken one area but strengthen another, spiritual caretakers should remove some vices without allowing others to grow.
The pestilent growth of some vices can occur when others are abolished, harming the field of the mind by promoting some vices while trying to remove others.
Tarasius attempted this flawed approach, using a forbidden and ineffective remedy to fix another forbidden and obstructive issue. It's like trying to clean mud with more muddy water; the more you try to clean, the more you spread the impurity.
Similarly, Tarasius, suddenly promoted from layman to bishop, tried to correct his sudden consecration with the unlawful act of image worship, thus compounding his errors.
If inappropriate image worship could stabilize an inappropriate ordination, illicit things could easily be reinforced by other illicit things, and impurities could be cleansed with other impurities. But impurities cannot be cleansed with impurities.
Therefore, inappropriate ordination cannot be stabilized by inappropriate worship of images. If the ecclesiastical regulation handed down by the holy fathers is to be kept inviolate, it must not be corrupted. If it should not be corrupted for some useful reason, much less should it be corrupted for an unhelpful reason since both worshipping images and assuming the pontifical chair without proper order are useless.
Why discuss this? Let us turn to the Apostle and the chosen vessel. Let us ask the distinguished preacher! He would undoubtedly answer: "Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands." And again: "He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil."
This means that thinking he has gained not a ministry of humility but a secular power, he might fall into the devil's condemnation through pride. Such an ordination is perilous, and his teaching to worship images is most fearsome, given the danger of setting such a terrible example.
It is forbidden for a layman to fulfill the priesthood's teaching role without having known its duties or discipline and teaching things he has not learned before.
Regarding such ordination, here is the opinion of the blessed Gregory, bishop of Rome: "Some, driven by the desire for honor, after the death of bishops, are suddenly tonsured and become priests from laymen, disrespectfully seizing the religious office even though they have not yet learned to be soldiers.
What can we expect these people to offer their subjects, considering they fear the position of teacher before even reaching the threshold of discipleship?
Therefore, even if someone has blameless merit, they must still practice ecclesiastical duties through distinct orders, observe what to imitate, and learn what to teach."
"a lamp placed on a lampstand shines," so that those who observe the flame of faith do not extinguish it, but increase it. For it is written:  "First let him be tested, and then let him serve," much more must he be tested before being taken as an intercessor for the people, lest bad priests become the cause of the people's downfall.
Therefore, there can be no excuse, no defense, because it is clearly known to all what diligence the holy and outstanding teacher shows in this matter, to prevent a novice from advancing to sacred orders. Just as at that time a novice was called someone who had newly planted conversations of faith, so now a novice must be considered someone who, suddenly, having taken on the garb of religion, stealthily seeks to attain sacred honors.
Therefore, one must advance from order to order. He does not rightly seek a sacred rank who, bypassing steps, tries to ascend to the highest peaks abruptly. The same Apostle teaches, among other things, that the hands of sacred order should not be laid on anyone hastily. What is quicker or more hasty than to begin from the summit, to become a bishop before being a teacher?
Against this norm of ecclesiastical institution, when the aforementioned Tarasius, as they say, ascended to the priestly summit, he is known to have disturbed rather than governed the people. It is no wonder if he does not preach correctly, who did not come to the office of preaching correctly. Concerning his disorderly consecration, many testimonies of the holy fathers could be presented, but they have been omitted for the sake of brevity. This much shall suffice to have been stated on this matter.
Chapter 3: Whether Tarasius correctly believes the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son rather than from the Father and the Son
Our memories have not at all forgotten what we promised at the beginning of this work—that we would leave nothing undiscussed and nothing passed over in silence that is found worthy of criticism in the same council held for the veneration of images.
Unless perhaps the difficulty of the disordered speech denies our understanding the opportunity to impart, or the reverence for the childish statement prevents our discussion from pursuing the folly.
Therefore, it does not follow that our discussion should be suspended from this point on what Tarasius professes in his reading of faith.
He confesses that the Holy Spirit proceeds not from the Father and the Son as the universal Church confesses and believes, nor from the Father alone as some believe who, although they have not explicitly denied that the Spirit proceeds from the Son, have altogether believed it proceeds from the Father and the Son.
Instead, he professes that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son.
In this profession, unless there is purity and sincerity of heart that believes the Spirit is not a creature but the Creator, and not lesser than the Father and the Son but equal to them and consubstantial with them, and proceeds from both, a harmful virus can arise.
Therefore, the definition of all things must be such that, with all obscurities or ambiguities removed, it tends to demonstrate the indication of the matter rightly and clearly.
If the definition of other things must be so clear and evident that it demonstrates what needs to be shown, then much more so must the definition of faith be clear and evident, without any ambiguity or tortuosity.
If anything in it is twisted, ambiguous, or obscured by a certain cloud of words, it brings great loss to the speaker or listener.
For it is rightly believed and commonly confessed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, not from the Father through the Son, because He does not proceed through the Son as a creature made through Him, nor as later in time or lesser in power or of another substance.
Instead, He is believed to proceed from the Father and the Son as co-eternal, consubstantial, co-equal, and existing with them in one glory, power, and divinity.
The preposition "from" has a different force than "through."
Hence, the Son of God is believed to be born from a human, not through a human, that is, not through intercourse or human operation, but born from a virgin by assuming flesh.
Therefore, it can be questioned whether it is rightly said that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father "through the Son," lest, while this preposition "through" is incautiously placed in the profession of such a great mystery, it serves someone the poisonous cup of the Arian error, which blasphemes that the Holy Spirit is a creature and created through the Son just as other created things are, and also imparts the unhappy belief to those turning to them that their baptism is not according to the evangelical faith in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but "in the name of the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit."
For the Holy Spirit is proven to be not a creature but the Creator by these testimonies.
David says: "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their host" (Psalm 33:6).
And Solomon says: "He created them through the Holy Spirit" (Wisdom of Solomon 1:7).
Again, David says: "Send out Your Spirit, and they shall be created; and You shall renew the face of the earth" (Psalm 104:30).
And in the book of Job, it is written: "The Spirit of God has made me" (Job 33:4).
And in the book of Judith: "All Your creation serves You, for You spoke, and they were made; You sent Your Spirit, and He built them" (Judith 16:14).
The Holy Spirit is shown to be of such great power and virtue that, with His cooperation, the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is our redemption, was formed in the womb of the Virgin, as the evangelist says: "Do not be afraid, Joseph, to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 1:20).
Also, "She was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 1:18).
Not that the Holy Spirit is to be called the father of our Savior, so that two fathers are believed, but...
From the Father and the Son, the same Holy Spirit cooperates and is believed to be of the same power with them, as the Lord affirms:
"Go," He says to the disciples, "baptize all nations in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
Just as the Lord sent the apostles to preach, the Holy Spirit is also declared to act in the same way.
It is written in the Acts of the Apostles that while Peter was pondering the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him,
"Look, men are looking for you; rise and go down without hesitation, for I have sent them to you."
And again, "Set apart for me Paul and Barnabas for the work to which I have called them."
And again, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."
For He, along with the Father and the Son, as shown, created everything, and is proven to be God of the same essence with them by these testimonies.
David says, "I will hear what God the Lord will speak in me."
Thus, it is clearer than light that all prophets announce or speak through the Holy Spirit, as the Lord testifies, saying,
"When the Holy Spirit comes, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you and announce to you what is to come."
Likewise, through the prophet, the Lord says, "They were not willing to hear my words, which I commanded in my Spirit through the prophets before, says the Lord."
Paul the apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says,
"The Holy Spirit testifies to us."
And this is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord.
In the Acts of the Apostles, we also read that to Ananias, the pastor of the church, it was said,
"Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?"
And showing that He is God, it says subsequently, "You have not lied to men but to God."
Paul, the chosen vessel, writes to the Corinthians,
"There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are different kinds of service, but the same Lord; there are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men."
By these apostolic words, the Holy Spirit is declared to be the same God, the same Lord.
The same Lord says in the Gospel, "God is Spirit."
Likewise, Paul writes to the Corinthians,
"The Lord is the Spirit," and to the Ephesians, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."
He also says to the Corinthians, "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, whom you have received from God?"
And showing that God dwells in human bodies, he adds and says, "So glorify and carry God in your bodies."
Since by these testimonies, He is approved as both Creator and God and is believed by the whole Catholic Church to proceed from the Father and the Son, it must be asked whether it is necessary to profess that He proceeds from the Father through the Son, or rather from the Father and the Son, since such a profession is not found in the Nicene or Chalcedonian Creed made by the holy fathers.
For He appeared over the apostles in fire through the Son, given to men through the Son, because the Holy Spirit could not be received by men except through the Son.
However, professing that He proceeds from the Father through the Son is unusual in synodal confession, since the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father, does not need another's assistance to proceed through anyone, as He is indeed the third person in the same Holy Trinity and of the same power and essence with the Father and the Son.
For, being God to Himself, He is relative to us as a gift, distributing gifts of grace to each as He wills.
For He also grants prophecies to whom He wills and distributes tongues to whom He wills, which cannot be given without Him.
Hence, He is properly called love, as He naturally proceeds from those whom He represents and shows Himself to be of the same essence with them, or because He acts in us so that we are in God and He in us.
Thus, among the gifts of God, there is nothing greater than love, and there is no greater gift of God than the Holy Spirit.
He is also grace, which, because it is given freely by divine will and not by our merits, is thus called grace.
Just as the only Word of God is properly called wisdom, because He is universally and the Holy Spirit of the Father is wisdom, so the Holy Spirit is properly called by the name of love, as He is.
Three times the Son is universally love, for he is the Spirit of the Father, as the Lord testifies, who says:
"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you."
He is also the Spirit of the Son, as Paul testifies, who says:
"But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."
And so, he is called the Spirit of both, because proceeding from the Father and the Son, he is proved to be of one substance and nature.
If he were said to be unbegotten, there would be two Fathers; if begotten, there would be two Sons inappropriately spoken of. But since he is neither Father nor Son, he is neither unbegotten nor begotten, but is said to proceed from both.
For the Father alone is not from another, therefore he alone is called unbegotten, not indeed in the Scriptures, but in the custom of those disputing and speaking about such a great matter, as they were able, for the benefit of those present or future. The Son alone is born of the Father, therefore he alone is called begotten. The Holy Spirit alone proceeds from the Father and the Son, therefore he alone is called the Spirit of both.
He proceeds from both, not by being born, so as to be called someone's son. He would be called the Son of the Father and the Son if, which is abhorrent to the feelings of all faithful, both had begotten him; therefore, he is not born of both, but proceeds from both as the Spirit of both.
But our Lord Jesus Christ taught the disciples that he proceeds from the Father, saying:
"But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me."
And again, the same Mediator of God and men, our Lord Jesus Christ, after his resurrection, to show that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him as well as from the Father, breathed on his disciples and said:
"Receive the Holy Spirit."
If he did not proceed from him, he would not have given him to the disciples by breathing on them. Therefore, there is one Spirit of the Father and the Son, one, as we have mentioned before, the Spirit of both.
If anyone asks how the Son is born from the Father, but the Holy Spirit proceeds without being born, or why both are not called sons, since both proceed from the Father, or why the Holy Spirit is not called unbegotten like the Father, or how he proceeds from both, or why the Son says:
"As the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,"
as if the Son existed without life before and received it from the Father, or how the Father was never without the Son and yet the Father begot the Son, or how the Son was never without the Spirit and yet says:
"Unless I go away, the Helper will not come to you,"
or how the Son is not of himself but of the Father, and yet is not later than he from whom he is, or how the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and yet is not preceded by those from whom he proceeds, let him know that these and similar questions are inscrutable and incomprehensible to human frailty.
For who can consider these things? Who can comprehend them? If we do not grasp the secrets of Christ's human birth, how can we grasp the mysteries of his divine nature? But because in that coeternal, equal, incorporeal, ineffably immutable, and inseparable Trinity, it is extremely difficult to distinguish generation from procession, let it suffice to believe this, hold this firmly, and confess with all our heart that the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten, and the Holy Spirit neither created nor begotten, but proceeding from the Father and the Son.
Just so, that in the confession of faith all opinions, all novelties of words are avoided, and the confession of believers is strengthened by these words and sentences which the holy and universal synods have established in the creed.
Chapter 4: Whether Theodore, Bishop of Jerusalem, is correct in his belief about the Father's and Son's beginnings
In the previous chapter, we explained that a clear and transparent definition should be made in the confession of the holy faith.
We now necessarily carry this out because unless speech proceeds on a straight path, with all ambiguities set aside to demonstrate the truth of the matter, there is doubt among listeners about the integrity of the faith of the one who speaks.
It seems to approach heretical depravity, even if not in intent, at least in sound.
Therefore, it must be avoided that in the profession of faith by Bishop Theodore, when he says the Father is 'without beginning' and the Son 'acknowledges no other beginning than the Father and has his subsistence from Him,' it might be suspected that the Father precedes the Son either in time, who is co-eternal with Him, or in substance, who is consubstantial with Him, or in honor, who is equal to Him.
Although this is indeed rightly and catholically believed by the aforementioned man, it is nevertheless so ambiguously stated that suspicion about his faith can arise in the reader, which often not weak belief, but the difficulty of the speech usually causes.
Since therefore it does not evidently shine forth in this profession whether his faith should be approved or disapproved, and since our intention prefers to approve rather than disapprove it, it remains for us to briefly explain what we have received, believed, and held from the holy fathers about this matter.
For in such a profession, it must be feared lest, while the Father is said to be 'without beginning' and the Son 'acknowledges no other beginning than the Father,' it might be suspected that the Father is older than the Son because He begot Him, and the Son is later than the Father because He was begotten, when nothing in the Holy Trinity is earlier or later, where nothing begins in time to be perfected subsequently in time.
Because just as the three persons are consubstantial with each other, so also co-eternal.
And without time, the generation of the Son from the Father is understood, and without time also the procession of the Holy Spirit from both.
For the Father is the beginning of the Son not by creating, but by begetting; not by preceding in time, but by ineffably begetting an ineffable Son who is co-eternal with Him, without whom He never was.
And the Son is the beginning, not of the Father, but of the things created by Him.
And the Holy Spirit is the beginning of all things created by Him because He cannot in any way be separated from the designation of creator.
The Father and the Son are the beginning of the Holy Spirit, not by begetting, because He is not a Son, nor by creating, because He is not a creature, but by giving, because He proceeds from both.
Likewise, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one beginning of all things created by the one and only creator.
And although the Father is the beginning, the Son is the beginning, and the Holy Spirit is the beginning, yet they are not three beginnings, but one beginning, one divinity, one substance, one omnipotence.
These things, which we have briefly touched upon, are to be approved by the words of the distinguished preacher Augustine.
For he says: The Father is therefore called relatively, and the same is called relatively the beginning, and if anything else, the Father is said to be relative to the Son.
The beginning, however, is said to be relative to everything that has come from Him.
Likewise, the Son is said to be relative, is called relatively the Word and the Image; and in all these terms, He is referred to the Father, none of which the Father is called.
And the Son is called the beginning: for when it was said to Him, 'Who are you?' He replied, 'The beginning, because I also speak to you.'
But is it the same beginning as the Father? He wanted to show Himself as the creator when He said He is the beginning, just as the Father is the beginning of creation, because all things are from Him.
For the creator is also called relative to the creature, just as the lord to the servant.
And therefore, when we say both the Father is the beginning and the Son is the beginning, we do not say two beginnings of the creature, because the Father and the Son are together the beginning of the creature, just as one creator, just as one God.
The principle is that which begets. Indeed, since it works, we can rightly call the Holy Spirit a principle, provided we separate this from the title of Creator. It is written about Him that He works and remains always working within Himself. For He does not change or cease to be the same while He works.
As He works, consider: "To each one," says the Apostle, "is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good: to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit, and so on." Likewise, after a few lines: "For if we are each asked separately about the Holy Spirit, we rarely respond that He is God; and yet, along with the Father and the Son, He is truly God." Therefore, God is called one principle in relation to creation, not three principles.
Within the Trinity, if the begetter to the begotten is a principle, then the Father is a principle to the Son because He begot Him. And whether the Father is also a principle to the Holy Spirit, of whom it is said, "He proceeds from the Father," is a small question. Because, if it is so, then He is not only a principle to that which He begets or makes, but also to that which He gives.
Hence, it becomes clear, as it often troubles many, why the Son is not also called the Holy Spirit. For it is read in the Gospel that He proceeds not as one born but as one given; and therefore He is not called the Son, because He is neither born as the only-begotten, nor made, that He might be adopted through grace, as we are.
For what is of the Father by nature refers only to the Father, as He is called the Son, and therefore He is the Son of the Father, not of the Holy Spirit. But what is given refers both to the one who gives and to those who receive. Thus, the Holy Spirit is called not only of the Father and the Son, who give Him, but also ours, who receive Him: as it is said, "the salvation of the Lord," because He gives salvation, so He is also our salvation, who receives it.
Likewise, after a few lines: "Therefore, if what is given has a principle from whom it is given, because it has not received it from elsewhere, as it proceeds from Him, it must be confessed that the Father and the Son are the principle of the Holy Spirit, not two principles, but as the Father and the Son are one God and in relation to creation one Creator and one Lord, so in relation to the Holy Spirit they are one principle." However, in relation to creation, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one principle, one Creator, and one Lord.
Chapter 5: That Tarasius improperly called the Holy Spirit 'a fellow tribe member to the Father and the Son'
It is also said that Tarasius, in his profession of faith, called the Holy Spirit "a fellow tribe member to the Father and the Son." This statement is utterly absurd and must be thoroughly rejected from the confession of the Catholic faith, not only by those who are well-versed in literary scholarship but also by those who use common letters. It is entirely rejected and repudiated in every way.
It is easy to understand that just as "consanguineous" means those who are of the same blood, "consorts" means those who share the same lot, and "coetaneous" means those who are of the same age, who are also called "contemporaries," and "conform" means those who are of the same form, so "fellow tribe members" means those who are from the same tribe. Because this linguistic preposition holds this force, wherever it is placed in the composition of words, it demonstrates that different things are linked together. As in this composition, when we call two or more people "fellow tribe members," we clearly show that they are from the same tribe. For a "tribe" is a multitude of people who either derive their lineage from one stock, as the twelve tribes are known to have come from Jacob, or serve one office, as in the beginning of the city of Rome, the Roman people were divided into three orders by the founder of the city: namely, senators, soldiers, or common people. Hence, the etymology of this name is still preserved, and those who lead them are called "tribunes."
However, in God, who is the highest good, a singular peak of all things, one in substance, three in persons, the name "fellow tribe member" cannot be found, because a fellow tribe member can only be found where a tribe is found.
The Holy Spirit is not a fellow tribe member to the Father and the Son, but consubstantial with them. If He were a fellow tribe member, He would only be joined to them by some sort of tribal or familial association—which is profane to say. If He were only joined by some tribal or familial association—which is not only absurd to believe but also impious—He would not be consubstantial. But He is consubstantial with the Father and the Son; therefore, He is not to be believed or called their fellow tribe member. In the confession of such a great mystery, it would have been sufficient to say that the Holy Spirit is coessential, coeternal, coequal to the Father and the Son, of one power and glory, so that in three persons the unity of substance, power, and glory of the supreme God is believed and confessed by Catholics, who is blessed above all things forever.
Therefore, whoever thinks this name should be rightly used in the Holy Trinity and attempts to support it with assertions should read the thirteen books of the blessed Hilary and the fifteen books of the most holy Augustine, which discuss the sacred and ineffable Trinity with great subtlety and powerfully proclaim it. When he does not find this name applied to the Holy Trinity in these works, he should not presume to apply it himself, because if it were at all suitable to the confession of the holy faith, it could not escape the dense thickets of so many discussions, nor would it be foreign to such eloquent and learned men skilled in Latin if it were not alien to error. He should also read the works of other Catholic fathers on the faith and, when he does not find mention of this name in such a high and distinguished matter, he should know that he has found it elsewhere in vain. Because if it is found in the confession of the holy faith outside of these discussions, it should be attributed either to ineloquence, which springs from lack of skill, or to the peculiarity of another language, which often loses its force when translated into another language.
Chapter 6: That Basil, Bishop of Ancyra, included image and relic adoration in his faith confession but omitted key doctrines
The remission of sins, which was omitted by Basil, bishop of Ancyra, in his confession of faith, is to be counted among the highest gifts of ecclesiastical dignity. The prophet extols this with great praise, saying those are blessed whose transgressions are forgiven and whose sins are covered. This was thundered among the first proclamations of the gospel by the voice of the word, the voice of wisdom, the friend of the bridegroom, as it is written: "And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
The Mediator between God and men, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, dedicated this with the mercy by which he came to redeem the world, when he forgave some sins before his passion and offered himself to God the Father as a sacrifice to cleanse the sins of the whole world. To ensure that the Church could always attain this, he granted the ineffable gift of the Spirit, the indelible mark of his character, and the saving sacrament of holy baptism.
The apostles, in their joint confession of faith, which they established as a kind of standard of belief and preaching before they parted from each other, are said to have placed this after the confession of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They did not delay to include it, because they saw that the integrity of faith could not be complete without it. The brevity of the symbol did not prevent them from professing this, as the integrity of holy faith and the venerable sublimity of such a great gift demanded it.
It is indeed accomplished through the Holy Spirit, through whom sins are forgiven, or through the blood of Christ, which we receive in the sacrament and which was shed for us for the remission of sins. It is also accomplished through the water of baptism, in which the ancient and long-standing wound of original sin is washed away. Hence, the apostle says that three bear witness: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are one, because through the Holy Spirit, the blood of Christ, and the water of baptism, we reach one and the same goal, that is, the remission of sins.
Some teachers, when explaining what the standard of faith is, have listed among the other novelties completed in the incarnation of Christ, saying: "It is new that the Son of God became man, it is new that he was handed over to death by men, it is new that he rose on the third day, it is new that he ascended into heaven with his body, and it is new that the remission of sins is given to men." Thus, they said that the remission of sins given to men is new, because, as it is given in the New Testament, it was not given in the Old. The Old Testament page does not wash away sins but shows them.
The resurrection of the body, which Christians believe and confess, but Sadducees do not believe in, was also retained in the confession of faith by the aforementioned bishop. This is shown in the reading of the Old Testament, where Job, a man more evangelical than legal, says: "I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another." And it is shown by Daniel, a most holy man and investigator of God's mysteries, who says: "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt." This is entirely commended by the Truth himself when he descended to earth for the salvation of mankind, teaching it in the holy oracles of his preaching and demonstrating it by the saving example of his resurrection.
If someone says that Job, in this statement, spoke only of his own resurrection and not the general resurrection of all men, let him hear Job affirming the general resurrection of all in another place, saying: "A tree has..."
If there is hope for a tree, it will sprout again, and its branches will grow. Even if its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil, at the scent of water, it will bud and put forth shoots like a young plant.
However, when a person dies and is laid low, where is he? Just as waters recede from the sea and a river dries up, so too when a person lies down, he will not rise again; until the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
This passage should be understood as follows: does a tree have the hope of reviving, and a person does not have the hope of resurrection? Just as waters recede from the sea and a river dries up, so too when a person lies down, will they not rise again? Until the heavens are no more, will they not awake or be roused from their sleep? These words demonstrate not only his own resurrection but also the general resurrection of all humankind.
The apostles, when they were preparing to spread the gospel to various nations, infused not with different faiths but with diverse languages, did not intend to deliver different doctrines. Among the mysteries of spirituality they passed on, they included the hope of resurrection. To ensure this would not be forgotten or corrupted by heretical error over time, they placed it in the creed. In this authentic symbol of faith, which encapsulates the entirety of faith with admirable brevity, they included it. One of the apostles, who conquered the hearts of the wild nations with the sacred teachings, foretold that it would happen in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
The life of the world to come, which the same Basil is known to have negligently omitted, is promised to us by the Lord Himself and is proclaimed in almost all the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures. Without this belief in the resurrection, the resurrection of the flesh is meaningless, and our entire religious endeavor aims to achieve it.
From this, it is understood that Basil did not entirely fail when, in his confession of faith, he omitted matters full of such mysteries—indeed, full of mysteries—without which Christian belief cannot stand, and instead brought forth matters that are unnecessary and worthy of ridicule. He is not merely reprimanded because he delayed professing them, provided he believes them in his heart, as sometimes things are omitted in speech for the sake of brevity or due to some occasion, even though they are firmly held in belief. He is criticized because he added something that no holy father has ever included in the profession of faith. A soldier who once fought or is about to fight is not criticized if he does not fight temporarily, but if he flees and disgraces his nobility and weakens his comrades with a bad example. For the aforementioned bishop said, after professing the worship and kissing of images as the first of his faith's defenses, "he is confident in participating in their sanctification." Rightly, he deserves to participate in insensible things, which not only lack sanctification but also life, after professing faith in such trifles and neglecting the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come, which are among the primary gifts of the Christian religion.
Even if it is useful to worship images, what detracts from the Christian religion if the profession of this practice is not included among the primary professions of faith? There are many traditions of church practice transmitted to the faithful, which, even if not professed in the confession of faith, do not detract from holy religion. What harm, then, does it cause to the integrity of faith if the worship of images is omitted, since it is believed to be forbidden rather than instituted by the holy fathers? The omission of the worship of images does not harm the purity of sacred faith, which is rather forbidden than instituted, as the omission of the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come would, if omitted in confession, which are proclaimed in all the Holy Scriptures and, as we have mentioned, were placed by the apostles in the creed.
The praiseworthy topic is held together by the brevity of the connection.
Chapter 7: That Theodosius, Bishop of Amorium, spoke excessively about images while neglecting the Trinity
We rightly showed that Basil, Bishop of Ancyra, should be accused in the previous chapter because, having laid the foundation of his faith, he neglected to build upon it the very necessary things for a building of such an excellent mystery, and instead tried to build things that should be completely rejected from any structure of religion.
But in the present case, we decide that Theodosius, Bishop of Amorium, should be more rightly and appropriately accused, who, having laid no foundation of his faith in the mentioned synod, began to build vain and irrational things.
In his building, if what was vainly raised is removed, at least what was well-founded will remain.
But in this case, if all that is vain and frivolous is removed, nothing will remain.
If therefore he is rightly blamed who added the adoration of images to the confession of the holy and unique Trinity, much more rightly should this one be blamed, who, setting aside the confession of that highest and ineffable mystery, only dreamed of some frivolous things about the adoration of those images.
For he began thus:
'I confess and promise and accept and kiss and adore images.'
Oh, what a wonderful confession from a bishop!
Oh, what a fine saying from a priest!
Oh, what praiseworthy devotion from a prelate!
He is silent about the confession of the most excellent majesty and sounds forth the confession of the most insolent vanity.
He withdraws from the confession of Him who said:
'Everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven';
and he enters fully into the confession of images.
He is silent about what he should confess and should urge others to confess, and he confesses what he should neither confess nor allow others to confess;
and he, who ought to oppose the wall for the house of Israel and stand in the battle on the day of the Lord, himself, to the disgrace of surrender, alas!
willingly falls away:
because he, who ought to restrain the minds of others from wrong confession and ridiculous error by the zeal of preaching, himself first becomes the way of error by the example of wrong confession.
As for the fact that he anathematizes everyone 'who does not instruct all people beloved by Christ to adore and venerate the images of all the saints who have pleased God since the beginning of time', let the prudent reader notice how absurdly and incautiously he acts, especially since the anathema, which he rashly attempts to impose on others, he irreverently turns upon himself and his own, and the weapon with which he tries to pierce the foreign part of his error he deflects to the death of himself and his citizens.
Nor does the adoration of images free his own from the bond of anathema, which was only trying to bind outsiders.
For he anathematizes 'those who do not instruct all people beloved by Christ to adore images'.
Surely, to leave others aside, do all in the flock entrusted to him instruct all people beloved by Christ to adore images, who neither have the duty of instruction nor the rank of preaching?
Does he himself instruct 'all people beloved by Christ'?
Since almost the whole world is full of the people of Christ, for God is no longer known only in India, but the sound of the apostles has gone out into all the earth, and the whole earth is filled with the glory of the Lord, and all nations come and worship in the sight of the Lord according to the prophecy of Malachi in the word of the Lord, saying:
'From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place, a pure offering is sacrificed and offered to me.'
And the shepherd of the church, to whom, in the vision, the whole world full of various nations is shown as full of different kinds of animals to be called to the grace of God, says:
'In truth, I perceive that God shows no partiality, but in every nation, anyone who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.'
If, according to his delusion,
For even if they instruct the people of two or three or certainly several provinces, they do not instruct the entire beloved people of Christ. The Catholic Church is spread through such vast and extensive parts of the world, which is indeed the
Therefore, either he will teach the entire Church of Christ from east to west, from north to south, instructing himself and his followers in the worship of images, or according to his own vain opinion, he and his companions or subjects will be subject to condemnation.
For even if they could instruct all the people, they could not have all the images of all the saints who have pleased God since the beginning, in whose worship they would instruct the entire population. Their number is so great that it is said by the prophet, speaking from the perspective of the Son to the Father:
Even if this is said hyperbolically, the number of those who have pleased God since the beginning is so vast that they cannot be painted or counted by anyone except Him, in whose book their names are written.
For if the same bishop wishes to avoid the condemnation he has proclaimed, it is necessary for him to have and worship the images of all the saints who have pleased God in various parts of the world since the beginning. And if he cannot have them due to their multitude, indeed because he cannot, he should submit himself to the condemnation he has proclaimed.
Chapter 8: That doubt exists regarding the Holy Spirit's procession
It has been shown above, as far as the brevity of this style, to which we strive, permits, with the Lord’s assent, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.
Now, since almost everyone in the aforementioned synod either remained completely silent on this matter or spoke ambiguously, we – as humans with human weaknesses in our thoughts and ignorant of things we neither hear nor read – do not bear witness to the faith of those who passed over this in silence, nor to those who spoke ambiguously.
Nor do we reject their belief because they were silent or spoke ambiguously, since we do not know how they hold this matter.
But we pass over this matter undiscussed, so as not to appear to give assent by our silence, and because it is not clear what they mean, we fear to condemn and reserve the judgment for Him who is not deceived by hidden things.
We know that those who are not far from error, if they are distant from it because they have correct thoughts on this matter, still approach it because they have neglected to confess correctly what they rightly think.
For what is rightly believed in the heart must be rightly professed with the mouth for salvation.
Chapter 9: That some bishops' complex statements on faith remain unclear and undiscussed
Since there are many kinds of expressions that are taught extensively and variously by grammarians or rhetoricians, the sequence of all speeches or words is divided into four parts. Every speech is either wise and eloquent, wise and not eloquent, eloquent and not wise, or neither wise nor eloquent.
Therefore, it is wise and eloquent, as many books of the Holy Scriptures are, such as the book of the prophet Isaiah. His speech is both wise, as it was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and eloquent because it was delivered by a distinguished and cultured man.
However, it is wise and not eloquent, as some parts of the divine Scriptures are: wise in the heights of the sentences proclaimed with divine nectar but not eloquent either due to the simplicity of the holy men who delivered it, who preferred to use the sense rather than the beauty of words, or due to the manner of speaking of the natives among whom the holy men, the bearers of the divine word, are known to have been born or lived. As Jerome says about blessed Jeremiah, the simplicity of his speech came from the place Anatoth, where he was born.
Therefore, it is eloquent and not wise, as some of the writings of the Gentiles are. Although adorned with the cultivation of human arts, they are foolish because they lack the knowledge of the true God and the salutary exhortation. There is also the speech of some heretics, eloquent but not wise, which, although polished by the industry of human minds, is entirely devoid of the truth of wisdom and the teachings of virtues. About eloquent but not wise, it is said through the prophet Isaiah: "For the people are foolish, not understanding, the people of unwise speech, so that you cannot understand the eloquence of their language, in which there is no wisdom."
Therefore, neither eloquent nor wise is like many who rashly approach teaching anything before they are refreshed by the feasts of the most sacred senses and imbued with the ornaments of eloquence. This is also true of the writing of this synod, whose errors we strive to discuss, in whose sentences neither the embellishment of sense is found nor any stream drawn from the river of eloquence.
And since every writing is either cultivated and clear, or cultivated and not clear, or uncultivated and clear, or neither cultivated nor clear, this is alien to the first two types and entirely bound to the following two because it is neither elevated by the cultivation of words or the high style of eloquence, nor woven with the purity of clear expression. In one case, it soothes the mind of the reader by its brilliance; in the other, it promotes understanding by its purity.
It is not cultivated and unclear because it is not involved in long periods, not adorned with various perplexities of topics, nor linked by slippery conclusions of syllogisms coming from the industry of the art of dialectics. All of these are cultivated, as they are polished by a sophistic cylinder, and unclear because they are remote from the understanding of simple readers and only present themselves to the ingenuity of the most learned.
But it is either clear, lacking cultivation, and evident to all readers or listeners; or disorganized and poorly composed, mutilated by solecisms, corrupted by barbarisms, clothed in the clouds of other faults, and lacking cultivated speech. The order of weaving senses is exploded, neither cultivated nor clear.
Therefore, if by chance any error in the statements about faith remains undiscussed, it will defend itself with these arms from us because it has hidden itself in such convoluted words and could not be detected by us because it came to us shrouded as if by a certain cloak of speech difficulty.
Chapter 10: That Bishop Theodorus incorrectly connected two separate verses in his faith statement
Indeed, what Bishop Theodorus has done by presenting these two psalmist verses together with the inserted adverb "immediately," as if one directly follows the other without the interruption of other verses, is ridiculous.
The verse that he says "immediately follows" not only does not follow immediately but is known to precede the other by almost 50 psalms.
We do not wish to criticize because it might show some sign of faith, but because it is subject to ridiculous criticism and provides material for mockery to critics.
It shows that such writing is not suitable to instruct greatly without error, as it stumbles without strength in small matters.
It does not have the power to affirm doubtful things and teach unknown matters, which it does not have the talent to narrate non-doubtful things and present known ones.
How then can the doctrine of that synod be accepted, whose writing is criticized in so many places?
Or how can it achieve the dignity of association with the other synodal writings compiled or accepted by the holy fathers, which avoids the association of their meanings and words?
For those writings are criticized in nothing and therefore accepted in everything, but these, because they are criticized in many ways, are justly almost entirely rejected.
Chapter 11: That the Greeks rashly anathematized the Catholic Church for not worshiping images
The proclamation of the ecclesiastical trumpet declares that a sinning brother should first be reprimanded in private. If he refuses to listen, he should be admonished in the presence of witnesses for the sake of correction or confirmation. If he also refuses to listen to them, then the matter should be made known to many so that he may be detested, and if he cannot be saved by shame, he may at least be saved by reproach. If he does not listen even to many, he should be treated like a pagan or a tax collector.
Their church seems to significantly oppose this proclamation since they attempt to presumptuously or recklessly anathematize all the churches of the world before consulting or inquiring through the ecclesiastical practice of written correspondence. They should have sent an investigative delegation to the surrounding provincial churches to determine whether images should be worshipped or not. According to the voice of a certain wise person, through counsel, they might follow what is to be followed and avoid what is to be avoided. Thus, they would not later regret their decision, but the church would hold what most people, according to the apostolic institution, want to hold. Those who try to oppose ancient institutions with obstinate minds and want to separate themselves from the entirety of the ecclesiastical body would be subject to detestation.
For what madness or foolishness is it for the church of one part to try to establish a matter that neither the apostles nor their successors established and attempt to anathematize the churches of the whole world, compelling them to either oppose apostolic institutions or be subject to their utterly vain anathema? But since their most foolish anathema brings more harm to them than to us, as the Apostle says: "Neither the malicious nor the covetous shall inherit the kingdom of God," even if it could somehow harm us, it would be more tolerable for us to endure it than to oppose the teachings of the apostles or other holy fathers. As we say with Susanna: "It is better to fall into the hands of men than to forsake the law of our God," and we are taught by the words of the pastor of the church to obey God rather than men.
For just as it is more tolerable for any citizen or person enjoying the society of a prince to endure insults from seditious people acting against the prince and citizens than to conspire with them in sedition, likewise it is more tolerable for us to be cursed by those who do not fear to curse their own parents than to worship insensible things against the institution of the divine Scriptures. For curses without reason, anger without power, and condemnation without authority do not harm those they are aimed at, but rather afflict their authors with greater afflictions and reveal their laziness and impatience.
Thus, unless ancient destruction and the old plague, the guide of death and root of evils, which expelled angels from the society of heavenly citizens and men from the dignity of their flourishing seat, inflamed them with the goads of their wickedness, they would not have cared to call a synod for the worship of images without the agreement of many Catholic and God-faithful churches, nor would they have dared to so insolently anathematize so many churches, which are indeed the body of Christ, nor attempted to establish the worship and adoration of insensible things against the institution of divine writings. For no one, says the Apostle, speaking in the Spirit of God, says "anathema to Jesus."
Therefore, it must be avoided that, while they rashly and recklessly try to anathematize the church, which is the body of Christ, they may seem to insult Him who is its head. Christ has so lovingly chosen the church for Himself that He inseparably presides over it as the head to the body, and it perpetually adheres to Him as the body to the head, so that no injury or honor can be exhibited to the body that is not referred to the head.
Christ was referring to the persecution brought upon him by the Jews when he spoke to the predatory wolf Saul, not yet Paul, who was devouring the prey in the destruction of the church, saying to him in the most beneficial proclamation or the sending of letters:
"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
Not that he was persecuting Christ reigning in the heavenly heights, but the church, which was already flourishing at that time and navigating the stormy waves of this world.
Therefore, Christ, in his body, which is the church, still endures persecution, not physically as he once did for the salvation of the world, but with a certain compassionate pity, by which he always has mercy on his members, that is, the faithful remaining in the unity of the holy church, among whom was the one who said,
"I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions in my flesh for the sake of his body, which is the church"
(Colossians 1:24).
David foreshadowed this suffering that Christ endures in his saints when he said,
"I will appear sooner than a wild fig"
(Psalm 102:3).
For when he, humbling himself to death, reached the mystery of the cross and was despised by the synagogue, which has remained barren since then, he showed in his bloody sweat the future sufferings of his members and testified against the honor given to the church, saying,
"Whoever receives you receives me,"
and,
"When you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me"
(Matthew 25:40).
Therefore, if those about whom we speak were to embrace humility, the guardian of virtues and the teacher of good deeds, they would not impudently attempt to anathematize the body of Christ, which is the church, nor would they, out of a desire for their own, or rather vain, praise, convene a council over something so useless and ungracious.
Chapter 12: That they have largely abandoned kindness and patience by speaking disorderly
Thus, when the synod had gathered, if they had conducted their necessary affairs in an ecclesiastical manner, discussing what would benefit the faithful, they would avoid all improper behavior and disorderly speech.
By maintaining the path of moderation, they would not deviate from apostolic teachings or the practices of ancient synods.
Adorned with the ornaments of patience and kindness, they would not call good evil and evil good, nor put sweet for bitter and bitter for sweet, contradicting the prophetic word.
They would prudently establish what necessarily needed to be established and carefully say what needed to be said, rejecting superfluous and extraordinary anathemas, teaching useful matters, while letting ambiguous or certainly useless matters remain silent.
The churches of our region and other parts of the world would comply with their statutes.
But because it is impossible to both assent to their statutes and adhere to the ancient practices of the fathers, since they are as different from each other as light from darkness, life from death, sight from blindness, honesty from dishonesty, purity from impurity, health from sickness, their statutes differ so much from the institutions of the holy fathers.
Therefore, rejecting the worse, we are content with the better and, disregarding deceptive diversions, we desire to follow the certain and royal path.
Where, I ask, most excellent virtue, kindness, or you, most steadfast patience, have you gone?
Where have you departed when you saw such unjust and perverse constitutions being enacted by so many priests, when you saw so many bonds of anathema being imposed on the church?
Why did you not at least find lodging in two or three people?
Why did you reject all?
Why did you present your absence to all?
Why did you not curb so many vanities with the reins of your moderation?
Why did you not restrain so many delusions with the reins of your diligence?
Since boasting and the desire for vain praise urged on the incontinent mouth to fight against us, which, like other sources of evil, our legions rightly reject, we withdrew from them and could not finally find lodging among those we discovered to be seized by such errors.
For there is no fellowship between light and darkness, nor any communion between Christ and Belial, because according to the saying of a certain wise man, the spirit of God, who is indeed the leader of our army, flees from deceit and will not dwell in a body subjected to sins.
For he did not dwell among them nor they among us, who fosters pride, because according to the words of Jesus, the son of Sirach, pride is hateful before God and men, and the assembly of the proud will not be healed; the root of sin will be planted in them.
For in their synod, the disciple of pride, namely the incontinent mouth, prevailed as much as modesty and prudence should have prevailed, and whose slightest touch should not have been involved in such actions, held the chief place, alas!
And what should have held the chief place did not even have the slightest touch in their activities.
Thus, by your urging, O incontinent mouth, which prevents the steps of men from being directed in the land of the living, as the prophet says: A man of many words will not be established on the earth, and by whose effort sin is not absent, as it is written: In the multitude of words there is no sin lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise; and through which the soul is wounded, as the wise man says: He who uses many words wounds his soul;
and which not only responds before hearing but also anathematizes the holy church before speaking, you compel your followers according to the saying: He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him.
Thus, you have so thoroughly urged them to reject our fellowship that our association could not even leave a slight trace in their minds.
For to follow the beauty of life is for us, and to reject the error of madness, according to the voice of our teacher, wisdom, is our duty.
You will be cited soon. For if the legislator of our warnings had not been compliant and had not kept the steps of his mind bound to the reins of our guidance, as Scripture says:
"Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth,"
he would not have enjoyed divine conversations so frequently, nor would he have been imbued with so many mysteries with the Lord's guidance, nor would the Lord of all things have said of him:
"But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord."
The virtues of patience and humility are entirely attributed to those who have been sent to gather a council to anathematize the Catholic Church extraordinarily and who have attempted with insane audacity to curse what is eternally blessed. They did not heed what is written:
"Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God,"
and we must approach and hold onto it with the arm of faith, the hand of love, and the embrace of the heart. For the psalmist says:
"The Lord is good and upright; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way."
From this, it is understood that whoever wishes to be a follower of the Lord's gentleness should not scorn gentleness but should embrace it to be taught the ways of the Lord. It is also written in Proverbs:
"A gentle heart is the physician of the body, but an intelligent heart is the life of the bones."
Also there:
"Better a patient person who controls their temper than one who takes a city."
In Ecclesiasticus, it is written:
"Son, perform your tasks with humility, and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts."
Also, there:
"Be swift to hear, and let your life be sincere; and with patience give a true answer."
Moreover, Jesus, son of Sirach, says:
"Son, conduct your affairs with humility, and you will be loved more than a donor of gifts."
Thus, the teacher of the nations writes to the Ephesians:
"As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."
And the apostle James says:
"Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom."
All these commands are undoubtedly rejected by those who dared to anathematize the church for the worship of images, which is indeed as immune from their curse, which is unjust, as it is anointed with the oil of gladness by Christ, who redeemed it, with an unfading and perpetual anointing.
Concerning prudence, patience, and self-control of speech, it is written:
"Whoever spares their words has knowledge, and whoever has a calm spirit is a man of understanding."
For what word can be harsher than a curse? If they refrained from uttering it, they would not stray far from the path. What patience or prudence would be more useful to them in this matter than to consult the church established in various parts of the world through their letters and prudently and patiently sanction what the consensus of all has decreed? For it is said by a wise man:
"Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you."
In this saying, while by metonymy the eyes signify careful consideration of past actions and the feet signify the actions themselves, it clearly suggests to us that the exercises of our actions should always be preceded by prudent and careful consideration, so that the eye of the mind may foresee where actions will later extend.
Therefore, from the much speaking they used in their council, the psalmist declares himself to be restrained with these words:
"I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth."
And to be properly restrained, he strives to implore the Lord with these prayers:
"Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil."
If, therefore, we enumerate all that has been done through patience and gentleness by the holy fathers, whether in the Old or New Testament, and on the contrary, what has been done through pride or uncontrolled speech by the wicked...
Chapter 13: That a woman should not teach in a council, as Herena did in their council
Since almost in all respects, that council gathered for the worship of images contradicts the most beneficial teachings of the Holy Scriptures, it seems to contradict them also in this part, where it is said to have had a woman as an instructor or teacher. This is indeed prohibited not only by the teachings of divine law but also by the law of nature itself. For the fragility of her sex or the instability of her mind does not allow her to hold the position of teaching or leadership over men, but compels her to be restrained by male authority as one prone to deception and more easily led astray. Hence, it is also sanctioned by divine laws that certain vows of women can be nullified by male deliberation, and it is established by human laws that unmarried women, even if they are of advanced age, should remain under guardianship due to the lightness of their minds.
For we know that a woman is usually granted to a man for the sake of offspring, assistance, and to curb incontinence, but we never read that she is given for the sake of teaching. For the sake of offspring, as it is read in Genesis: "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'" This is indeed marriage, which according to Pelagius should not be considered a sin, nor according to Jovinian should it be equated with virginity, but virginity should be preferred over it because of the sanctity of purity and the integrity of the body, as the Apostle says: "The married woman thinks of the things of the world, how she may please her husband; the virgin thinks of the things of the Lord, how she may please the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit." Although the former is not to be rejected or entirely put aside, it should be pursued with gratitude by those to whom it is appropriate, since it is both ordinary in itself and fruitful towards virginity. For it is the seedbed of virginity, just as grapes are known to come from vines, so too virginity is born from marriage; and although virginity is the hundredfold fruit, it still includes the thirtyfold, that is, marriage, among which the sixtyfold, which is appropriately taken in widows, is intermediate.
Therefore, a woman is granted to a man for the sake of assistance, as the Lord says: "It is not good for man to be alone; let us make him a helper like unto himself," and for the sake of incontinence, according to the Apostle: "If they cannot contain, let them marry," and again: "It is better to marry than to burn."
Let us ask the Apostle then! Let the distinguished preacher, the chosen vessel, say whether he permits women to teach or to have authority over men? For he says to Timothy: "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." When asked why he prohibits her from both teaching and having authority over men, the wise teacher wisely gives the reason and says why he forbids both: "For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not the one deceived, it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner," so that we may know that the Apostle did not grant her the dignity of teaching or ruling over men, because she was created not to teach but to help the man, nor to rule over him but to be subordinate to him, either because she is weaker in mind and more easily tempted. For, as the Apostle says, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.
For if anyone should presumptuously try to support this error with the assertion that the same Apostle, when talking about the behavior and self-control of older women, says: "Let them teach what is good," and "teach with prudence," let him consider that he did not allow them to teach some kind of madness or some tradition resisting the sacred institutions of the fathers or certainly the worship of some senseless thing, but allowed them to teach prudence and examples of good living; nor to do this in church, nor in assembly, nor in council, but privately, with the experience of old age and freed from the incentives of vice due to the maturity of age, among their household; and not all women, but those who have a testimony of good works, who receive strangers, who wash the saints' feet, who endure tribulation.
They help with everything that follows every good work, including their own behavior, movements, expressions, serenity, and silence, which all exhibit a certain sacred decency. It's one thing for a mother to educate her household with words and examples, and another for a woman to teach church leaders or even participate in public synods with useless teachings, as this only seeks vain praise and arrogance.
Just as Christ is the head of the man, so the man is the head of the woman. Therefore, if a woman should lead men, she would become their head. And if she is their head, then they would necessarily be the head of Christ. But no one can be the head of Christ except the Father, according to the Apostle, who said,  Thus, a woman should not prefer herself over men to become their head, lest the inferior sex, by raising itself above its place, disrupts the natural order, where the head that should lead is lowered and the feet, which should be below, are raised above.
If anyone attempts to resist these sacred apostolic institutions by claiming that women should teach men, lead men, and establish synods because, according to the gospel proclamation, women often served the Mediator between God and men, sitting at His feet, hearing His word, busy with frequent service, washing His feet with their tears, drying them with their hair, anointing His body with precious ointments, following Him to His passion, and after His resurrection, returning to His tomb to be the first to witness and announce His glorious resurrection to the disciples, let him consider that sitting at the Lord's feet and performing those services is different from establishing synods, teaching men in assemblies, passing perverse laws, and seeking to lead men. Those women, who served the Lord, symbolized the holy church and clung to His sacred teachings, unlike Athaliah, who, by desiring to lead men with inappropriate ambition, nearly extinguished the entire royal lineage and ended her unworthy life with a death fitting her wickedness.
A woman is considered a proclaimer of our Lord and Savior's resurrection so that, just as a woman provided the way for Him to come from heaven to earth, a woman would also announce His return from earth to heaven. And just as the Virgin Mary bore Him into the world, Mary, who was healed by the Lord, would announce His return to the disciples. The Mediator between God and men was born of a woman not to elevate the female sex above men but to redeem both sexes, which had fallen into sin, through the mystery of His incarnation: a man, because He chose to become a man for our salvation, as the prophecy says,
Chapter 14: Against those who claim God's cooperation in gathering the council
XIV.
Against those who say: "We, cooperating with God, say we must gather you," or: "God gathered you, wanting to establish His own plan."
In the first book of this work, in the first part of the book, when discussing the error of those who say "God reigns with them," it was somewhat debated.
Thus, this error, which they arrogantly boast about as "cooperators with God," can be dismissed.
They are neither humble nor following the examples of the holy kings, nor instructed by the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, but are wrongfully and arrogantly elevated.
While they seek to usurp for themselves what is not appropriate, it is to be feared that they may lose what is appropriate, because whoever seeks illicit things tends to lose what they've acquired.
But since, as we mentioned before, this error was partly discussed earlier, now we turn to the point that they say those who are known to have been present at the same synod were gathered so that "God would establish His plan through them."
They say: "God gathered you, wanting to establish His own plan," as if it were not written: "He who lives forever created all things together," and as if some new will, which did not exist before, could come to God.
It is written through the prophet: "He established them forever and ever, He gave a decree, and it shall not pass away"—as if, needing the aid of others, He gathers them to decide what to do through the deliberation of many.
For counsel is derived from consultation, where something is determined through constant consideration of whether to do it or not.
It is a type of cause that speakers call deliberative, in which what should or should not be done is discussed.
There is persuasion and dissuasion, that is, about seeking and avoiding, doing and not doing.
In persuasion, two things are stronger: hope and fear.
Since God is omnipotent, He needs nothing.
Thus, He is not moved by another's persuasion to do things He does not want, nor dissuaded by anyone from what He wants to do, nor hindered by any fear from doing what He wants, nor urged by any hope to do what He does not want.
Nor does He establish the deliberation of His counsel with another.
If He needed all these things, He would experience necessity; if He experienced necessity, He would not be omnipotent.
However, He is omnipotent; therefore, He has no need.
Thus, it is foolish to say: "God gathered you, wanting to establish His own plan."
Indeed, the Son of God is His counsel, who was not established by the Father through some deliberation but was begotten before the ages by an ineffable birth, whom the faithful believe the Father begot and with whom He was never without.
He is the wisdom of God the Father, which is co-eternal with Him and which says: "Before the hills, I was brought forth. The earth was not yet made, and when He prepared the heavens, I was there; when He set a boundary for the sea and laid down the law for the waters, I was with Him."
This wisdom also demonstrates its loftiness with these words: "I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne was in the pillar of cloud"; and again: "I circled the vault of the sky alone and walked in the waves of the sea, I held the primacy in every nation and every people"; and again: "I spread out my branches like a terebinth. I made the morning star rise in the sky. I love all those who love me. My paths are the paths of life."
About this counsel, the psalmist said: "The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations."
It is called counsel because the mystery of His incarnation was granted to benefit the human race, a counsel that is never dissolved but remains forever because the triumphant death of the Lord extinguished the devil's destruction perpetually.
The thoughts of His heart imply the predestination of His inner judgment, in which all things are stored, whether they were or will be in the following ages.
Human counsels often fail, but the counsel of the Lord stands forever.
For mortal man thinks of fleeting things, but the eternal Lord...
Mistakes are never to be blamed. Hence, this plan, which they say the Lord had "established" through them, is not believed to be established by the Lord because it is known to go against the Lord's commandments. For God, through the pages of both the Old and New Testaments, has commanded that He alone be worshipped or revered. However, these people consider it the most absurd decision to worship or revere certain non-sentient things.
For God is unchangeable, so that what He had once prohibited, He does not now permit to be done but permits what He established in His counsel, that is, in His Son, to remain stable forever, as Isaiah testifies, who says from the person of God the Father: "All my counsel will stand, and I will accomplish all that I have thought."
For this counsel, that is, the Son, is also called the testament. Hence, Jeremiah says: "If my covenant were not with day and night, I would not have established the ordinances of heaven and earth." About this covenant, it is said: "And the covenant of peace will be in Jerusalem."
How, then, could God gather them to establish His own counsel through them, as they dream, in which there is such knowledge that nothing is past or future to Him, but all things are present, whose substance, as it is, no opinion can touch, no definition can encompass, since it is greater than anything that can be said or thought? For He is a spirit by nature simple, light inaccessible, invisible, inestimable, infinite, perfect needing nothing, eternal, immortal—and truly immortal, in whom all live, from whom all have received their beginning—to be revered, loved, feared, outside of whom there is nothing, indeed in whom all things that exist above and below, the highest and the lowest.
Omnipotent, holding all things, truly rich in all, because there is nowhere He is not, nor is any place absent from Him, except in the hearts of the impious, where, although He is there by His power, He is not there by His grace, who is proven to be everywhere by these testimonies of divine law. For the psalmist says: "Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I descend to hell, you are there; if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me."
In Isaiah it is also written: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of your glory." Through Jeremiah as well, He says: "I am a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off: if a man hides himself in secret places, do I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth?" says the Lord.
The Book of Wisdom also says: "For the holy spirit of wisdom will not free the blasphemer from his lips, for God is the witness of his innermost thoughts, the true observer of his heart, and the listener of his tongue, for the spirit of the Lord fills the world." In Ecclesiasticus, it is also written: "For the wisdom of God is great, strong in power, seeing all without ceasing; who by His goodness created him who was not, by His justice condemned him who had sinned, by His mercy, indeed great mercy, restored him who had perished."
About whom it is said through the prophet: "Great are the works of the Lord, sought out in all His will, His confession and magnificence are His work, and His justice endures forever." And again: "All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth." And to whom through the same prophet it is said: "But you, O Lord God, are merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and truth."
Is it possible to believe that He, whom dominions worship, powers tremble before, and the joyous host of angels praises with heavenly hymns, whom the cherubim and seraphim, those sublime powers filled with His knowledge, burning with His love, can in no way comprehend with their senses, whom no one knows except the Son, who is of one substance with Him, would need the counsel of another and therefore call others together to establish His own counsel through them? O most foolish statement! O insipid speech! O words opposing all divine words! Which, if defended by those to whom they were spoken, are close to madness; if not defended...
They are given, and must be attributed to ignorance and laziness! For anyone can adhere to God by persistently doing good deeds, just as the one desired who said: "For me, it is good to be close to God"; however, no one can give Him counsel. For He is the author and source of all good things and, as we have often said, in need of nothing, the Great One.
The Prophet says: "Our Lord is great, and His strength is immense, and His wisdom has no limit."
Tell us, please, holy Isaiah, most noble of prophets, tell us about the Lord's incarnation and the calling of the nations, as narrated in the Gospel rather than prophesied. Can anyone understand the mind of the Lord or become His counselor? For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor? With whom did He take counsel and who instructed Him in knowledge and showed Him the way of understanding?
The same prophet also says: "Do you not know? Have you not heard? The eternal God, the Lord, who created the ends of the earth, neither faints nor grows weary; His understanding is unsearchable."
Let the teacher of the nations also tell us what he thinks about this matter! For he says: "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His paths beyond tracing out!"
Since His judgments are unsearchable and His paths beyond tracing out, He is in no way believed to need another’s counsel for deliberations because, just as He surpasses all in nature, so He also surpasses all in wisdom. And as no one can be equal to Him by nature, so no one can add anything to His knowledge through counsel. For counsel is sought from one who is either equal by nature or by intelligence. But no one is equal to God, no one is His partner, as Moses says: "Who among the gods is like you, Lord? Who is like you—majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?"
And about whom it is said through the psalmist: "For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord, a God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, great and awesome above all who are around Him?"
Lord God of hosts, who is like you? "You are mighty, Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds you."
Chapter 15: Against those who equate honoring imperial images with venerating religious images
Whoever desires to have expertise in any craft through diligent study does so by adhering to the teachings of skilled, not unskilled, craftsmen, and does not attempt to usurp the mastery of those he sees as less learned and despicable in their own art. Otherwise, while trying to gain praise from the acquired skill, he wastes his work and becomes a mockery to others. This is observed by practitioners of the liberal arts, by doctors, by metalworkers or sculptors, by wood and stone carvers, and by farmers.
But it is neglected by those who, wanting to establish the practice of worshipping images, attempt to draw examples from corrupt things and shamelessly try to support something so useless and perverse with inappropriate good examples, or more often, with perverse ones. They are like a drunkard, soaked in wine, with trembling limbs and unsteady steps, using both barbaric and Latin words, enjoying both the heat of fires and the cold of frost, senselessly lying down or playing weakly without a fixed intention, swaying here and there, lacking reason. Similarly, these people use testimonies from divine Scriptures inappropriately, mix in their own nonsensical assertions, and try to firmly establish their error with examples of bad things and evil deeds.
For what madness or folly is it to bring forth the ridiculous example that images of emperors are worshipped in cities and streets, and expect an unlawful thing to be established by another unlawful thing? The teacher of the nations urges us not to be imitators of emperors, but of himself, indeed of Christ, saying: "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" First Corinthians 11:1; and to separate the fasces of emperors or the wild celebrations of the crowd from the minds of Christians, he says: "For us, to whom Christ was crucified, what have we to do with the forum?" Galatians 6:14.
Now, since they wish to draw examples from judicial or public actions within the holy church, why do they not also adopt the theatrical and mimicry antics or even the cruelties that happen miserably in the theaters or arenas with gladiatorial games? Why does not a cleric with a bishop chase the people like a net-wielding gladiator? Why does one who guards the church of Christ not follow the entirely pagan or rather unfortunate examples of the circus? But let it be far from the Catholic faith to imitate and uphold the perverse actions which the obstinate Gentiles once practiced. For our citizenship, says the Apostle, is in heaven Philippians 3:20. Therefore, whoever desires to go where our head, Christ, has preceded, should not be a follower of judicial or public actions, but of Christ our head or his members, namely the apostles or apostolic men.
For wrong examples must be avoided by Catholics, just as the seduction of evil men or the company of the unjust, as the Lord says: "You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shall you bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert justice" Exodus 23:2. A Christian should hate, like the psalmist, those who hate the Lord and pine away over His enemies. Indeed, Tobit, a commendable man and beloved by God, did not urge his son to follow perverse examples when he said: "See, my son, that you do not follow the way of iniquity, and let not the multitude of sinners persuade you, for their wages are death; but if you work truth, God will regard your works, and you will inherit eternal life with all who practice justice."
Therefore, whoever sees the images of emperors worshipped by the masses and, encouraged by this example, considers worshipping images...
In the basilicas, it is clearly shown that he strongly resisted this holy man's command and could not say with David:
"I have not sat with the council of vanity, nor will I go in with those who work iniquity; I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked; I will wash my hands in innocence and will surround Your altar, Lord."
But if perhaps a defender of this error says, "Worshipping the images of emperors is not a sin," let him consider the great glory given to the three youths who refused to do so in the blazing furnace. When an angel was sent from heaven to extinguish the consuming fire and impart a life-giving dew to them, the Babylonian prince testified that he saw among them someone like the Son of God, not to his own glory, but to theirs, or even to refute his own stubbornness.
Let them also hear the blessed Jerome in his commentary, which he published in the book of Daniel, speaking thus:
"Behold, our God, whom we worship, can save us from the burning fiery furnace and out of your hands, O king."
What he thought would terrify the youths, he sees in them as a source of strength.
They do not delay but promise present help, saying:
"Behold, our God, whom we worship, can save us from the fire you threaten and from your hands."
"But if He does not."
Beautifully, in response to what was said: "He can save us," he did not add the contrary: "if He cannot," but: "if He does not," so that it is not about God's inability, but His will if they perish.
"Let it be known to you, O king, that we do not worship your gods and we will not worship the golden statue you have set up."
Whether we read "statue," as Symmachus, or "golden image," as others have translated, worshippers of God should not worship it.
Therefore, judges and rulers of the world who worship the statues and images of emperors should understand that by doing this, they are doing what the three youths, by refusing to do, pleased God. And note the precision: to worship gods and adore images, neither of which is fitting for God's servants.
We are instructed by the teachings of holy men that we should not worship the images of emperors. And who is so perverse as not only to decide to worship them but also to take examples of perversity from their worship to the worship of other images?
If mortal men, inflated with the arrogance of vanity, exalted by worldly pomp, greedy for honors, full of boasting, confined by place, content with location because they could not be everywhere, therefore commanded their images to be worshipped by men because they themselves could not be worshipped everywhere, what need is there to worship God in an image, who is unlimited, who is everywhere entirely, everywhere wonderful, who is not contained by place, not confined by location, whom, as Solomon says, the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain, whom the world cannot contain, but He contains the world?
For since His power is so great, His glory so immense, His might so vast, He is not to be sought in images but in pure and holy hearts; He is not to be worshipped in a painted tablet, but in a holy hall, as the prophet says:
"Worship the Lord in His holy hall";
who is not found through painting in appointed places, but through works by devout minds; whom Elijah did not seek in place, in painting, or tablets, but knew Him to be present everywhere and showed himself present to Him by the urgency of good works, when he said:
"The Lord lives, in whose presence I stand."
Therefore, wanting to worship God in tablets, who is unlocalized and omnipotent, as the Gentiles worshipped their localized or mortal kings, is profane and close to unbelief. For we read that no nation committed this crime except the Babylonians and Romans or those nations that were either subdued by them or neighboring to them or took examples from them, so that as these two kingdoms are known to have surpassed other kingdoms of the world in ferocity and strength, so they are also believed to have been more prone to worshipping and adoring idols.
Therefore, between these two strongest kingdoms, there was great agreement, great similarity: great cruelty, and also great strength, and indeed strength, which ruled over other kingdoms of the world in their time. For as that one from the East, so indeed this one from...
It emerged from the West; that one during the world's youth, this one now during the world's old age. For, as historians say, the Roman Empire inherited all the legacy and pinnacle of the Babylonian kingdom. Between these two kingdoms, like an old father who had already lost his power and a young son who had not yet gained the strength to rule, two kingdoms acted as guardians, namely the Persians and the Macedonians. But when the heir, that is, the Roman Empire, grew up, what held the place of the guardian withdrew, and the young son took on the inheritance that the old father had lost.
It would be lengthy to follow the harmonies or agreements of these two kingdoms. For, to keep other things silent, in this part there is significant harmony between the two kingdoms. Both decreed that their kings should be worshipped in statues or images through fields or streets and imposed diverse punishments on those who refused to do this. For this evil, along with other evils frustrated by the advent of Christ, must be completely frustrated. Not only should examples for other actions be taken from Him, but this very thing must be eradicated by Christians from the root, so that no root of bitterness, as the Apostle says, may spring up again and defile many.
For, being instructed by apostolic teachings that we should give no opportunity to the evil one, why should we give such an opportunity to the Gentiles by worshipping images of mortal kings? They might say to us: "We worship the images or statues of those whom we believe to be gods by true religion or whom we have learned from the traditions of the ancients not to be ignorant of being gods; but you, for whom this is an abomination, why do you venerate images of men, either painted on wax or cast in metal, under the reverence of kings with even public worship? As you preach, do you give to men the honor due only to God? If it is unlawful and contrary to the law, why do you do this, Christians, or why do your priests not prohibit it, so that what you ascribe to us ignorantly as sacrilege, you knowingly undertake under the excuse of duty?"
When such and similar things were brought up against our people by the philosophers of the Gentiles during the early times of faith, our people are said to have responded thus: "What you say, we neither ought nor can approve, for by the clear words of God we are not allowed to worship elements, angels, or any rulers of heaven and earth or air."
For this is a special name of divine duty and is higher than all earthly veneration or reverence. But just as in such evil, flattery first led men astray, so now custom scarcely recalls them from error. Although in this careless compliance, divine worship is not found, but because of the likeness of beloved faces, the intended joys make them do more than those to whom it is offered perhaps demand, or than the offerers ought to perform. Nonetheless, more reverent and stricter Christians abhor this custom, to whom it does not appear that they then decreed to worship the images of kings, although the minds of men, still rough and not yet solidly converted from gentility, were still unprepared to grasp solid food.
Now indeed, because they say that by the example of imperial images, the image of God or the holy mother of God, Mary, or all the saints should be worshipped, how absurd and how useless this is, is evident. It has been shown in part either in this chapter or in others. For no one besides God Almighty can have or retain the images or names of all the saints, as the prophet says: "Your friends are greatly honored, O God, their rule is greatly strengthened. I will count them, and they will multiply beyond the sand." And the Lord said to Abraham: "If the stars of heaven can be numbered because of their multitude, so can your offspring be numbered."
The offspring of Abraham, however, are manifest to be all the believers. For he is the father of nations, in whose offspring, that is in Christ, all nations shall be blessed; who according to the apostle was called a friend of God not from circumcision, but from belief, nor was the observation of the law but the belief of faith counted to him as righteousness.
Chapter 16: Against those who say the honor of an image transfers to its original form
It is very common and exceedingly familiar to those who are fervent in the worship of images to believe and assert that the honor given to an image can transfer to the form it represents. How this could happen and whether it can happen is not understood by any reasoning, nor is it approved by the testimonies of divine scriptures.
Did the saints, who were able to ascend to the heavenly kingdoms because of their merits and whose images those people worship improperly, seek superstitious or unnecessary honors? Did they allow themselves to be worshipped? Some of them wanted to be humble to earn the grace of the Lord; among these was the one who said:  "I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked." Others preferred to be flogged rather than venerated; witness the one who said:  "I am ready not only to be bound but also to die for the name of the Lord Jesus." For the teacher of the nations recounts that they were not seekers of honors, but were burning with spiritual zeal, fortified against adversities, refined by the fire of tribulation, and made stronger than worldly adversities. He says that some of them were tempted, like Achaia; some were stoned, like Zechariah and Stephen; some were sawn in two, like Isaiah; some were killed with the sword, as many prophets are known to have been; some wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, like Elijah and John; some were oppressed or in need, and the world was not worthy of them, as it is believed of almost all saints.
These examples show that they were driven by the desire for virtues, not honors. For if they had been burned with ambition for honors while they lived mortally, they would not today enjoy such great glory in heaven. Since perpetual honor has been attributed to them by the Lord, they are not in need of transient honors.
Therefore, the honor duly given to the bodies of the saints, their relics, or basilicas, remains acceptable to Almighty God and His saints; but inappropriate and indecent honor remains unacceptable to God and His saints. This is why the blessed Joseph, after prophecy, commanded his bones to be carried by the children of Israel to the promised land, so that the Egyptians, remembering him and his administration during the great famine in Egypt, would not give his bones useless veneration. He, being firmly devoted to God the Creator and entirely alien to the vain superstitions of the Egyptians, showed his sanctity more strongly by serving God humbly and rightly in life and rejecting inappropriate veneration of his ashes after death. Therefore, since holy men acceptable to God in all things avoided the vain services of men, just as Paul and Barnabas are known to have avoided the superstitious services of the Lycaonians, and Peter rejected the devoted veneration of Cornelius, and the angel in the Apocalypse forbade John from worshiping him, who would believe that they delight in the worship of images or are soothed by the services rendered to pictures? How could the honor given to pictures, which are neither of their bodies nor clothes but are prepared by artists according to their skill, reach them? For they are not depicted by the work of painters, who reign with Christ in heaven, nor do they seek to be painted by craftsmen on boards or walls, who have earned to be inscribed in the book of life by Christ.
Let those who are so peculiar in saying that the honor of the image transfers to the original form, say where they have read this or by what testimonies they can prove it. For our Lord and Savior did not say:  "As long as you did for the images," but:  "As long as you did it for one of the least of these, you did it for me;" nor did He say:  "Whoever receives the images," but:  "Whoever receives you receives me;" nor did the Apostle say:  "Let us love images," but:  "Let us love one another, for love comes from God;" nor did he say to bear the burdens of images, but to bear each other's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
You will be violating the law of Christ.
For since images are generally made according to the skill of the artists, so that sometimes they are beautiful, sometimes ugly, sometimes nicely done, sometimes even poorly, some very much resemble those they depict, while others are quite different, some are shining with newness, while others are fading with age, we must ask which of them are more honorable: those that are more expensive, or those that are known to be cheaper?
Because, if the more expensive ones have more honor, it means that the work or the quality of the materials is being venerated, not the fervor of devotion; if, however, the cheaper ones—those that are less similar to those they are meant to represent—are unjustly venerated, then it is wrong, since these, which neither excel in work nor material nor are known to resemble the persons, are venerated more fervently and extensively.
For while we do not expect anything from images except for reverence, since we allow images in the churches of the saints not for worship but for the memory of the deeds and for the beauty of the walls, those others place nearly all their hope of belief in images, it remains for us to venerate the saints in their bodies or rather the relics of their bodies or even their garments according to the tradition of the ancient fathers, while they, worshiping walls and panels, think they gain great merit in faith because they are subject to the works of painters.
For even if this can be avoided by the educated, who understand what they are venerating in images, it causes scandal among the uneducated, who venerate and worship nothing other than what they see.
Hence, it must be avoided that they fall under the gospel sentence, who cause so many little ones to stumble, since if he who causes one of the little ones to stumble is subjected to a most fearful sentence, much more will he be struck with severe destruction who causes nearly the whole church of Christ to either worship images or condemns those who reject image worship to anathema.
Both of which must be avoided with great caution, lest anyone, by leaning too much to either side than order requires, cannot avoid the loss of his own salvation.
Chapter 17: On the reckless statement of Constantinus, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus
"I receive and honorably embrace the holy and venerable images according to the service of adoration that I offer to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity; and those who do not feel this way or glorify them, I separate from the holy, catholic, and apostolic church and subject them to anathema and align them with those who have denied the incarnate and saving dispensation of Christ, our true God."
How recklessly and, if I may say so, foolishly Constantinus, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, with the consent of others, declared he would 'receive and honorably embrace images' and 'render them the service of adoration owed to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,' is not to be much debated in our discussion,
as it is clear to all who read or hear this that he is deeply immersed in error.
He admits to offering to created things the service due only to the Creator, and while trying to favor pictures, he contradicts all holy Scriptures.
Who, therefore, in their right mind would ever say or agree with such an absurdity, that the variety of pictures should be held in as much honor as the holy, life-giving, and creator of all things Trinity, and that such service should be rendered to a picture as is rendered to the Lord of all creation?
Or who would tolerate hearing someone utter such nonsense rather than speak sense?
Or what ears would strive to avoid rather than perceive such a great crime?
For it is perverse to offer to any insensate things the service of adoration due to Almighty God,
to whom there is no equal,
to whom it is said by Solomon: "Lord, there is none like you in heaven above or on earth below" (First Kings 8:23).
With what face, therefore, to pass over other matters, does he hear this one command of divine law: "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve" (Matthew 4:10),
who, having spurned this, not only serves created things but also strives to equate their service with the service due to God?
Let the bishop stand in the church and read: "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve,"
and then, as soon as he sits in the assembly, say:
"I receive and honorably embrace the holy and venerable images and give them the service of adoration due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,"
thus showing himself unstable in divine words, professing one thing with his mouth, believing another in his heart, reading one thing in the divine pages, holding another in the recesses of his heart, and preferring his nonsense to the divine precepts.
For while it is known to be harmful to him and his followers in their perverse profession,
it is known to be beneficial to us, who wish to resist their nonsense, since it uncovers the unfortunate error they seem to impose on the people, disguised though it may be.
For they say: "We do not worship images as God nor do we render them the worship of divine service, but while we look at and worship them, we fix the acumen of our mind where we know those whom they represent to be."
But on the contrary, this man, exposing their error and revealing his own thoughts without any cover, admits that he renders the same service to images as to the holy Trinity;
thus, the absurdity that they secretly harbor, he openly declares.
No one can be unaware of their folly, as the sentiment of this profession reveals it.
Because, therefore, he tries to separate and anathematize all who disagree with his error from the holy, catholic, and apostolic church and aligns them with those who refused to believe in the saving incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ,
it is clear to all readers how great his foolishness is, as he, sunk in the abyss of his own folly, while drawing others to suffer such things with him,
tries to rebuke with insults and abusive words those whom he sees avoiding the abyss of such a great danger.
For what madness or what insanity is it to try to tear Christ's people away from the breasts of the mother church because the service due only to God is given to insensate things?
Trying to oppose! Or what perversity is it to consider equal those who, with a stubborn mind, refuse to believe in the life-giving incarnation of the Mediator between God and humans, Jesus Christ, with those who, rejecting the commands of divine law, desire to serve only God, who created everything and to whom all things serve!
It’s one thing not to believe in the redemption of the world, another to want to serve only God; one thing to spurn the Savior of the world, another to reject the worship of images; one thing to resist saving teachings, another to oppose vain and superstitious practices. The same Lord and Savior, who, through the Old Testament, prohibited the worship of images, and through his physical presence, deemed that the image of Caesar should be given to Caesar rather than worshipped, gave such commandments about believing in him, saying:  “Whoever believes in me has eternal life”; and again:  “I am the door and the life; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture”; and again:  “Unless one is born of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.”
The Truth says this, the Savior of the world testifies this, the Redeemer of humanity proclaims this, and who is so dull and sluggish as to consider equal those who contradict these most authoritative teachings with those who, content with divine words, despise worshipping things without sense?
Let it be that worshipping images is a virtue and a good deed. Can it be equated to faith? While all good works must be pursued, no good work can bring anyone to perfect salvation unless it is built upon the foundation of faith and strengthened by it. Abraham was justified not by works but by faith; Moses became great through faith; the saints conquered kingdoms through faith, and all the saints died in faith. And the prophet says:  “All his works are in faith”; and the Lord in the gospel:  “Your faith has saved you”; and again:  “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will be done; and whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive.”
From this, it is understood that faith surpasses all other virtues; and although hope and charity are connected to it, it is through faith that one reaches them. Nor should the same condemnation be given to those who err in other works as to those who err in faith, since, although no one can be saved by worshipping images without faith, countless legions in the heavenly homeland, whether through martyrdom, innocence, or the life of solitude, never had or worshipped images, yet through the observance of faith, they enjoy eternal joys in the company of the inhabitants of heaven.
Chapter 18: That Euthymius, Bishop of Sardis, erred in his statement about image veneration
When Euthymius, Bishop of Sardis, is almost identical in his confession to Constantine, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, it is not uncertain that they share the same faith and will receive the same reward, unless repentance precedes in either of them.
For both confess with all their heart to embrace images with the highest honor and affectionate adoration.
Oh, the foolish confession of bishops! Oh, the insane preaching of prelates!
The Catholic Church, with the voice of its prelates, rejoicing in the mystery of Christ's incarnation, says to the Lord:
"We have received, O God, Your mercy in the midst of Your temple," and these men say: "We receive and adore images."
The congregation of believers, invoking Christ, who is our peace and who made both one, prays to receive the apostles and apostolic men, saying:
"Let the mountains bring peace to Your people," and these men say: "We receive images with affectionate adoration."
Therefore, since these men place almost all their hope for help in images, they do not moderately dissent from the holy and universal church, which places its hope for help not in painted pictures, not in handmade works of artisans, but in God, the Creator of all.
It has as its helpers the apostles and apostolic men, who intercede daily with the Lord for it and, by the gift of the Holy Spirit from the heavens, pour out the rain of holy preaching upon the church according to the prophecy of Joel, saying: “And it will be in that day, the mountains will drip sweetness, and the hills will flow with milk,” which Ezekiel also echoes by saying: “But you, O mountains of Israel, will give forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel to eat.”
This fruit, although understood as Christ the Lord, who came from the mountains of Israel by assuming human form from the patriarchs, can also be understood as the sweetness of preaching combined from the Old and New Testaments, which is spread through the minds of humble believers and softens the hearts of the incredulous to believe and bear fruit, and brightens the minds of leaders with the hope of eternal reward.
It encourages them to be clothed in righteousness and to sing to God with their subjects, fulfilling the prophetic word: “Your fields will be filled with abundance, the fertile places of the wilderness will overflow, and the hills will be girded with joy; the rams of your flock will be clothed, and the valleys will abound with grain. They will shout for joy and sing hymns.”
For he lifts his eyes to them, saying: “I lift my eyes to the mountains, from where my help will come.”
He does not say: “I lift my eyes to senseless things, that I may receive help from them,” but: “I lift my eyes to the mountains,” to those mountains upon which the church of Christ is founded, according to the prophet: “His foundation is in the holy mountains.”
Seeing the people of God delivered from Egyptian slavery and ascending to the promised land, that is, despising the burdensome slavery of this world and flying to the eternal homeland, they rejoice, as the most holy of prophets says: “The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs of the flock.”
Therefore, whoever, turning away from the vanities of created things, lifts the eyes of his mind solely to worship and serve God, dispelling the sleep of unbelief, will not fear when the proud aerial powers or their followers descend into the deadly darkness of Hell.
And with the highest jubilation, together with others of like mind, he will sing: “Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth be moved, and the mountains be carried into the heart of the sea; though its waters roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with its swelling.”
It comes to the mountains and evil spirits, about whom it is said through the prophet Nahum:
"The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away."
And about whom the Apostle says:
1 Corinthians:
"If I have faith that can move mountains."
The instigator of all evils and the opposite of all good counsels, therefore, persuaded men to worship creatures, to turn them away from the Creator.
By his worst persuasions, the worship of creatures increased. Under the pretext of some sort of religion and reverence for saints, it held a significant place among those who confessed to 'embrace' and worship images 'with all their heart.'
For while the error of both is nearly equal, as we have stated, it is known to be somewhat different. Constantine judged those who refused to offer the service owed to God alone to creatures as unbelievers and infidels, while Euthymius condemned them not as unbelievers, but as heretics. As Sedulius said about some:
"Both equal in error, although following different paths."
Due to the madness of one error, they falsely claim that the holy Catholic Church is partly unbelieving and partly heretical. For if all of us Christians, who wish to offer the service owed to God alone, rejecting the worship of creatures, are judged heretics because we do not serve images, then those who served creatures, whether before or after the coming of the Redeemer, will undoubtedly be judged as completely Catholic.
If they are unbelievers—and indeed they are unbelievers because they worshipped creatures instead of the Creator—they will be judged by all means. We, who serve the one and only God, rejecting vanities, and offer him due and fitting service, will be considered and judged as Catholics and faithful.
Chapter 19: That Agapius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, made a foolish statement about divine Scriptures
Often ignorance is both guilty and innocent; guilty ignorance frequently tries to cause harm, while innocent ignorance does not intend to offend anyone. But although neither type is subject to sin, both are subject to criticism because guilty ignorance is driven by a disgraceful will to offend, and innocent ignorance, even if it does not sin by harming anyone, still does not escape criticism because all ignorance is unlearned and all unlearned things are subject to criticism.
Thus, the ridiculous statement by Agapius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, saying, "It is written in our divine Scriptures," is proven to be subject to either the same criticism that is applied to sin or the same that is applied to ignorance. This is because it is either guilty of sin, as those who, being men not different from other mortals, claim that God reigns with them and call themselves 'divine' and their actions or words 'divine,' and therefore call their writings 'divine'; or it is subject to criticism for speaking uneloquently and ignorantly, having said 'in our divine Scriptures' instead of something like 'in our codices containing divine Scriptures' or something similar, thus speaking awkwardly and ridiculously.
If it is believed that he said this out of the arrogance by which they presume to call themselves 'divine' and claim that God reigns with them, it is madness. If they wanted to say something else but lacked the sharpness to express what they conceived in their hearts with precise words, it is laziness. Thus, they are either carried away by arrogance or believed to be bound by the dark chains of ignorance.
Who in their right mind would say such a thing? What sane person would utter such a statement? What madness or folly makes a mortal man, subjected to passions, say: "It is written in our divine Scriptures"? If they are 'ours,' how can they be 'divine'? And if they are 'divine,' how can they be 'ours'? Human things derive from humans, divine things derive from God. Our writings are human, God’s writings are divine. We can rightly call the books of the holy law 'our books,' but we can only properly call divine Scriptures 'divine Scriptures.'
Even if this statement could reasonably stand, which it cannot, it could not be believed to have come from a source of boasting or from the abyss of ignorance. Ultimately, it is criticized in every way possible because it is useless, and it appears to have been made uselessly to support something useless, namely, the worship of images.
And simplicity, which often adheres to straightforward things, cannot support it, as it is clear that it was not said with pure, straightforward intent but with perverse will. If it were known to have come simply and innocently from a holy rusticity, which sometimes benefits only itself, not to assert something forbidden, God, who examines the heart and kidneys and often considers intentions rather than actions, would undoubtedly forgive it. For just as a bad will, even if it does not carry out any evil act, is often held accountable as if it did, so a good will is always accepted as a good deed. To illustrate this with examples, Balaam's bad will, which desired to curse the people of God, although he did not achieve what he wanted, was not free from guilt; and David's good will, which desired to build a temple for the Lord, although it was not fulfilled in action, was praised by divine oracles.
Chapter 20: On John the Priest's recounting of John Chrysostom's words about an angel in an image
"And saying: I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," he said: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem while they were arrayed?"
John Chrysostom is said to have told Theodosius, abbot of the monastery of Saint Andrew, in the often mentioned and most vain synod, which was held for the worship of images: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians."
Since those who are said to have been in that synod try to distort the words of patriarchs, prophets, and other saints and illustrious men in order to establish the worship of images, and falsely claim that these same patriarchs performed certain acts which they did not, it is not surprising if they also falsely accuse John Chrysostom of saying such things.
For would that eloquent and learned man say: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," knowing that the immortal nature of angels is by no means in need of paintings to be seen by men?
For they are by nature spirits, and their role is as angels, who, if they are to be seen by men, are believed to take on bodies from the most luminous ether, not from the works of painters.
Therefore, it is not to be believed that such a statement was made by the most eloquent John, as it is neither well-phrased nor clear in meaning nor supported by any reason.
It contains the flaw which grammarians call amphiboly, that is, ambiguity of expression, because when it is said: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," it is not clearly evident whether he saw an angel in an image who was chasing a multitude of barbarians somewhere else or whether an angel was seen somewhere else and was chasing a multitude of barbarians in an image.
Even if this statement were free from this flaw, other indications would show it not to be by such a great man, who, since he was not of that age, would be most ridiculous and rather false to say: "I saw an angel chasing barbarians," who, if I am not mistaken, saw the same story painted by an artist in a picture, where the angel had previously struck down the ranks of barbarians.
Many eloquent and learned men, in the vast fields of their discussions, as order and reason dictate, mention paintings and images, just as they do other things.
But when those who burn with the zeal for worshiping such images find these mentions in their readings, they try to pervert everything to that worship, so that they might seem to arm their defenseless assertion against us, who, with the Lord's favor, are true worshippers, worshipping the Father in spirit and in truth.
They attempt to make their defenseless assertion armed by discovering that the most eloquent men mentioned some images, as if commandments are given about all things mentioned in treatises.
Thus John the priest, when the aforementioned Theodosius the abbot falsely claimed that John, bishop of Constantinople, said: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," is immediately reported to have added and said: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem while they were arrayed?"
In many places of that vain reading, which was compiled by them from this matter, he is found to have spoken many notable things hastily and carelessly.
For he is noted to have spoken incautiously almost everywhere there, and the faster he was in words, the slower he is proven to be in understanding, as Solomon says: If you see a man hasty in his words, know that a fool has more hope than he.
For when he is reported to have said about the painting: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians?" and so forth, it becomes apparent how incautious and delirious he was, since that angel did not strike the Assyrians in a painting, but the one who was sent to accomplish that task.
In the case of Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, as if it were written this way, and in this, as in other things, the lack of education is revealed, because nowhere is it found written in this order of words.
Although Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, captured almost all the fortified cities of Judah, the Scripture says: And it happened in the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. However, he never reached Jerusalem, nor did he set up camp around the city with machines to strike the wall, but he sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, who is recorded to have stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway to the fuller's field.
The Book of Chronicles, which is called Dibre Hayyamim in Hebrew and Paralipomenon in Greek, which is the chronicle of the divine law, testifies to this: Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, sent his servants to Jerusalem. For he himself with his entire army was besieging Lachish. For what John is known to have used in his usual manner, as if it were written there: 'Around Jerusalem with soldiers,' is found in none of the authentic books of the holy law.
To prove this more clearly, the very words of the holy law, as they are in the books, must be set forth in order. Thus, in the Book of Kings, it is written: So it happened that night, the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 181,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When morning came, they saw all the dead bodies and Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, departed and returned to Nineveh.
The Book of the very holy and eloquent prophet Isaiah also describes this history in this way: The angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians, and when morning came, behold, all the dead bodies. Then Sennacherib departed and returned and stayed in Nineveh.
The Book of Chronicles, which, as we have said, is the chronicle of the entire divine law, but it elaborates on the histories of the kings from the side of the Book of Kings, which were omitted there, narrates this history in this way: And the Lord sent an angel, who struck down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame to his own land.
In these examples, what John has used is not found at all.
Chapter 21: That the story of Polemon's image preventing adultery lacks authority and is wrongly compared to Christ's miracles
Among other nonsensical claims made to support their error, this one is the most familiar to them:
they assert that someone was restrained from committing adultery by the image of a certain Polemon.
Even if this event did happen - though it is not found in any authentic books of either the Old or New Testaments, nor mentioned by any of the recognized doctors of the holy Roman Catholic and apostolic church - they present it as if it were a proven miracle and dare to equate it with the miracle of the hem of the Lord's garment.
Even if, as they assert, it happened, it should not and cannot be equated with the saving acts of the Lord, because the distance between some unknown Polemon and the Mediator between God and men is as great as the distance between the acts of the aforementioned Polemon and his image and the most holy miracles of the Lord Savior.
Their deeds cannot be similar since they are vastly different in virtue.
The prophet says, "Who among the clouds can be compared to the Lord? Or who among the sons of God is like the Lord?"  (Psalm 89:6).
It is also said in the Song of Songs, "His head is the finest gold"  (Song of Solomon 5:11), because just as no metal can be equated in nature to gold, so no creature can be equated to the Creator of all, who is the head of Christ.
It is also said in the Song of Songs by the bride, "As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the sons"  (Song of Solomon 2:3), because just as an apple, being beautiful in appearance and having a sweet smell, surpasses the trees of the forest, so our Redeemer, who is the fragrance of life, whom the church daily follows in the fragrance of his ointments, surpasses all gatherings of the saints, who are therefore called sons because they are known not to adhere to the world to which they were born, but to Christ to whom they were reborn.
In the Book of Revelation, it is also read that the twenty-four elders cast their crowns before the Lamb, because all the virtues and victories of the saints, in which they shone by his help, are seen to be lesser compared to his virtues and victory, just as a stream derived from a perennial source is considered lesser when compared to the source itself, and a worthless vine shoot is always considered inferior when compared to the fruitful branches of the vine.
Even if it is believed that the power of Polemon's image restrained someone from the crime of adultery, does that mean all images should be worshipped?
Should animals be worshipped because the tongue of a speechless animal, speaking human words, restrained the perverse intention of a soothsayer who tried to curse a blessed people, and an irrational animal was allowed to avoid the terrifying blows of an angel for a rational man?
Or should the ferocity of bears be worshipped because a group of children mocking a man of God was torn apart by them?
Often, events occur by chance that somehow prevent the perpetration of harmful deeds by those wishing to commit them, but reason does not allow the worship of the things through which these events happen.
Therefore, even if what they say about Polemon and his image is true, it does not mean images should be worshipped, because, as we briefly mentioned, not all things that bring some benefit to mortals are to be worshipped.
If, however, it is not true, as we believe, and they do not present it with fully reasonable authority, since they do not prove it with any authentic evidence, then the worship of such utterly senseless things cannot be established.
In modern English:
Indeed, because actions that should be done rationally and truthfully are never established by lies or examples of lies, as truth is never known to consent to lies, lies are always believed to oppose the truth. These two are seen to be opposed to each other in such a way that they always resist each other. Just as no one can nourish fire with flowing water, nor can anyone increase flowing water with fire, no one can prove the truth with lies as they desire to do.
Therefore, having briefly examined and proven in part that the act involving the image of Polemon—if indeed, as they admitted, it happened—cannot nor should be equated to the act involving the hem of the Lord's garment, whether it is entirely doubtful whether it happened as they say it did or not, or even if it did happen, the worship of images cannot be established from it. Moreover, truth cannot be approved or established by lies. Therefore, it is now worthwhile to briefly explain what the hem of the Lord's garment, which they try to compare to the image of Polemon, symbolically implies with its hidden mysteries.
The hem of the Lord's garment signifies the faith of the Incarnation, by whose touch Gentiles lost the sickness of idolatry and foulness. For just as the hem is the smallest part compared to the body or the entire garment, so the Incarnation of the Redeemer, compared to the divine and ineffable generation by which He was begotten by the Father before the ages, seems to be the smallest. Of this generation, it is said through Isaiah:  "Who shall declare His generation?"  (Isaiah 53:8) The implication is that 'no one' can. However, His human generation is thus described by the evangelist:  "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David."  (Matthew 1:1)
Therefore, the woman touching the hem of the Lord's garment from behind received the desired healing, which the skill of doctors had long denied her, because after the Lord's passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, the Gentiles received the health of faith by touching the hem of the Lord's garment—that is, by believing in the mystery of His Incarnation, which neither the teaching of the patriarchs nor the prophets could impart to them. And while scarcely a small crowd of disciples believed at the Lord's preaching, nevertheless, at the preaching of the apostles, such a great multitude was inflamed with the swift fervor of faith that it is reported that on one day five thousand men believed, and on another day, three thousand. This is what the Truth promised to the disciples, saying:  "He who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also, and greater works than these he will do."  (John 14:12) Some believe that this can be understood in the miracle performed by Peter by the Lord's will, for while the Lord healed the sick by the command of His word or by touch, Peter is read to have healed the sick by the mere touch of his shadow.
Therefore, the Lord, going to raise the daughter of the synagogue ruler, heals the woman from the flow of blood by the touch of His hem, because, as He aimed to awaken the synagogue, which undoubtedly descended from the stock of the patriarchs and prophets, from the sleep of unbelief, He healed the Gentiles from the most insolent worship of demons by the knowledge of His faith. And the good that the synagogue, ensnared by the guilt of perfidy, neglected to receive, the Gentiles merited to receive by the devotion of faith. Therefore, the Lord testifies that He came to liberate the synagogue, both by saying in His bodily presence:  "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel"  (Matthew 15:24) and by forbidding the disciples to go into the way of the Gentiles and enter the cities of the Samaritans  (Matthew 10:5). And allegorically, He promises to descend into the garden of the Israelite people through Solomon in the Song of Songs, saying:  "I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley."  (Song of Solomon 6:11) Because, indeed, while He descended by taking on flesh to the garden of the Jewish people, where the law revealed the utmost severity in its shell and concealed incomparable sweetness in its core, He visited the abandoned works of the Gentile valley and joined it to Himself with the integrity of faith.
Furthermore, when the healed woman is brought to the house of the synagogue ruler by the Lord, and his daughter is raised from the bonds of death, the synagogue, once...
Doubts will be dispelled, and through faith in Christ, we will rise and live with Him forever.
This is shown because, as soon as the full number of non-Jewish people have come in, according to the Apostle, the blindness that came upon them for not believing in the Mediator between God and humans will be removed.
By believing in Him, who was foretold to them long ago by the patriarchs and prophets through the thunderings of sacred prophecies, all of Israel will be saved.
Therefore, since the image of Polemon lacks these and other similar mysteries hinted at through the garment of the Lord, it should not be considered in the same way as the hem of the Lord's garment, nor should it be equated in honor to something that cannot be matched in the splendor of so many mysteries.
Chapter 22: That the judges at the synod inappropriately exalted the art of painting
If a harmful fluid besieges the citadel of the body, that is, the head, it easily spreads to the other limbs.
It's not surprising if this fluid, having spread to the lowest parts of the feet, causes them severe damage, especially since it is known to have injured the head, which commands all the limbs.
Therefore, the madness of worshiping images, which has crept into the minds of Constantine and his mother Helena, as well as Terasius, the bishop of Constantinople, and the other priests of those regions, should not be highly esteemed if it descends to deceive the minds of judges or common people.
As shown by the previous example, when the head is invaded by the arrogance of a certain thing, it easily invades the rest, which are shown to be subordinate to the head.
"The whole head is sick," says the prophet, "and the whole heart is faint. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it."
For evidently, when kings and priests, who ought to be examples of good living to their subordinate people, neglect the pursuit of living rightly and acting rightly, the internal health of the subordinate common people is somewhat doubted.
When therefore in the same synod the minds of so many priests were beset with errors, how could the error not adhere to the minds of the judges?
Or who will lead the sheep back from error if the shepherds themselves hold the leadership in error?
For priests who are known to lead their subordinate people into error are rebuked with such reproaches by the prophet Jeremiah: "Therefore, this is what the Lord says to the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away and have not looked after them."
Immediately, it is shown how great God's care is for the people and how, when the negligent are removed, more diligent shepherds are given to the people of God: "Behold, I will punish you for the evil of your doings, and I will raise up shepherds over them who will feed them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed," says the Lord.
In the prophet Ezekiel too, concerning such people - which we indeed recount with great anguish - who live off ecclesiastical stipends and are believed to lead the people into error with erroneous and incautious examples, as it is said they did, who burned with vain worship of images and associated the subordinate people with their error of profession, it is written: "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: You devour my sheep and clothe yourselves with their wool and slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed my sheep. You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered over all the mountains and on every high hill; they were scattered over the whole earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them."
Therefore, in this matter of the most vain profession, the wickedness of the judges is not as great as the perversity of the priests.
In the judges, there is found laziness, but in the priests, there is great madness, especially since the latter declare they will worship images and offer to them the service due to the Holy Trinity.
The former profess that 'the art of painters is pious' and should not be mocked, and that 'a pious painter is commended by the Father,' saying: 'The art of the painter is indeed pious, and those who criticize it foolishly are wrong; for even the Father himself commends a pious painter.'
In these professions of both parties, it is clearly shown that the priests have surpassed the judges in error as much as they surpass them in the honor of their higher rank.
The laity could not be equated with the prelates in absurd professions, just as they cannot be equal in the seat of the priestly chair.
But while in neither party is there found anything that can be rightly praised, in both parties something is seen that can be justly condemned.
They admitted that they would worship images and give them the service due only to God, and some of that has been refuted.
It remains, therefore, that the error of the judges, who assert that the art of painting is pious, should be refuted by our writing.
They say that the art of painting is pious, as if it does not share the same potential for piety or impiety as other worldly arts. What greater piety does the art of painters have over the arts of blacksmiths, sculptors, founders, engravers, stonemasons, carpenters, farmers, or other craftsmen?
All these arts, which can only be learned through practice, can be held either piously or impiously by those who practice them. Piety or impiety does not fall on the arts themselves but on the people who follow them, who are often either constrained by the most shameless disturbances of vice or adorned by the life-saving company of virtues.
So, if the art of painters is considered pious because it often depicts the actions and pious deeds of pious people, then it should also be considered impious because it often depicts many impieties, such as the slaughter of people, the atrocities of wars, the cruelties of criminals, the savagery of wild animals, the attacks of beasts, and other similar things.
And if it is not considered impious because these things are depicted for human eyes through outlines or other means, it will not be considered pious because it depicts the deeds of good people. Just as iron is not called impious because it kills people, nor is it called pious because instruments are made from it that protect people and aid doctors in healing, so too the art of painting is not impious because it depicts cruelty, nor pious because it depicts certain acts of kindness.
As for those who lament that it is wrongly criticized by some foolish people, no one in their right mind doubts that they are being irrational in this matter as in others. No person of sound mind criticizes images or the art of painting, but condemns the madness of those who worship them and give them inappropriate service.
Wine is not condemned because it causes drunkenness, as it is often offered in sacrifice to God. Forests are not condemned because they provide shelter to thieves, as they also provide many useful things for people. Fire is not condemned because it sometimes greedily devours houses and other human possessions, as it also supports human life in many ways.
Moreover, when they say, The Father Himself commends the pious painter, where and when the Father commends the painter is neither for them to prove nor for us to believe, as no divine oracle praises painters. Let them find any place in the divine Scriptures where painters are praised for creating images, and we will find a way to respond. For Almighty God often judges not the works but the devotion behind them, not the acts but the intentions, not the things themselves but the reasons for those things, not what one does but with what mind they do it.
Chapter 23: On John the Presbyter's false statement about painters and Scriptures
If all the nonsense of John the Presbyter and legate of the Easterners, which he presented in the same synod, in the disapproving readings of which our style revolves, were to be discussed by us individually and collected into one, the forest of such great disputation would be unworthy of great volumes. But we, partly in the interest of brevity, which we entirely pursue, and partly keeping the order of the reading itself, where not each individual separately, but some things here and there in order, as each one spoke or even as they are found in the same book, discussing them in our disputation and being compelled to narrow all things into a brief article of disputation and not separately, but almost all scattered, as order dictated, pursue.
Meanwhile, it is worthwhile to diligently discuss how, as the same one stated, painters are by no means believed to "contradict the Scriptures" or how "whatever the Scripture says, they demonstrate" or how they are "in agreement with the Scriptures." For although it is not clear from which scriptures he said this, it must be believed that he spoke of the holy Scriptures, which we customarily call Scriptures, as it is in the gospel: "Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures."
Meanwhile, the art of painting has grown for this reason: to bring the memory of things truly done to those looking and to promote minds from lies to recalling the truth. Conversely, sometimes it promotes senses to think of lies instead of the truth and not only those things that are or were or can be, but also those that neither are nor were nor can be, it brings to sight. A lie is either about things that are not but can be, or about things that neither are nor can be, about which in the "Perihermenias" the philosophers have a sharp or very subtle disputation, which to insert into this work would be very lengthy.
For while he says "painters do not contradict the Scriptures," and many things are painted by painters which the divine Scriptures are silent about and are proven to be false by people, not only by the learned but also by the unlearned, who would not admit his statement to be most ridiculous or rather most false? Are they not known to contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict the abyss as having the form of a man and pouring out floods of waters abundantly? Is it not undoubted that they contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict the earth in human form, sometimes dry and barren, sometimes abundant with fruits? Is it not evident that they contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict rivers in human forms or pouring water from buckets, or flowing into each other? Do they not contradict the holy Scriptures in every way when they depict the sun and moon and other ornaments of the sky as having human forms and heads surrounded by rays? Do they not contradict the Scriptures when they attribute individual forms to the twelve winds according to the quality of their strength, or to the individual months according to the quality of the times, giving some naked, some half-naked, some even clothed in various garments, or when they depict the four seasons of the year each in different forms, either flowering with flowers like spring, or burnt with heat or loaded with crops like summer, or burdened with wine presses or grapes like autumn, or sometimes cold with frost, sometimes warming itself with fires, sometimes providing food for animals, sometimes catching withered birds with excessive cold like winter, which are by no means contained in the divine Scriptures?
How then are the painters, who often follow the vain fables of poets, not contradicting the holy Scriptures in the least? For they sometimes depict things truly done into other and other incredible tales; they also depict things that neither were done nor could be done, but are either mystically understood by philosophers or vainly worshiped by pagans or truly by Catholics.
These things are rejected. Although they are found in the writings of the pagans, they are completely foreign to the Holy Scriptures.
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that the three-headed Chimera is said to have been killed by Bellerophon, when Bellerophon did not slay a beast, as they falsely claim, but rather made a mountain habitable, as most understand it?
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that Vulcan is depicted as lame and that Erichthonius is said to be the son of Earth and to forge iron on Mount Etna, with his furnace being Vesuvius, a mountain in Campania, which is said to burn with perpetual fires?
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that Scylla is depicted with dog heads around her and that Philomela is said to have been transformed into a tree because of her love for a young man, and another Scylla, because she cut off her father's purple hair, is depicted along with her father?
And that Itys, because of the incestuous act committed by his father with his aunt and the murder of his mother or aunt, is depicted as being transformed into birds along with his parents or aunt, or that the Sirens are depicted as part virgins and part birds, or that Ixion, deceived by Juno, is said to have mated with a cloud and fathered the Centaurs, or that Neptune, armed with a trident, is depicted as ruling the sea waves?
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that Perseus is said to have killed the three Gorgon sisters with the help of Minerva, or that he is depicted as flying with wings, or that Pegasus, a winged horse, is said to have been born from his blood, which is depicted as striking a fountain with its hoof for the Muses?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Prometheus is said to have fashioned humans from clay without life and that the same Prometheus, raised to heaven by Minerva among the hours of the sevenfold shield, after seeing all the celestial things, is depicted as having brought fire to humans by applying it to the wheels of Phoebus and giving life to the body he had fashioned by applying it to the chest of the man?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Tantalus is depicted as being placed in a certain lake in the underworld with deceitful water touching his lips and tempting him with fruit that turns to ashes upon contact, appearing to hang just above his face, and that he is seen as wealthy but becomes poor?
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that Phineus is depicted as blind and that his food is snatched by Harpies, who are said to defile his meals with their filth, and that Zetes and Calais, sons of the North Wind, are falsely depicted as driving them away from his sight?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Admetus, king of Greece, to enjoy the marriage with Alcestis, according to the plan of his father-in-law, is depicted as having yoked a lion and a boar to a chariot with the help of Apollo and Hercules, or that Hercules is depicted as having killed Cerberus, the three-headed dog of the underworld?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Actaeon, a certain hunter, for having seen Diana bathing, is depicted as being turned into a deer and devoured by his own dogs, not recognizing him?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Berecynthia is depicted as having loved the very handsome boy Attis and, inflamed by jealous madness, castrated him and made him a half-male?
Is it not contrary to the Holy Scriptures that Orpheus is depicted as having loved the nymph Eurydice and persuaded her with the sound of his lyre to be his wife, and that when she died after stepping on a snake while fleeing the pursuit of the shepherd Aristaeus, he descended to the underworld to retrieve her and received the law not to look back at her, but, turning back, lost her again?
Is it not foreign to the Holy Scriptures that Venus is depicted as having committed adultery with Mars, being caught by the Sun, betrayed by Vulcan, and bound together with Mars in adamantine chains?
These and similar things, which are tedious for us to recount and which are either sweet for the poets and philosophers of the pagans to sing about or mystical to explore, and familiar to painters to depict, are, as we have said before, completely foreign to the Holy Scriptures.
For example, if a painter depicts two heads on one body or one head on two bodies or the head of one animal on the body of another, or...
Body parts, like the Centaur with the whole body of a horse and the head of a human, and the Minotaur, half-bull and half-man, if they aim to paint, wouldn't they be said to contradict the Scriptures?
And what does it mean to say, 'Painters do not contradict the Scriptures'?
As if there couldn't be some things painted by artists that are believed to go against the holy writings.
In the holy writings, nothing is faulty, nothing is inappropriate, nothing impure, nothing false, unless perhaps it is something that the holy Scripture recalls some perverse individuals having said or done; in pictures, however, there are many false, many faulty, many inconsistent, many inappropriate, and to sum it up, almost everything, whether possible or impossible, is painted by learned artists.
By these documents, John the priest and envoy of the Easterners is also proven to have strayed in this part as in the others.
But what the same priest says, 'painters demonstrate whatever Scripture says,' how false and useless this is, the wise reader will note.
Can all the commands of the divine law, which were given by the Lord through Moses, like this one: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one, and other similar ones, in which there is nothing that can be painted, be demonstrated by painters?
Can all the words of the prophets, in which teachings, exhortations, reproofs, contemplations, threats, or other similar things are contained, in which it is often found: 'Thus says the Lord' or: 'The Lord has sworn' or similar things, which are written by authors rather than painted by painters, be demonstrated by painting according to its vanity?
Can the words of the Lord Himself and the apostles each be demonstrated by painters?
Therefore, painters can somewhat bring back to memory the stories of historical events, but things that are perceived only by the senses and expressed in words can be comprehended and demonstrated by authors and the accounts of others, not by painters.
And thus it is absurd to say: 'Painters do not contradict the Scriptures, but demonstrate whatever Scripture says.'
Furthermore, what he says: 'They are in agreement with the Scriptures,' how nonsensical and absurd this is can be proven by many indications.
For what agreement can they have with the holy Scriptures, since the Scriptures are truthful, while painters often fabricate falsehoods, and it is said of the Scriptures: The words of the Lord are pure words, while painters sometimes create impure and incestuous things, the Scripture always urges honest and wholesome things, while painters often depict dishonorable and shameful things, the Scripture always aims for human salvation, while painters often aim for vanity, the Scripture always encourages heavenly gifts, while painters frequently depict earthly and perishable things?
For just as much agreement as there is between that which always relies on truth and that which often follows truth and often falsehood, so there is an agreement between the divine Scriptures, which always hold pure and fixed rules, and painters, who, like mortals, have many changes.
Chapter 24: That images should not be equated with the relics of saints
Just as sacred things—whether consecrated by the lawgiver, by the Mediator between God and men, or by priests daily through the invocation of the divine name and taken into the mystery of our redemption—should not be equated with images, so too the relics of holy martyrs or confessors, which are venerated by the faithful out of love for them, should not be equated with images. Those who burn with zeal for the adoration of these things and strive to equate them with all sacred things and mysteries also insolently and absurdly strive to equate them with the relics of holy martyrs.
Therefore, when these people strive to honor images or sculptures or carvings or any other objects made by craftsmen, as if they were the bodies or certainly the relics of the bodies of saints, or the clothes or similar things that the saints used while living mortally, they are shown to inflict no small injury upon the saints. Especially since the clothes and similar things of the saints are venerated because they were either on the bodies of the saints or around their bodies and are believed to have received sanctification from them, for which they are venerated, as well as the bodies of the saints or even the relics of their bodies, because although now reduced to dust, they are destined to rise again with glory at the end of the world and to reign perpetually with Christ. Images, however, which they strive in vain to equate with the aforementioned things, cannot be equated with them because they are neither what the bodies of the saints are nor were they in or around their most sacred bodies, but are often made either beautifully or deformedly, sometimes even from impure things, according to the skill and tools of each craftsman.
Hence, it is clear that those who strive to equate these images with the relics of saints are not slightly mistaken. Therefore, venerating the bodies of saints and showing honor to their relics has not been without reason admitted by tradition.
For Abraham, the father of nations, a man full of faith, supreme in devotion, outstanding in obedience, and vigorous in the precepts of the Lord, is read to have buried his wife not in any place, but in a field bought with care, and he is read to have been buried by his sons, according to his command, not in any place but in a very beautiful cave, in the inner part of which the first man was buried.
Isaac, too, born from an aged womb and brought to be offered as a sacrifice to God in the figure of our Redeemer, a man renowned for his holiness and chastity, is believed to have been buried by his sons next to his father according to his own command.
Jacob, a man of great patience, strengthened by divine oracles and encouraged by frequent promises, when he desired to avoid famine and see his beloved son, whom he thought dead, with his offspring, descended into the Egyptian regions. He did not allow his body to be buried there but ordered that his body be carried to the land promised to him and his fathers to be buried next to the bones of his father and grandfather. Because he was the fourth to be buried in the same cave, in the inner part of which Adam was buried, he named the place Arba, which means four.
Joseph, who deserved to be called the savior of the world by the gentiles in a typical mystery and shone with wonderful holiness among his brothers, commanded his sons to carry his bones to the promised land; the lawgiver did not delay in doing this because he recognized that it was by no means against the faith.
Therefore, the body of the holy man who had come from Judah to rebuke the wickedness of the king of Israel in Bethel, when he was killed by a lion because he ate the forbidden food of the city, is read to have been guarded by the same lion. However, the fault of disobedience...
With the cruelty lifted, the wild beast did not dare to touch the holy body of the prophet, whom it had cruelly presumed to kill. The prophet from Bethel, knowing that holy bones should be revered, would never have commanded himself to be buried next to the bones of the holy man, saying:
Bury me next to the bones of the prophet.
The holy man Josiah, named before he was born, destroyer of idols, and diligent observer of his fathers' laws, commanded that the bones of the two prophets be kept untouched when he burned the bones of many people to defile the profane altar, knowing that holy bones should be revered.
Behold, from these examples, not to mention others, it is shown that the ashes of the saints should be venerated!
Let them say where we are ever commanded to worship images.
Therefore, to give honor to the bodies of the saints is a great gain of faith, especially since it is believed that they live with Christ in the heavenly seats and that their bones will one day rise again.
To give the worship due only to God to images, which are never believed to have lived or to rise again but are destined to be consumed by fire or decay, is either laziness if done carelessly or madness and rather infidelity if stubbornly defended.
Therefore, we neither deny the relics with Vigilantius and his followers nor worship images with Simon and his accomplices.
We give proper respect to relics and the bodies of the saints and decorate the basilicas with images of saints, as well as gold and silver as we see fit, and with God's help, we render the service of worship and reverence due only to Him, to whom alone it is owed.
Chapter 25: That images should not be worshiped merely because of alleged miracles associated with them
It is also common for them to claim that some miracles were performed through certain images, yet neither the Old nor the New Testament supports this. Even if such things were proven to have been seen or heard, we must be cautious. Perhaps they were seen or heard in the twisted paths of the serpent, who, though he is atrocious and shrouded in the darkness of evil, transforms himself into an angel of light and dares to call himself light.
Indeed, many signs and miracles are performed by fallen angels or their followers, who, being spiritual powers and, so to speak, spiritual evil, impart prophecies to the unfortunate and perform many wonders through their minions. Among these will be those who say: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name, and do many wonders in your name?" To whom the internal judge will say: "I do not know you."
As signs often occur by diabolic influence, the blessed Gregory, bishop of the holy Roman Church, said: "Do not, my brothers, love signs that can be common with the reprobate." The most holy Augustine also testified that demons perform miracles similar to those done by the holy servants of God. He said: "One should not be moved, for magical arts often produce miracles similar to those performed by the holy servants of God." As it is written in Exodus, Pharaoh's magicians did some things similarly to what Moses did. Therefore, these should not be marveled at, because all visible things can also be believed to be done by the lower powers of this air. But the difference is that when saints perform such things, it is commanded in the name of God, the Lord of all things, to the lower creatures from higher powers. When evil men work through magical arts, similar things are given into their hands when they are answered by demons. They are worthy of such deception, so that what seems to be a benefit becomes a punishment for them, as lower powers privately show them certain miracles, to have them subdued, yet this is allowed by divine permission, as each soul is awarded according to its merits.
Therefore, the signs and miracles they claim appeared in images, if they did not occur—as no authentic history records this—are lies, and those who serve the truth should not use lies, because, as Truth itself says, no one can serve two masters. If they appeared and were shown through some fantastic illusions to deceive minds, it is extremely dangerous, lest the ancient enemy, through his cunning, fraudulently persuades to commit unlawful acts while showing some wonders. If the signs truly appeared, which no certain writings prove, and their claim does not fall under the sentence of lying nor the fraudulent machinations of the enemy according to the above examples, but are proven to be done by God's operation, to whom all things are possible and nothing is impossible, it must be highly noted that although many amazing things have been done by God's will through certain creatures or in certain creatures, not all things through which or in which these were done are to be worshiped. Indeed, God showed many signs to mortals through some visible and tangible things to soften the hardness of visible and mortal men through visible things, not to establish the worship of certain things, as He alone commands to be worshiped and honored.
Should the bush be worshiped because the Lord spoke to Moses from the burning bush? No, He appeared in the bush not to designate the material of the bush for worship, but to demonstrate through its thorns the sins for which the law came.
Because the bush does not have a root armed with thorns, when it becomes dense with thorns at the top, it clearly shows that sins are not from nature. The bush was not burned by fire to indicate that sins are not to be destroyed by the law but only revealed. The law only shows sins, but grace, which is given through Christ, heals the sins that the law had shown.
Since the Lord appeared in the fire, it does not mean that fire should be worshipped, but He wanted to appear in that nature which always strives to ascend to higher places. Because He chose to appear on the mountain, it is not believed that He established the worship of mountains, but it was reasonable that the King of Heaven appeared in that place which always desires high places, and not in a low but in a high place, to show that He is the Most High and to clearly indicate that His followers will ascend to high places.
Is it because the lawgiver escaped the wrath of the terrible judge and the destruction of death by circumcision with a very sharp stone that stones must be worshipped? The lawgiver rightly saw an angel so hostile to him because, living in the land of Midian, he neglected to circumcise his son, and the messenger of the God of Abraham did not bear the sign of the faith of Abraham in his son, in which he knew the Jews boasted. He is not circumcised with a stone so that the worship of stones is established by this act, but to show that through Christ, who is the cornerstone, sins must be cut off, and the dangers of death must be avoided.
Is it because the staff was turned into a serpent so many times and then returned to the firmness of a staff, symbolizing Christ going from life to death and back to life, or because the same staff, which we said carried the figure of Christ, divided the waters of the Red Sea, representing baptism, and provided a path to the promised land, that is, the heavenly kingdom, for the people of God, that staffs must be worshipped?
Is it because the bitter waters were made sweet by a piece of wood, which rightly symbolizes the law being sweetened by the wood of Christ and the spiritual sweetness satisfying the minds of the people, that wood must be worshipped? Is it because the sight of the bronze serpent, which prefigured the death of Christ on the wood, saved the people from the bites of serpents, that is, from the deadly persuasions of unclean spirits, that bronze or serpents must be worshipped?
Is it because the struck rock produced streams of water in the scorched fields and freed the thirsty people from their drought, which undoubtedly bore the figure of Christ, who is the rock cut from the mountain without hands, who quenches the thirst of unbelief from the minds of the faithful with the streams of gospel preaching, who daily calls out: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink," that stones or waters are believed to be worshipped?
Is it because Aaron's staff, which symbolizes the birth of the Blessed Virgin, flourished and produced almonds, without human intervention, following the natural law, that staffs must be worshipped?
Is it because the dry fleece became wet and the wet fleece became dry at the request of the holy Gideon, by which miracle it is clear that the entire world of the Gentiles was signified by the heavenly dew, and only the fleece of the Israelite race was wet with the divine word, and later, due to the guilt of their unbelief, the same people were signified as dry by their infidelity, and the world of the Gentiles soaked with the dew of holy faith, that either the area or fleeces must be worshipped?
Is it because Samson slew a thousand men with the jawbone of a donkey and, after removing a molar from the same jawbone, was satisfied with streams of water, carrying the symbol of our Mediator, who, by His death, conquered the powers of the air and watered the dry hearts of the faithful, who are indeed His members, with spiritual streams, that jawbones or molars must be worshipped?
Is it because Elijah, with his cloak, which symbolized the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, with which he crossed the Jordan, representing baptism, is said to have divided the Jordan, that cloaks must be worshipped?
Is it because Naaman the Syrian was cleansed of leprosy in the river, representing the Gentiles being cleansed from the contamination of idols by the baptism of Christ, that rivers must be worshipped?
What about the fact that the coming of the Holy Spirit to the holy man Elisha was delayed until a musician was brought to him?
When the musician was brought, the Holy Spirit poured himself into Elisha's heart.
This symbolizes the Jewish people, who do not receive the coming of the Holy Spirit because they do not accept the incarnation of the Redeemer in faith.
But as soon as they realize this towards the end of the world, they will be adorned with the breath of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of all the charisms.
Does this mean the musician should be worshipped?
Is it because the edge of the Lord's garment, which healed the woman upon touch and represents faith in the Lord's incarnation, through which the Gentiles were healed, should be worshipped?
Or because the sick were healed by Peter's shadow, should the shadow be worshipped?
Therefore, as we mentioned before, not all things through which or in which miracles were shown by God's order are believed to be worshipped.
If these things, in which miracles appeared, are not to be worshipped, then much less should images be believed to be worshipped, especially since no authentic scripture shows that miracles appeared through or in them.
Chapter 26: On Theodorus, Bishop of Miri's, recounting of his archdeacon's dreams to defend image worship
While in that same book of vanity, which they fervently consider under the title of the Seventh Council, almost everything seems to be similar to the imaginations of dreams and certain fanciful shadows. There is almost nothing there that does not either reflect the emptiness of dreams or the dullness of some other delirium. Everything tasted by the inner palate returns a flavor that is bland and insipid. Theodorus, bishop of Miri, is read to have particularly recounted the dreams of his archdeacon there, in order to support an error which he could not uphold by the authority of the Holy Scriptures or by any teachings or examples of the holy fathers. At least he managed to support it with the delusions of dreams, and not unjustly showing a support worthy and almost equal to such a frivolous and senseless matter to be established.
Although the use of dreams ought neither to be entirely approved, because they are often exhibited by the deceptions of demons, nor entirely disapproved, because sometimes certain mysteries are revealed through them, they are never found suitable for establishing doubtful matters and affirming those things that come into contention. For who can ever affirm a doubtful matter by his own dream, since whether he saw it in the way he claims to have seen it, he can prove by no witness's testimony? Therefore, for confirming a doubtful matter and one that comes into question, neither the deceptive vanity of dreams, nor the most impudent prolixity of apocryphal writings, nor the falsehood of trivial and useless words are to be sought, but the authentic authority of the divine books or the catholic fathers.
For just as useful things and those adorned with the secrets of mysteries, when indicated by dreams, are revealed by angels, so conversely, when harmful things and those lacking any usefulness are demonstrated by dreams, they are believed to be shown by demons. Hence, if the dream which he recounted at the council was shown by an angel to his archdeacon to support the worship of images, it is beneficial to worship images; and if it is beneficial to worship images, it is beneficial to worship other things devoid of sense. But it is harmful to worship things devoid of sense. Therefore, the dream which his archdeacon recounted to support the worship of images was not shown by an angel.
It is clearly and plainly evident that since it was not shown by an angel, it was introduced by the instigating spirit, who always urges vanities and harmful matters. To make this clearer, it must be confirmed by reasonable argument. Since, if the instigating spirit did not introduce it to him, the angel must undoubtedly be believed to have introduced it; and if the angel must be believed to have introduced it, the angels would be showing consent to prohibited matters. But angels do not show consent to prohibited or harmful matters or those opposed to divine instructions. Thus, the instigating spirit must be believed to have introduced it to him.
Therefore, since it has been proven that it was not exhibited to him by a holy angel, because spirits continuously remaining in the praise of their Creator and completely free from sin utterly reject impure matters and those prone to sins, it remains that either he confesses that it was exhibited to him by the deception of a most wicked spirit or he testifies that he was entirely lying, which is not fitting for servants of God. For every Catholic must resist unclean spirits, as the apostle says: James 4:7, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"; and lying must be spurned, as Scripture says: Proverbs 13:5, "Do not tell lies, for all lying is not good." Meanwhile, according to the apostle's judgment, spirits must be tested whether they are from God, and according to the voice of Truth they are known by their fruits. Hence, from its fruit, by which it aims to support the worship of images, it is most evidently perceived that the spirit who introduced it is not from God.
But lest we seem to declare this solely by our own arguments, let us turn to the divine Scriptures! Let us ask the lawgiver! Let him say whether dreams are to be accepted at all? Let him say how we ought to deal with dreamers! Say, I pray, holy Moses, say most gentle of men, say!
A noble man and diligent "inspector of the secrets of God, speak, you most kind and faithful interpreter of the ineffable God, who, receiving the law on the mountain, brought down a face glorified, intolerable to the sinful people.
Just as the law you carried was opposed to sin, so too your face was terrifying to those who saw it. Speak, noble man, who, bearing the type of the true Redeemer, stood as a mediator between God and men!
Give a command: are all dreams to be believed? Tell us, should any illusions be given consent?
If a prophet or a dreamer arises among you, who says he has seen a dream and predicts some sign or portent, and it comes to pass, and he says to you: Come, let us follow other gods whom you do not know, you shall not heed the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart or not.
Behold, by the authority of the lawgiver, we are taught that the words of dreamers, although they may come true, should not be heeded. Let Wisdom now say what it thinks about dreams! For it says: Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities and countless words. But fear God. For it is believed that dreams disturbed the Egyptians, as Scripture says: For the dreams that troubled them showed this, that they might not be ignorant of why they suffered evils. It is clear from the authorities of divine law that dreams and auguries are vain, and the more one fears them, the more his heart is deceived.
Therefore, we thought it should be condemned in every way that the aforementioned bishop, who should have fought against dreamers and other nonsense with the arms of divine law, brought up the dreams of his archdeacon to the synod to support something useless. These should be considered of little importance not only in the oracles of divine law but also in the writings of the pagans. For the philosopher Cato says: Do not care for dreams, for the human mind wishes for these things. When you are awake, you hope; in a dream, you see the same thing.
For if anyone should perhaps be angry with us for inserting the words of pagans into our work, let him first read the books of the most blessed and learned men, Jerome and Augustine, and soon he will find that not only the words of philosophers but also of pagan poets are found in their works. He will recognize that we have them as our teachers and authors, whose footsteps we follow, with whom we neither refuse to be blamed nor are ashamed to be reproached. For, to go further back, even the chosen vessel inserted some words of the pagans into his works, as in: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
Furthermore, when we discuss the observations or rather the vanities of dreams, we do not testify that their use should be entirely rejected, since certain sacred mysteries were shown to the patriarchs and prophets in dreams or rather in visions.
The three wise men were warned in a dream not to return to the violent tyrant, so they took another path and returned to their own country. And it is read that an angel appeared to the holy man Joseph in a dream and showed him the secrets of mysteries that had been announced by prophets many ages before.
Therefore, lest anyone presumptuously seeks the use of dreams, follows, believes, or recites them in assemblies or, like Theodore, affirms things that come into contention, it is, as we mentioned a little earlier, forbidden by the holy Scriptures. We also read that certain secrets were shown to infidels and profane kings in dreams, which were not revealed to them by any prerogatives of their own merits, but so that holy men, who showed them these things by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, might be exalted in honor and be able to benefit their fellow captives.
Although therefore visions and dreams are customarily spoken of together, certain people say there is a difference between visions and dreams: dreams are often false - they sometimes come from revelation, but many times from thoughts, temptations, or similar things; visions, on the other hand, are said to be...
There are more truthful revelations, of which there are three kinds: bodily, spiritual, and intellectual.
Bodily revelation happens through the body. Spiritual revelation occurs when we store images of what we see in our memory. Intellectual revelation is when we discern through our intellect what we see physically and store in our memory as images. With our intellect, we discern that one thing is a body and another is a likeness of a body.
Animals, livestock, and birds do not have this intellect at all. They see through their bodies, and their spirits are informed by the images of what they see. Thus, livestock recognize their feeding troughs, and birds return to their nests. But they neither understand themselves nor what they see with their eyes.
Finally, this bodily vision cannot exist without the spiritual one. Therefore, when we turn our eyes away from what we have seen, we retain the images of what we do not see in our memory. Spiritual vision, however, cannot exist without bodily vision. Hence, we remember absent people and see in our minds what we do not see in the dark.
Intellectual vision, on the other hand, does not need either bodily or spiritual vision. Through intellect, we do not see a body or an image of a body. Through it, we see justice, love, God Himself, and the mind of a human, which has no body and no solidity of a body.
Since there are so many different kinds of dreams and visions coming from various sources, we must carefully consider that when someone recognizes they have seen something in a dream, they should not immediately hold it firmly and present it in council as an authoritative source for deliberating on uncertain matters. Otherwise, while trying to support vanity with vanities, they might, heaven forbid, fall into vanity themselves.
Chapter 27: That they wrongly apply God's words about worship to the veneration of images
If they mean the temple of God, which is often abusively referred to as the place of God, they are gravely mistaken.
For sacrifices are offered in the temple of the Lord, not in images; the solemnities of the Mass are celebrated in the temple, not in paintings; the people standing in the temple and offering their prayers to God are heard, not in painted panels.
The Lord is in His holy temple, says David, not in His holy image; His throne is in heaven, not in pictures.
Nor does he say: His eyes look upon the proud or those who seek vain praise, but they look upon the poor, upon the poor indeed, about whom the Truth itself says: "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
And again: In His temple, says the same most holy prophet, not in images, everyone will speak of glory.
And again: Worship the Lord, not in paintings, but in His holy court.
For as much as the temple, which can hold many people, differs from the image, which, apart from the memory of the vision it brings to those who look at it, is suitable for no other purpose, so much does the veneration or adoration of images differ from the veneration given to the temple of God, as many indications show.
If they call the soul of a righteous person the place of God, which more familiarly can be called the place of God, since the Lord inhabits and sanctifies it by inhabiting, in this too they are gravely mistaken.
For God gave the law for the salvation of souls, not for the salvation of images; the Redeemer of the world descended to earth to free souls, not images; for humans, who are often figuratively referred to as souls, not for images, which are formed by artisans, He said to the Father: "Those whom You have given me, I want them to be with me where I am, so that they may see my glory, which You have given me, because You loved me."
Therefore, since God first gave men the natural law, which they corrupted, and later gave the written law, which they also violated, He then showed Himself to be seen in bodily presence, and it is believed that He always cared for human salvation before the law, under the law, and under grace, it is never believed that He gave any such attention to images.
Therefore, the veneration that is due to people out of charity cannot be equated with the veneration of images.
This indeed about the place of God or the temple, which is abusively so called, or about the soul of a righteous person, which is more fittingly called the place of God, with which images in no way should be equated according to their madness, should suffice to be briefly said.
On the other hand, discussing the place of God, who is non-local, who is not contained by a place, who contains everything and is not a place, to whom nothing of those six parts of a place applies, to whom nothing is before or after, to the right or left, above or below, requires more subtle understanding.
Although, therefore, the order of those ten categories, which are dealt with by philosophers, seems to be ascribed to Him, so that according to His essence, which is ineffable, it is said: The Lord God, God is one, God is strong, God is mighty; according to His magnitude, which is immense: great is the Lord and greatly to be praised; according to His quality, which is indescribable, it is said: the good Creator of all; according to His relation, it is said: the Lord, the Father of all who believe in Him; according to His position: who sits above the cherubim; according to His time: and Your years will not fail; according to His place: the Lord has prepared His throne in heaven; according to His habit: the abyss is like a garment to Him; according to His action: He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; according to His passion: you made me labor with your sins - nevertheless, all these and similar things are shown to be humanly said about God, about whom nothing can be worthily said by mortals.
For He is a substance easy for no one to investigate, and therefore ineffable, because He is not investigable by anyone.
He is great without magnitude, good without quality, the Lord of all without relation, and similar things, which seek the matter of more abundant discussion.
To say something about the place of God, the words of Saint Augustine must be cited, who stated that God is non-local through the complexity of a single five-part syllogism.
He proved it. For he said: God is not in any place. For that which is in a place is contained by location; that which is contained by location is a body. But God is not a body. Therefore, He is not in any place.
Later, in another syllogism, he proved that He is not in a place, and that everything is in Him. For he said: And yet, because He exists and is not in a place, everything is rather in Him than He is in any place, and yet not in such a way that He is the place. For a place is in space, which is occupied by the length, width, and height of a body. Nor is God such a thing, and therefore everything is in Him, and He is not a place.
Later, in a very fitting little clause, he asserted that the place of God is abusively called the temple of God, but that the soul of a human can be better called the place: However, the place of God, he said, is abusively called the temple of God, not because He is contained there, but because He is present there; but nothing is better understood to be this than a pure soul.
Therefore, when they say that they venerate images as the place of God, whether they mean as the temple of God, or as the soul of a just person, neither is appropriate. But if, in that word, they understand something local about God, their sense is very much at odds with the truth.
Therefore, as we are unaware of their thoughts and do not know with what feeling or sense they said this, we only examine those things which we have perceived from the writing.
Chapter 28: On the erroneous statement equating fearing God with venerating images
This is also an extremely insane and completely unguarded statement when they say: "Anyone who fears God absolutely honors, worships, or venerates the Son of God, the sign of His cross, and the image of His saints."
How different is the mystery of the Lord’s cross, which the Apostle teaches us to understand with revealed eyes to comprehend the height, length, breadth, and depth of Christ's cross. This has been shown in the earlier parts of this work with the Lord's help. And how different is the worship and devotion due only to God from the worship and devotion they claim should be shown to images. In this third book, we have discussed this while examining the words of Constantine, Bishop of Constantinople, and Euthymius, Bishop of Sardis, as the Lord has granted us assistance. Now, with the Lord's help, let us briefly discuss how the fear of the Lord differs from the worship of images.
They say: "Anyone who fears God completely worships images as the Son of God." But do all the patriarchs and prophets, because they rejected the worship of images, therefore are believed not to have feared God? Or should we say that the Apostles, because they are never recorded as having celebrated the worship of images, did not have the fear of God? Or the holy martyrs, hermits, or the entire multitude of ecclesiastical men, who are known to have served God most devotedly, are believed not to have had the fear of the Lord because they are never recorded as having celebrated or proved the worship of images?
The most holy prophet David did not say he would teach the worship of images but the fear of God when he called all believers to come to him with gentle exhortations, saying: "Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord." He did not testify to the worship of images but to the holy fear of the Lord, saying: "The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever." He did not call blessed anyone who worships images but the one who fears God, saying: "Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in His commandments." And again: "Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in His ways." He did not say absurdly, as those people do, "Anyone who fears the Lord worships images," but he said: "Anyone who fears the Lord greatly delights in His commandments."
Hence, it is very clear that the fear of the Lord is not in the worship of images but in the will and earnestness of God's commandments. The holy man did not testify that the eyes of the Lord are upon those who worship images, but upon those who fear Him, saying: "Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy." Nor did he say: "Worship images, for nothing is lacking for those who worship them," but he said: "Fear the Lord, you His saints, for there is nothing lacking for those who fear Him." Neither did he testify that the beginning of wisdom is the worship of images, but the fear of the Lord, saying: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." This commandment of the fear of the Lord is thus instituted through Moses: "Follow the Lord your God, fear Him, keep His commandments, listen to His voice, and serve Him." Among these salutary precepts, the worship of images is nowhere instituted. Since the worship of images is found to be forbidden in divine scriptures, it is in no way comparable to the fear of the Lord, which is commended by so many divine law oracles.
Therefore, the flowers by which the fear of the Lord is commanded, which we have diligently gathered from the vast fields of divine law, are set out in order, so that we may briefly arrange them, both to soothe the reader's mind and to compel anyone trying to equate the worship of senseless things with the fear of the Lord to be filled with shame and reverence. For it is said in Proverbs: "The fear of the Lord adds days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened." Also in Proverbs: "The fear of the Lord is a strong tower; the destruction is for those who do evil." Also in Proverbs: "The fear of the Lord leads to life; those who lack it will remain without it."
He will go to a place that knowledge does not visit.
Also in Proverbs: The fear of the Lord is the discipline of wisdom, and humility precedes glory.
Also in Proverbs: Do not let your heart envy sinners, but be in the fear of the Lord all day long.
Also in Proverbs: Blessed is the one who fears everything through fear, for the one who is hard-hearted will fall into trouble.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and it is formed in the womb with the faithful, created with the chosen seeds, and recognized with the just and the wise.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: The fear of the Lord recognizes knowledge, chastity will guard holiness, and the heart will be justified, giving joy and happiness.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: It will be well for the one who fears the Lord, and in the days of his fulfillment, he will be blessed. The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and its fullness is from its fruits; it filled all his house from generations, and its storehouses from his treasures. The crown of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and both are the gifts of God.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: The fear of the Lord expels sin, for the one who is without fear cannot be justified.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: Do not be unbelieving in the fear of the Lord and do not approach him with a double heart.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: Those who fear the Lord will not be unbelieving in His word, and those who love Him will keep His way; those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts and will sanctify their souls in His sight; those who fear the Lord will keep His commandments and will have patience until His inspection. The fear of the Lord does not despise a just poor man and does not exalt a sinful rich man.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: All wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and in that, to fear God.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: There is no decrease in the fear of the Lord. The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing.
Also in Ecclesiasticus: If you do not hold the fear of the Lord firmly, your house will soon be contested.
Also in Ecclesiastes: The end of the matter, all has been heard. Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man; for God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
Also in Proverbs: The fear of the Lord hates evil, also arrogance and pride and the ways of the wicked.
This fear, therefore, which these testimonies indicate is not the adoration of images, but the increase of good works, should be held by the faithful.
There is also another fear, about which it is said: Perfect love casts out fear, because this fear drives a person to all exercises of good works, but the other, which love casts out, neither tolerates vigils or fasts nor suffers venerable martyrdoms for the name of Christ.
Just as there are two types of temptations, one by which one is deceived - hence it is said: God tempts no one, but He Himself is not tempted by evil - another by which one is tested by divine examination - hence it is said: The Lord your God tests you, or: God tested Abraham, in the same way, many things are found in the Holy Scriptures by diligent investigation - so indeed there are two fears, one which love casts out, and another, which is the beginning of good works, which love nourishes.
For if the beginning of the fear of the Lord is to worship images, as they babble, it follows that all the saints, who are believed to have feared God, worshiped images, and if all the saints, who are truly believed to have feared God, worshiped images, it follows that they acted contrary to the commands of the Creator, who forbade the worship of creatures and established that He alone should be worshiped.
However, they are not to be believed to have acted contrary to the commands of the Creator by worshiping creatures. Therefore, the beginning of the fear of the Lord, as they babble, is not to worship images. By this proof, it is shown that the beginning of the fear of the Lord is not in the worship of senseless things but in the observance of the Lord's commandments.
For he truly fears God, who, despising all vanities, shows by faith and works that he will serve Him alone.
Chapter 29: On John the Eastern priest's irrational comparison of honoring the emperor's image to venerating Christ's image
Regarding what is generally said or agreed upon by all, that the image of the Savior or any of the saints should be venerated in the same way as the imperial images sent to cities, which are met by crowds with candles and incense, it has already been discussed.
It has been approved by the words of the blessed Jerome that the images of judges and emperors, from which they try to take examples, should not be venerated.
Now, however, the specific words of John must be discussed, as he is found to have spoken more frequently and more foolishly than others in this matter.
Although he follows the general error of all, he tries to add something special to this error.
I believe he has tried to associate his own nonsense with general nonsense because he thought the vanities of everyone else were insufficient to accumulate to such a great error.
As if God were local like the emperor, and while He is in one place, He cannot be in another.
Therefore, he tries to establish that God's image should be venerated like the emperor's image, which is completely against all reason.
For God is never absent.
If He is absent anywhere, He is local.
If He is local, He neither contains nor fills all things.
But He both contains and fills all things.
Therefore, He is never absent.
Since this is the case, He should not be venerated or sought in material images, but always kept in the purest heart.
For while it is perverse to venerate the image of the emperor, it is profane to liken the image of the emperor, who is local, to the image of God, who is not local.
It is undoubtedly profane and perverse for someone to try to corroborate an illicit thing by another illicit thing, and by the steps of errors, as if by certain gradations, while having neither the moderation of mind nor tongue, alas! he weakly runs to worse things.
As for his statement: "Christ's image should be honored like the emperor's image, as the Father thought," it should be questioned where, when, why, or how the Father thought this, or what he meant by "thought."
Was it when it was ordered by someone else or done by others that the Father thought so?
Therefore, since we do not discuss their errors in words, which would be immense and difficult to accomplish, especially since almost none of the words there provide meaning to the reader, but only criticize their sense or judgments, it remains that we should not consider what they say—especially since, as said, it has almost no sense—but what they mean to say.
His statement: "the image of Christ should be honored as the Father thought of the emperor," he means to say that the Father ordered the image of Christ to be venerated just like the emperor.
But where, when, why, or how this happened is completely unknown to any Catholic.
For the Father did not order to honor His image, but to honor and listen to Him when the Holy Trinity, in the unity of substance, appeared at the waters of Jordan: the Father in the voice, which thundered, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, listen to Him," the Son in the body, and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.
Even if the Father ordered the image of Christ to be honored like the emperor, would it not be more appropriate to decide that the emperor should be honored like the image of Christ, so that the image of Christ holds a more eminent place in such a matter?
Therefore, the Father is not read to have ordered anywhere to depict, venerate, or honor the image of Christ, as He has instituted that He alone should be worshiped and served.
Since emperors and kings are to be honored by their subjects, this can be approved by some examples from the Divine Scripture.
For if they were not to be honored, the holy man David would not have called Saul, after God had departed from him, "the anointed one.”
"Lord," he was called.
For the aforementioned man was not unaware that divine dispensation is involved in the office of royal order; therefore, he honored Saul, who was still in the same position of dignity, lest he be seen as doing injury to God, who decreed that honor is to be given to these orders.
As long as he is in that dignity, he is to be honored, if not for his own sake, then for the sake of the "order." Hence, the Apostle also says: Be subject to all higher powers. For there is no power except from God; and in another place: Fear God, honor the king.
Indeed, a more extensive discussion could arise from this reasoning, but because some of it has already been discussed in the earlier parts of this work, we must now move on to other matters, leaving these aside.
Chapter 30: That they inserted apocryphal and laughable tales into their speeches
If someone builds a wooden house and wants to decorate the walls with marble panels or various colored glass fragments, but sees that by nature these materials cannot adhere to the wood, they will abandon these materials and try again with wood to complete the house.
Similarly, if someone wants to make a tin vessel but lacks the necessary material, they will not seek other precious metals that cannot adhere to tin, but will look for more tin to complete the intended work.
In the same way, those in their council, when they tried to expand their instrument of error—namely, the writing composed for the worshipping of images—realized that the divine Scriptures could not adhere to it, so they turned to certain apocryphal and laughable tales.
And when they saw that the testimonies of divine law, applied inappropriately to the same work, could not adhere, they tailored sentences that could not differ in sense or words.
Just as a precious emerald set in an iron ring or a gold-threaded garment sewn with a haircloth cover does not fit, so the testimonies of divine words do not fit the work they applied them to.
Therefore, a matter that is doubtful and contentious should not be supported by apocryphal tales but by the oracles of divine law or the salutary warnings and very clear teachings of those doctors who are accepted by the Catholic and Apostolic Church.
But perhaps some very scrupulous defender of this error might say: They did not insert the sentences of apocryphal books into their work to confirm the matter at hand, but to mock the madness of certain heretics.
To this, our style can easily provide a response.
When they say that someone, which no authentic reading narrates, restrained a certain person from a crime with an image of Polemon, are they mocking anyone?
Therefore, in the same reading, there are certain things that they placed to affirm the matter at hand, and also many things which, although placed mockingly, are so convoluted, so disorderly, so monstrously delivered, so mixed up, that it is almost impossible to understand whether the words spoken are those of mockers or those who believe in what is being said.
This matter, although understood as said by learned people, is said to generate scandal among some unlearned people; and rightly so, because it is covered by such ignorance that it can hardly be understood.
Chapter 31: On the nonsensical story of a recluse's oath and his abbot's foolish statement about image worship
Often in this work we are compelled to say that examples should not be taken from harmful matters.
We repeat this so often because we have found that they frequently did this to affirm their error.
Just as proper examples provide support for good deeds in an appropriate order, so too do they seek support from erroneous deeds for their erroneous actions.
To establish the proposed error, they bring forth the example of a certain recluse, who, if he acted as they assert, is known to have committed a threefold fault in this matter: whether because he willingly obeyed a demonic suggestion, or because he bound himself with an oath at its instigation, or even because he nullified that oath.
These three are not only not to be drawn as examples, but also to be utterly rejected by every Catholic, as they are prohibited by many testimonies of divine law.
Associations and seductions, not only of demons but also of wicked men, are prohibited by numerous precepts of divine oracles.
For it is written in Exodus: "You shall not bear false witness"; and in Proverbs: "My son, do not let wicked men lead you astray."
If therefore the seductions of wicked men are to be avoided, much more are the suggestions and agreements of evil spirits to be avoided, because, being enemies of humanity and always hostile to us, we should always be suspicious of their deception and vigilant against their wickedness, knowing that they are of a more subtle nature and wit.
Also, in swearing to a demon, he contradicts the divine words which prohibit oaths.
For it is written in Sirach: "Do not accustom your mouth to swearing, for many falls are due to it."
Just as a servant continually interrogated will not be without bruises, so anyone who swears and names frequently will not be clean from sin.
A man who swears much will be filled with iniquity, and plague shall not depart from his house."
Moreover, Truth itself says in the Gospel: "But I say to you, do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King, nor shall you swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black."
Let your speech be 'Yes, yes,' 'No, no'; anything more than this is from the evil one."
Furthermore, it is absurdly said that he perjured himself to a demon.
For the Lord says through Moses: "You shall not swear falsely by my name, and so profane the name of your God; I am the Lord."
And in the prophet Zechariah it is written: "Do not love a false oath, for all these things I hate, says the Lord Almighty."
Therefore, since the same recluse committed these three things contrary to divine words, his abbot showed no correction in him but pointed out to him a worse path of sin, saying: "It is more convenient for you to enter any brothel in the city than to deny the worship of the image of the Lord or His holy mother."
Oh incomparable absurdity! Oh destructive evil! Oh madness to be preferred over many other insanities!
He says it is more convenient to do what is prohibited by both law and gospel than to abstain from something that is neither instituted by law nor gospel.
He says it is more convenient to commit a crime than to abstain from a crime.
He says it is more convenient to plunge oneself voluntarily into the depths of mud than to hold the path of the right road with an unoffending foot.
He says it is more convenient to violate the temple of God than to spurn the worship of insensate things.
He says it is more convenient to take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute than to disdain the worship of any work of an artisan.
Let him say, if he can find it anywhere, that the Lord said, "Do not deny the worship of the image," just as it is most evident that He said, "You shall not commit adultery."
Let him say, if he can find it anywhere, that the Lord said, "If you see an image and do not..."
When you worship it, you sin, as he clearly said: "If you look at a woman to lust after her, you have already committed adultery with her in your heart."
When this is not recognized, one strongly feels they have made a mistake, having committed such a shameful act to avoid something fruitless. For while the Lord commands through the law to gird your loins above your breasts, meaning to cut off lust in the heart, and through the gospel to gird your loins and keep your lamps, meaning to associate good works with chastity, and while chastity commandments are given in the books of divine speech, nowhere is it found that the worship of images is commanded.
Hence, while his abbot, who ought to have guided him to salvation, loosened the reins of sin, and who should have pulled him back from the snare of error with which he had sworn to the demon, he also fell with him into the abyss of error, saying that the gravest crime was more convenient to commit. He undoubtedly fulfilled that gospel saying: "If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit." Whoever wishes to support their assertion with such an example demonstrates not only their considerable madness but also shows it to be stronger than others'.
Therefore, since the persistence of their absurdity and the continuity of their nonsense or even the accumulation of their delusions do not rest in the intervals of their volume, which we examine for errors, let at least the interval of these books, which is between the end of one and the beginning of another, rest. Thus, as their error is examined by constant discussion, so the continuity of those errors may also be somewhat separated by the interval of books.
