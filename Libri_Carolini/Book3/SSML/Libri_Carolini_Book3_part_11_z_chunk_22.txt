  <p>The proclamation of the ecclesiastical trumpet declares that a sinning brother should first be reprimanded in private. If he refuses to listen, he should be admonished in the presence of witnesses for the sake of correction or confirmation. If he also refuses to listen to them, then the matter should be made known to many so that he may be detested, and if he cannot be saved by shame, he may at least be saved by reproach. If he does not listen even to many, he should be treated like a pagan or a tax collector.</p>

  <p>Their church seems to significantly oppose this proclamation since they attempt to presumptuously or recklessly anathematize all the churches of the world before consulting or inquiring through the ecclesiastical practice of written correspondence. They should have sent an investigative delegation to the surrounding provincial churches to determine whether images should be worshipped or not. According to the voice of a certain wise person, through counsel, they might follow what is to be followed and avoid what is to be avoided. Thus, they would not later regret their decision, but the church would hold what most people, according to the apostolic institution, want to hold. Those who try to oppose ancient institutions with obstinate minds and want to separate themselves from the entirety of the ecclesiastical body would be subject to detestation.</p>

  <p>For what madness or foolishness is it for the church of one part to try to establish a matter that neither the apostles nor their successors established and attempt to anathematize the churches of the whole world, compelling them to either oppose apostolic institutions or be subject to their utterly vain anathema? But since their most foolish anathema brings more harm to them than to us, as the Apostle says: "Neither the malicious nor the covetous shall inherit the kingdom of God," even if it could somehow harm us, it would be more tolerable for us to endure it than to oppose the teachings of the apostles or other holy fathers. As we say with Susanna: "It is better to fall into the hands of men than to forsake the law of our God," and we are taught by the words of the pastor of the church to obey God rather than men.</p>

  <p>For just as it is more tolerable for any citizen or person enjoying the society of a prince to endure insults from seditious people acting against the prince and citizens than to conspire with them in sedition, likewise it is more tolerable for us to be cursed by those who do not fear to curse their own parents than to worship insensible things against the institution of the divine Scriptures. For curses without reason, anger without power, and condemnation without authority do not harm those they are aimed at, but rather afflict their authors with greater afflictions and reveal their laziness and impatience.</p>

  <p>Thus, unless ancient destruction and the old plague, the guide of death and root of evils, which expelled angels from the society of heavenly citizens and men from the dignity of their flourishing seat, inflamed them with the goads of their wickedness, they would not have cared to call a synod for the worship of images without the agreement of many Catholic and God-faithful churches, nor would they have dared to so insolently anathematize so many churches, which are indeed the body of Christ, nor attempted to establish the worship and adoration of insensible things against the institution of divine writings. For no one, says the Apostle, speaking in the Spirit of God, says "anathema to Jesus."</p>

  <p>Therefore, it must be avoided that, while they rashly and recklessly try to anathematize the church, which is the body of Christ, they may seem to insult Him who is its head. Christ has so lovingly chosen the church for Himself that He inseparably presides over it as the head to the body, and it perpetually adheres to Him as the body to the head, so that no injury or honor can be exhibited to the body that is not referred to the head.</p>

        Christ was referring to the persecution brought upon him by the Jews when he spoke to the predatory wolf Saul, not yet Paul, who was devouring the prey in the destruction of the church, saying to him in the most beneficial proclamation or the sending of letters: 
        <s>
            "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
        </s>
        <s>
            Not that he was persecuting Christ reigning in the heavenly heights, but the church, which was already flourishing at that time and navigating the stormy waves of this world.

            Therefore, Christ, in his body, which is the church, still endures persecution, not physically as he once did for the salvation of the world, but with a certain compassionate pity, by which he always has mercy on his members, that is, the faithful remaining in the unity of the holy church, among whom was the one who said,

            For when he, humbling himself to death, reached the mystery of the cross and was despised by the synagogue, which has remained barren since then, he showed in his bloody sweat the future sufferings of his members and testified against the honor given to the church, saying,

            Therefore, if those about whom we speak were to embrace humility, the guardian of virtues and the teacher of good deeds, they would not impudently attempt to anathematize the body of Christ, which is the church, nor would they, out of a desire for their own, or rather vain, praise, convene a council over something so useless and ungracious.
