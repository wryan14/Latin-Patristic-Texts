    <s>Thus, when the synod had gathered, if they had conducted their necessary affairs in an ecclesiastical manner, discussing what would benefit the faithful, they would avoid all improper behavior and disorderly speech.</s>
    <s>By maintaining the path of moderation, they would not deviate from apostolic teachings or the practices of ancient synods.</s>
    <s>Adorned with the ornaments of patience and kindness, they would not call good evil and evil good, nor put sweet for bitter and bitter for sweet, contradicting the prophetic word.</s>
    <s>They would prudently establish what necessarily needed to be established and carefully say what needed to be said, rejecting superfluous and extraordinary anathemas, teaching useful matters, while letting ambiguous or certainly useless matters remain silent.</s>
    <s>The churches of our region and other parts of the world would comply with their statutes.</s>
    <s>But because it is impossible to both assent to their statutes and adhere to the ancient practices of the fathers, since they are as different from each other as light from darkness, life from death, sight from blindness, honesty from dishonesty, purity from impurity, health from sickness, their statutes differ so much from the institutions of the holy fathers.</s>
    <s>Therefore, rejecting the worse, we are content with the better and, disregarding deceptive diversions, we desire to follow the certain and royal path.</s>
    <s>Where, I ask, most excellent virtue, kindness, or you, most steadfast patience, have you gone?</s>
    <s>Where have you departed when you saw such unjust and perverse constitutions being enacted by so many priests, when you saw so many bonds of anathema being imposed on the church?</s>
    <s>Why did you not at least find lodging in two or three people?</s>
    <s>Why did you reject all?</s>
    <s>Why did you present your absence to all?</s>
    <s>Why did you not curb so many vanities with the reins of your moderation?</s>
    <s>Why did you not restrain so many delusions with the reins of your diligence?</s>
    <s>Since boasting and the desire for vain praise urged on the incontinent mouth to fight against us, which, like other sources of evil, our legions rightly reject, we withdrew from them and could not finally find lodging among those we discovered to be seized by such errors.</s>
    <s>For there is no fellowship between light and darkness, nor any communion between Christ and Belial, because according to the saying of a certain wise man, the spirit of God, who is indeed the leader of our army, flees from deceit and will not dwell in a body subjected to sins.</s>
    <s>For he did not dwell among them nor they among us, who fosters pride, because according to the words of Jesus, the son of Sirach, pride is hateful before God and men, and the assembly of the proud will not be healed; the root of sin will be planted in them.</s>
    <s>For in their synod, the disciple of pride, namely the incontinent mouth, prevailed as much as modesty and prudence should have prevailed, and whose slightest touch should not have been involved in such actions, held the chief place, alas!</s>
    <s>And what should have held the chief place did not even have the slightest touch in their activities.</s>
    <s>Thus, by your urging, O incontinent mouth, which prevents the steps of men from being directed in the land of the living, as the prophet says: A man of many words will not be established on the earth, and by whose effort sin is not absent, as it is written: In the multitude of words there is no sin lacking, but he who restrains his lips is wise; and through which the soul is wounded, as the wise man says: He who uses many words wounds his soul;</s>
    <s>and which not only responds before hearing but also anathematizes the holy church before speaking, you compel your followers according to the saying: He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him.</s>
    <s>Thus, you have so thoroughly urged them to reject our fellowship that our association could not even leave a slight trace in their minds.</s>
    <s>For to follow the beauty of life is for us, and to reject the error of madness, according to the voice of our teacher, wisdom, is our duty.</s>

    You will be cited soon. For if the legislator of our warnings had not been compliant and had not kept the steps of his mind bound to the reins of our guidance, as Scripture says: 
    <s> "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth," </s> 
    he would not have enjoyed divine conversations so frequently, nor would he have been imbued with so many mysteries with the Lord's guidance, nor would the Lord of all things have said of him: 
    <s> "But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord." </s>
  </p>

  <p>
    The virtues of patience and humility are entirely attributed to those who have been sent to gather a council to anathematize the Catholic Church extraordinarily and who have attempted with insane audacity to curse what is eternally blessed. They did not heed what is written: 
    <s> "Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God," </s> 
    and we must approach and hold onto it with the arm of faith, the hand of love, and the embrace of the heart. For the psalmist says: 
    <s> "The Lord is good and upright; therefore he instructs sinners in his ways. He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way." </s>
  </p>

  <p>
    From this, it is understood that whoever wishes to be a follower of the Lord's gentleness should not scorn gentleness but should embrace it to be taught the ways of the Lord. It is also written in Proverbs: 
    <s> "A gentle heart is the physician of the body, but an intelligent heart is the life of the bones." </s> 
    Also there: 
    <s> "Better a patient person who controls their temper than one who takes a city." </s>
  </p>

  <p>
    In Ecclesiasticus, it is written: 
    <s> "Son, perform your tasks with humility, and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts." </s> 
    Also, there: 
    <s> "Be swift to hear, and let your life be sincere; and with patience give a true answer." </s> 
    Moreover, Jesus, son of Sirach, says: 
    <s> "Son, conduct your affairs with humility, and you will be loved more than a donor of gifts." </s>
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, the teacher of the nations writes to the Ephesians: 
    <s> "As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace." </s> 
    And the apostle James says: 
    <s> "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." </s> 
    All these commands are undoubtedly rejected by those who dared to anathematize the church for the worship of images, which is indeed as immune from their curse, which is unjust, as it is anointed with the oil of gladness by Christ, who redeemed it, with an unfading and perpetual anointing.

    Concerning prudence, patience, and self-control of speech, it is written: 
    <s> "Whoever spares their words has knowledge, and whoever has a calm spirit is a man of understanding." </s> 
    For what word can be harsher than a curse? If they refrained from uttering it, they would not stray far from the path. What patience or prudence would be more useful to them in this matter than to consult the church established in various parts of the world through their letters and prudently and patiently sanction what the consensus of all has decreed? For it is said by a wise man: 
    <s> "Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you." </s> 
    In this saying, while by metonymy the eyes signify careful consideration of past actions and the feet signify the actions themselves, it clearly suggests to us that the exercises of our actions should always be preceded by prudent and careful consideration, so that the eye of the mind may foresee where actions will later extend.

    Therefore, from the much speaking they used in their council, the psalmist declares himself to be restrained with these words: 
    <s> "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth." </s> 
    And to be properly restrained, he strives to implore the Lord with these prayers: 
    <s> "Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not let my heart be drawn to what is evil." </s>
  </p>

  <p>
    If, therefore, we enumerate all that has been done through patience and gentleness by the holy fathers, whether in the Old or New Testament, and on the contrary, what has been done through pride or uncontrolled speech by the wicked...
