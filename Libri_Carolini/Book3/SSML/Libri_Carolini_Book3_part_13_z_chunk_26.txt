        Since almost in all respects, that council gathered for the worship of images contradicts the most beneficial teachings of the Holy Scriptures, it seems to contradict them also in this part, where it is said to have had a woman as an instructor or teacher. This is indeed prohibited not only by the teachings of divine law but also by the law of nature itself. For the fragility of her sex or the instability of her mind does not allow her to hold the position of teaching or leadership over men, but compels her to be restrained by male authority as one prone to deception and more easily led astray. Hence, it is also sanctioned by divine laws that certain vows of women can be nullified by male deliberation, and it is established by human laws that unmarried women, even if they are of advanced age, should remain under guardianship due to the lightness of their minds.

        For we know that a woman is usually granted to a man for the sake of offspring, assistance, and to curb incontinence, but we never read that she is given for the sake of teaching. For the sake of offspring, as it is read in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛnɪsɪs">Genesis</phoneme>: "And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'" This is indeed marriage, which according to Pelagius should not be considered a sin, nor according to Jovinian should it be equated with virginity, but virginity should be preferred over it because of the sanctity of purity and the integrity of the body, as the Apostle says: "The married woman thinks of the things of the world, how she may please her husband; the virgin thinks of the things of the Lord, how she may please the Lord, that she may be holy in body and spirit." Although the former is not to be rejected or entirely put aside, it should be pursued with gratitude by those to whom it is appropriate, since it is both ordinary in itself and fruitful towards virginity. For it is the seedbed of virginity, just as grapes are known to come from vines, so too virginity is born from marriage; and although virginity is the hundredfold fruit, it still includes the thirtyfold, that is, marriage, among which the sixtyfold, which is appropriately taken in widows, is intermediate.

        Therefore, a woman is granted to a man for the sake of assistance, as the Lord says: "It is not good for man to be alone; let us make him a helper like unto himself," and for the sake of incontinence, according to the Apostle: "If they cannot contain, let them marry," and again: "It is better to marry than to burn."

        Let us ask the Apostle then! Let the distinguished preacher, the chosen vessel, say whether he permits women to teach or to have authority over men? For he says to Timothy: "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet." When asked why he prohibits her from both teaching and having authority over men, the wise teacher wisely gives the reason and says why he forbids both: "For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not the one deceived, it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner," so that we may know that the Apostle did not grant her the dignity of teaching or ruling over men, because she was created not to teach but to help the man, nor to rule over him but to be subordinate to him, either because she is weaker in mind and more easily tempted. For, as the Apostle says, man was not created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man.

        For if anyone should presumptuously try to support this error with the assertion that the same Apostle, when talking about the behavior and self-control of older women, says: "Let them teach what is good," and "teach with prudence," let him consider that he did not allow them to teach some kind of madness or some tradition resisting the sacred institutions of the fathers or certainly the worship of some senseless thing, but allowed them to teach prudence and examples of good living; nor to do this in church, nor in assembly, nor in council, but privately, with the experience of old age and freed from the incentives of vice due to the maturity of age, among their household; and not all women, but those who have a testimony of good works, who receive strangers, who wash the saints' feet, who endure tribulation.

    They help with everything that follows every good work, including their own behavior, movements, expressions, serenity, and silence, which all exhibit a certain sacred decency. <s>It's one thing for a mother to educate her household with words and examples, and another for a woman to teach church leaders or even participate in public synods with useless teachings, as this only seeks vain praise and arrogance.</s>

    <s>If anyone attempts to resist these sacred apostolic institutions by claiming that women should teach men, lead men, and establish synods because, according to the gospel proclamation, women often served the Mediator between God and men, sitting at His feet, hearing His word, busy with frequent service, washing His feet with their tears, drying them with their hair, anointing His body with precious ointments, following Him to His passion, and after His resurrection, returning to His tomb to be the first to witness and announce His glorious resurrection to the disciples, let him consider that sitting at the Lord's feet and performing those services is different from establishing synods, teaching men in assemblies, passing perverse laws, and seeking to lead men.</s> <s>Those women, who served the Lord, symbolized the holy church and clung to His sacred teachings, unlike Athaliah, who, by desiring to lead men with inappropriate ambition, nearly extinguished the entire royal lineage and ended her unworthy life with a death fitting her wickedness.</s>
