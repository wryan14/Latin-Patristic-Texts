        <s>
            In the first book of this work, in the first part of the book, when discussing the error of those who say "God reigns with them," it was somewhat debated.
        </s>
        <s>
            Thus, this error, which they arrogantly boast about as "cooperators with God," can be dismissed.
        </s>
        <s>
            They are neither humble nor following the examples of the holy kings, nor instructed by the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, but are wrongfully and arrogantly elevated.
        </s>
        <s>
            While they seek to usurp for themselves what is not appropriate, it is to be feared that they may lose what is appropriate, because whoever seeks illicit things tends to lose what they've acquired.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            But since, as we mentioned before, this error was partly discussed earlier, now we turn to the point that they say those who are known to have been present at the same synod were gathered so that "God would establish His plan through them."
        </s>
        <s>
            They say: "God gathered you, wanting to establish His own plan," as if it were not written: "He who lives forever created all things together," and as if some new will, which did not exist before, could come to God.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is written through the prophet: "He established them forever and ever, He gave a decree, and it shall not pass away"—as if, needing the aid of others, He gathers them to decide what to do through the deliberation of many.
        </s>

            For counsel is derived from consultation, where something is determined through constant consideration of whether to do it or not.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is a type of cause that speakers call deliberative, in which what should or should not be done is discussed.

        <s>
            There is persuasion and dissuasion, that is, about seeking and avoiding, doing and not doing.
        </s>
        <s>
            In persuasion, two things are stronger: hope and fear.

        <s>
            Since God is omnipotent, He needs nothing.
        </s>
        <s>
            Thus, He is not moved by another's persuasion to do things He does not want, nor dissuaded by anyone from what He wants to do, nor hindered by any fear from doing what He wants, nor urged by any hope to do what He does not want.
        </s>
        <s>
            Nor does He establish the deliberation of His counsel with another.
        </s>
        <s>
            If He needed all these things, He would experience necessity; if He experienced necessity, He would not be omnipotent.
        </s>
        <s>
            However, He is omnipotent; therefore, He has no need.
        </s>
        <s>
            Thus, it is foolish to say: "God gathered you, wanting to establish His own plan."

        <s>
            Indeed, the Son of God is His counsel, who was not established by the Father through some deliberation but was begotten before the ages by an ineffable birth, whom the faithful believe the Father begot and with whom He was never without.
        </s>
        <s>
            He is the wisdom of God the Father, which is co-eternal with Him and which says: "Before the hills, I was brought forth. The earth was not yet made, and when He prepared the heavens, I was there; when He set a boundary for the sea and laid down the law for the waters, I was with Him."
        </s>
        <s>
            This wisdom also demonstrates its loftiness with these words: "I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne was in the pillar of cloud"; and again: "I circled the vault of the sky alone and walked in the waves of the sea, I held the primacy in every nation and every people"; and again: "I spread out my branches like a terebinth. I made the morning star rise in the sky. I love all those who love me. My paths are the paths of life."
        </s>
        <s>
            About this counsel, the psalmist said: "The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations."
        </s>
        <s>
            It is called counsel because the mystery of His incarnation was granted to benefit the human race, a counsel that is never dissolved but remains forever because the triumphant death of the Lord extinguished the devil's destruction perpetually.
        </s>
        <s>
            The thoughts of His heart imply the predestination of His inner judgment, in which all things are stored, whether they were or will be in the following ages.

        <s>
            Human counsels often fail, but the counsel of the Lord stands forever.

  <p>
    Mistakes are never to be blamed. Hence, this plan, which they say the Lord had "established" through them, is not believed to be established by the Lord because it is known to go against the Lord's commandments. For God, through the pages of both the Old and New Testaments, has commanded that He alone be worshipped or revered. However, these people consider it the most absurd decision to worship or revere certain non-sentient things.
  </p>
  <p>
    For God is unchangeable, so that what He had once prohibited, He does not now permit to be done but permits what He established in His counsel, that is, in His Son, to remain stable forever, as Isaiah testifies, who says from the person of God the Father: "All my counsel will stand, and I will accomplish all that I have thought."
  </p>
  <p>
    For this counsel, that is, the Son, is also called the testament. Hence, Jeremiah says: "If my covenant were not with day and night, I would not have established the ordinances of heaven and earth." About this covenant, it is said: "And the covenant of peace will be in Jerusalem."
  </p>
  <p>
    How, then, could God gather them to establish His own counsel through them, as they dream, in which there is such knowledge that nothing is past or future to Him, but all things are present, whose substance, as it is, no opinion can touch, no definition can encompass, since it is greater than anything that can be said or thought? For He is a spirit by nature simple, light inaccessible, invisible, inestimable, infinite, perfect needing nothing, eternal, immortal—and truly immortal, in whom all live, from whom all have received their beginning—to be revered, loved, feared, outside of whom there is nothing, indeed in whom all things that exist above and below, the highest and the lowest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Omnipotent, holding all things, truly rich in all, because there is nowhere He is not, nor is any place absent from Him, except in the hearts of the impious, where, although He is there by His power, He is not there by His grace, who is proven to be everywhere by these testimonies of divine law. For the psalmist says: "Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I descend to hell, you are there; if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me."
  </p>
  <p>
    In Isaiah it is also written: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of your glory." Through Jeremiah as well, He says: "I am a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off: if a man hides himself in secret places, do I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth?" says the Lord.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Book of Wisdom also says: "For the holy spirit of wisdom will not free the blasphemer from his lips, for God is the witness of his innermost thoughts, the true observer of his heart, and the listener of his tongue, for the spirit of the Lord fills the world." In Ecclesiasticus, it is also written: "For the wisdom of God is great, strong in power, seeing all without ceasing; who by His goodness created him who was not, by His justice condemned him who had sinned, by His mercy, indeed great mercy, restored him who had perished."
  </p>
  <p>
    About whom it is said through the prophet: "Great are the works of the Lord, sought out in all His will, His confession and magnificence are His work, and His justice endures forever." And again: "All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth." And to whom through the same prophet it is said: "But you, O Lord God, are merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and truth."
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it possible to believe that He, whom dominions worship, powers tremble before, and the joyous host of angels praises with heavenly hymns, whom the cherubim and seraphim, those sublime powers filled with His knowledge, burning with His love, can in no way comprehend with their senses, whom no one knows except the Son, who is of one substance with Him, would need the counsel of another and therefore call others together to establish His own counsel through them? O most foolish statement! O insipid speech! O words opposing all divine words! Which, if defended by those to whom they were spoken, are close to madness; if not defended...
  </p>


  <p>They are given, and must be attributed to ignorance and laziness! For anyone can adhere to God by persistently doing good deeds, just as the one desired who said: <s>"For me, it is good to be close to God"; however, no one can give Him counsel.</s> For He is the author and source of all good things and, as we have often said, in need of nothing, the Great One.</p>
  
  <p>The Prophet says: <s>"Our Lord is great, and His strength is immense, and His wisdom has no limit."</s></p>

  <p>Tell us, please, holy Isaiah, most noble of prophets, tell us about the Lord's incarnation and the calling of the nations, as narrated in the Gospel rather than prophesied. Can anyone understand the mind of the Lord or become His counselor? For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor? With whom did He take counsel and who instructed Him in knowledge and showed Him the way of understanding?</p>

  <p>The same prophet also says: <s>"Do you not know? Have you not heard? The eternal God, the Lord, who created the ends of the earth, neither faints nor grows weary; His understanding is unsearchable."</s></p>
  
  <p>Let the teacher of the nations also tell us what he thinks about this matter! For he says: <s>"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His paths beyond tracing out!"</s></p>

  <p>Since His judgments are unsearchable and His paths beyond tracing out, He is in no way believed to need another’s counsel for deliberations because, just as He surpasses all in nature, so He also surpasses all in wisdom. And as no one can be equal to Him by nature, so no one can add anything to His knowledge through counsel. For counsel is sought from one who is either equal by nature or by intelligence. But no one is equal to God, no one is His partner, as Moses says: <s>"Who among the gods is like you, Lord? Who is like you—majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?"</s></p>

  <p>And about whom it is said through the psalmist: <s>"For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord? Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord, a God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones, great and awesome above all who are around Him?"</s></p>

  <p>Lord God of hosts, who is like you? <s>"You are mighty, Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds you."</s></p>
