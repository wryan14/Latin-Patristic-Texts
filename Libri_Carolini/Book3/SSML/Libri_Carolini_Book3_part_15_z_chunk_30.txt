    <p>Whoever desires to have expertise in any craft through diligent study does so by adhering to the teachings of skilled, not unskilled, craftsmen, and does not attempt to usurp the mastery of those he sees as less learned and despicable in their own art. Otherwise, while trying to gain praise from the acquired skill, he wastes his work and becomes a mockery to others. This is observed by practitioners of the liberal arts, by doctors, by metalworkers or sculptors, by wood and stone carvers, and by farmers.</p>
    <p>But it is neglected by those who, wanting to establish the practice of worshipping images, attempt to draw examples from corrupt things and shamelessly try to support something so useless and perverse with inappropriate good examples, or more often, with perverse ones. They are like a drunkard, soaked in wine, with trembling limbs and unsteady steps, using both barbaric and Latin words, enjoying both the heat of fires and the cold of frost, senselessly lying down or playing weakly without a fixed intention, swaying here and there, lacking reason. Similarly, these people use testimonies from divine Scriptures inappropriately, mix in their own nonsensical assertions, and try to firmly establish their error with examples of bad things and evil deeds.</p>
    <p>For what madness or folly is it to bring forth the ridiculous example that images of emperors are worshipped in cities and streets, and expect an unlawful thing to be established by another unlawful thing? The teacher of the nations urges us not to be imitators of emperors, but of himself, indeed of Christ, saying: "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfɜːst kɔrɪnθiənz">First Corinthians</phoneme> 11:1; and to separate the fasces of emperors or the wild celebrations of the crowd from the minds of Christians, he says: "For us, to whom Christ was crucified, what have we to do with the forum?" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɡəˈleɪʃənz">Galatians</phoneme> 6:14.</p>
    <p>Now, since they wish to draw examples from judicial or public actions within the holy church, why do they not also adopt the theatrical and mimicry antics or even the cruelties that happen miserably in the theaters or arenas with gladiatorial games? Why does not a cleric with a bishop chase the people like a net-wielding gladiator? Why does one who guards the church of Christ not follow the entirely pagan or rather unfortunate examples of the circus? But let it be far from the Catholic faith to imitate and uphold the perverse actions which the obstinate Gentiles once practiced. For our citizenship, says the Apostle, is in heaven <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɪˈlɪpiənz">Philippians</phoneme> 3:20. Therefore, whoever desires to go where our head, Christ, has preceded, should not be a follower of judicial or public actions, but of Christ our head or his members, namely the apostles or apostolic men.</p>
    <p>For wrong examples must be avoided by Catholics, just as the seduction of evil men or the company of the unjust, as the Lord says: "You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shall you bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert justice" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme> 23:2. A Christian should hate, like the psalmist, those who hate the Lord and pine away over His enemies. Indeed, Tobit, a commendable man and beloved by God, did not urge his son to follow perverse examples when he said: "See, my son, that you do not follow the way of iniquity, and let not the multitude of sinners persuade you, for their wages are death; but if you work truth, God will regard your works, and you will inherit eternal life with all who practice justice."</p>
    <p>Therefore, whoever sees the images of emperors worshipped by the masses and, encouraged by this example, considers worshipping images...</p>


  <p>In the basilicas, it is clearly shown that he strongly resisted this holy man's command and could not say with David:</p> 
  <s>"I have not sat with the council of vanity, nor will I go in with those who work iniquity; I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked; I will wash my hands in innocence and will surround Your altar, Lord."</s>
  
  <p>But if perhaps a defender of this error says, <s>"Worshipping the images of emperors is not a sin,"</s> let him consider the great glory given to the three youths who refused to do so in the blazing furnace. When an angel was sent from heaven to extinguish the consuming fire and impart a life-giving dew to them, the Babylonian prince testified that he saw among them someone like the Son of God, not to his own glory, but to theirs, or even to refute his own stubbornness.</p>
  
  <p>Let them also hear the blessed Jerome in his commentary, which he published in the book of Daniel, speaking thus:</p> 
  <s>"Behold, our God, whom we worship, can save us from the burning fiery furnace and out of your hands, O king."</s> 
  <p>What he thought would terrify the youths, he sees in them as a source of strength.</p>
  
  <s>They do not delay but promise present help, saying:</s> 
  <s>"Behold, our God, whom we worship, can save us from the fire you threaten and from your hands."</s> 
  <s>"But if He does not."</s> 
  <p>Beautifully, in response to what was said: <s>"He can save us,"</s> he did not add the contrary: <s>"if He cannot,"</s> but: <s>"if He does not,"</s> so that it is not about God's inability, but His will if they perish.</p> 
  
  <s>"Let it be known to you, O king, that we do not worship your gods and we will not worship the golden statue you have set up."</s> 
  <p>Whether we read "statue," as Symmachus, or "golden image," as others have translated, worshippers of God should not worship it.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, judges and rulers of the world who worship the statues and images of emperors should understand that by doing this, they are doing what the three youths, by refusing to do, pleased God. And note the precision: to worship gods and adore images, neither of which is fitting for God's servants.</p>
  
  <p>We are instructed by the teachings of holy men that we should not worship the images of emperors. And who is so perverse as not only to decide to worship them but also to take examples of perversity from their worship to the worship of other images?</p> 
  
  <p>If mortal men, inflated with the arrogance of vanity, exalted by worldly pomp, greedy for honors, full of boasting, confined by place, content with location because they could not be everywhere, therefore commanded their images to be worshipped by men because they themselves could not be worshipped everywhere, what need is there to worship God in an image, who is unlimited, who is everywhere entirely, everywhere wonderful, who is not contained by place, not confined by location, whom, as Solomon says, the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain, whom the world cannot contain, but He contains the world?</p>
  
  <p>For since His power is so great, His glory so immense, His might so vast, He is not to be sought in images but in pure and holy hearts; He is not to be worshipped in a painted tablet, but in a holy hall, as the prophet says:</p> 
  <s>"Worship the Lord in His holy hall";</s> 
  <p>who is not found through painting in appointed places, but through works by devout minds; whom Elijah did not seek in place, in painting, or tablets, but knew Him to be present everywhere and showed himself present to Him by the urgency of good works, when he said:</p> 
  <s>"The Lord lives, in whose presence I stand."</s>
  
  <p>Therefore, wanting to worship God in tablets, who is unlocalized and omnipotent, as the Gentiles worshipped their localized or mortal kings, is profane and close to unbelief. For we read that no nation committed this crime except the Babylonians and Romans or those nations that were either subdued by them or neighboring to them or took examples from them, so that as these two kingdoms are known to have surpassed other kingdoms of the world in ferocity and strength, so they are also believed to have been more prone to worshipping and adoring idols.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, between these two strongest kingdoms, there was great agreement, great similarity: great cruelty, and also great strength, and indeed strength, which ruled over other kingdoms of the world in their time. For as that one from the East, so indeed this one from...</p>


  <p>
    It emerged from the West; that one during the world's youth, this one now during the world's old age. For, as historians say, the Roman Empire inherited all the legacy and pinnacle of the Babylonian kingdom. Between these two kingdoms, like an old father who had already lost his power and a young son who had not yet gained the strength to rule, two kingdoms acted as guardians, namely the Persians and the Macedonians. But when the heir, that is, the Roman Empire, grew up, what held the place of the guardian withdrew, and the young son took on the inheritance that the old father had lost. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It would be lengthy to follow the harmonies or agreements of these two kingdoms. For, to keep other things silent, in this part there is significant harmony between the two kingdoms. Both decreed that their kings should be worshipped in statues or images through fields or streets and imposed diverse punishments on those who refused to do this. For this evil, along with other evils frustrated by the advent of Christ, must be completely frustrated. Not only should examples for other actions be taken from Him, but this very thing must be eradicated by Christians from the root, so that no root of bitterness, as the Apostle says, may spring up again and defile many.
  </p>
  <p>
    For, being instructed by apostolic teachings that we should give no opportunity to the evil one, why should we give such an opportunity to the Gentiles by worshipping images of mortal kings? They might say to us: "We worship the images or statues of those whom we believe to be gods by true religion or whom we have learned from the traditions of the ancients not to be ignorant of being gods; but you, for whom this is an abomination, why do you venerate images of men, either painted on wax or cast in metal, under the reverence of kings with even public worship? As you preach, do you give to men the honor due only to God? If it is unlawful and contrary to the law, why do you do this, Christians, or why do your priests not prohibit it, so that what you ascribe to us ignorantly as sacrilege, you knowingly undertake under the excuse of duty?"
  </p>
  <p>
    When such and similar things were brought up against our people by the philosophers of the Gentiles during the early times of faith, our people are said to have responded thus: "What you say, we neither ought nor can approve, for by the clear words of God we are not allowed to worship elements, angels, or any rulers of heaven and earth or air."
  </p>
  <p>
    For this is a special name of divine duty and is higher than all earthly veneration or reverence. But just as in such evil, flattery first led men astray, so now custom scarcely recalls them from error. Although in this careless compliance, divine worship is not found, but because of the likeness of beloved faces, the intended joys make them do more than those to whom it is offered perhaps demand, or than the offerers ought to perform. Nonetheless, more reverent and stricter Christians abhor this custom, to whom it does not appear that they then decreed to worship the images of kings, although the minds of men, still rough and not yet solidly converted from gentility, were still unprepared to grasp solid food.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now indeed, because they say that by the example of imperial images, the image of God or the holy mother of God, Mary, or all the saints should be worshipped, how absurd and how useless this is, is evident. It has been shown in part either in this chapter or in others. For no one besides God Almighty can have or retain the images or names of all the saints, as the prophet says: "Your friends are greatly honored, O God, their rule is greatly strengthened. I will count them, and they will multiply beyond the sand." And the Lord said to Abraham: "If the stars of heaven can be numbered because of their multitude, so can your offspring be numbered." 
  </p>
  <p>
    The offspring of Abraham, however, are manifest to be all the believers. For he is the father of nations, in whose offspring, that is in Christ, all nations shall be blessed; who according to the apostle was called a friend of God not from circumcision, but from belief, nor was the observation of the law but the belief of faith counted to him as righteousness.
