  <p>It is very common and exceedingly familiar to those who are fervent in the worship of images to believe and assert that the honor given to an image can transfer to the form it represents. How this could happen and whether it can happen is not understood by any reasoning, nor is it approved by the testimonies of divine scriptures.</p>
  <p>Did the saints, who were able to ascend to the heavenly kingdoms because of their merits and whose images those people worship improperly, seek superstitious or unnecessary honors? Did they allow themselves to be worshipped? Some of them wanted to be humble to earn the grace of the Lord; among these was the one who said: <break time="0.5s"/> "I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked." Others preferred to be flogged rather than venerated; witness the one who said: <break time="0.5s"/> "I am ready not only to be bound but also to die for the name of the Lord Jesus." For the teacher of the nations recounts that they were not seekers of honors, but were burning with spiritual zeal, fortified against adversities, refined by the fire of tribulation, and made stronger than worldly adversities. He says that some of them were tempted, like Achaia; some were stoned, like Zechariah and Stephen; some were sawn in two, like Isaiah; some were killed with the sword, as many prophets are known to have been; some wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, like Elijah and John; some were oppressed or in need, and the world was not worthy of them, as it is believed of almost all saints.</p>
  <p>These examples show that they were driven by the desire for virtues, not honors. For if they had been burned with ambition for honors while they lived mortally, they would not today enjoy such great glory in heaven. Since perpetual honor has been attributed to them by the Lord, they are not in need of transient honors.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the honor duly given to the bodies of the saints, their relics, or basilicas, remains acceptable to Almighty God and His saints; but inappropriate and indecent honor remains unacceptable to God and His saints. This is why the blessed Joseph, after prophecy, commanded his bones to be carried by the children of Israel to the promised land, so that the Egyptians, remembering him and his administration during the great famine in Egypt, would not give his bones useless veneration. He, being firmly devoted to God the Creator and entirely alien to the vain superstitions of the Egyptians, showed his sanctity more strongly by serving God humbly and rightly in life and rejecting inappropriate veneration of his ashes after death. Therefore, since holy men acceptable to God in all things avoided the vain services of men, just as Paul and Barnabas are known to have avoided the superstitious services of the Lycaonians, and Peter rejected the devoted veneration of Cornelius, and the angel in the Apocalypse forbade John from worshiping him, who would believe that they delight in the worship of images or are soothed by the services rendered to pictures? How could the honor given to pictures, which are neither of their bodies nor clothes but are prepared by artists according to their skill, reach them? For they are not depicted by the work of painters, who reign with Christ in heaven, nor do they seek to be painted by craftsmen on boards or walls, who have earned to be inscribed in the book of life by Christ.</p>
  <p>Let those who are so peculiar in saying that the honor of the image transfers to the original form, say where they have read this or by what testimonies they can prove it. For our Lord and Savior did not say: <break time="0.5s"/> "As long as you did for the images," but: <break time="0.5s"/> "As long as you did it for one of the least of these, you did it for me;" nor did He say: <break time="0.5s"/> "Whoever receives the images," but: <break time="0.5s"/> "Whoever receives you receives me;" nor did the Apostle say: <break time="0.5s"/> "Let us love images," but: <break time="0.5s"/> "Let us love one another, for love comes from God;" nor did he say to bear the burdens of images, but to bear each other's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</p>

      For since images are generally made according to the skill of the artists, so that sometimes they are beautiful, sometimes ugly, sometimes nicely done, sometimes even poorly, some very much resemble those they depict, while others are quite different, some are shining with newness, while others are fading with age, we must ask which of them are more honorable: those that are more expensive, or those that are known to be cheaper?
    </s>
    <s>
      Because, if the more expensive ones have more honor, it means that the work or the quality of the materials is being venerated, not the fervor of devotion; if, however, the cheaper ones—those that are less similar to those they are meant to represent—are unjustly venerated, then it is wrong, since these, which neither excel in work nor material nor are known to resemble the persons, are venerated more fervently and extensively.
    </s>
    <s>
      For while we do not expect anything from images except for reverence, since we allow images in the churches of the saints not for worship but for the memory of the deeds and for the beauty of the walls, those others place nearly all their hope of belief in images, it remains for us to venerate the saints in their bodies or rather the relics of their bodies or even their garments according to the tradition of the ancient fathers, while they, worshiping walls and panels, think they gain great merit in faith because they are subject to the works of painters.
    </s>
    <s>
      For even if this can be avoided by the educated, who understand what they are venerating in images, it causes scandal among the uneducated, who venerate and worship nothing other than what they see.

      Hence, it must be avoided that they fall under the gospel sentence, who cause so many little ones to stumble, since if he who causes one of the little ones to stumble is subjected to a most fearful sentence, much more will he be struck with severe destruction who causes nearly the whole church of Christ to either worship images or condemns those who reject image worship to anathema.
    </s>
    <s>
      Both of which must be avoided with great caution, lest anyone, by leaning too much to either side than order requires, cannot avoid the loss of his own salvation.
