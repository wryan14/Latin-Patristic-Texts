      <s>How recklessly and, if I may say so, foolishly Constantinus, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, with the consent of others, declared he would 'receive and honorably embrace images' and 'render them the service of adoration owed to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,' is not to be much debated in our discussion,</s>
      <s>as it is clear to all who read or hear this that he is deeply immersed in error.</s>
      <s>He admits to offering to created things the service due only to the Creator, and while trying to favor pictures, he contradicts all holy Scriptures.</s>

      <s>Who, therefore, in their right mind would ever say or agree with such an absurdity, that the variety of pictures should be held in as much honor as the holy, life-giving, and creator of all things Trinity, and that such service should be rendered to a picture as is rendered to the Lord of all creation?</s>
      <s>Or who would tolerate hearing someone utter such nonsense rather than speak sense?</s>
      <s>Or what ears would strive to avoid rather than perceive such a great crime?</s>
      <s>For it is perverse to offer to any insensate things the service of adoration due to Almighty God,</s>

      <s>With what face, therefore, to pass over other matters, does he hear this one command of divine law: "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve" (Matthew 4:10),</s>
      <s>who, having spurned this, not only serves created things but also strives to equate their service with the service due to God?</s>
      <s>Let the bishop stand in the church and read: "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve,"</s>
      <s>and then, as soon as he sits in the assembly, say:</s>
      <s>"I receive and honorably embrace the holy and venerable images and give them the service of adoration due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,"</s>
      <s>thus showing himself unstable in divine words, professing one thing with his mouth, believing another in his heart, reading one thing in the divine pages, holding another in the recesses of his heart, and preferring his nonsense to the divine precepts.</s>

    <p>
      <s>For while it is known to be harmful to him and his followers in their perverse profession,</s>
      <s>it is known to be beneficial to us, who wish to resist their nonsense, since it uncovers the unfortunate error they seem to impose on the people, disguised though it may be.</s>
      <s>For they say: "We do not worship images as God nor do we render them the worship of divine service, but while we look at and worship them, we fix the acumen of our mind where we know those whom they represent to be."</s>
      <s>But on the contrary, this man, exposing their error and revealing his own thoughts without any cover, admits that he renders the same service to images as to the holy Trinity;</s>
      <s>thus, the absurdity that they secretly harbor, he openly declares.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
      <s>No one can be unaware of their folly, as the sentiment of this profession reveals it.</s>
      <s>Because, therefore, he tries to separate and anathematize all who disagree with his error from the holy, catholic, and apostolic church and aligns them with those who refused to believe in the saving incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ,</s>
      <s>it is clear to all readers how great his foolishness is, as he, sunk in the abyss of his own folly, while drawing others to suffer such things with him,</s>
      <s>tries to rebuke with insults and abusive words those whom he sees avoiding the abyss of such a great danger.</s>
      <s>For what madness or what insanity is it to try to tear Christ's people away from the breasts of the mother church because the service due only to God is given to insensate things?</s>

    Trying to oppose! Or what perversity is it to consider equal those who, with a stubborn mind, refuse to believe in the life-giving incarnation of the Mediator between God and humans, Jesus Christ, with those who, rejecting the commands of divine law, desire to serve only God, who created everything and to whom all things serve! 
  </p>

    It’s one thing not to believe in the redemption of the world, another to want to serve only God; one thing to spurn the Savior of the world, another to reject the worship of images; one thing to resist saving teachings, another to oppose vain and superstitious practices. The same Lord and Savior, who, through the Old Testament, prohibited the worship of images, and through his physical presence, deemed that the image of Caesar should be given to Caesar rather than worshipped, gave such commandments about believing in him, saying: <break time="500ms"/> “Whoever believes in me has eternal life”; and again: <break time="500ms"/> “I am the door and the life; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture”; and again: <break time="500ms"/> “Unless one is born of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    The Truth says this, the Savior of the world testifies this, the Redeemer of humanity proclaims this, and who is so dull and sluggish as to consider equal those who contradict these most authoritative teachings with those who, content with divine words, despise worshipping things without sense?
  </p>
  <p>
    Let it be that worshipping images is a virtue and a good deed. Can it be equated to faith? While all good works must be pursued, no good work can bring anyone to perfect salvation unless it is built upon the foundation of faith and strengthened by it. Abraham was justified not by works but by faith; Moses became great through faith; the saints conquered kingdoms through faith, and all the saints died in faith. And the prophet says: <break time="500ms"/> “All his works are in faith”; and the Lord in the gospel: <break time="500ms"/> “Your faith has saved you”; and again: <break time="500ms"/> “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will be done; and whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive.” 
  </p>
  <p>
    From this, it is understood that faith surpasses all other virtues; and although hope and charity are connected to it, it is through faith that one reaches them. Nor should the same condemnation be given to those who err in other works as to those who err in faith, since, although no one can be saved by worshipping images without faith, countless legions in the heavenly homeland, whether through martyrdom, innocence, or the life of solitude, never had or worshipped images, yet through the observance of faith, they enjoy eternal joys in the company of the inhabitants of heaven.
