      When Euthymius, Bishop of Sardis, is almost identical in his confession to Constantine, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, it is not uncertain that they share the same faith and will receive the same reward, unless repentance precedes in either of them.

      The Catholic Church, with the voice of its prelates, rejoicing in the mystery of Christ's incarnation, says to the Lord:

      Therefore, since these men place almost all their hope for help in images, they do not moderately dissent from the holy and universal church, which places its hope for help not in painted pictures, not in handmade works of artisans, but in God, the Creator of all.

      It has as its helpers the apostles and apostolic men, who intercede daily with the Lord for it and, by the gift of the Holy Spirit from the heavens, pour out the rain of holy preaching upon the church according to the prophecy of Joel, saying: “And it will be in that day, the mountains will drip sweetness, and the hills will flow with milk,” which Ezekiel also echoes by saying: “But you, O mountains of Israel, will give forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel to eat.”

  <p>
    <s>
      This fruit, although understood as Christ the Lord, who came from the mountains of Israel by assuming human form from the patriarchs, can also be understood as the sweetness of preaching combined from the Old and New Testaments, which is spread through the minds of humble believers and softens the hearts of the incredulous to believe and bear fruit, and brightens the minds of leaders with the hope of eternal reward.

      It encourages them to be clothed in righteousness and to sing to God with their subjects, fulfilling the prophetic word: “Your fields will be filled with abundance, the fertile places of the wilderness will overflow, and the hills will be girded with joy; the rams of your flock will be clothed, and the valleys will abound with grain. They will shout for joy and sing hymns.”

      He does not say: “I lift my eyes to senseless things, that I may receive help from them,” but: “I lift my eyes to the mountains,” to those mountains upon which the church of Christ is founded, according to the prophet: “His foundation is in the holy mountains.”

      Seeing the people of God delivered from Egyptian slavery and ascending to the promised land, that is, despising the burdensome slavery of this world and flying to the eternal homeland, they rejoice, as the most holy of prophets says: “The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs of the flock.”

      Therefore, whoever, turning away from the vanities of created things, lifts the eyes of his mind solely to worship and serve God, dispelling the sleep of unbelief, will not fear when the proud aerial powers or their followers descend into the deadly darkness of Hell.

      And with the highest jubilation, together with others of like mind, he will sing: “Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth be moved, and the mountains be carried into the heart of the sea; though its waters roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with its swelling.”

        It comes to the mountains and evil spirits, about whom it is said through the prophet <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈneɪhəm">Nahum</phoneme>:

            "The mountains quake before him, and the hills melt away."

            And about whom the Apostle says:

        The instigator of all evils and the opposite of all good counsels, therefore, persuaded men to worship creatures, to turn them away from the Creator.
    </p>

    <p>
        By his worst persuasions, the worship of creatures increased. Under the pretext of some sort of religion and reverence for saints, it held a significant place among those who confessed to 'embrace' and worship images 'with all their heart.'
    </p>

    <p>
        For while the error of both is nearly equal, as we have stated, it is known to be somewhat different. Constantine judged those who refused to offer the service owed to God alone to creatures as unbelievers and infidels, while Euthymius condemned them not as unbelievers, but as heretics. As Sedulius said about some:
    </p>

    <s>
        "Both equal in error, although following different paths."
    </s>

    <p>
        Due to the madness of one error, they falsely claim that the holy Catholic Church is partly unbelieving and partly heretical. For if all of us Christians, who wish to offer the service owed to God alone, rejecting the worship of creatures, are judged heretics because we do not serve images, then those who served creatures, whether before or after the coming of the Redeemer, will undoubtedly be judged as completely Catholic.
    </p>

    <p>
        If they are unbelievers—and indeed they are unbelievers because they worshipped creatures instead of the Creator—they will be judged by all means. We, who serve the one and only God, rejecting vanities, and offer him due and fitting service, will be considered and judged as Catholics and faithful.
