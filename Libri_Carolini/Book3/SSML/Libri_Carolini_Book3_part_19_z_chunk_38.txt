<p>Often ignorance is both guilty and innocent; guilty ignorance frequently tries to cause harm, while innocent ignorance does not intend to offend anyone. But although neither type is subject to sin, both are subject to criticism because guilty ignorance is driven by a disgraceful will to offend, and innocent ignorance, even if it does not sin by harming anyone, still does not escape criticism because all ignorance is unlearned and all unlearned things are subject to criticism.

      Thus, the ridiculous statement by Agapius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, saying, "It is written in our divine Scriptures," is proven to be subject to either the same criticism that is applied to sin or the same that is applied to ignorance. This is because it is either guilty of sin, as those who, being men not different from other mortals, claim that God reigns with them and call themselves 'divine' and their actions or words 'divine,' and therefore call their writings 'divine'; or it is subject to criticism for speaking uneloquently and ignorantly, having said 'in our divine Scriptures' instead of something like 'in our codices containing divine Scriptures' or something similar, thus speaking awkwardly and ridiculously.

      If it is believed that he said this out of the arrogance by which they presume to call themselves 'divine' and claim that God reigns with them, it is madness. If they wanted to say something else but lacked the sharpness to express what they conceived in their hearts with precise words, it is laziness. Thus, they are either carried away by arrogance or believed to be bound by the dark chains of ignorance.

      Who in their right mind would say such a thing? What sane person would utter such a statement? What madness or folly makes a mortal man, subjected to passions, say: "It is written in our divine Scriptures"? If they are 'ours,' how can they be 'divine'? And if they are 'divine,' how can they be 'ours'? Human things derive from humans, divine things derive from God. Our writings are human, Godâ€™s writings are divine. We can rightly call the books of the holy law 'our books,' but we can only properly call divine Scriptures 'divine Scriptures.'

      Even if this statement could reasonably stand, which it cannot, it could not be believed to have come from a source of boasting or from the abyss of ignorance. Ultimately, it is criticized in every way possible because it is useless, and it appears to have been made uselessly to support something useless, namely, the worship of images.

      And simplicity, which often adheres to straightforward things, cannot support it, as it is clear that it was not said with pure, straightforward intent but with perverse will. If it were known to have come simply and innocently from a holy rusticity, which sometimes benefits only itself, not to assert something forbidden, God, who examines the heart and kidneys and often considers intentions rather than actions, would undoubtedly forgive it. For just as a bad will, even if it does not carry out any evil act, is often held accountable as if it did, so a good will is always accepted as a good deed. To illustrate this with examples, Balaam's bad will, which desired to curse the people of God, although he did not achieve what he wanted, was not free from guilt; and David's good will, which desired to build a temple for the Lord, although it was not fulfilled in action, was praised by divine oracles.
