      "And saying: I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," he said: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem while they were arrayed?"

      John Chrysostom is said to have told Theodosius, abbot of the monastery of Saint Andrew, in the often mentioned and most vain synod, which was held for the worship of images: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians."
    </s>
    <s>
      Since those who are said to have been in that synod try to distort the words of patriarchs, prophets, and other saints and illustrious men in order to establish the worship of images, and falsely claim that these same patriarchs performed certain acts which they did not, it is not surprising if they also falsely accuse John Chrysostom of saying such things.
    </s>

  <p>
    <s>
      For would that eloquent and learned man say: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," knowing that the immortal nature of angels is by no means in need of paintings to be seen by men?
    </s>
    <s>
      For they are by nature spirits, and their role is as angels, who, if they are to be seen by men, are believed to take on bodies from the most luminous ether, not from the works of painters.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, it is not to be believed that such a statement was made by the most eloquent John, as it is neither well-phrased nor clear in meaning nor supported by any reason.
    </s>
    <s>
      It contains the flaw which grammarians call amphiboly, that is, ambiguity of expression, because when it is said: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," it is not clearly evident whether he saw an angel in an image who was chasing a multitude of barbarians somewhere else or whether an angel was seen somewhere else and was chasing a multitude of barbarians in an image.
    </s>
    <s>
      Even if this statement were free from this flaw, other indications would show it not to be by such a great man, who, since he was not of that age, would be most ridiculous and rather false to say: "I saw an angel chasing barbarians," who, if I am not mistaken, saw the same story painted by an artist in a picture, where the angel had previously struck down the ranks of barbarians.

      Many eloquent and learned men, in the vast fields of their discussions, as order and reason dictate, mention paintings and images, just as they do other things.
    </s>
    <s>
      But when those who burn with the zeal for worshiping such images find these mentions in their readings, they try to pervert everything to that worship, so that they might seem to arm their defenseless assertion against us, who, with the Lord's favor, are true worshippers, worshipping the Father in spirit and in truth.
    </s>
    <s>
      They attempt to make their defenseless assertion armed by discovering that the most eloquent men mentioned some images, as if commandments are given about all things mentioned in treatises.

      Thus John the priest, when the aforementioned Theodosius the abbot falsely claimed that John, bishop of Constantinople, said: "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," is immediately reported to have added and said: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem while they were arrayed?"
    </s>
    <s>
      In many places of that vain reading, which was compiled by them from this matter, he is found to have spoken many notable things hastily and carelessly.
    </s>
    <s>
      For he is noted to have spoken incautiously almost everywhere there, and the faster he was in words, the slower he is proven to be in understanding, as Solomon says: If you see a man hasty in his words, know that a fool has more hope than he.
    </s>

  <p>
    <s>
      For when he is reported to have said about the painting: "Who is this angel, unless it is of whom it is written: Because the angel of the Lord struck 185,000 Assyrians?" and so forth, it becomes apparent how incautious and delirious he was, since that angel did not strike the Assyrians in a painting, but the one who was sent to accomplish that task.

        In the case of Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers, as if it were written this way, and in this, as in other things, the lack of education is revealed, because nowhere is it found written in this order of words.

        Although Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, captured almost all the fortified cities of Judah, the Scripture says: <s>And it happened in the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.</s> However, he never reached Jerusalem, nor did he set up camp around the city with machines to strike the wall, but he sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, who is recorded to have stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool on the highway to the fuller's field.

        The Book of Chronicles, which is called <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="diːˈbreɪ hɑːˈjɑːmɪm">Dibre Hayyamim</phoneme> in Hebrew and Paralipomenon in Greek, which is the chronicle of the divine law, testifies to this: <s>Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, sent his servants to Jerusalem. For he himself with his entire army was besieging Lachish.</s> For what John is known to have used in his usual manner, as if it were written there: 'Around Jerusalem with soldiers,' is found in none of the authentic books of the holy law.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prove this more clearly, the very words of the holy law, as they are in the books, must be set forth in order. Thus, in the Book of Kings, it is written: <s>So it happened that night, the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 181,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When morning came, they saw all the dead bodies and Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, departed and returned to Nineveh.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Book of the very holy and eloquent prophet Isaiah also describes this history in this way: <s>The angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians, and when morning came, behold, all the dead bodies. Then Sennacherib departed and returned and stayed in Nineveh.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Book of Chronicles, which, as we have said, is the chronicle of the entire divine law, but it elaborates on the histories of the kings from the side of the Book of Kings, which were omitted there, narrates this history in this way: <s>And the Lord sent an angel, who struck down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame to his own land.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        In these examples, what John has used is not found at all.
