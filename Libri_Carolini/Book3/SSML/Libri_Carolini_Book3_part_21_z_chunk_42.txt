    <s>Among other nonsensical claims made to support their error, this one is the most familiar to them:</s> 
    <s>they assert that someone was restrained from committing adultery by the image of a certain Polemon.</s> 
    <s>Even if this event did happen - though it is not found in any authentic books of either the Old or New Testaments, nor mentioned by any of the recognized doctors of the holy Roman Catholic and apostolic church - they present it as if it were a proven miracle and dare to equate it with the miracle of the hem of the Lord's garment.</s>

    <s>Even if, as they assert, it happened, it should not and cannot be equated with the saving acts of the Lord, because the distance between some unknown Polemon and the Mediator between God and men is as great as the distance between the acts of the aforementioned Polemon and his image and the most holy miracles of the Lord Savior.</s>

    <s>In the Book of Revelation, it is also read that the twenty-four elders cast their crowns before the Lamb, because all the virtues and victories of the saints, in which they shone by his help, are seen to be lesser compared to his virtues and victory, just as a stream derived from a perennial source is considered lesser when compared to the source itself, and a worthless vine shoot is always considered inferior when compared to the fruitful branches of the vine.</s>

    <s>Therefore, even if what they say about Polemon and his image is true, it does not mean images should be worshipped, because, as we briefly mentioned, not all things that bring some benefit to mortals are to be worshipped.</s>

    Indeed, because actions that should be done rationally and truthfully are never established by lies or examples of lies, as truth is never known to consent to lies, lies are always believed to oppose the truth. These two are seen to be opposed to each other in such a way that they always resist each other. Just as no one can nourish fire with flowing water, nor can anyone increase flowing water with fire, no one can prove the truth with lies as they desire to do.

    Therefore, having briefly examined and proven in part that the act involving the image of Polemon—if indeed, as they admitted, it happened—cannot nor should be equated to the act involving the hem of the Lord's garment, whether it is entirely doubtful whether it happened as they say it did or not, or even if it did happen, the worship of images cannot be established from it. Moreover, truth cannot be approved or established by lies. Therefore, it is now worthwhile to briefly explain what the hem of the Lord's garment, which they try to compare to the image of Polemon, symbolically implies with its hidden mysteries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hem of the Lord's garment signifies the faith of the Incarnation, by whose touch Gentiles lost the sickness of idolatry and foulness. For just as the hem is the smallest part compared to the body or the entire garment, so the Incarnation of the Redeemer, compared to the divine and ineffable generation by which He was begotten by the Father before the ages, seems to be the smallest. Of this generation, it is said through Isaiah: <break time="500ms"/> "Who shall declare His generation?" <break time="500ms"/> (Isaiah 53:8) The implication is that 'no one' can. However, His human generation is thus described by the evangelist: <break time="500ms"/> "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David." <break time="500ms"/> (Matthew 1:1)

    Therefore, the woman touching the hem of the Lord's garment from behind received the desired healing, which the skill of doctors had long denied her, because after the Lord's passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, the Gentiles received the health of faith by touching the hem of the Lord's garment—that is, by believing in the mystery of His Incarnation, which neither the teaching of the patriarchs nor the prophets could impart to them. And while scarcely a small crowd of disciples believed at the Lord's preaching, nevertheless, at the preaching of the apostles, such a great multitude was inflamed with the swift fervor of faith that it is reported that on one day five thousand men believed, and on another day, three thousand. This is what the Truth promised to the disciples, saying: <break time="500ms"/> "He who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also, and greater works than these he will do." <break time="500ms"/> (John 14:12) Some believe that this can be understood in the miracle performed by Peter by the Lord's will, for while the Lord healed the sick by the command of His word or by touch, Peter is read to have healed the sick by the mere touch of his shadow.

    Therefore, the Lord, going to raise the daughter of the synagogue ruler, heals the woman from the flow of blood by the touch of His hem, because, as He aimed to awaken the synagogue, which undoubtedly descended from the stock of the patriarchs and prophets, from the sleep of unbelief, He healed the Gentiles from the most insolent worship of demons by the knowledge of His faith. And the good that the synagogue, ensnared by the guilt of perfidy, neglected to receive, the Gentiles merited to receive by the devotion of faith. Therefore, the Lord testifies that He came to liberate the synagogue, both by saying in His bodily presence: <break time="500ms"/> "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" <break time="500ms"/> (Matthew 15:24) and by forbidding the disciples to go into the way of the Gentiles and enter the cities of the Samaritans <break time="500ms"/> (Matthew 10:5). And allegorically, He promises to descend into the garden of the Israelite people through Solomon in the Song of Songs, saying: <break time="500ms"/> "I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley." <break time="500ms"/> (Song of Solomon 6:11) Because, indeed, while He descended by taking on flesh to the garden of the Jewish people, where the law revealed the utmost severity in its shell and concealed incomparable sweetness in its core, He visited the abandoned works of the Gentile valley and joined it to Himself with the integrity of faith.

  <s>Doubts will be dispelled, and through faith in Christ, we will rise and live with Him forever.</s>
  <s>This is shown because, as soon as the full number of non-Jewish people have come in, according to the Apostle, the blindness that came upon them for not believing in the Mediator between God and humans will be removed.</s>
  <s>By believing in Him, who was foretold to them long ago by the patriarchs and prophets through the thunderings of sacred prophecies, all of Israel will be saved.</s>

  <s>Therefore, since the image of Polemon lacks these and other similar mysteries hinted at through the garment of the Lord, it should not be considered in the same way as the hem of the Lord's garment, nor should it be equated in honor to something that cannot be matched in the splendor of so many mysteries.</s>
