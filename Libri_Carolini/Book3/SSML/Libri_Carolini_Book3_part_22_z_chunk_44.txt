      If a harmful fluid besieges the citadel of the body, that is, the head, it easily spreads to the other limbs.

      It's not surprising if this fluid, having spread to the lowest parts of the feet, causes them severe damage, especially since it is known to have injured the head, which commands all the limbs.

      Therefore, the madness of worshiping images, which has crept into the minds of Constantine and his mother Helena, as well as Terasius, the bishop of Constantinople, and the other priests of those regions, should not be highly esteemed if it descends to deceive the minds of judges or common people.

      As shown by the previous example, when the head is invaded by the arrogance of a certain thing, it easily invades the rest, which are shown to be subordinate to the head.

      "The whole head is sick," says the prophet, "and the whole heart is faint. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it."

      For evidently, when kings and priests, who ought to be examples of good living to their subordinate people, neglect the pursuit of living rightly and acting rightly, the internal health of the subordinate common people is somewhat doubted.

      When therefore in the same synod the minds of so many priests were beset with errors, how could the error not adhere to the minds of the judges?

      Or who will lead the sheep back from error if the shepherds themselves hold the leadership in error?
    </s>
    <s>
      For priests who are known to lead their subordinate people into error are rebuked with such reproaches by the prophet Jeremiah: "Therefore, this is what the Lord says to the shepherds who tend my people: You have scattered my sheep and driven them away and have not looked after them."

      Immediately, it is shown how great God's care is for the people and how, when the negligent are removed, more diligent shepherds are given to the people of God: "Behold, I will punish you for the evil of your doings, and I will raise up shepherds over them who will feed them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed," says the Lord.

      In the prophet Ezekiel too, concerning such people - which we indeed recount with great anguish - who live off ecclesiastical stipends and are believed to lead the people into error with erroneous and incautious examples, as it is said they did, who burned with vain worship of images and associated the subordinate people with their error of profession, it is written: "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: You devour my sheep and clothe yourselves with their wool and slaughter the fat ones, but you do not feed my sheep. You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bound up the injured, you have not brought back the strayed, you have not sought the lost, but with force and harshness you have ruled them. So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and they became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered over all the mountains and on every high hill; they were scattered over the whole earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them."

      Therefore, in this matter of the most vain profession, the wickedness of the judges is not as great as the perversity of the priests.
    </s>
    <s>
      In the judges, there is found laziness, but in the priests, there is great madness, especially since the latter declare they will worship images and offer to them the service due to the Holy Trinity.

      The former profess that 'the art of painters is pious' and should not be mocked, and that 'a pious painter is commended by the Father,' saying: 'The art of the painter is indeed pious, and those who criticize it foolishly are wrong; for even the Father himself commends a pious painter.'
    </s>
    <s>
      In these professions of both parties, it is clearly shown that the priests have surpassed the judges in error as much as they surpass them in the honor of their higher rank.
    </s>
    <s>
      The laity could not be equated with the prelates in absurd professions, just as they cannot be equal in the seat of the priestly chair.

      But while in neither party is there found anything that can be rightly praised, in both parties something is seen that can be justly condemned.

            They admitted that they would worship images and give them the service due only to God, and some of that has been refuted.
        </p>
        <p>
            It remains, therefore, that the error of the judges, who assert that the art of painting is pious, should be refuted by our writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            They say that the art of painting is pious, as if it does not share the same potential for piety or impiety as other worldly arts. What greater piety does the art of painters have over the arts of blacksmiths, sculptors, founders, engravers, stonemasons, carpenters, farmers, or other craftsmen? 
        </p>
        <p>
            All these arts, which can only be learned through practice, can be held either piously or impiously by those who practice them. Piety or impiety does not fall on the arts themselves but on the people who follow them, who are often either constrained by the most shameless disturbances of vice or adorned by the life-saving company of virtues. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if the art of painters is considered pious because it often depicts the actions and pious deeds of pious people, then it should also be considered impious because it often depicts many impieties, such as the slaughter of people, the atrocities of wars, the cruelties of criminals, the savagery of wild animals, the attacks of beasts, and other similar things.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if it is not considered impious because these things are depicted for human eyes through outlines or other means, it will not be considered pious because it depicts the deeds of good people. Just as iron is not called impious because it kills people, nor is it called pious because instruments are made from it that protect people and aid doctors in healing, so too the art of painting is not impious because it depicts cruelty, nor pious because it depicts certain acts of kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for those who lament that it is wrongly criticized by some foolish people, no one in their right mind doubts that they are being irrational in this matter as in others. No person of sound mind criticizes images or the art of painting, but condemns the madness of those who worship them and give them inappropriate service. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Wine is not condemned because it causes drunkenness, as it is often offered in sacrifice to God. Forests are not condemned because they provide shelter to thieves, as they also provide many useful things for people. Fire is not condemned because it sometimes greedily devours houses and other human possessions, as it also supports human life in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, when they say, The Father Himself commends the pious painter, where and when the Father commends the painter is neither for them to prove nor for us to believe, as no divine oracle praises painters. Let them find any place in the divine Scriptures where painters are praised for creating images, and we will find a way to respond. For Almighty God often judges not the works but the devotion behind them, not the acts but the intentions, not the things themselves but the reasons for those things, not what one does but with what mind they do it.
