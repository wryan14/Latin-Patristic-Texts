        If all the nonsense of John the Presbyter and legate of the Easterners, which he presented in the same synod, in the disapproving readings of which our style revolves, were to be discussed by us individually and collected into one, the forest of such great disputation would be unworthy of great volumes. But we, partly in the interest of brevity, which we entirely pursue, and partly keeping the order of the reading itself, where not each individual separately, but some things here and there in order, as each one spoke or even as they are found in the same book, discussing them in our disputation and being compelled to narrow all things into a brief article of disputation and not separately, but almost all scattered, as order dictated, pursue.

        Meanwhile, it is worthwhile to diligently discuss how, as the same one stated, painters are by no means believed to "contradict the Scriptures" or how "whatever the Scripture says, they demonstrate" or how they are "in agreement with the Scriptures." For although it is not clear from which scriptures he said this, it must be believed that he spoke of the holy Scriptures, which we customarily call <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈskrɪpʧərz">Scriptures</phoneme>, as it is in the gospel: "Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures."
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, the art of painting has grown for this reason: to bring the memory of things truly done to those looking and to promote minds from lies to recalling the truth. Conversely, sometimes it promotes senses to think of lies instead of the truth and not only those things that are or were or can be, but also those that neither are nor were nor can be, it brings to sight. A lie is either about things that are not but can be, or about things that neither are nor can be, about which in the "Perihermenias" the philosophers have a sharp or very subtle disputation, which to insert into this work would be very lengthy.

        For while he says "painters do not contradict the Scriptures," and many things are painted by painters which the divine Scriptures are silent about and are proven to be false by people, not only by the learned but also by the unlearned, who would not admit his statement to be most ridiculous or rather most false? Are they not known to contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict the abyss as having the form of a man and pouring out floods of waters abundantly? Is it not undoubted that they contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict the earth in human form, sometimes dry and barren, sometimes abundant with fruits? Is it not evident that they contradict the divine Scriptures when they depict rivers in human forms or pouring water from buckets, or flowing into each other? Do they not contradict the holy Scriptures in every way when they depict the sun and moon and other ornaments of the sky as having human forms and heads surrounded by rays? Do they not contradict the Scriptures when they attribute individual forms to the twelve winds according to the quality of their strength, or to the individual months according to the quality of the times, giving some naked, some half-naked, some even clothed in various garments, or when they depict the four seasons of the year each in different forms, either flowering with flowers like spring, or burnt with heat or loaded with crops like summer, or burdened with wine presses or grapes like autumn, or sometimes cold with frost, sometimes warming itself with fires, sometimes providing food for animals, sometimes catching withered birds with excessive cold like winter, which are by no means contained in the divine Scriptures?
    </p>
    <p>
        How then are the painters, who often follow the vain fables of poets, not contradicting the holy Scriptures in the least? For they sometimes depict things truly done into other and other incredible tales; they also depict things that neither were done nor could be done, but are either mystically understood by philosophers or vainly worshiped by pagans or truly by Catholics.

            And what does it mean to say, 'Painters do not contradict the Scriptures'?

            As if there couldn't be some things painted by artists that are believed to go against the holy writings. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the holy writings, nothing is faulty, nothing is inappropriate, nothing impure, nothing false, unless perhaps it is something that the holy Scripture recalls some perverse individuals having said or done; in pictures, however, there are many false, many faulty, many inconsistent, many inappropriate, and to sum it up, almost everything, whether possible or impossible, is painted by learned artists.

            By these documents, John the priest and envoy of the Easterners is also proven to have strayed in this part as in the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what the same priest says, 'painters demonstrate whatever Scripture says,' how false and useless this is, the wise reader will note. 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            Can all the commands of the divine law, which were given by the Lord through Moses, like this one: Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one, and other similar ones, in which there is nothing that can be painted, be demonstrated by painters? 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            Can all the words of the prophets, in which teachings, exhortations, reproofs, contemplations, threats, or other similar things are contained, in which it is often found: 'Thus says the Lord' or: 'The Lord has sworn' or similar things, which are written by authors rather than painted by painters, be demonstrated by painting according to its vanity? 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            Can the words of the Lord Himself and the apostles each be demonstrated by painters?
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, painters can somewhat bring back to memory the stories of historical events, but things that are perceived only by the senses and expressed in words can be comprehended and demonstrated by authors and the accounts of others, not by painters. 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            And thus it is absurd to say: 'Painters do not contradict the Scriptures, but demonstrate whatever Scripture says.'
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, what he says: 'They are in agreement with the Scriptures,' how nonsensical and absurd this is can be proven by many indications. 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            For what agreement can they have with the holy Scriptures, since the Scriptures are truthful, while painters often fabricate falsehoods, and it is said of the Scriptures: The words of the Lord are pure words, while painters sometimes create impure and incestuous things, the Scripture always urges honest and wholesome things, while painters often depict dishonorable and shameful things, the Scripture always aims for human salvation, while painters often aim for vanity, the Scripture always encourages heavenly gifts, while painters frequently depict earthly and perishable things? 
            <break time="500ms"/>
            For just as much agreement as there is between that which always relies on truth and that which often follows truth and often falsehood, so there is an agreement between the divine Scriptures, which always hold pure and fixed rules, and painters, who, like mortals, have many changes.
