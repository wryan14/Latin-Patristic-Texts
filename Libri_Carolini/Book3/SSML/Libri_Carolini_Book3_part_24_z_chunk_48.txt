  <p>Just as sacred things—whether consecrated by the lawgiver, by the Mediator between God and men, or by priests daily through the invocation of the divine name and taken into the mystery of our redemption—should not be equated with images, so too the relics of holy martyrs or confessors, which are venerated by the faithful out of love for them, should not be equated with images. Those who burn with zeal for the adoration of these things and strive to equate them with all sacred things and mysteries also insolently and absurdly strive to equate them with the relics of holy martyrs.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when these people strive to honor images or sculptures or carvings or any other objects made by craftsmen, as if they were the bodies or certainly the relics of the bodies of saints, or the clothes or similar things that the saints used while living mortally, they are shown to inflict no small injury upon the saints. Especially since the clothes and similar things of the saints are venerated because they were either on the bodies of the saints or around their bodies and are believed to have received sanctification from them, for which they are venerated, as well as the bodies of the saints or even the relics of their bodies, because although now reduced to dust, they are destined to rise again with glory at the end of the world and to reign perpetually with Christ. Images, however, which they strive in vain to equate with the aforementioned things, cannot be equated with them because they are neither what the bodies of the saints are nor were they in or around their most sacred bodies, but are often made either beautifully or deformedly, sometimes even from impure things, according to the skill and tools of each craftsman.</p>
  <p>Hence, it is clear that those who strive to equate these images with the relics of saints are not slightly mistaken. Therefore, venerating the bodies of saints and showing honor to their relics has not been without reason admitted by tradition.</p>
  <p>For Abraham, the father of nations, a man full of faith, supreme in devotion, outstanding in obedience, and vigorous in the precepts of the Lord, is read to have buried his wife not in any place, but in a field bought with care, and he is read to have been buried by his sons, according to his command, not in any place but in a very beautiful cave, in the inner part of which the first man was buried.</p>
  <p>Isaac, too, born from an aged womb and brought to be offered as a sacrifice to God in the figure of our Redeemer, a man renowned for his holiness and chastity, is believed to have been buried by his sons next to his father according to his own command.</p>
  <p>Jacob, a man of great patience, strengthened by divine oracles and encouraged by frequent promises, when he desired to avoid famine and see his beloved son, whom he thought dead, with his offspring, descended into the Egyptian regions. He did not allow his body to be buried there but ordered that his body be carried to the land promised to him and his fathers to be buried next to the bones of his father and grandfather. Because he was the fourth to be buried in the same cave, in the inner part of which Adam was buried, he named the place Arba, which means four.</p>
  <p>Joseph, who deserved to be called the savior of the world by the gentiles in a typical mystery and shone with wonderful holiness among his brothers, commanded his sons to carry his bones to the promised land; the lawgiver did not delay in doing this because he recognized that it was by no means against the faith.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the body of the holy man who had come from Judah to rebuke the wickedness of the king of Israel in Bethel, when he was killed by a lion because he ate the forbidden food of the city, is read to have been guarded by the same lion. However, the fault of disobedience...</p>


    <p>
        With the cruelty lifted, the wild beast did not dare to touch the holy body of the prophet, whom it had cruelly presumed to kill. The prophet from Bethel, knowing that holy bones should be revered, would never have commanded himself to be buried next to the bones of the holy man, saying: 
        <s>Bury me next to the bones of the prophet.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        The holy man Josiah, named before he was born, destroyer of idols, and diligent observer of his fathers' laws, commanded that the bones of the two prophets be kept untouched when he burned the bones of many people to defile the profane altar, knowing that holy bones should be revered.

        <s>Behold, from these examples, not to mention others, it is shown that the ashes of the saints should be venerated!</s> 
        <s>Let them say where we are ever commanded to worship images.</s> 
        <s>Therefore, to give honor to the bodies of the saints is a great gain of faith, especially since it is believed that they live with Christ in the heavenly seats and that their bones will one day rise again.</s> 
        <s>To give the worship due only to God to images, which are never believed to have lived or to rise again but are destined to be consumed by fire or decay, is either laziness if done carelessly or madness and rather infidelity if stubbornly defended.</s>

        <s>Therefore, we neither deny the relics with Vigilantius and his followers nor worship images with Simon and his accomplices.</s> 
        <s>We give proper respect to relics and the bodies of the saints and decorate the basilicas with images of saints, as well as gold and silver as we see fit, and with God's help, we render the service of worship and reverence due only to Him, to whom alone it is owed.</s>
