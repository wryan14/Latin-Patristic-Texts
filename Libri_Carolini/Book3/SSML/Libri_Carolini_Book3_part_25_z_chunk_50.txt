  <p>It is also common for them to claim that some miracles were performed through certain images, yet neither the Old nor the New Testament supports this. Even if such things were proven to have been seen or heard, we must be cautious. Perhaps they were seen or heard in the twisted paths of the serpent, who, though he is atrocious and shrouded in the darkness of evil, transforms himself into an angel of light and dares to call himself light.</p>

  <p>Indeed, many signs and miracles are performed by fallen angels or their followers, who, being spiritual powers and, so to speak, spiritual evil, impart prophecies to the unfortunate and perform many wonders through their minions. Among these will be those who say: "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name, and do many wonders in your name?" To whom the internal judge will say: "I do not know you."</p>

  <p>As signs often occur by diabolic influence, the blessed Gregory, bishop of the holy Roman Church, said: "Do not, my brothers, love signs that can be common with the reprobate." The most holy Augustine also testified that demons perform miracles similar to those done by the holy servants of God. He said: "One should not be moved, for magical arts often produce miracles similar to those performed by the holy servants of God." As it is written in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme>, Pharaoh's magicians did some things similarly to what Moses did. Therefore, these should not be marveled at, because all visible things can also be believed to be done by the lower powers of this air. But the difference is that when saints perform such things, it is commanded in the name of God, the Lord of all things, to the lower creatures from higher powers. When evil men work through magical arts, similar things are given into their hands when they are answered by demons. They are worthy of such deception, so that what seems to be a benefit becomes a punishment for them, as lower powers privately show them certain miracles, to have them subdued, yet this is allowed by divine permission, as each soul is awarded according to its merits.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the signs and miracles they claim appeared in images, if they did not occur—as no authentic history records this—are lies, and those who serve the truth should not use lies, because, as Truth itself says, no one can serve two masters. If they appeared and were shown through some fantastic illusions to deceive minds, it is extremely dangerous, lest the ancient enemy, through his cunning, fraudulently persuades to commit unlawful acts while showing some wonders. If the signs truly appeared, which no certain writings prove, and their claim does not fall under the sentence of lying nor the fraudulent machinations of the enemy according to the above examples, but are proven to be done by God's operation, to whom all things are possible and nothing is impossible, it must be highly noted that although many amazing things have been done by God's will through certain creatures or in certain creatures, not all things through which or in which these were done are to be worshiped. Indeed, God showed many signs to mortals through some visible and tangible things to soften the hardness of visible and mortal men through visible things, not to establish the worship of certain things, as He alone commands to be worshiped and honored.</p>

  <p>Should the bush be worshiped because the Lord spoke to Moses from the burning bush? No, He appeared in the bush not to designate the material of the bush for worship, but to demonstrate through its thorns the sins for which the law came.</p>


    <p>
        Because the bush does not have a root armed with thorns, when it becomes dense with thorns at the top, it clearly shows that sins are not from nature. The bush was not burned by fire to indicate that sins are not to be destroyed by the law but only revealed. The law only shows sins, but grace, which is given through Christ, heals the sins that the law had shown.

        Since the Lord appeared in the fire, it does not mean that fire should be worshipped, but He wanted to appear in that nature which always strives to ascend to higher places. Because He chose to appear on the mountain, it is not believed that He established the worship of mountains, but it was reasonable that the King of Heaven appeared in that place which always desires high places, and not in a low but in a high place, to show that He is the Most High and to clearly indicate that His followers will ascend to high places.

        Is it because the lawgiver escaped the wrath of the terrible judge and the destruction of death by circumcision with a very sharp stone that stones must be worshipped? The lawgiver rightly saw an angel so hostile to him because, living in the land of Midian, he neglected to circumcise his son, and the messenger of the God of Abraham did not bear the sign of the faith of Abraham in his son, in which he knew the Jews boasted. He is not circumcised with a stone so that the worship of stones is established by this act, but to show that through Christ, who is the cornerstone, sins must be cut off, and the dangers of death must be avoided.

        Is it because the staff was turned into a serpent so many times and then returned to the firmness of a staff, symbolizing Christ going from life to death and back to life, or because the same staff, which we said carried the figure of Christ, divided the waters of the Red Sea, representing baptism, and provided a path to the promised land, that is, the heavenly kingdom, for the people of God, that staffs must be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it because the bitter waters were made sweet by a piece of wood, which rightly symbolizes the law being sweetened by the wood of Christ and the spiritual sweetness satisfying the minds of the people, that wood must be worshipped? Is it because the sight of the bronze serpent, which prefigured the death of Christ on the wood, saved the people from the bites of serpents, that is, from the deadly persuasions of unclean spirits, that bronze or serpents must be worshipped?

        Is it because the struck rock produced streams of water in the scorched fields and freed the thirsty people from their drought, which undoubtedly bore the figure of Christ, who is the rock cut from the mountain without hands, who quenches the thirst of unbelief from the minds of the faithful with the streams of gospel preaching, who daily calls out: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink," that stones or waters are believed to be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it because Aaron's staff, which symbolizes the birth of the Blessed Virgin, flourished and produced almonds, without human intervention, following the natural law, that staffs must be worshipped?

        Is it because the dry fleece became wet and the wet fleece became dry at the request of the holy Gideon, by which miracle it is clear that the entire world of the Gentiles was signified by the heavenly dew, and only the fleece of the Israelite race was wet with the divine word, and later, due to the guilt of their unbelief, the same people were signified as dry by their infidelity, and the world of the Gentiles soaked with the dew of holy faith, that either the area or fleeces must be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it because Samson slew a thousand men with the jawbone of a donkey and, after removing a molar from the same jawbone, was satisfied with streams of water, carrying the symbol of our Mediator, who, by His death, conquered the powers of the air and watered the dry hearts of the faithful, who are indeed His members, with spiritual streams, that jawbones or molars must be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it because Elijah, with his cloak, which symbolized the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, with which he crossed the Jordan, representing baptism, is said to have divided the Jordan, that cloaks must be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
        Is it because Naaman the Syrian was cleansed of leprosy in the river, representing the Gentiles being cleansed from the contamination of idols by the baptism of Christ, that rivers must be worshipped?

    What about the fact that the coming of the Holy Spirit to the holy man Elisha was delayed until a musician was brought to him? 
    When the musician was brought, the Holy Spirit poured himself into Elisha's heart. 
    This symbolizes the Jewish people, who do not receive the coming of the Holy Spirit because they do not accept the incarnation of the Redeemer in faith. 
    But as soon as they realize this towards the end of the world, they will be adorned with the breath of the Holy Spirit and the gifts of all the charisms. 
    Does this mean the musician should be worshipped?
  </p>
  <p>
    Is it because the edge of the Lord's garment, which healed the woman upon touch and represents faith in the Lord's incarnation, through which the Gentiles were healed, should be worshipped? 
    Or because the sick were healed by Peter's shadow, should the shadow be worshipped?
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, as we mentioned before, not all things through which or in which miracles were shown by God's order are believed to be worshipped. 
    If these things, in which miracles appeared, are not to be worshipped, then much less should images be believed to be worshipped, especially since no authentic scripture shows that miracles appeared through or in them.
