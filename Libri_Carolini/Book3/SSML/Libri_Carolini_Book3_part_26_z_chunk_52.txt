    <p>While in that same book of vanity, which they fervently consider under the title of the Seventh Council, almost everything seems to be similar to the imaginations of dreams and certain fanciful shadows. There is almost nothing there that does not either reflect the emptiness of dreams or the dullness of some other delirium. Everything tasted by the inner palate returns a flavor that is bland and insipid. Theodorus, bishop of Miri, is read to have particularly recounted the dreams of his archdeacon there, in order to support an error which he could not uphold by the authority of the Holy Scriptures or by any teachings or examples of the holy fathers. At least he managed to support it with the delusions of dreams, and not unjustly showing a support worthy and almost equal to such a frivolous and senseless matter to be established.</p>


    <p>Although the use of dreams ought neither to be entirely approved, because they are often exhibited by the deceptions of demons, nor entirely disapproved, because sometimes certain mysteries are revealed through them, they are never found suitable for establishing doubtful matters and affirming those things that come into contention. For who can ever affirm a doubtful matter by his own dream, since whether he saw it in the way he claims to have seen it, he can prove by no witness's testimony? Therefore, for confirming a doubtful matter and one that comes into question, neither the deceptive vanity of dreams, nor the most impudent prolixity of apocryphal writings, nor the falsehood of trivial and useless words are to be sought, but the authentic authority of the divine books or the catholic fathers.</p>


    <p>For just as useful things and those adorned with the secrets of mysteries, when indicated by dreams, are revealed by angels, so conversely, when harmful things and those lacking any usefulness are demonstrated by dreams, they are believed to be shown by demons. Hence, if the dream which he recounted at the council was shown by an angel to his archdeacon to support the worship of images, it is beneficial to worship images; and if it is beneficial to worship images, it is beneficial to worship other things devoid of sense. But it is harmful to worship things devoid of sense. Therefore, the dream which his archdeacon recounted to support the worship of images was not shown by an angel.</p>


    <p>It is clearly and plainly evident that since it was not shown by an angel, it was introduced by the instigating spirit, who always urges vanities and harmful matters. To make this clearer, it must be confirmed by reasonable argument. Since, if the instigating spirit did not introduce it to him, the angel must undoubtedly be believed to have introduced it; and if the angel must be believed to have introduced it, the angels would be showing consent to prohibited matters. But angels do not show consent to prohibited or harmful matters or those opposed to divine instructions. Thus, the instigating spirit must be believed to have introduced it to him.</p>


    <p>Therefore, since it has been proven that it was not exhibited to him by a holy angel, because spirits continuously remaining in the praise of their Creator and completely free from sin utterly reject impure matters and those prone to sins, it remains that either he confesses that it was exhibited to him by the deception of a most wicked spirit or he testifies that he was entirely lying, which is not fitting for servants of God. For every Catholic must resist unclean spirits, as the apostle says: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒeɪmz">James</phoneme> 4:7, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you"; and lying must be spurned, as Scripture says: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="prəˈvɜrbz">Proverbs</phoneme> 13:5, "Do not tell lies, for all lying is not good." Meanwhile, according to the apostle's judgment, spirits must be tested whether they are from God, and according to the voice of Truth they are known by their fruits. Hence, from its fruit, by which it aims to support the worship of images, it is most evidently perceived that the spirit who introduced it is not from God.</p>


    <p>But lest we seem to declare this solely by our own arguments, let us turn to the divine Scriptures! Let us ask the lawgiver! Let him say whether dreams are to be accepted at all? Let him say how we ought to deal with dreamers! Say, I pray, holy Moses, say most gentle of men, say!</p>

      A noble man and diligent "inspector of the secrets of God, speak, you most kind and faithful interpreter of the ineffable God, who, receiving the law on the mountain, brought down a face glorified, intolerable to the sinful people. <break time="500ms"/> 
      Just as the law you carried was opposed to sin, so too your face was terrifying to those who saw it. Speak, noble man, who, bearing the type of the true Redeemer, stood as a mediator between God and men! <break time="500ms"/> 
      Give a command: are all dreams to be believed? Tell us, should any illusions be given consent?

      If a prophet or a dreamer arises among you, who says he has seen a dream and predicts some sign or portent, and it comes to pass, and he says to you: Come, let us follow other gods whom you do not know, you shall not heed the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold, by the authority of the lawgiver, we are taught that the words of dreamers, although they may come true, should not be heeded. Let Wisdom now say what it thinks about dreams! For it says: Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities and countless words. But fear God. For it is believed that dreams disturbed the Egyptians, as Scripture says: For the dreams that troubled them showed this, that they might not be ignorant of why they suffered evils. It is clear from the authorities of divine law that dreams and auguries are vain, and the more one fears them, the more his heart is deceived.

      Therefore, we thought it should be condemned in every way that the aforementioned bishop, who should have fought against dreamers and other nonsense with the arms of divine law, brought up the dreams of his archdeacon to the synod to support something useless. These should be considered of little importance not only in the oracles of divine law but also in the writings of the pagans. For the philosopher Cato says: Do not care for dreams, for the human mind wishes for these things. When you are awake, you hope; in a dream, you see the same thing.

      For if anyone should perhaps be angry with us for inserting the words of pagans into our work, let him first read the books of the most blessed and learned men, Jerome and Augustine, and soon he will find that not only the words of philosophers but also of pagan poets are found in their works. He will recognize that we have them as our teachers and authors, whose footsteps we follow, with whom we neither refuse to be blamed nor are ashamed to be reproached. For, to go further back, even the chosen vessel inserted some words of the pagans into his works, as in: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.

      Furthermore, when we discuss the observations or rather the vanities of dreams, we do not testify that their use should be entirely rejected, since certain sacred mysteries were shown to the patriarchs and prophets in dreams or rather in visions. <break time="500ms"/> 
      The three wise men were warned in a dream not to return to the violent tyrant, so they took another path and returned to their own country. And it is read that an angel appeared to the holy man Joseph in a dream and showed him the secrets of mysteries that had been announced by prophets many ages before. 
      <break time="500ms"/> 
      Therefore, lest anyone presumptuously seeks the use of dreams, follows, believes, or recites them in assemblies or, like Theodore, affirms things that come into contention, it is, as we mentioned a little earlier, forbidden by the holy Scriptures. We also read that certain secrets were shown to infidels and profane kings in dreams, which were not revealed to them by any prerogatives of their own merits, but so that holy men, who showed them these things by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, might be exalted in honor and be able to benefit their fellow captives.

      Although therefore visions and dreams are customarily spoken of together, certain people say there is a difference between visions and dreams: dreams are often false - they sometimes come from revelation, but many times from thoughts, temptations, or similar things; visions, on the other hand, are said to be...
    </p>
  <p>There are more truthful revelations, of which there are three kinds: bodily, spiritual, and intellectual.</p>
    <p>Bodily revelation happens through the body. Spiritual revelation occurs when we store images of what we see in our memory. Intellectual revelation is when we discern through our intellect what we see physically and store in our memory as images. With our intellect, we discern that one thing is a body and another is a likeness of a body.</p>
    <p>Animals, livestock, and birds do not have this intellect at all. They see through their bodies, and their spirits are informed by the images of what they see. Thus, livestock recognize their feeding troughs, and birds return to their nests. But they neither understand themselves nor what they see with their eyes.</p>
    <p>Finally, this bodily vision cannot exist without the spiritual one. Therefore, when we turn our eyes away from what we have seen, we retain the images of what we do not see in our memory. Spiritual vision, however, cannot exist without bodily vision. Hence, we remember absent people and see in our minds what we do not see in the dark.</p>
    <p>Intellectual vision, on the other hand, does not need either bodily or spiritual vision. Through intellect, we do not see a body or an image of a body. Through it, we see justice, love, God Himself, and the mind of a human, which has no body and no solidity of a body.</p>
    <p>Since there are so many different kinds of dreams and visions coming from various sources, we must carefully consider that when someone recognizes they have seen something in a dream, they should not immediately hold it firmly and present it in council as an authoritative source for deliberating on uncertain matters. Otherwise, while trying to support vanity with vanities, they might, heaven forbid, fall into vanity themselves.</p>
