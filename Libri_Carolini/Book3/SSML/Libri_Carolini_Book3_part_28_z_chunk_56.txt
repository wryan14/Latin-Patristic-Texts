    <p>This is also an extremely insane and completely unguarded statement when they say: <s>"Anyone who fears God absolutely honors, worships, or venerates the Son of God, the sign of His cross, and the image of His saints."</s></p>

    <p>How different is the mystery of the Lordâ€™s cross, which the Apostle teaches us to understand with revealed eyes to comprehend the height, length, breadth, and depth of Christ's cross. This has been shown in the earlier parts of this work with the Lord's help. And how different is the worship and devotion due only to God from the worship and devotion they claim should be shown to images. In this third book, we have discussed this while examining the words of Constantine, Bishop of Constantinople, and Euthymius, Bishop of Sardis, as the Lord has granted us assistance. Now, with the Lord's help, let us briefly discuss how the fear of the Lord differs from the worship of images.</p>

    <p>They say: <s>"Anyone who fears God completely worships images as the Son of God."</s> But do all the patriarchs and prophets, because they rejected the worship of images, therefore are believed not to have feared God? Or should we say that the Apostles, because they are never recorded as having celebrated the worship of images, did not have the fear of God? Or the holy martyrs, hermits, or the entire multitude of ecclesiastical men, who are known to have served God most devotedly, are believed not to have had the fear of the Lord because they are never recorded as having celebrated or proved the worship of images?</p>

    <p>The most holy prophet David did not say he would teach the worship of images but the fear of God when he called all believers to come to him with gentle exhortations, saying: <s>"Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord."</s> He did not testify to the worship of images but to the holy fear of the Lord, saying: <s>"The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever."</s> He did not call blessed anyone who worships images but the one who fears God, saying: <s>"Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who greatly delights in His commandments."</s> And again: <s>"Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in His ways."</s> He did not say absurdly, as those people do, <s>"Anyone who fears the Lord worships images,"</s> but he said: <s>"Anyone who fears the Lord greatly delights in His commandments."</s></p>

    <p>Hence, it is very clear that the fear of the Lord is not in the worship of images but in the will and earnestness of God's commandments. The holy man did not testify that the eyes of the Lord are upon those who worship images, but upon those who fear Him, saying: <s>"Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy."</s> Nor did he say: <s>"Worship images, for nothing is lacking for those who worship them,"</s> but he said: <s>"Fear the Lord, you His saints, for there is nothing lacking for those who fear Him."</s> Neither did he testify that the beginning of wisdom is the worship of images, but the fear of the Lord, saying: <s>"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."</s> This commandment of the fear of the Lord is thus instituted through Moses: <s>"Follow the Lord your God, fear Him, keep His commandments, listen to His voice, and serve Him."</s> Among these salutary precepts, the worship of images is nowhere instituted. Since the worship of images is found to be forbidden in divine scriptures, it is in no way comparable to the fear of the Lord, which is commended by so many divine law oracles.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the flowers by which the fear of the Lord is commanded, which we have diligently gathered from the vast fields of divine law, are set out in order, so that we may briefly arrange them, both to soothe the reader's mind and to compel anyone trying to equate the worship of senseless things with the fear of the Lord to be filled with shame and reverence. For it is said in Proverbs: <s>"The fear of the Lord adds days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened."</s> Also in Proverbs: <s>"The fear of the Lord is a strong tower; the destruction is for those who do evil."</s> Also in Proverbs: <s>"The fear of the Lord leads to life; those who lack it will remain without it."</s></p>

    <p>
        This fear, therefore, which these testimonies indicate is not the adoration of images, but the increase of good works, should be held by the faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also another fear, about which it is said: Perfect love casts out fear, because this fear drives a person to all exercises of good works, but the other, which love casts out, neither tolerates vigils or fasts nor suffers venerable martyrdoms for the name of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as there are two types of temptations, one by which one is deceived - hence it is said: God tempts no one, but He Himself is not tempted by evil - another by which one is tested by divine examination - hence it is said: The Lord your God tests you, or: God tested Abraham, in the same way, many things are found in the Holy Scriptures by diligent investigation - so indeed there are two fears, one which love casts out, and another, which is the beginning of good works, which love nourishes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For if the beginning of the fear of the Lord is to worship images, as they babble, it follows that all the saints, who are believed to have feared God, worshiped images, and if all the saints, who are truly believed to have feared God, worshiped images, it follows that they acted contrary to the commands of the Creator, who forbade the worship of creatures and established that He alone should be worshiped.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, they are not to be believed to have acted contrary to the commands of the Creator by worshiping creatures. Therefore, the beginning of the fear of the Lord, as they babble, is not to worship images. By this proof, it is shown that the beginning of the fear of the Lord is not in the worship of senseless things but in the observance of the Lord's commandments.
    </p>
    <p>
        For he truly fears God, who, despising all vanities, shows by faith and works that he will serve Him alone.
