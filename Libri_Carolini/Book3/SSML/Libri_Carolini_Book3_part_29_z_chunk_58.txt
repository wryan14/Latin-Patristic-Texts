            Regarding what is generally said or agreed upon by all, that the image of the Savior or any of the saints should be venerated in the same way as the imperial images sent to cities, which are met by crowds with candles and incense, it has already been discussed.
        </s>
        <s>
            It has been approved by the words of the blessed Jerome that the images of judges and emperors, from which they try to take examples, should not be venerated.

            Now, however, the specific words of John must be discussed, as he is found to have spoken more frequently and more foolishly than others in this matter.
        </s>
        <s>
            Although he follows the general error of all, he tries to add something special to this error.
        </s>
        <s>
            I believe he has tried to associate his own nonsense with general nonsense because he thought the vanities of everyone else were insufficient to accumulate to such a great error.

        <s>
            As if God were local like the emperor, and while He is in one place, He cannot be in another.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, he tries to establish that God's image should be venerated like the emperor's image, which is completely against all reason.
        </s>

        <s>
            For God is never absent.
        </s>
        <s>
            If He is absent anywhere, He is local.
        </s>
        <s>
            If He is local, He neither contains nor fills all things.
        </s>
        <s>
            But He both contains and fills all things.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, He is never absent.
        </s>
        <s>
            Since this is the case, He should not be venerated or sought in material images, but always kept in the purest heart.
        </s>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <s>
            For while it is perverse to venerate the image of the emperor, it is profane to liken the image of the emperor, who is local, to the image of God, who is not local.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is undoubtedly profane and perverse for someone to try to corroborate an illicit thing by another illicit thing, and by the steps of errors, as if by certain gradations, while having neither the moderation of mind nor tongue, alas! he weakly runs to worse things.
        </s>

    <p>
        <s>
            As for his statement: "Christ's image should be honored like the emperor's image, as the Father thought," it should be questioned where, when, why, or how the Father thought this, or what he meant by "thought."
        </s>
        <s>
            Was it when it was ordered by someone else or done by others that the Father thought so?
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, since we do not discuss their errors in words, which would be immense and difficult to accomplish, especially since almost none of the words there provide meaning to the reader, but only criticize their sense or judgments, it remains that we should not consider what they say—especially since, as said, it has almost no sense—but what they mean to say.
        </s>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <s>
            His statement: "the image of Christ should be honored as the Father thought of the emperor," he means to say that the Father ordered the image of Christ to be venerated just like the emperor.
        </s>
        <s>
            But where, when, why, or how this happened is completely unknown to any Catholic.
        </s>
        <s>
            For the Father did not order to honor His image, but to honor and listen to Him when the Holy Trinity, in the unity of substance, appeared at the waters of Jordan: the Father in the voice, which thundered, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, listen to Him," the Son in the body, and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.
        </s>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <s>
            Even if the Father ordered the image of Christ to be honored like the emperor, would it not be more appropriate to decide that the emperor should be honored like the image of Christ, so that the image of Christ holds a more eminent place in such a matter?
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, the Father is not read to have ordered anywhere to depict, venerate, or honor the image of Christ, as He has instituted that He alone should be worshiped and served.
        </s>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <s>
            Since emperors and kings are to be honored by their subjects, this can be approved by some examples from the Divine Scripture.
        </s>
        <s>
            For if they were not to be honored, the holy man David would not have called Saul, after God had departed from him, "the anointed one.”
        </s>
    </p>


    <p>
        "Lord," he was called.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the aforementioned man was not unaware that divine dispensation is involved in the office of royal order; therefore, he honored Saul, who was still in the same position of dignity, lest he be seen as doing injury to God, who decreed that honor is to be given to these orders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As long as he is in that dignity, he is to be honored, if not for his own sake, then for the sake of the "order." Hence, the Apostle also says: Be subject to all higher powers. For there is no power except from God; and in another place: Fear God, honor the king.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, a more extensive discussion could arise from this reasoning, but because some of it has already been discussed in the earlier parts of this work, we must now move on to other matters, leaving these aside.
