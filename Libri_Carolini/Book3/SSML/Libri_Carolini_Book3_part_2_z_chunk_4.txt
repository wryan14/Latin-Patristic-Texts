  <p>After moving from one ailment to another, suddenly going from a layman to a bishop, he tried to fix the mistake of his abrupt consecration by promoting image worship.</p>
  <p>The old method of experienced doctors is to treat one ailment with frequent medications without causing another issue. Just as some treatments might weaken one area but strengthen another, spiritual caretakers should remove some vices without allowing others to grow.</p>
  <p>The pestilent growth of some vices can occur when others are abolished, harming the field of the mind by promoting some vices while trying to remove others.</p>
  <p>Tarasius attempted this flawed approach, using a forbidden and ineffective remedy to fix another forbidden and obstructive issue. It's like trying to clean mud with more muddy water; the more you try to clean, the more you spread the impurity.</p>
  <p>Similarly, Tarasius, suddenly promoted from layman to bishop, tried to correct his sudden consecration with the unlawful act of image worship, thus compounding his errors.</p>
  <p>If inappropriate image worship could stabilize an inappropriate ordination, illicit things could easily be reinforced by other illicit things, and impurities could be cleansed with other impurities. But impurities cannot be cleansed with impurities.</p>
  <p>Therefore, inappropriate ordination cannot be stabilized by inappropriate worship of images. If the ecclesiastical regulation handed down by the holy fathers is to be kept inviolate, it must not be corrupted. If it should not be corrupted for some useful reason, much less should it be corrupted for an unhelpful reason since both worshipping images and assuming the pontifical chair without proper order are useless.</p>
  <p>Why discuss this? Let us turn to the Apostle and the chosen vessel. Let us ask the distinguished preacher! He would undoubtedly answer: "Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands." And again: "He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil."</p>
  <p>This means that thinking he has gained not a ministry of humility but a secular power, he might fall into the devil's condemnation through pride. Such an ordination is perilous, and his teaching to worship images is most fearsome, given the danger of setting such a terrible example.</p>
  <p>It is forbidden for a layman to fulfill the priesthood's teaching role without having known its duties or discipline and teaching things he has not learned before.</p>
  <p>Regarding such ordination, here is the opinion of the blessed Gregory, bishop of Rome: "Some, driven by the desire for honor, after the death of bishops, are suddenly tonsured and become priests from laymen, disrespectfully seizing the religious office even though they have not yet learned to be soldiers.</p>
  <p>What can we expect these people to offer their subjects, considering they fear the position of teacher before even reaching the threshold of discipleship?</p>
  <p>Therefore, even if someone has blameless merit, they must still practice ecclesiastical duties through distinct orders, observe what to imitate, and learn what to teach."</p>



    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="æ">"a lamp placed on a lampstand shines,"</phoneme> so that those who observe the flame of faith do not extinguish it, but increase it. For it is written: <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɝst">"First let him be tested, and then let him serve,"</phoneme> much more must he be tested before being taken as an intercessor for the people, lest bad priests become the cause of the people's downfall. 

        Therefore, there can be no excuse, no defense, because it is clearly known to all what diligence the holy and outstanding teacher shows in this matter, to prevent a novice from advancing to sacred orders. Just as at that time a novice was called someone who had newly planted conversations of faith, so now a novice must be considered someone who, suddenly, having taken on the garb of religion, stealthily seeks to attain sacred honors. 

        Therefore, one must advance from order to order. He does not rightly seek a sacred rank who, bypassing steps, tries to ascend to the highest peaks abruptly. The same Apostle teaches, among other things, that the hands of sacred order should not be laid on anyone hastily. What is quicker or more hasty than to begin from the summit, to become a bishop before being a teacher? 

        Against this norm of ecclesiastical institution, when the aforementioned Tarasius, as they say, ascended to the priestly summit, he is known to have disturbed rather than governed the people. It is no wonder if he does not preach correctly, who did not come to the office of preaching correctly. Concerning his disorderly consecration, many testimonies of the holy fathers could be presented, but they have been omitted for the sake of brevity. This much shall suffice to have been stated on this matter.
