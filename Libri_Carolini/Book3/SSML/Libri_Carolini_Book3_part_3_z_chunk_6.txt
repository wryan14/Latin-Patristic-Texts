      Our memories have not at all forgotten what we promised at the beginning of this workâ€”that we would leave nothing undiscussed and nothing passed over in silence that is found worthy of criticism in the same council held for the veneration of images.

      Therefore, it does not follow that our discussion should be suspended from this point on what Tarasius professes in his reading of faith.
    </s>
    <s>
      He confesses that the Holy Spirit proceeds not from the Father and the Son as the universal Church confesses and believes, nor from the Father alone as some believe who, although they have not explicitly denied that the Spirit proceeds from the Son, have altogether believed it proceeds from the Father and the Son.
    </s>
    <s>
      Instead, he professes that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son.
    </s>
    <s>
      In this profession, unless there is purity and sincerity of heart that believes the Spirit is not a creature but the Creator, and not lesser than the Father and the Son but equal to them and consubstantial with them, and proceeds from both, a harmful virus can arise.

      Therefore, the definition of all things must be such that, with all obscurities or ambiguities removed, it tends to demonstrate the indication of the matter rightly and clearly.

      If the definition of other things must be so clear and evident that it demonstrates what needs to be shown, then much more so must the definition of faith be clear and evident, without any ambiguity or tortuosity.

      If anything in it is twisted, ambiguous, or obscured by a certain cloud of words, it brings great loss to the speaker or listener.

  <p>
    <s>
      For it is rightly believed and commonly confessed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, not from the Father through the Son, because He does not proceed through the Son as a creature made through Him, nor as later in time or lesser in power or of another substance.
    </s>
    <s>
      Instead, He is believed to proceed from the Father and the Son as co-eternal, consubstantial, co-equal, and existing with them in one glory, power, and divinity.

    <s>
      The preposition "from" has a different force than "through."
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence, the Son of God is believed to be born from a human, not through a human, that is, not through intercourse or human operation, but born from a virgin by assuming flesh.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, it can be questioned whether it is rightly said that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father "through the Son," lest, while this preposition "through" is incautiously placed in the profession of such a great mystery, it serves someone the poisonous cup of the Arian error, which blasphemes that the Holy Spirit is a creature and created through the Son just as other created things are, and also imparts the unhappy belief to those turning to them that their baptism is not according to the evangelical faith in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but "in the name of the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit."

      The Holy Spirit is shown to be of such great power and virtue that, with His cooperation, the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is our redemption, was formed in the womb of the Virgin, as the evangelist says: "Do not be afraid, Joseph, to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 1:20).

    From the Father and the Son, the same Holy Spirit cooperates and is believed to be of the same power with them, as the Lord affirms: 
    <s>
      "Go," He says to the disciples, "baptize all nations in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as the Lord sent the apostles to preach, the Holy Spirit is also declared to act in the same way.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is written in the Acts of the Apostles that while Peter was pondering the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, 
    <s>
      "Look, men are looking for you; rise and go down without hesitation, for I have sent them to you."
    </s>
    <s>
      And again, "Set apart for me Paul and Barnabas for the work to which I have called them."

    <s>
      And again, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers."

    For He, along with the Father and the Son, as shown, created everything, and is proven to be God of the same essence with them by these testimonies. 
    <s>
      David says, "I will hear what God the Lord will speak in me."
    </s>
    Thus, it is clearer than light that all prophets announce or speak through the Holy Spirit, as the Lord testifies, saying, 
    <s>
      "When the Holy Spirit comes, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you and announce to you what is to come."
    </s>
    <s>
      Likewise, through the prophet, the Lord says, "They were not willing to hear my words, which I commanded in my Spirit through the prophets before, says the Lord."

  <p>
    Paul the apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, 
    <s>

    In the Acts of the Apostles, we also read that to Ananias, the pastor of the church, it was said, 
    <s>
      "Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?"

    <s>
      And showing that He is God, it says subsequently, "You have not lied to men but to God."

    Paul, the chosen vessel, writes to the Corinthians, 
    <s>
      "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are different kinds of service, but the same Lord; there are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men."
    </s>
    <s>
      By these apostolic words, the Holy Spirit is declared to be the same God, the same Lord.
    </s>
    <s>
      The same Lord says in the Gospel, "God is Spirit."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, Paul writes to the Corinthians, 
    <s>
      "The Lord is the Spirit," and to the Ephesians, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."
    </s>
    <s>
      He also says to the Corinthians, "Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, whom you have received from God?"
    </s>
    <s>
      And showing that God dwells in human bodies, he adds and says, "So glorify and carry God in your bodies."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since by these testimonies, He is approved as both Creator and God and is believed by the whole Catholic Church to proceed from the Father and the Son, it must be asked whether it is necessary to profess that He proceeds from the Father through the Son, or rather from the Father and the Son, since such a profession is not found in the Nicene or Chalcedonian Creed made by the holy fathers. 
    <s>
      For He appeared over the apostles in fire through the Son, given to men through the Son, because the Holy Spirit could not be received by men except through the Son.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, professing that He proceeds from the Father through the Son is unusual in synodal confession, since the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father, does not need another's assistance to proceed through anyone, as He is indeed the third person in the same Holy Trinity and of the same power and essence with the Father and the Son.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    For, being God to Himself, He is relative to us as a gift, distributing gifts of grace to each as He wills. 
    <s>
      For He also grants prophecies to whom He wills and distributes tongues to whom He wills, which cannot be given without Him.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence, He is properly called love, as He naturally proceeds from those whom He represents and shows Himself to be of the same essence with them, or because He acts in us so that we are in God and He in us.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, among the gifts of God, there is nothing greater than love, and there is no greater gift of God than the Holy Spirit. 
    <s>
      He is also grace, which, because it is given freely by divine will and not by our merits, is thus called grace.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as the only Word of God is properly called wisdom, because He is universally and the Holy Spirit of the Father is wisdom, so the Holy Spirit is properly called by the name of love, as He is.
    </s>
  </p>


    <p>
        Three times the Son is universally love, for he is the Spirit of the Father, as the Lord testifies, who says: 
        <s>"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        He is also the Spirit of the Son, as Paul testifies, who says: 
        <s>"But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him."</s>
        And so, he is called the Spirit of both, because proceeding from the Father and the Son, he is proved to be of one substance and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        If he were said to be unbegotten, there would be two Fathers; if begotten, there would be two Sons inappropriately spoken of. But since he is neither Father nor Son, he is neither unbegotten nor begotten, but is said to proceed from both.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Father alone is not from another, therefore he alone is called unbegotten, not indeed in the Scriptures, but in the custom of those disputing and speaking about such a great matter, as they were able, for the benefit of those present or future. The Son alone is born of the Father, therefore he alone is called begotten. The Holy Spirit alone proceeds from the Father and the Son, therefore he alone is called the Spirit of both.
    </p>
    <p>
        He proceeds from both, not by being born, so as to be called someone's son. He would be called the Son of the Father and the Son if, which is abhorrent to the feelings of all faithful, both had begotten him; therefore, he is not born of both, but proceeds from both as the Spirit of both.
    </p>
    <p>
        But our Lord Jesus Christ taught the disciples that he proceeds from the Father, saying: 
        <s>"But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me."</s>
        And again, the same Mediator of God and men, our Lord Jesus Christ, after his resurrection, to show that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him as well as from the Father, breathed on his disciples and said: 
        <s>"Receive the Holy Spirit."</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        If he did not proceed from him, he would not have given him to the disciples by breathing on them. Therefore, there is one Spirit of the Father and the Son, one, as we have mentioned before, the Spirit of both.
    </p>
    <p>
        If anyone asks how the Son is born from the Father, but the Holy Spirit proceeds without being born, or why both are not called sons, since both proceed from the Father, or why the Holy Spirit is not called unbegotten like the Father, or how he proceeds from both, or why the Son says: 
        <s>"As the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,"</s>
        as if the Son existed without life before and received it from the Father, or how the Father was never without the Son and yet the Father begot the Son, or how the Son was never without the Spirit and yet says: 
        <s>"Unless I go away, the Helper will not come to you,"</s>
        or how the Son is not of himself but of the Father, and yet is not later than he from whom he is, or how the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and yet is not preceded by those from whom he proceeds, let him know that these and similar questions are inscrutable and incomprehensible to human frailty.
    </p>
    <p>
        For who can consider these things? Who can comprehend them? If we do not grasp the secrets of Christ's human birth, how can we grasp the mysteries of his divine nature? But because in that coeternal, equal, incorporeal, ineffably immutable, and inseparable Trinity, it is extremely difficult to distinguish generation from procession, let it suffice to believe this, hold this firmly, and confess with all our heart that the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten, and the Holy Spirit neither created nor begotten, but proceeding from the Father and the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just so, that in the confession of faith all opinions, all novelties of words are avoided, and the confession of believers is strengthened by these words and sentences which the holy and universal synods have established in the creed.
