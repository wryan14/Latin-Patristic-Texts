    It is also said that Tarasius, in his profession of faith, called the Holy Spirit "a fellow tribe member to the Father and the Son." This statement is utterly absurd and must be thoroughly rejected from the confession of the Catholic faith, not only by those who are well-versed in literary scholarship but also by those who use common letters. It is entirely rejected and repudiated in every way.

    It is easy to understand that just as "consanguineous" means those who are of the same blood, "consorts" means those who share the same lot, and "coetaneous" means those who are of the same age, who are also called "contemporaries," and "conform" means those who are of the same form, so "fellow tribe members" means those who are from the same tribe. Because this linguistic preposition holds this force, wherever it is placed in the composition of words, it demonstrates that different things are linked together. As in this composition, when we call two or more people "fellow tribe members," we clearly show that they are from the same tribe. For a "tribe" is a multitude of people who either derive their lineage from one stock, as the twelve tribes are known to have come from Jacob, or serve one office, as in the beginning of the city of Rome, the Roman people were divided into three orders by the founder of the city: namely, senators, soldiers, or common people. Hence, the etymology of this name is still preserved, and those who lead them are called "tribunes."

    However, in God, who is the highest good, a singular peak of all things, one in substance, three in persons, the name "fellow tribe member" cannot be found, because a fellow tribe member can only be found where a tribe is found.

    The Holy Spirit is not a fellow tribe member to the Father and the Son, but consubstantial with them. If He were a fellow tribe member, He would only be joined to them by some sort of tribal or familial association—which is profane to say. If He were only joined by some tribal or familial association—which is not only absurd to believe but also impious—He would not be consubstantial. But He is consubstantial with the Father and the Son; therefore, He is not to be believed or called their fellow tribe member. In the confession of such a great mystery, it would have been sufficient to say that the Holy Spirit is coessential, coeternal, coequal to the Father and the Son, of one power and glory, so that in three persons the unity of substance, power, and glory of the supreme God is believed and confessed by Catholics, who is blessed above all things forever.

    Therefore, whoever thinks this name should be rightly used in the Holy Trinity and attempts to support it with assertions should read the thirteen books of the blessed Hilary and the fifteen books of the most holy Augustine, which discuss the sacred and ineffable Trinity with great subtlety and powerfully proclaim it. When he does not find this name applied to the Holy Trinity in these works, he should not presume to apply it himself, because if it were at all suitable to the confession of the holy faith, it could not escape the dense thickets of so many discussions, nor would it be foreign to such eloquent and learned men skilled in Latin if it were not alien to error. He should also read the works of other Catholic fathers on the faith and, when he does not find mention of this name in such a high and distinguished matter, he should know that he has found it elsewhere in vain. Because if it is found in the confession of the holy faith outside of these discussions, it should be attributed either to ineloquence, which springs from lack of skill, or to the peculiarity of another language, which often loses its force when translated into another language.
