  <p>The remission of sins, which was omitted by Basil, bishop of Ancyra, in his confession of faith, is to be counted among the highest gifts of ecclesiastical dignity. The prophet extols this with great praise, saying those are blessed whose transgressions are forgiven and whose sins are covered. This was thundered among the first proclamations of the gospel by the voice of the word, the voice of wisdom, the friend of the bridegroom, as it is written: "And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."</p>
  
  <p>The Mediator between God and men, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, dedicated this with the mercy by which he came to redeem the world, when he forgave some sins before his passion and offered himself to God the Father as a sacrifice to cleanse the sins of the whole world. To ensure that the Church could always attain this, he granted the ineffable gift of the Spirit, the indelible mark of his character, and the saving sacrament of holy baptism.</p>
  
  <p>The apostles, in their joint confession of faith, which they established as a kind of standard of belief and preaching before they parted from each other, are said to have placed this after the confession of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They did not delay to include it, because they saw that the integrity of faith could not be complete without it. The brevity of the symbol did not prevent them from professing this, as the integrity of holy faith and the venerable sublimity of such a great gift demanded it.</p>
  
  <p>It is indeed accomplished through the Holy Spirit, through whom sins are forgiven, or through the blood of Christ, which we receive in the sacrament and which was shed for us for the remission of sins. It is also accomplished through the water of baptism, in which the ancient and long-standing wound of original sin is washed away. Hence, the apostle says that three bear witness: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are one, because through the Holy Spirit, the blood of Christ, and the water of baptism, we reach one and the same goal, that is, the remission of sins.</p>
  
  <p>Some teachers, when explaining what the standard of faith is, have listed among the other novelties completed in the incarnation of Christ, saying: "It is new that the Son of God became man, it is new that he was handed over to death by men, it is new that he rose on the third day, it is new that he ascended into heaven with his body, and it is new that the remission of sins is given to men." Thus, they said that the remission of sins given to men is new, because, as it is given in the New Testament, it was not given in the Old. The Old Testament page does not wash away sins but shows them.</p>
  
  <p>The resurrection of the body, which Christians believe and confess, but Sadducees do not believe in, was also retained in the confession of faith by the aforementioned bishop. This is shown in the reading of the Old Testament, where Job, a man more evangelical than legal, says: "I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes—I, and not another." And it is shown by Daniel, a most holy man and investigator of God's mysteries, who says: "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt." This is entirely commended by the Truth himself when he descended to earth for the salvation of mankind, teaching it in the holy oracles of his preaching and demonstrating it by the saving example of his resurrection.</p>
  
  <p>If someone says that Job, in this statement, spoke only of his own resurrection and not the general resurrection of all men, let him hear Job affirming the general resurrection of all in another place, saying: "A tree has..."</p>


  <p>
    If there is hope for a tree, it will sprout again, and its branches will grow. Even if its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil, at the scent of water, it will bud and put forth shoots like a young plant.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, when a person dies and is laid low, where is he? Just as waters recede from the sea and a river dries up, so too when a person lies down, he will not rise again; until the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    This passage should be understood as follows: does a tree have the hope of reviving, and a person does not have the hope of resurrection? Just as waters recede from the sea and a river dries up, so too when a person lies down, will they not rise again? Until the heavens are no more, will they not awake or be roused from their sleep? These words demonstrate not only his own resurrection but also the general resurrection of all humankind.

    The apostles, when they were preparing to spread the gospel to various nations, infused not with different faiths but with diverse languages, did not intend to deliver different doctrines. Among the mysteries of spirituality they passed on, they included the hope of resurrection. To ensure this would not be forgotten or corrupted by heretical error over time, they placed it in the creed. In this authentic symbol of faith, which encapsulates the entirety of faith with admirable brevity, they included it. One of the apostles, who conquered the hearts of the wild nations with the sacred teachings, foretold that it would happen in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    The life of the world to come, which the same Basil is known to have negligently omitted, is promised to us by the Lord Himself and is proclaimed in almost all the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures. Without this belief in the resurrection, the resurrection of the flesh is meaningless, and our entire religious endeavor aims to achieve it.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this, it is understood that Basil did not entirely fail when, in his confession of faith, he omitted matters full of such mysteries—indeed, full of mysteries—without which Christian belief cannot stand, and instead brought forth matters that are unnecessary and worthy of ridicule. He is not merely reprimanded because he delayed professing them, provided he believes them in his heart, as sometimes things are omitted in speech for the sake of brevity or due to some occasion, even though they are firmly held in belief. He is criticized because he added something that no holy father has ever included in the profession of faith. A soldier who once fought or is about to fight is not criticized if he does not fight temporarily, but if he flees and disgraces his nobility and weakens his comrades with a bad example. For the aforementioned bishop said, after professing the worship and kissing of images as the first of his faith's defenses, "he is confident in participating in their sanctification." Rightly, he deserves to participate in insensible things, which not only lack sanctification but also life, after professing faith in such trifles and neglecting the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come, which are among the primary gifts of the Christian religion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if it is useful to worship images, what detracts from the Christian religion if the profession of this practice is not included among the primary professions of faith? There are many traditions of church practice transmitted to the faithful, which, even if not professed in the confession of faith, do not detract from holy religion. What harm, then, does it cause to the integrity of faith if the worship of images is omitted, since it is believed to be forbidden rather than instituted by the holy fathers? The omission of the worship of images does not harm the purity of sacred faith, which is rather forbidden than instituted, as the omission of the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come would, if omitted in confession, which are proclaimed in all the Holy Scriptures and, as we have mentioned, were placed by the apostles in the creed.

    The praiseworthy topic is held together by the brevity of the connection.
