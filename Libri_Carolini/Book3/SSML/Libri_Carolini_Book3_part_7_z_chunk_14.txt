        <s>But in the present case, we decide that Theodosius, Bishop of Amorium, should be more rightly and appropriately accused, who, having laid no foundation of his faith in the mentioned synod, began to build vain and irrational things.</s>

        <s>If therefore he is rightly blamed who added the adoration of images to the confession of the holy and unique Trinity, much more rightly should this one be blamed, who, setting aside the confession of that highest and ineffable mystery, only dreamed of some frivolous things about the adoration of those images.</s>

    For even if they could instruct all the people, they could not have all the images of all the saints who have pleased God since the beginning, in whose worship they would instruct the entire population. Their number is so great that it is said by the prophet, speaking from the perspective of the Son to the Father: </p>

    Even if this is said hyperbolically, the number of those who have pleased God since the beginning is so vast that they cannot be painted or counted by anyone except Him, in whose book their names are written.

    For if the same bishop wishes to avoid the condemnation he has proclaimed, it is necessary for him to have and worship the images of all the saints who have pleased God in various parts of the world since the beginning. And if he cannot have them due to their multitude, indeed because he cannot, he should submit himself to the condemnation he has proclaimed.
