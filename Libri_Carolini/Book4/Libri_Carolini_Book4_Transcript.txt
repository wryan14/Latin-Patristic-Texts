Chapter 1:That John the priest's statement about worshipping an image as Christ is false and laughable
He gave one of the Orientals, who among other absurdities of his profession neither avoided being deceived in this matter, which is being discussed, nor feared to deceive, nor was ashamed to lie or to encourage others to lie. He did not avoid being deceived, as he strayed from the narrow path of the Holy Scriptures, which advocate the worship and adoration of one and only God, and he turned his mind to worshiping senseless objects. He did not fear to deceive, as he persuaded others with many assertions and vanities to stray with him from the right path. He was not ashamed to lie and to encourage others to lie, asserting that committing an illegal act and telling a lie was not a sin. For he says: "Whoever worships an image and says, 'This is Christ, the Son of God,' does not sin."
This vanity can be easily refuted with the following argument: if saying what is not true is not a lie, then saying what is true cannot be considered truth. Therefore, if lying is not a vice, then speaking the truth is not a virtue. And if speaking and following the truth is a virtue, then lying and following falsehood is undoubtedly a vice. Hence, when someone says that a picture is Christ, the Son of God, they are lying. And when they lie, they act wrongly, and when they act wrongly, they sin. Therefore, when they say that a picture is Christ, the Son of God, they sin.
For no picture has taken on human form for our salvation, allowed itself to be scourged, and crucified for us, nor has any image risen from the grave, having conquered death and the underworld, nor has any earthly artist's work ascended to heaven with the apostles' teachings and directives, and sat at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. All these things were done not by any picture, but by Christ, who is the only Son of God the Father, begotten ineffably by the Father before all ages, sent to earth for human salvation at the end of ages, anointed by the Father with the oil of gladness above his companions, who according to the Apostle reconciled all things by the blood of his cross, whether things on earth or things in heaven, to whom every knee bows, whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth. Therefore, if anyone worshiping an image says: 'This is Christ, the Son of God,' not only does he sin, but he acts insanely and wickedly, attempting to apply such a sublime and excellent name—if it can even be called a thing and not rather the origin and cause of all things—to such a vile and abject thing, lacking not only mysteries but also life. Just as no image can be equated to Christ in nature, it also cannot be equated to him in name.
If anyone thinks that the reasoning of equivocal names can apply here, let him know that the statement we are now discussing is far from the reasoning of equivocal names. It is one thing to say: 'a painted man and a true man, a painted lion and a true lion, and a celestial lion,' and quite another to declare that an image is Christ, the Son of God. In the former, there is only a sound similarity in name, while in the latter, the full meaning is clear. The reasoning of equivocal names only holds a community in name, but as soon as it reaches the definition, what the sound similarity of the name covered is revealed by the definition. As we have said, it is one thing and quite another to call a picture by the name of the thing it represents, according to the reasoning of equivocal names, and another to worship a senseless thing and declare with full meaning: 'This is Christ, the Son of God.' For if uttering such a lie, as he confessed, is not a sin, then committing any illegal act is not a sin, and the authority of the Holy Scriptures, which certainly advocate abstaining from illegal acts, must be considered to have failed.
The strength of the holy Scriptures, which command abstaining from all illicit things, must not be considered weak; therefore, to tell such a lie is a sin. For while almost every lie told with the intent to deceive is a sin, this kind of lie is much more of a sin, since it seeks to call such a low thing by the confession of such a great name. To produce a confession, which the pastor of the church offers to the Redeemer and which the entire holy catholic and universal church offers daily, through which it is saved and attains its own salvation, how can someone attempt to produce it about an insensible thing? Therefore, just as other vices, so too the vice of lying is forbidden by the teachings of the divine Scriptures.
Whoever obeys the warnings of the same John, to worship images and to call them the Christ, the Son of God, and practices wicked vanity and shows himself to be undisciplined, if this crime, as he professed, were to be committed, it would fulfill what is said in the prophecy of Jeremiah in the voice of the Lord: "Lies and not faith have prevailed over the land, because evils came out from evil people, and they have not known me."
Paul also, the eminent preacher, persuades to put away lying and to speak truth with these words; for he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians: "Putting away lying, speak truth each one with his neighbor, because we are members of one another." Similarly, to the Colossians: "Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds." John the Apostle also says: "Every lie is not of the truth."
Hence it is clearly evident that, if the picture, as he urges to confess, is not Christ, the Son of God, it is a lie what is said; and if what is said is a lie, according to the Apostle's voice, it is not of the truth, who says: "I am the way and the truth and the life." For the worship of adoration is to be shown to God alone and the confession of the Son of God to him alone, who is truly his consubstantial Son, not adopted.
But if this word ‘here’ in the same place is used as an adverb of place, not as a pronoun, this sentence can stand because God is everywhere.
Chapter 2: That books of unknown authorship are unsuitable for confirming contested matters
This nonsensical idea, often mentioned by John the presbyter, he did not hesitate to add to his frivolities, to say that 'by the image, which appears through colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped.'
As if the Lord needs something and by some means makes his strength, which lacks nothing, to be worshiped.
When God created the first of all angelic nature with the heaven and earth, it is believed that from the beginning of their creation, they worshiped and praised the strength of God, because at that time there were no humans, nor were there materials to paint images on.
So, should we believe that the Lord's strength was not worshiped or praised?
For Scripture says: When all the stars were created, all my angels praised me together (Job 38:7).
Here it is clearly shown that not 'by the image, which appears through colors,' but by his ineffable power, God's strength has always been praised and worshiped.
After the creation of humans, when the art of painting had not yet developed in the world, was the strength of the Lord any less worshiped by the saints?
Indeed, neither righteous Abel, nor Enoch, nor Noah, nor any of the saints who lived in those times are believed to have worshiped the Lord's strength 'by the image' or 'by colors,' as in the still-primitive world, they had no experience with certain worldly arts.
Therefore, if there are many parts of the world where people are unaware of the art of painting, is the strength of the Lord not believed to be worshiped there?
Hence, the strength of the Lord is worshiped not 'by the image, which appears through colors,' as he dreams, but by his ineffable power, by which it is known that the whole world was created.
The strength of the Lord is also worshiped not by certain materials, but by His Word, namely the Son, whom he ineffably begot before ages and through whom and in whom he created the universe.
He is the right hand and strength of the Father, through which the creation of all creatures was accomplished, and so too is the perpetual worship by angels and humans, who recognize him as the cause of all creation and the cause of the most just and fitting adoration.
Thus, the holy and universal church does not worship God through 'the image, which is made from colors,' as often mentioned by John, but through Christ the Lord, confessing when celebrating the mysteries of his redemption that it is fitting and right, just and beneficial, that we always and everywhere give thanks to him, through whom the ineffable majesty of the Father is praised by angels, worshiped by dominions, trembled at by powers, and the heavens and the heavenly army sing a hymn of glory to him with sweet-sounding modulation.
Therefore, his strength is worshiped not through a colorful image of him, but through his most sacred and life-giving incarnation.
His power is worshiped not through a painting, but through his works, namely, by taking the form of a servant, being born of a virgin, giving hearing to the deaf, speech to the mute, movement to the lame, health to lepers and others afflicted with diseases, life to the dead, sight to the blind, despoiling the underworld, destroying the power of death, rising from the grave, and ascending to the heavens.
These are the means by which the strength of the Lord is worshiped by Catholics: these are the defenses by which the faith of the church is protected; this is the confession, from which if anyone dissents, they are endangered, but if they hold it in their heart, they attain eternal salvation.
This is the perpetual memorial, by which the minds of the faithful always behold Christ with their inner eyes, to which full knowledge is not reached through painting, but through faith, hope, and love.
Since John, clouded by the mist of his ignorance, as I think, said one thing while intending to say another, let these words suffice against what he said!
To address the things he wanted to say, we need to turn to the main point of this discussion, so that both what he reluctantly confirmed and what he eagerly tried to say, with this style fortified by rational arguments, can be shaken. This way, the reader will recognize that we have both understood the things said in improper words and analyzed the statements that are easy to understand.
For example, when he says: "By the image that appears through colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped," we guess he meant to say: "Seeing the image made up of colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped." He made this almost clear in the following when he says: "And we will remember His presence on earth."
We can easily object to this idea because neither the reading of the Holy Scriptures nor the examples of the fathers suggest that God should be sought in man-made things. David says: "I have hidden your words in my heart, not in images; with all my heart I have sought you, God, do not reject me from your commandments." And Moses says: "Place the words of the Lord in your hearts." And the Lord through the prophet says: "Return to me with all your heart." Conversely, about the rejected ones, He says: "This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
From this, it is understood that God is to be sought not in visible things, not in man-made things, but in the heart; not with the physical eyes, but only with the eye of the mind. For what madness it is to say: "By the image that appears through colors, His strength is worshiped, and we will remember His presence on earth"! It is an unfortunate memory that relies on an imaginary vision to remember Christ, who should never leave the heart of a righteous man. One cannot have the presence of Christ in oneself unless one sees His image painted on a wall or some material, because such a memory, which is nourished by images, does not come from the love of the heart, but from the necessity of vision. This is because it is not internal love that ignites the memory of Christ, but the necessity by which we even recall unpleasant things when we see them painted, led to the mind by the vision.
Therefore, it is to be feared for such people, who are bound by such a necessity that they can hardly remember Christ unless they see pictures, that if they were to lose their sight due to some bodily ailment or lack pictures by some accident, which cannot always be available, they would entirely forget Christ, who must always be kept before their eyes.
Chapter 3: That Dionysius reported a lamp burning for months before Saint Mary's image
Because they say that one should not be offended because lights and incense are made before the images of saints.
Indeed, when the same synod, the reading of which we have insisted upon, advises many things to which no sane person will dare to give assent, attempts to dissuade many things from which no sane person will attempt to turn away, and criticizes many things that are entirely praiseworthy, and on the contrary, praises many things that are entirely worthy of criticism, it also advises that no one should be offended 'because lights and incense are made before images,' as if those who light candles for things that lack light and offer fragrant incense to things that lack odor are not the ones being offended.
For those are indeed offended who offer to senseless things what should be offered worthily to God and encourage others to do so; and they think we will be offended, from whom they reasonably fear their madness will be mocked, and while they consider themselves to be reproached by us, they boast of being zealous for our salvation.
Thus, they fear that we will be offended in this part and think they are striving for good works, but the offense of this part will harm us as much as the exhibition of their insolent service will benefit them, because the order demands that they must impart the same reward for the service offered to those images as the sense of honor imparted, since they are known to be completely senseless.
But perhaps wishing to refute our assertion, they will say: 'Why do you mock those who prepare lights and burn incense before senseless images, when we also prepare lights and burn incense in basilicas, which are equally senseless?'
To which an easy objection can arise, since it is one thing for places dedicated to divine worship to be illuminated with lights and for the smoke of prayers and incense to be offered to God in those places, and another thing to offer light to an image with eyes that see nothing and burn incense to a nose that smells nothing; it is one thing to venerate places dedicated to divine worship, and another to offer lights and incense to pictures decorated with various colors; it is one thing to solemnly venerate the house of the majesty of the Lord built by any of the faithful and dedicated by the pontiff, and another and far different thing to irrationally kiss images composed by painters with offered gifts.
For my house, says the Lord, will be called a house of prayer; and elsewhere: Acceptable gifts will be on my altar, and my house of prayer will be honored.
For in many ways that place must be exalted with honors, where the faithful people gather from everywhere, and their supplications are mercifully heard by God, and the mysteries of our salvation are celebrated, and a sacrifice of praise is offered to God, where an angelic assembly is made to bring sacrifices to God by the hands of priests, where the frequent harmony of those singing psalms resounds, where the flowing streams of divine reading irrigate thirsty hearts.
Indeed, in many of those places, where they boast of offering lights and incense to images, from which they think we who despise doing so are offended, the places dedicated to divine worship are so despicable that, as we have learned from our envoys or those who were sent by my father of reverent memory, or those who were destined by us to those parts, many basilicas in their lands lack not only lights and incense but even coverings themselves, whereas in the kingdom granted to us by God with His help, who deigned to preserve them, the basilicas abound in gold and silver, gems and pearls, and other most beautiful decorations, and although we refuse to prepare lights and burn incense for images, we adorn places dedicated to divine worship with the most precious things.
Chapter 4: That equating despising images with desecrating kings' graves is incorrect
It is said that it is the same crime to despise images as it is to bring out the bones of kings from their graves. For example, Nebuchadnezzar brought out the bones of the kings of India from their graves, gouged out the eyes of the king of Judea after killing his sons, and took the cherubim from the temple.
Despising images, as we have often said, breaking them, offering them lights and incense, and worshiping them is considered to have no authority from any reading and is shown by no example of any saint to be something that should be done. Especially because breaking them or worshiping them has been prohibited by some holy fathers. And not without reason, because it is entirely removed from caution, which both those who hold synods or those who overly abolish them or even unnecessarily worship them commit.
Therefore, they say that those who despise them are guilty of the same crime as Nebuchadnezzar, who, with the increasing sins of the people of Israel, destroyed the kingdom of Judea under the urging of the dreadful judgment of God's wrath. He overturned the walls of the once holy city and, with the beauty of the entire temple destroyed, also threw down the cherubim. If this were so, this crime could not fall on us, who, while allowing them in church decorations, entirely despise worshiping them, but on their predecessors or parents, who broke them when they were used in ancient basilica decorations and decreed they should be entirely abolished. Thus, the judgment of this issue seems to hang in the balance against them, so that whatever they bring forth more troublesome or detestable, they seem inevitably to condemn either themselves or their predecessors.
Therefore, since they despise their ancestors for the abolition of images and boast of having a great merit for worshiping them, neither can these be compared to the builders of that venerable temple in praise, nor can their ancestors be equated with the destroyers of the same in crime. For as much as there is a difference between the temple of the highest God, which was built in the time of the prophets by illustrious men, and certain images made by any artisans, so much is there undoubtedly a difference between the destroyers of the same temple and the despisers of images.
But while we and those who judge that they should be worshiped inopportunely, and their ancestors, who rashly rejected them, are reproved by true reason, it remains to teach that the destroyers of the Lord's temple were involved in a greater and much greater crime than the despisers of images.
For the prophet did not lament the abolition of such images, which they boast of worshiping, but looked forward with prophetic spirit to the future destruction of the temple, which was not yet founded, and of the city, which stood out among other cities, as already past, and lamented it in song, saying: "Why have you rejected us forever, God? Your fury has burned against the sheep of your pasture. Remember your congregation, which you created from the beginning."
He does not call the despisers of images enemies but the destroyers of that most holy temple, when he adds: "How the enemy has acted wickedly in your holy place, and all who hate you have boasted."
He does not lament signs in paintings but in the courtyard of the Lord, namely hostile standards of the Chaldean or Roman army, saying: "They have set up their standards in the midst of your courtyard, and the signs they did not recognize, as on the top of the road."
Nor does he lament the doors of painters or the materials of certain craftsmen or even painted panels being cut down with axes and chisels, but the most holy doors of the temple of the Lord, in which were the holy of holies, cut down by hostile wedges, saying: "As in a forest of trees, they cut down its doors with axes and chisels."
He does not follow with anguish of mind the burning or desecration of certain images, but the sanctuary of the Lord, saying: "They burned your sanctuary with fire, they polluted the dwelling place of your name on the earth."
Nor in another psalm did he sing with mournful modulation about the Lord's wrath being poured out on despisers of images, but about the destroyers of the city and temple or even the devastators of the entire people of Israel, saying: "How long, Lord, will you be angry forever? Will your zeal burn like fire forever? Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name."
Your name they have not called upon, because they have consumed Jacob and made his place desolate.
Nor does it speak of those who scorn images, but under the name of the Edomites, it speaks of all nations hostile to the Israelite people: Remember, Lord, the children of Edom in Jerusalem, who say: Destroy it, destroy it down to its foundations.
Not of those who scorn the worship of images, but under the name of the daughter of Babylon, the Chaldean, or the people of Rome, it threatens: Daughter of Babylon, miserable; blessed is he who repays you what you have done to us; blessed is he who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock. Nothing similar is found anywhere about those who scorn images.
Many similar things are found in the prophecies about the destroyers of the Lord's temple or the city of Jerusalem, which we have omitted for brevity. It is also read that our Lord and Redeemer wept over the future ruin of this same temple or city. All these things, although they can be understood mystically about the destroyers of the church or soul, who seek to overthrow the virtues of the soul like certain walls, by whose defense one fights against vices, and the faith placed in the heart, in which pure sacrifices are offered to God, like a certain temple, always attacking and seeking to overthrow it, and striving to lay low pure thoughts or certain exercises of good works like a certain people, nevertheless, they are historically understood to have been said about the destruction of the aforementioned temple.
Hence, it is clearly evident that their predecessors, although they were somewhat incautious in abolishing images from church decorations, are by no means to be equated with the subverters of that most sacred and revered temple, because in these there was lightness, in those, there was atrocity; in these, there was ignorance, in those, there was malice; these, thinking they were offering service to God, removed them from church decorations, those, provoking the angry God against themselves, cruelly destroyed His house. With the help of God, we set aside both and adorn places dedicated to divine worship and render the service of adoration to God alone.
Chapter 5: That Saint Simeon the Stylite's letter differs from Scripture and church fathers' teachings
The letter that they say is from Saint Simeon the Stylite to Emperor Justinian is very different from the Holy Scriptures or the teachings of the holy fathers.
It says to the aforementioned emperor, "For whom we remember and report to your divine ears," and forbids the same emperor from showing mercy.
The cunning of heretics often includes writing disgraceful and misleading things and attributing them to certain holy and reputable men, so that the poisoned cup, coated with honey, may be more easily offered to the unsuspecting.
Therefore, it is to be feared that the letter they claim to be from a certain Saint Simeon, from which they draw testimonies to support their error, are not the words of a holy man but of a deceitful schemer.
Indeed, we and other orthodox believers doubt it because its language in some places contradicts the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.
We do not presume to use its reading as testimony to establish doubtful matters since we know it contradicts divine law.
We do not remember reading anything else from its text except what we found marked in their book.
Although it lacks the charm of meaning and words and smells of something crude and rustic, we prefer to present it as we found it in their book.
They say that the aforementioned Saint Simeon, whose life and preaching are unknown to us, wrote to Emperor Justinian concerning certain Samaritan images that were causing harm as follows: "For whom we remember and report to your divine ears"; and again: "I have nothing to say to those who presume such things, lest one act of humanity be done for them.
Therefore, we pray to your victorious strength not to show mercy to those who presumed this, neither to spare them nor to accept any plea or response for them"; and a little later: "But I adjure you, Lord, by Emmanuel, the most high God, not to delay or to postpone appropriate vengeance even for a moment"; and again: "And may the ties of their kin condemn them, who await to consume them in unquenchable and dark fire, and may they be cursed to the lowest abyss by the holy and omnipotent Spirit of Jesus Christ our Lord, who proceeds from the Father, to destroy them in infinite perdition"; and a little later: "In Him, who reigns with your piety."
In these most foolish words, which not only lack eloquence but also common sense and are filled with barbarisms and solecisms, these points are utterly reprehensible:
That he called the ears of Emperor Justinian, a mortal man subject to all human changes, "divine";
That he forbade him to show mercy;
That he was quick to repay evil for evil;
That he neglected to act patiently and gently in the same cause;
That he should have worked to restrain the king's anger for the sake of the condemned but instead inflamed it more and more and pushed him to rage;
That he did not follow the example of Him who wishes none to perish;
And that he, who should have watched over the salvation of souls, pronounced curses and maledictions and told the same emperor that God "reigns with him."
Since these words are reprehensible in so many places, they are found less suitable for supporting the veneration of images because it is difficult for someone who stumbles on flat ground to run through precipices, and one who cannot keep to the public path cannot be a guide in ambiguous detours, and one who is rejected by the most refined studies of liberal arts is found to lack even the most common literacy.
For although we have fully disputed against their ravings, which continue to use such nonsense, in the earlier parts of this work, the current order demands that we now address the rest of the matters being discussed.
For if mercy is found to have restrained the emperor, what else does it do but oppose all the holy Scriptures that call for mercy to be shown? Therefore, it is very dangerous to follow the precepts of such writings that seem to oppose divine Scriptures.
For the Lord says in the gospel:  "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful";  and again:  "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy";  and the teacher of the nations says:  "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you";  and the Psalmist says that the Lord loves mercy, and that the earth is full of the Lord's mercy;  and the same Lord says through the prophet:  "I desire mercy, not sacrifice."
Since mercy is mandated by such authentic precepts, and the prophet testifies to singing of it forever - "I will sing of your mercies, Lord, forever" - and since it is said to be loved by the Lord, whoever prohibits and despises it is found to not love God and to entirely contradict His most excellent teachings.
Hence, the Truth itself responded to the lawyer saying the one who showed mercy was the neighbor:  "Go and do likewise." This guidance shows that not only should we love humans who share our nature, but also angels, who, although of a different nature, are considered neighbors because they exercise mercy towards us, and are commanded to be loved by anyone who loves God and his neighbor.
By being so quick to repay evil for evil, he completely contradicted divine teachings. For he should neither have been so harsh in seeking revenge nor have incited the emperor to exercise it, since his role was not to seek or order revenge, but to love and preach acts of mercy. For the Lord says in Exodus:  "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to take it back to him." He did not obey this command, as he did not bring back the erring Samaritans, if indeed they were believed to be in error, but instead incited the emperor's mind to let them perish in that error; and he allowed those under burden to perish harshly, while the Lord says:  "If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; help him with it." Proverbs also says:  "If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you." For by feeding the spiritual food and drink of divine words to those he knew were enemies by sinning and in need of salvation, he would have heaped burning coals—which consume the rust of sins and ignite love for God and neighbor—upon their heads, that is, their minds.
Therefore, seeking revenge, spurning mercy, and harboring anger, all of which the aforementioned writings are said to have encouraged the emperor to do, are prohibited by these teachings of Ecclesiasticus:  "He who does not seek revenge will find vengeance from the Lord, and his sins will be forgiven; leave vengeance to your neighbor, and your sins will be forgiven when you pray." A man keeps anger against another man and seeks healing from God? He shows no mercy to a man like himself and yet prays about his own sins? He keeps anger and asks for God’s forgiveness? Who will pray for his offenses? Likewise, the oracle of Isaiah forbids repaying evil for evil in this way:  "Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, 'Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame." The Lord also commands in the gospel not to incite anger or exercise revenge or heap curses upon enemies or wrongdoers, but to show love towards them with these most sacred words...
The chosen vessel also admonishes us not to repay evil with evil; for he says in his letter to the Romans: “Do not be wise in your own opinion, repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. Do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay,’ says the Lord.”
Therefore, if we should not defend ourselves according to the teaching of the excellent preacher, what madness is it to defend injuries to insensible things according to the exhortation of the same letters sent to Justinian, and to lose works of piety, which we should not even lose for our own slanders, for the insults to pictures, which do not feel them at all? Thus, the writer of the same epistle did not follow the example of Saint Stephen the protomartyr, who, when he was being stoned, prayed for his persecutors with bent knees, while this man, unable to bear the injuries to images, which do not feel them, requested that the perpetrators of the same injury be swiftly and mercilessly killed and ensured that their souls were bound with the bond of anathema and destined for eternal punishment.
Meanwhile, the writer of the same letters neglected to act patiently or gently in this matter and spurned fulfilling the preaching of the one who wrote to the Thessalonians: “Be patient with all. See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.” He also disregarded the advice of the one who said, “Better is a patient man with humility than one who divides the spoils with the proud.” And while he should have restrained the king’s wrath by rescuing the miserable, as Solomon says, “Deliver those who are drawn toward death, and hold back those stumbling to the slaughter. If you say, ‘Surely we did not know this,’ does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not render to each man according to his deeds?” Instead, he incited the emperor’s mind to slaughter and cruelty with his letters.
Therefore, since those who suffer injury should be freed, Ecclesiasticus demonstrates; for it says: “Deliver him who suffers injury from the hand of the oppressor, and do not feel resentment in your soul; in judging, be merciful like a father to orphans and like a husband to their mother, and you will be like a son of the Most High, obedient, and He will have more mercy on you than a mother.” Isaiah also speaks of this matter: “Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow. Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Rescue the plundered from the hand of the oppressor.” Therefore, if anyone wishes to become like a son of the Most High God, by insisting on good works and desires to be shown mercy by God and cleansed from the filth of sins, he should rather follow these most salutary advices than the cruel perversity of that letter.
Furthermore, by inciting the emperor’s mind to anger, he acted cruelly in this matter as well and completely contradicted sacred writings in this aspect as in others. For it is said by a wise man: “Blessed is the simple soul; but the passionate or angry man acts dishonorably.” Also by the same: “Do not be a friend to an angry man; with a furious man, do not go, lest you learn his ways and set a snare for your soul.”
Woe to the paths when learning from a wise person is prohibited; much more so are teaching and encouraging prohibited under testimony. The Book of Ecclesiasticus similarly declares about this matter: "A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, and a sinner disrupts friends and introduces slander among those who have peace." For Ecclesiastes also gives these instructions: "Do not be quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools." Therefore, the Teacher of the Gentiles writes to the Ephesians: "Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger." Also: "Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander be put away from you, along with all malice." Furthermore: "But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth." These admonitions, if examined carefully, can all be found in the text of the aforementioned epistle.
Let the most righteous man and beloved of God, the Apostle James, declare whether, according to this epistle's exhortation, anyone should be quick to anger! Let him thunder whether it is to be agreed upon with this letter, which decreed that the emperor should be provoked to anger! He says: "Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God." Let the Truth itself also declare what its members should follow concerning this matter! Speak, holy Matthew, what you have proclaimed from the eternal fountain of paradise with the life-giving streams of your river. For the eternal fountain, the fountain of life, the fountain of light says: "Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment."
Since anger, which is counted among the principal vices, is declared detestable by so many divine laws and oracles of divine words, it is easy to understand that these letters are not suitable for reinforcing the matters in question, through which the emperor is committed under great testimony and supplication to have and perpetrate the work. The author of the same epistle indeed ought to have exhorted those he saw in peril to repentance; if they perhaps despised repentance, he could have approached the emperor with humble prayers to compel them to convert. Possibly, they might follow the good of their own profit when coerced, which they had despised voluntarily, since God Almighty wants no one to perish, attested by Paul, who says: "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth." If indeed he was concerned with saving souls, he ought to have provoked those he saw erring to repentance rather than inciting the prince's mind to shed blood, since the virtue of repentance should not be put behind other virtues but rather should be equated with the best of them. It consolidates what is broken, heals what is weak, restores what is lost, and often brings sinners back to their former state after a fall.
For this, the Psalmist commends when he says: "I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,' and you forgave the iniquity of my heart." Isaiah commands to have this saying: "Remember these things and groan, repent, you who err, and return from the heart." This is considered the oracle of the prophet Jeremiah saying: "Return, O faithless children; I will heal your faithlessness." In another place, he says: "Let everyone turn from his evil way, and improve your deeds." Joel also thunders with the voice of the Lord saying: "Return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love."
The Book of Ecclesiasticus also says: "If we do not repent, we will fall into the hands of the Lord according to his greatness; and his mercy is with him." Indeed, it is written in the Acts of the Apostles: "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out." The pastor of the church in his epistle...
The second says: The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
Therefore, the greater this virtue in saving, the more He neglected to preach to those who were erring, the more without a doubt this cruelty excels in harming others, because He neither allowed mercy to prevail as a prince nor restrained from anger and from exercising revenge with serious adjurations.
Therefore, according to the Lord's statement, it is a grave sin to cause one of the little ones to stumble.
How grave do you think it is to not only promote a certain little one but a king, who is indeed the head of the people, to stumble?
For in that preface of the letter, the writer lists among other cruelties that he exercised towards those he saw erring, he used curses, which is notably condemned by the sacred scriptures, with the chosen vessel saying: "Bless and do not curse"; and elsewhere: "Nor will the revilers inherit the kingdom of God."
The rock of the church also forbids the use of curses with these words; for in the First Peter it says: "Finally, be all like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing."
But lest anyone thinks we judge or speak ill of someone whose merit we are most unaware of, let it be known that we do not discuss the life or merit of any just person, but only diligently examine the words with the winnowing fan of the divine scriptures, which have been improperly brought forth to nurture error, being entirely bound by the sinews of errors.
For we do not discuss other words of the same Symeon, which, as we said above, we do not remember reading anywhere, but only those which we perceive through the narrators of their details; and since we do not know whether they are indeed the words of the same Symeon, as they confess, or of some other person written under his name, we know that they are alien to the senses of the holy scriptures and rightly should be rejected from all ecclesiastical doctrine.
Chapter 6: That they claim image destroyers are worse than all heretics, including their ancestors
It wasn't enough for them to reject their predecessors or parents with dreadful curses and tear them apart with various insults. They even claimed that they were worse than all heretics. The more they try to condemn them with harsh injuries, the more they contradict divine teachings. They say the Samaritans are worse than all heretics and prefer those who destroy images over them. It's clear that their ancestors destroyed images; and according to those who destroy images, they are worse than the Samaritans. And the Samaritans, as they say, are worse than all heretics. So, according to them, their ancestors were worse than all heretics, and it's clear they destroyed images.
Since they claim they were taught or consecrated by the worst of all heretics through the flesh, in the teachings of the Scriptures, or through the laying on of hands to perform the mysteries of the Christian religion, it is surprising that they consider themselves superior to other Catholics in establishing regulations and traditions of the Church. They boast of having such a great authority, even though their actions, teachings, and the examples of their ancestors do not prove this. For if they are to be preferred over all Catholics because of their worship of images, then it is not followers of virtues but worshippers of images who will hold a higher place in the Church. And if worshippers of images hold a higher place within the holy Church, then errors, not virtues, will be followed.
It is virtues, not errors, that should be followed. Therefore, these people should not be preferred over all Catholics just because of their worship of images.
The Samaritans, whom they call 'worse than all heretics,' are not heretics among Christians but among Jews, and they hold to the Old Testament, not the New Testament. While the Jews believe in bodily resurrection and accept the prophets and the writings, the Samaritans reject the resurrection and, except for the five books of the law, they disregard all the Scriptures of both the Old and New Testaments. They are remnants of the people whom Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, sent to guard the land of Israel after moving the ten tribes of Israel to the Medes. When they were devastated by lions and other wild animals and various misfortunes in the land of Israel, they sent a message to the king saying they could not survive there unless they followed the laws of the God of the land. It is said that some Levites were sent to them to teach them the ceremonies of the law. They accepted these teachings partially and adopted many heretical practices, to the point that their barbarous pride led them to consider themselves the true children of Jacob and reject the Jews, who are believed to have descended from Jacob, as well as the communion of the Jews and other nations with arrogance.
The Samaritan woman, who spoke with the Lord at the well, boasted with empty pride that her father Jacob, who gave her the well, was greater than the Redeemer of the world. She stubbornly insisted that her ancestors worshipped not in Jerusalem but on the mountain. She eventually laid down her stubbornness along with her water jar and accepted the saving teachings.
If we briefly explain the symbolic mysteries implied by these events, it is not irrelevant. She represented the entire human race, which came to the Lord as the world was growing old. The Lord sat by the well during the sixth age of the world, signifying the earthly labor and error of this dark world. He 'sat down,' signifying the humility of the flesh He took on for us, and 'was tired,' indicating the weakness of that same flesh, although in another sense, His sitting demonstrates the dignity of His teaching and authority. He 'was thirsty,' not just for water but for the faith of the nations.
So when the disciples urged him to eat, he said he had food that they did not know about. He thirsted for the faith of the Gentiles, to do the will of the Father and complete His work. He promised to give her living water, meaning the Spirit, which those who believed in him would receive. He said she had had five husbands, that is, she had used the five carnal senses, and that the sense she would finally have, with which she would believe in Christ, she no longer had; for after the five carnal responses, she names Christ in the sixth response.
Her first response was: "You, being a Jew, how do you ask me for a drink?"
The second: "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep."
The third: "Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst or come here to draw."
The fourth: "I have no husband."
The fifth: "I see that you are a prophet; our fathers worshiped on this mountain."
For this response was carnal; a place on earth had been given to the carnal, where they might pray, not to worship a place or any object placed in it, but to worship the Lord in that place. But the spiritual ones will pray in spirit and truth, not in images, not in paintings, not in things that lack sense, as the Lord said. After he spoke, the woman's sixth response acknowledges Christ as the teacher of all these things. She says: "I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when he comes, he will tell us all things." But she was still mistaken because she did not see that the one she hoped would come was already there, which error was dispelled by the Lord's mercy saying: "I am he, who speaks to you."
Upon hearing this, she said nothing but left her water jar—meaning her desire and love for this world, by which people draw pleasure from the dark depths and earthly conversation, which, once perceived, they burn with desire for again, as it is said: "Whoever drinks of that water will thirst again." She went into the city, meaning she proclaimed to the world what she believed, believing with her heart unto righteousness, confessing with her mouth unto salvation.
Since we have diverged somewhat from the proposed topic, let us return to it. The Samaritans, being Gentiles and seemingly adhering to Judaism only superficially, are not known to attack the church more fiercely than other unbelievers. Although these people consider the Samaritans to be heretics and worse than all other heretics, they show them a certain favor, teaching that their ancestors should be preferred to them in wickedness; for he is not the worst of all, who has someone else found worse in fault.
Chapter 7: That they dishonor their parents while criticizing heretics' images
VII. On the fact that the more examples and images of heretics they despise, the more they dishonor their parents with greater insults and injuries, whom they undoubtedly claim to follow in this matter.
It is a very old custom, not only among philosophers but also among orators, when they want to prove something, to take arguments either from the matter itself in question, or from other things, or certainly from external sources. While these people despise following in other matters due to ignorance intervening, they strive to follow in this particular part when they decide to condemn and insult their predecessors or parents for the abolition of images, taking arguments either from the matter itself or from elsewhere or from external sources. They do not fear to damage them with insults, to curse them with anathemas, and to dishonor them with the most insane words.
The more examples of certain heretics they bring in as testimony, whom they claim to follow, the more they renounce them with severe curses and demonstrate that they go against divine instructions, which command honor to be given to parents.
The Lord says, "Honor your father and your mother, so that it may go well with you." This commandment holds such authority that it is written by the finger of the Lord on the tablets and is called the first commandment by the Apostle; for he says: "Honor your father and your mother," which is the first commandment with a promise, specifically in the promise that follows: "that you may live long on the earth and that it may go well with you."
It must be seriously considered how great the condemnation is for those who tear their parents apart with insults or curse them with anathemas, given the merit and promise held by those who honor their parents according to the command of the Lord's voice. For the better the promise rewards those who keep this commandment, the more dreadful the condemnation should deter those who resist this commandment of the Lord.
It is also written in Leviticus: "Each of you must respect his father and mother." And in Ecclesiasticus, it is written about honoring parents: "He who honors his father will live a long life; and he who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother, and serves those who gave birth to him in work and word and all patience, and his blessing remains in the end." Also in Ecclesiasticus: "My child, support your father's old age, and do not grieve him during his life; and if he lacks understanding, excuse him and do not despise him in your strength. It is not glory for you but a disgrace."
The teacher of the nations also says: "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." For if honoring and obeying parents pleases God, then insulting them and bringing curses upon them displeases God in every way; and if the latter does not displease, then neither does the former please.
Therefore, it is grave and fearful not to honor parents; but it is gravest and most fearful to abominate or anathematize them, as the Lord says: "Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death." And again: "Cursed is anyone who dishonors his father or mother, and all the people shall say, Amen, Amen." It is also written in Proverbs: "Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness." Also there: "Whoever drives away his father or mother and thinks he does not sin, he is a partner to a man of destruction."
Hence, it must be understood that those who do not fear to heap curses upon their elders for lifeless things are not of moderate insanity, and while they want to favor images, they do not fear to dishonor their parents nor to go against divine oracles. We, while saying this, do not favor their elders, whom we also find to have acted absurdly in this matter, but we show by the testimonies of divine law how presumptuous these people are in such audacities.
Chapter 8: On Deacon Demetrius's account of their parents destroying books with images
Since neither side maintains moderation, neither are these restrained by reason, nor are their predecessors believed to have been restrained by discipline. Instead, both are proven to be carried away through rough and pathless ways, followers of forbidden and unproductive things. As has often been said, these think it right to worship images submissively, while those have impatiently thought it right to break them. As Deacon Demetrius says, Recklessly and disorderly, among other things, they burned two silver-embellished books because there was some mention of images in them, and they cut out two pages from another book, as if the mention of images could not be made otherwise without immediately being thought to worship them.
For while no one even lightly considers worshipping images in accepted books, mention of them is still made in many.  If all books in which there is mention of images are to be burned, many instruments of scripture will perish altogether. For first, each thing must be examined and then judged. This can be proven with many examples of both divine and worldly laws, and can also be supported by the teachings of the rhetoricians. They placed the deliberative genre first, the demonstrative second, and the judicial third, so that whatever deliberation finds to be either rejected or followed, demonstration shows it to be either praiseworthy or blameworthy, and judicial gives the sentence either with punishments or rewards. Otherwise, if these two latter genres do not precede the judicial, with the causes of deliberation examined first and the order of demonstration neglected, anything will be judged otherwise than is just.
Therefore, in all things, moderation or mediocrity must be maintained, and the philosophical saying must be remembered: Nothing in excess. This moderation must always be tempered with the company of examination. For the Apostle does not say: Burn everything without moderation and without examination, but: Examine everything; hold fast to what is good.
Chapter 9: On Leontius's boast of finding correction in silver tablet images
In that book, two pages had been cut out because of a mention of images in a previous synod, which was held to abolish images. There were images on silver tablets, as they are usually found on vessels or many other objects. In the second synod gathered to worship images, Leontius, as soon as he saw them, believed he had found a great correction of his error and judged those who had cut out the two pages from the same book, where the images were, to be exceedingly foolish for doing so because of a mention of images.
And so, the same book, over different periods, with various events and in different ways, was judged by some to be cut because of the mention of images and by others to be worshipped because of the images on the tablets. It suffered the unjust loss of pages from those and was elevated by unlawful worship from these. Those who took away what it had and should have had wrongly caused it to lose, and those who provided what it neither had nor should have had illogically acquired it. It neither lost the pages because of any pressing guilt nor found worship because of any notable merits, and as much as it rightly deserved to lose what it had, it deserved to acquire what was forbidden.
Should all books, which have histories inserted among writings with artistic painting in gold and silver or any colors, be burned or cut by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them because they contain images? Should silk or garments of any materials, suitable for human use or divine worship, decorated with certain figures and dyed with various colors, be burned by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them because they contain images? Should metals or woods, shaped for any uses and decorated with certain images by sculpting or engraving, therefore be burned or broken by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them?
Unfortunate is the mind that always struggles between either cursing or, on the contrary, worshipping images! Unfortunate is the sense that always pants for rejecting things that can be possessed without offense and cannot be worshipped without offense! Unfortunate is the custom that, having scorned the right path of moderation, not knowing how to hold a fixed rule, always wavers this way and that, sometimes improperly rejecting what should not be rejected, sometimes unhappily worshipping what should not be worshipped at all, sometimes excessively discarding what should not be discarded, sometimes excessively extolling what should not be excessively extolled, and, neglecting necessary things, focusing on unnecessary things, either because of the abolition of images or their worship.
Both are unsuitable, as they convene synods, as if they could bring any harm to Christian religion either by having or not worshipping something, when images, if they are not possessed, do not detract, and if they are possessed, do not add anything, while rejected images bring some lightness of cause, but worshipped images bring guilt!
Chapter 10: That no Gospel mentions Jesus sending an image to Abgarus
The Gospel is good news, and truly good news, because those who receive it are called children of God.
It is like a river flowing from one ineffable source in paradise, splitting into four streams and healthily nourishing dry hearts.
It is the path that leads to life, the light that brings people out of the darkness of vices, and directs mortal steps safely towards the heavens.
It is the fortification of a flourishing city, where standing firm ensures the greatest reward of life, and leaving it brings the most dangerous loss.
It is the flow of truth, which neither deceives nor can be deceived.
In its vast currents, while many remarkable deeds of the Lord are held, it is not found that the Lord received a letter from King Abgarus or sent a reply to him.
These two letters are completely foreign to the reading of the holy Gospel and were classified among apocryphal writings by Pope Gelasius the First and other equally Catholic and orthodox men.
Therefore, they are not to be produced as evidence to approve or disapprove of the matters in question, just like other apocryphal scriptures are less suitable for this purpose.
Since the texts of these letters were not included in the Gospel manuscripts by the evangelists and were rightfully classified as apocryphal by Catholics, and since they were brought forward by those wishing to support the error of worshipping images in a synod, they do not even slightly support their followers, especially since it is not read there that Abgarus requested a certain image to worship from the Lord, nor that the Lord sent such an image to Abgarus to be worshipped.
If those who try to support their error with these readings want to claim that one letter was received by the Lord and the other sent by Him, and use the testimony of John saying:
"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book,"
they should understand that this refers to miracles, not letters, to signs, not decrees.
It is clear that these letters are removed from the Gospel reading, classified as apocryphal by Catholics, and contain no evidence for the worship of images.
We reject the worship of images and, reading them among apocrypha, we approve all things and retain what is good.
Chapter 11: That unknown authors' books are unsuitable for confirming contested matters
The apostolic preaching advises us to test everything and retain what is good.
This can be understood especially regarding the diversity of doctrines.
It did not permit us to taste all acts or even things, as if pre-tasting everything, retaining only the good and discarding the bad, which cannot be done without committing some unlawful acts.
Instead, we are commanded to test and taste all doctrines with a spiritual palate, retaining only those that refresh our minds with internal satisfaction from the most proven men, while rejecting all others along with their authors.
Thus, while this rule is to be strictly observed in almost all such writings, it must also be thoroughly maintained in books that recount the deeds of certain holy fathers.
This is because there is a large number of those books, and their narratives and preachings are varied.
The more their authors are unknown, the more believers often doubt their sayings.
Therefore, not all of these books are to be brought forth as testimony for doubtful matters, because not all are endowed with the preface of their authors or composed in the style of strong and eloquent men.
Thus, we are instructed by the teachings of the venerable Pope Gelasius and other fathers to receive with all honor the lives of the fathers Paul, Anthony, Hilarion, and others, which were either written or translated into Latin by the blessed Jerome or composed in the style of those learned men, whose other works are received by the holy catholic and apostolic church.
The other books, whose authors are unknown, should be considered among the apocryphal writings.
Therefore, when they attempt to prove the veneration of images using sections of divine scriptures inappropriately applied, statements of some unknown teachers, or apocryphal tales, they should realize they have undertaken an impossible task.
This is because neither can nor should the testimonies of divine scriptures be forcibly used for foreign intentions, nor should the preachings of unknown authors, whose spirits have not yet been tested to see if they are from God, be produced as testimony.
Neither can the frivolous and uncertain matters of apocryphal writings provide firmness.
For if the words of any person must not be tainted with falsehood, much less should the divine words, which are pure words like silver refined in a furnace, be misused for other purposes than intended.
And since in human affairs, lowly or unknown persons are not admitted to approve matters in dispute, much less in such great matters that require heavenly teaching should the testimonies of unknown teachers or apocryphal writings be admitted.
Scriptures must indeed be tested, scrutinized with subtle examination, and strengthened by the testimonies of the holy fathers, which are to be produced as testimony within the holy church to confirm doubtful matters.
For even the wicked servant in the gospel is reproached by the Lord for not giving the money to the bankers.
Therefore, we ought to give the money to the bankers, lest we be reproached with the same servant.
We give the money to the bankers when we submit any writings of the holy fathers to the examination of the discerning.
The bankers examine the money in four ways: whether the gold is proven, whether it is pure and not internally tainted with any falsehood, whether it is stamped with the inscription of the king rather than a tyrant, and whether it has the full weight of equality.
All these things are sought in the money of the great householder, that is, in the teachings of our Redeemer by the bankers, that is, by the holy and most eloquent men, who test them with the fire from above.
Thus, it is sought whether each scripture's coin is the most proven gold, so that it may adorn the Lord's threshing floor or make the whole work of the sanctuary shine, so that the spiritual brilliance may shine forth in it, by which the divine law is understood and the whole church...
Beauty shines forth.
It is inquired whether it is pure and not tainted inside by any stain of falsehood, lest perhaps the perverse doctrine of some heresy, cloaked in softer eloquence and seemingly mixed with spiritual meanings, lies hidden and obscured within.
And while someone thinks they are receiving the coin of the divine word, they might instead receive the deadly poison of a harmful doctrine.
It is asked whether the inscription belongs to a king or a tyrant, because this is scrutinized with the most diligent investigation by the most learned men in such writings, to see if they pertain to the salvation of the soul and contain the healthy teachings of our King, who is called Savior or Healer.
Lest perhaps by putting these aside, they contain some harmful schemes of the ancient enemy.
And while one should follow Him who said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me,"
who through humility united earthly with heavenly things, one might instead, heaven forbid, follow him who wanted to arrogantly be like the Most High through tyranny and miserably fell by divine and just judgment to the lower realms.
It is also asked by such money changers whether the coin of such a great householder bears the equality of the fullest weight, that is, whether any doctrine conforms to the prophetic and apostolic teachings, lest perhaps it somewhat disagrees with them or promulgates anything superfluous or less complete.
For the gifts of gold and silver, which were offered by the people for the work of the tabernacle, were received by the legislator weighed by the sanctuary's standard.
From this, it is understood that those scriptures or doctrines or even works are truly to be accepted within the holy church by the true legislator, namely the Mediator between God and men, which are not deviated from the standard of the sanctuary, that is, from the norm of the ancient fathers, in their meanings or deeds.
Thus, all these things, when they have been individually examined with prudent scrutiny in the books entitled 'Deeds of the Fathers' or in all doctrines everywhere and found with the utmost diligence, the doctrines or testimonies of those same books are confidently to be brought forward to confirm doubtful matters.
Nor can such currency be disapproved by anyone, which by such bankers has been approved through the investigation of such an examination.
Chapter 12: On Dionysius's report of a lamp burning before Saint Mary's image
It is also read in the reading of the same synod that Dionysius, a priest of the church of Ascalon, reported in the frequently mentioned synod that a certain monk had placed a lamp in front of the image of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and found it still burning after four, five, or even six months.
When this was reported, like the other things mentioned there, it was not brought up for any reason except to establish the veneration of images. However, the same veneration of images cannot obtain any validity from this, as there is doubt about the faith of the one who reported it, whether it actually happened, the time it happened, the place it happened, and the manner in which it happened.
For, since it is entirely unknown whether what the same priest reported actually happened, even if it were proven to have happened in truth, it would need to be more carefully investigated how it is claimed to have happened. Miracles sometimes occur through the unworthy, sometimes through aerial powers, but most often through saints or angelic ministries.
But if it was done through some intricate scheme of the ancient enemy, the veneration of images cannot be established from it and must be rejected along with its author and all his deceptions. If, however, it was done through angelic preparations, as many signs are usually done, even from this, the veneration of an irrational thing cannot grow. It is more credible that this miracle was done out of reverence for the holy place rather than the presence of any image, if it indeed happened.
For basilicas are more venerable than images, and places dedicated to divine worship are more revered than any paintings, as the Lord testified when He said that the altar is greater than the gift offered on it, and the temple is greater than the gold in it, because the gold and gifts are consecrated by the temple and the altar. We read that the blessed Gregory said that in a certain basilica, when an unusually severe flood of waters came, the waters rose up to the windows but could not enter, resisted by the power of the Lord, and the lamps that had been extinguished by the basilica's keepers were later found to be relit by the same keepers. This miracle is said to have been done not by any image, but out of reverence for the holy place.
Therefore, if the miracle reported by the priest of the Ascalon church appeared because of the image, it does not follow that images should be venerated, as not everything through which or in which miracles appeared is believed to be venerated. If everything in which or through which certain miracles appeared is to be venerated, almost nothing will remain that is not venerated, as divine miracles have appeared in so many ways and in almost all creatures. It is idle to dwell on this in our current discussion, as in earlier parts of this work, with the Lord's guidance, a little has already been discussed about this matter.
Chapter 13: That this synod cannot be compared to the Nicene synod
Although this synod was held in the city of Nicaea in Bithynia, it cannot in any way be equated with the holy Nicene synod according to their boast and the flattery of John the priest, because it not only disagrees with it in many respects but does not even fully agree with it in the creed.
For this synod has new and unusual words in its profession of faith that are not noted in the creed of the holy Nicene synod, about which we have discussed at the beginning of the third book of this work, as much as we were able, with the Lord's help. It also includes, after the confession of the Holy Trinity, a confession of venerating images, which we have not found inserted in the oracles of the prophets, the thunderings of the gospels, the teachings of the apostles, nor in the accounts of earlier holy synods or the doctrines of any orthodox fathers.
This synod is far, far removed from that one, especially since that synod brings the Catholic Church back from error, while this one leads it into error; that one drives it away from the most dangerous shipwreck of Arius, while this one pushes it into the shipwreck of image worship; that one teaches that the Son is consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, while this one considers the worship of insensate objects; that one affirms that the Son is equal to the Father in divinity, while this one equates any images of the Lord's ark, the Lord's cross, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, or other most sacred things; that one wisely teaches that the one substance of divine majesty is to be worshipped in three equal, consubstantial, coeternal persons, while this one shamelessly says that images should be worshipped according to the service of the Holy Trinity; in that one, the errors of the Arian dogmas are condemned, in this one their greater errors are nonetheless rejected; in that one, the blasphemies of those who stubbornly neither believe nor confess that the Son is consubstantial with the Father are accursed, in this one the purity of those who, scorning the worship of images, profess with a strong mind and devoted heart that they will serve God alone, is abominated. In that one, after the confession of the Holy Trinity, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come are thoroughly taught by the bishops, in this one, after the confession of the same holy and unique Trinity, the worship of images is improperly established. In that one and other synods, the offering of sacrifices to God for the faithful departed is not prohibited, in this one, curses are laid upon deceased predecessors or parents by their children or successors; and to keep silent about other matters, which are too long to recount, there were 318 bishops in that synod, in this one, as they themselves assert, there were 306.
Therefore, not unjustly, this synod is removed from that one by the number twelve, either because that number contains two perfect numbers, or because in the three, which it has four times, and in the four, which it has three times, the mystery of the Holy Trinity in the four gospels and the Holy Trinity itself as the source of the four gospels is demonstrated, or because that number twelve represents all discipline, distinguishing between creature and creator and leading to higher things, which is entirely lacking in this synod.
However, God is the creator, from whom all things are, through whom all things are, in whom all things are, as the Apostle says: "For from him and through him and to him are all things"; and therefore the Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The creature, on the other hand, is partly invisible, like the soul, and partly visible, like the body. The number three is attributed to the invisible - therefore we are commanded to love God in three ways: with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind; the number four, because of its most evident nature, that is, hot and cold, wet and dry, is attributed to the body; hence the number seven represents the entire creation. When this is joined with the knowledge of the Holy Trinity, the number ten is completed, in which all wisdom is contained.
Discipline related to the education of people: to recognize the Creator and creation, to worship the former as the ruler, and to acknowledge the latter as subject. With this discipline, two most eminent precepts are attached: the love of God and neighbor, forming the number twelve.
For if the previously mentioned number seven, which we said demonstrates human nature as partly visible and partly invisible, is added to the five books of the law, through which we come to the knowledge and love of God and neighbor, the number twelve is nonetheless completed.
If the four books of the Gospels are added to this, the order extends to the number sixteen, because the same number twelve, when multiplied by its parts, reaches the number sixteen: for the six parts it contains twice, the two parts it contains six times, the three parts it contains four times, the four parts it contains thrice, and the one part it contains twelve times, make up the number sixteen.
Thus, through these five parts, in which the figure of the five books is held, and the seven parts, in which visible and invisible creation is demonstrated, and the four parts, in which the holy Gospels are designated, the number sixteen is reached; where the ten commandments of the Decalogue and the sum of six, which in the New Testament is given through the Mediator of God and men, are shown, so that through the twelve apostles and the four Gospels and the sixteen most noble prophets who have books, the minds of mortals are raised to the worship and adoration of one God alone, spurning all vanities.
Therefore, since there are twelve patriarchs, twelve minor prophets, twelve apostles, and many such things that can be investigated by diligent readers in the divine scriptures, there are also many things in the same number that pertain to the physical world.
There are twelve signs in the zodiac circle, which encircle it like a row of gems. There are twelve winds blowing around the world in groups of three from the four parts of the sky. There are twelve months that complete the year. There are twelve hours that complete the day, and many such things that are investigated by learned men according to secular knowledge and understood spiritually according to ecclesiastical doctrine.
For if perhaps some detractor of this work attempts to criticize us for using examples from physical things, that is, those found in "mathematics," let him read blessed Jerome and either criticize us with him or recognize that we follow his teaching and that of the other fathers, who were not ignorant of letters. For the same teacher, while discussing the priestly garment, said: The rationale placed in the middle explains the earth, which, like a point, although it contains all things, is still surrounded by all elements. The twelve stones or the zodiac circle interpret the twelve months, and each verse assigns a specific time, and to these they assign three months each.
Let no one consider this explanation pagan. For if celestial things and God's disposition are defamed by the names of idols, it is not for that reason that the providence of God, which runs, moves, and governs all things by a certain law, should be denied. And in Job, we read about Arcturus, Orion, and Mazuroth, that is, the zodiac circle, and other star names, not that these are the same vocabulary among the Hebrews, but because we cannot understand what is said except with familiar words.
This number is also consecrated with many mysteries, which we cannot recount in detail for the sake of brevity, and so we can know that this synod of twelve bishops was less than that holy Nicene synod, because it is known that it was fortified by the most sacred preaching or authority of the twelve apostles, while this one is mostly foreign; and while that one, adorned with them as with certain impregnable towers, rises to higher things, this one, finding fewer, is mutilated and runs to worse things; that one is adorned with these twelve gems, in which the names of the twelve tribes, that is, the knowledge or examples of virtues of the ancient fathers, are written, which this one completely lacks.
It is known that through these twelve gates of that beautiful city, namely, the most sacred constitutions, mysteries are penetrated, which are not found in this one.
Therefore, we could find no agreement between that city and this one in terms of merits, except for the similarity of names. The former is called Nicene because it was held in the metropolis of the city of Nicaea for the benefit of the Church, and the latter also bears the name Nicene, although it was held there with a different intent and merit. It is not believed that the similarity of names always has the same power, because many names of saints and illustrious men are often found given to unknown people. Indeed, the name does not confer merit equality, but the equality of merit bestows the name's dignity.
Therefore, when they attempt to elevate it with the great insignias of merit because it was held in the same place where the holy synod was previously held, they should notice that the merit is not always the same, just as the merit of any name or place is not always the same.
For places were created for humans, not humans for places, and like other earthly creatures, places do not provide advantages based on their location, but on the eminence of merits. The holiness of any place does not matter much if there is impurity in the actions and merits of people. Evil deeds can be done by the wicked and righteous deeds by the just in the same places.
In the city which was the metropolis of Egypt, said to be founded by the Titans, that is, giants, and called Thanes by them, many astonishing miracles were performed by Moses through the invocation of the divine name, and many tricks were performed by Pharaoh's magicians through their insolent exercises. In the suburbs of the same Thanes, memorable prodigies were performed by the holy men Moses and Aaron, and infamous fabrications by the worshippers of demons with their wicked consecrations and invocations. Thus, the commonality of the place brought no prejudice to the holy men performing pious deeds or to the wicked performing shameful acts, providing a common hospitable ground for both.
The city of Luz in Samaria, which was named Bethel, meaning "house of God," by the holy patriarch Jacob, where he saw a ladder touching the sky with angels ascending and descending, later became a place of offense for the house of Israel with golden calves set up by the wicked king Jeroboam for worship. The place, of which the holy man said, "Truly the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it," and which he admired with great astonishment, calling it terrible and saying there was nothing there but the house of God and the gate of heaven, was later made into an idol's house and a danger for the Israelite nation. Neither the consecration of the stone set up by the patriarch nor the anointing with sacred oil nor the reverent naming could restrain the wickedness of the evil king Jeroboam from his perverse actions, but he did not fear to pollute with idols the place admired by such a great patriarch.
Hence, it is easy to understand that a perverse dogma of worshiping images could be established in the city of Nicaea in Bithynia, where a holy synod was once celebrated, just as idols could be placed in Bethel by the wicked king Jeroboam, where Jacob declared it to be the house of God and the gate of heaven. If, in the future, the place consecrated by such a great patriarch could not retain its vigor, the city of Bithynia in these times will have no defense from the ancient fathers in this matter. It is clear that places can be sanctified by the holy and polluted by sinners due to the diverse movements of people.
We read that the house of God in Shiloh was consecrated by Eleazar and Phinehas, priests, through the placement of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the tabernacle with the fires of sacrifices and offerings, and later polluted by the vile actions of Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, priests.
We also read about the once most noble city of Salem, later called Jebus or Solyma, which is now called Jerusalem by derivation, the first city built after the flood by the holy man Shem.
Tea, as they say, was called Melchizedek, founded and inhabited, and later conquered and occupied for a long time by the abominable race of the Jebusites until the time of David.
We also read that the most sacred and revered Temple of the Lord was planned by David, the most holy of prophets, and dedicated by Solomon. It was frequently attended by angels, illuminated by divine oracles, and prepared by the perpetual observance of the most sacred ceremonies. Because of these notable endowments, it was revered by the ancient fathers. However, it was defiled by the filth of idols and other abominations by subsequent evil kings of the same line, alas! where the Lord had established His sanctuary and the place of His glory. King Manasseh erected altars to the twelve signs and all the host of heaven.
After its restoration and the prophecy of Haggai and Zechariah, we read that the same house was profaned by the Greek kings. The reverence of the place did not restrain the people of those times from committing unlawful acts, their minds having been corrupted by the cruelty of diabolical temptations. The crowds of Jews, relying only on the fortification of the temple and lacking notable merits, were rebuked by the Lord through Jeremiah with these words:  “Do not trust in deceptive words, saying,  'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,' and so on.”
If we come to the times of the New Testament, we find the same profanations of holy places committed by wicked men. It is said that idols were placed by pagans on the rock of the cross, in the place of resurrection, and even in the cave of Bethlehem, where the Lord as a little child cried. Blessed Jerome says that from the time of Hadrian up to the reign of Constantine, for about 180 years, a statue of Jupiter was placed by pagans on the site of the resurrection, and a marble statue of Venus on the rock of the cross, with the persecutors believing that they would destroy our faith in the resurrection and the cross if they defiled the holy places with idols.
Bethlehem, our revered place, about which the Psalmist sings,  “Truth has sprung up from the earth,”  was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is, Adonis, and in the cave where Christ once cried as a little child, the lover of Venus was mourned.
If the grove of Adonis could defile the place of Christ's birth, is it any wonder if a crowd of perverse gatherings could usurp the place of the holy synod for setting up unlawful things? If the place of Calvary, which Christ trod on his glorious path to the triumph of the cross, was defiled by a statue of Venus placed by pagans, is it any wonder if the place once occupied by the notable crowd of holy fathers to strengthen the Catholic faith was later sought by a mad multitude of priests to establish new and contrary constitutions for the church?
And if the place of resurrection, which Christ consecrated by rising and showing angelic hosts to mortals, was profaned by a statue of Jupiter, is it any wonder if the worship of images was established by certain madmen in the same city of Bithynia, where Christ was once proclaimed by venerable prelates to be of one substance with the Father?
These examples can prove that certain power of places cannot always hold the same consistency, because people, being mutable, are not always held by the strictness of one tenacity. Especially since even Judas, who was once an apostle, later became an apostate, and Paul, who was once Saul and a persecutor, later became a teacher of the Gentiles and a preacher. Places that were once dedicated to divine worship were later profaned by pagans, and often, after the abominations were expelled, places that were considered impure were later dedicated to divine worship.
Furthermore, with insolent desire, both these and their predecessors seek to hold a synod and associate it with the six venerable synods, which were held by holy men at various times for certain church benefits, but not with a different faith, and to be considered under the designation of the seventh synod.
Both groups in this matter are believed to have pursued their goals inappropriately, but neither of them managed to achieve their ambitious aims.
So, desiring to abolish what was rashly and excessively done by their predecessors and to establish their own, which was similarly foolish and inept, they recounted a certain parable.
Someone, wanting to add a seventh gold coin to six gold coins, tried to insert the gold coin but is said to have mistakenly inserted a bronze coin instead.
Once the bronze coin was removed, they boasted of having added a gold coin to the gold coins. If they pay close attention, they are believed to have inserted a tin coin instead of a bronze coin.
And the seventh number of the council, which their predecessors wanted to complete with an ecumenical council, they are trying to complete by adding a tin council. But once the bronze coin is removed from the mystery of the seventh number, and the tin coin is also rejected, only six coins will remain.
These six are illuminated by both the perfection of the number and the brilliance of Catholic teaching, in which the purest gold shines in the purity of faith, and the glory of perfection reigns in the number. For in the number six, which is indeed perfect, they seem to hold the perfection of ecclesiastical preaching, so that in three, which is its half, the confession of the Holy Trinity is declared; in two, which is its third part, the unity of the two Testaments or the two talents, namely understanding and action, granted by the Holy and Only Trinity is shown; furthermore, in one, which is its sixth part, either the condition of the old man, who was formed on the sixth day, or the assumption of the new man, whom the Son received on the sixth age of the world for the salvation of humanity, is most clearly demonstrated.
Thus, in these six most sacred councils, both the mystery of the Holy Trinity is preached, the harmony of the two Testaments or the gift of understanding and action is held, and the faith of the Lord's incarnation for human salvation is taught. And, since none of these is lacking to them, they are fortified by the perfection of the number six.
But now, because they so eagerly wish to associate their council with the ancient councils, these ancient councils can indeed be associated with a certain council of the Ariminenses and be numbered together. For just as in that council the confession of the same substance homoousion was rejected, so in this one the worshippers and true adorers of God alone are condemned. And just as in that council the most pernicious doctrine of different substances in the Trinity was established, so in this one the worship and adoration of various things is counted as due to God alone.
Therefore, let the first council in this number be the Ariminensian, the second, the one conducted by their predecessors to abolish the ornaments of the basilicas, and the third, this one, which was conducted by them in the city of Nicea over the worship and adoration of images. However, let the first be a bronze coin, the second a tin one, and the third a lead one, because although they have a great temporal distance between them, they have a concordance in certain errors.
But if the second one is rejected by their pride and ostentation, let us also help them to reject it from this number: and the first, as we said before, be the Ariminensian, and the second, this one conducted by them; the first, as we said before, being a bronze coin, and because it is despised, let the second be counted as a lead coin held by them. And setting these aside, let us be content with only the six holy universal councils and local synods, which neither differ in faith nor in preaching from these, and let us fully prepare ourselves with the integrity of faith and the increase of good works for the dreadful arrival of the final day of judgment, which will be celebrated by His glorious return, about which it was said by the angels to the apostles:
"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven."
Chapter 14: On Gregory of Neocaesarea's statement about Christ's image
Therefore, Gregory, Bishop of Neocaesarea, is criticized for speaking uselessly and covering it with the cloud of incompetence and ineptness.
He is also criticized for saying: "Let them be glad and rejoice and be presumed, those who make, love, and venerate the true image of Christ for the salvation of soul and body," and the rest.
For what it means to "be glad and rejoice" in this statement is easy to understand; but what is meant by "be presumed" does not make any sense to the reader, because it is alien to the rules of meaning and completely foreign to the integrity of Latin expression.
For if he wanted to speak of presumption, this third term does not fit with the sense of the preceding two, unless perhaps he meant those who "rejoice and be glad" are those who presume to worship something illicit and forbidden by the holy fathers, and who are driven by the goads of such presumption, that in the worship of senseless things, they seem to contradict all authentic scriptures.
O demented and laughable statement of the bishop, who, when he said "the true image of Christ," did not clearly show what he meant!
For if he said "true," he spoke most absurdly and incompetently, as it is clear that no mortal can form the "true image of Christ."
For when "true" is said, it is far removed from what is made by artisans, for as much as truth differs from falsehood, so much does the true image of Christ differ from that which is formed by the skilled or unskilled hand of an artisan.
But if he meant the mystery of the body and blood of the Lord, which is taken daily in the sacrament by the faithful - which he almost revealed amidst his nonsensical conglomeration when he said: "Which the perfecter of sacrifice and God, taking from us our whole being, voluntarily handed over to his disciples as a sign and clear memory according to the time of his passion" - he also erred considerably in this.
For he did not offer an image or any prefiguration, but he offered himself to God the Father as a sacrifice for us, and he who was once prefigured to be offered under the shadow of the law in the immolation of the lamb or in certain things imaginatively, truly fulfilling what was prophesied about him by the oracles of the prophets, was presented as a saving victim to God the Father.
Nor did he give us an imaginary sign as the shadows of the law passed, but he gave the sacrament of his blood and body.
For the mystery of the blood and body of the Lord is not to be called an image now, but truth, not a shadow but the body, not an exemplar of future things, but what was prefigured by exemplars.
Now, according to the Song of Songs, the day has breathed, and the shadows have been removed; now the end of the law has come to Christ for the righteousness of every believer; now he has fulfilled the law; now he who sat in the region of the shadow of death has seen a great light, the veil on the face of Moses has fallen, and the veil of the temple has been torn, revealing to us the hidden and unknown things; now the true Melchizedek, that is, Christ, the righteous king, the king of the Father, has given us the sacrament of his body and blood, not the victims of animals.
Nor did he say: "This is the image of my body and blood," but: "This is my body, which will be given up for you," and: "This is my blood, which will be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins."
Therefore, as we have said, since neither the work of artisans can be called the true image of Christ, nor the mystery of his body and blood, which is known to have been carried out in truth, not in figure, Gregory, Bishop of Neocaesarea, is rightly criticized for speaking such foolishness with so many indications and documents.
Therefore, in this matter...
The bishop said about Christ: "Since He is both the perfecter of the sacrifice and God, taking upon Himself our entire human nature from us," it is justly criticized because, although humanity is called a mass of perdition due to original sin, the same bishop carelessly stated that Christ took upon Himself our entire human nature from us.
This is incorrect because, although Christ took on the whole of human nature, namely the flesh with its senses and the soul with its reason—without divinity being changed into humanity or humanity into divinity, but with both natures retaining their properties—God the Word became man in the unity of His person.
However, He did not take on human original sin, and thus it is absurd to say that He took on our entire human nature from us.
Therefore, He did not take on our entire human nature, because He is not to be believed to have taken on the guilt of original sin, which binds all humankind before baptism.
The mass of that ancient sin, with which we are born, is so great that if it is carefully divided, all criminal sins can be found in it: for there is pride, because man loved to be in his own power rather than in God's; sacrilege, because he did not believe in God; homicide, because he cast himself into death; spiritual fornication, because the integrity of the human mind was corrupted by the serpent's persuasion; theft, because the forbidden food was taken; and avarice, because he desired more than was sufficient for him.
With all these sins, the human race is so entangled that even someone conceived in legitimate marriage says: "In iniquities I was conceived, and in sins did my mother bring me forth."
Therefore, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God, took on human nature, not the mass of sin.
But, to return to the point from where we digressed, there is some ambiguity about the profession of the same bishop, who is reported to have said that "Christ took on our entire human nature from us," because either great ignorance compelled him to profess this or enormous error led him to say it.
For while we want him to be both learned and orthodox, desiring that no one should perish following the Lord's example, if he lacks either of these qualities—and he truly does—we would prefer to attribute what he said to ignorance rather than to heresy.
Chapter 15: On Epiphanius's claim about a healing herb near the Lord's image
We have often said in this work, and it is clearly apparent, that almost all their opinions, which they put forward in their synod in support of the veneration of images, are somewhat interwoven with such clouds of ignorance and laziness that their eloquence and sense are lacking, making it difficult for readers to grasp their meaning.
Thus, the most absurd structure of those texts does not clearly express what they wish to convey, but amidst those cloudy words, there are some clear indications, namely mentions of well-known names or things, just like small fires shining through thick darkness, so that through the words and well-known things, the reader's mind perceives what they wish to express.
In the sentence presented, Deacon Epiphanius, if I am not mistaken, tried to express that a woman, healed from a flow of blood by touching the fringe of the Lord's garment, erected a title or image in honor of the same Lord, and touched the fringe of the same image again, under which a certain herb grew, which, if it gradually grew and touched the base of the erected image, would heal all ailments.
In this act - if it is believed to have happened - there is no commendation of image veneration.
If that woman, due to the nature of her sex and a certain lightness of mind, erected an image upon receiving the benefit of health - as she was always seeking the presence of the Lord and unaware that He could be everywhere - who would be so foolish, after receiving the gifts of holy faith and knowing that He is everywhere, to erect an image and worship it?
And if that woman, in a world not yet freed from the worship of idols, acted similarly to the way some statues of dead men were erected in cities for the memory or worship of certain things, who in their right mind would approve of her actions and, believing the Lord to be not in man-made things but in heaven or rather everywhere, strive to act similarly?
Or if perhaps she had a zeal for God in a superstitious manner, but not according to knowledge, who, strengthened in faith as a Catholic, will take her actions as an example in this part and do similar things?
Or if perhaps, in the rudiments of her conversion, she could not yet partake of solid food and thus used tender food so that she might gradually grow in strength to receive solid food, that is, to approach the worship of the invisible and ineffable God through a visible and tangible thing, who, becoming her imitator in this act, would desire to be reduced to the foods of infancy, rejecting the strength of solid food?
Therefore, in the miracle that happens with the herb - if it is believed to have happened - which, as he admitted, heals all ailments, their assertion cannot be supported in any way, because it is not testified to have happened so that herbs or images might be worshipped, but so that the minds of unbelievers might be converted from the vanities of idols to the rudiments of true faith, since according to the Apostle, signs are believed to have been given not for the faithful, but for the unbelievers.
For the Catholic Church, in order to grow in faith, needed to be nourished by miracles, and to strengthen its new plantation, it needed to be fostered by constant irrigations.
Chapter 16: That Epiphanius's statement about consecration without prayer is criticized
Through these actions, we hope to drive away demons by making the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and by making the sign in the air with a finger, we hope to drive away demons. Similarly, we bring the image 'through the name's signification to the first form of honor, and by kissing it and honoring it respectfully, we will receive sanctification; for we also kiss and embrace various sacred vessels and hope for some sanctification.'
"If you see," says Scripture, "a man quick in his words, know that a fool has more hope than he"; and: "In the multitude of words, sin will not be lacking."
According to this sacred Scripture's judgment, Epiphanius the deacon, who is said to have been 'quick in his words' and used 'many words' in the same synod, showed himself to 'have the hope of a fool' more than himself and 'contracted various errors in his multitude of words.'
For while in the previous chapter we discussed some of his nonsense, in this one we must nonetheless discuss it a little more.
We have decided to examine their professions not by their words, but by their meanings, and not to scrutinize their literature, but their sense, because it is endless to seek the order of literature in these things.
No sentence can stand in the lengthy text of the same reading through it, and in the few errors of words and the roughness of unpolished learning, it is easy to argue about the errors of meanings.
Therefore, where there is neither purity of meaning nor integrity of words in the lengthy series of reading, it is difficult to argue about individual points, because the order of disputation is extended infinitely.
For if we dispute about each error of words, while the secrets must be examined and the things pertaining to ecclesiastical matters must be diligently investigated, the multiple rules of grammatical art, which are learned in schools, will seem to be taught.
But while in this work our progress is greatly hindered - either because due to the difficulty of their speech some things they want to signify are difficult to understand, or because their statements, infected with barbarisms and solecisms and other faults, are interspersed in our disputes, because the matter requires it, or because, among their corrupted words, the meanings are likewise corrupted - we, omitting the reproach of words for the sake of brevity, will only touch upon the series of meanings and laboriously make this - since one thing depends on another and one is inserted into another.
It remains, with the Lord's consent, that after postponing the reproach that occurs due to the faults of words, we should only shake the disordered conglomerations of meanings with the blow of a spiritual fist and continue the journey begun and largely completed.
For the aforementioned deacon Epiphanius, whose statement we began to examine, says: "Many things that are consecrated in us do not receive consecration through prayer." Although this, as it is said, has no full sense, we conjecture that he meant to say: "Many things are consecrated in us, which are not consecrated through the priest's prayer or the imposition of hands."
If this is so, how it can be true is not sufficiently clear; for whatever is consecrated in the church: whether ecclesiastical orders, the dedications of temples to be consecrated, or other such constitutions, are done through priestly consecrations according to ecclesiastical custom, since even to the very nobility of the Christian faith, by which one ascends to other degrees, it comes through the imposition of hands by priests and prayers to God in the very beginnings of infancy.
If he wanted to speak about places or vessels or any utensils dedicated to divine worship, in this his statement can be frustrated because there is almost nothing in these, which we have enumerated, that is not consecrated through the prayers and consecrations of priests.
But also, through exorcisms and the sprinkling of salt and water...
The church customarily, all of whose consecrations or institutions are known to have been handed down by the bishops of the church from the very beginnings of the church and are recorded in priestly books.
Therefore, when the deacon brought forward the idea that images, whose worship they absolutely refuse to establish, and of whose consecration there is no ecclesiastical institution, should be associated with vessels or other items dedicated to divine worship, he aimed to introduce the notion that just as these are consecrated without prayers, so too those could be consecrated without prayers.
This effort can be nullified because the consecration of these items is written in priestly books and celebrated solemnly by the priests according to ancient tradition. However, there is no institution anywhere in what is accepted by the church for either consecrating or worshiping images.
As for what he said: "Nor as much as we are venerated and honored and exalted; for he claims that the sign of the life-giving cross without sacred prayer is to be venerated by us," I think he meant that the sign of the venerable cross, which we honorably carry, is held sacred without any specific prayer or consecration by priests, and yet it is considered sacred.
In saying this, as in other matters, he demonstrates his considerable madness, as he does not seek any other consecration for the sign of the cross than that which was made through the Mediator of God and men.
What he added: "And we will be content to receive the sign of its sanctification, through which, made by us, a certain adoration is given on the forehead with sanctification, and which in the air is made with a finger to drive away demons," pertains to what was mentioned earlier.
Therefore, it is evident from clear signs that the sign of the cross holds a great mystery and that images cannot be equated with it, as demonstrated in the earlier parts of this work, as the Lord has deigned to grant.
For while images, as we said earlier, are not sanctified by any prayer or laying on of hands, the sign of the cross, wherever it is brought, is invoked with the divine name. And while these do not have nor can they have any form of consecration, that sign is so sacred by the Redeemer of the world that it needs no consecration, but being invoked with the divine name, it consecrates and blesses other things.
Furthermore, when he said: "Similarly, we lead the image by the name of its signification to its primary form of honor, and by kissing it and honoring it respectfully, we receive sanctification," it is clearly shown to be absurd and irrational.
He claimed that an image could be led to the honor of its primary form, that is, to the veneration of the saint in whose name it is titled. This can in no way be demonstrated by clear reasoning. If merely writing the name leads these items to the honor of the saints whose names are inscribed, then any object to which the name of a saint is attached ascends to the honor of that saint. Therefore, stones, woods, clothes, or certain animals inscribed with the names of some saints would pass to the honor of those saints whose names they bear.
And if the names inscribed cannot lead these enumerated items to the honor of those whose names they bear, then the inscriptions of names do not lead to the honor of the saints either. If this is denied with prudent consideration, it is also rejected with diligent investigation.
Suppose two images of beautiful women without inscriptions are presented to someone who worships images, and he disregards and discards them wherever. Someone says to him: "One of these is an image of Saint Mary, and should not be discarded; the other is of Venus, which should be completely discarded."
He turns to the painter, asking him, since they are very similar in all respects, which one is the image of Saint Mary and which is of Venus. The painter gives one the inscription of Saint Mary, and the other the inscription of Venus: this one, because it bears the inscription of the Mother of God, is elevated.
One is honored and kissed; the other, because it bears the name of Venus, the mother of a certain Aeneas, is cast down, reproached, and cursed. Both are of the same shape, the same colors, and made of the same materials, differing only in their inscriptions.
Let Epiphanius the deacon, who said that images could be "brought to the honor of the original form" through the inscription of a name, tell me, please, where was the sanctity of this one before it was inscribed? Or where was the reproach of that one before it was inscribed?
Therefore, the inscription, which is customarily placed on images, according to the manner of letters, which have so much power that they speak silently and sometimes convey the words of the absent, sometimes even the present without a voice, can bring knowledge, but it cannot bestow sanctification on those images to which it is applied.
For sanctification is granted to rational creatures by the exhibition of good works and the prerogatives of merits; but to irrational and senseless things, such as vessels dedicated to divine worship and similar items, it comes not through any inscription, but through priestly consecration and the invocation of the divine name.
Thus, it is clearly shown by this evident reasoning that no sanctification can adhere to images through any inscription, since this one, which now bears the inscription of the blessed mother of God, Mary, and which once lay despicably discarded, is now adorned with reverence. As much as it could harm its scorners while lying despised, it can equally benefit its worshipers when raised and honored. And as much as it could help if it were raised, it can harm when it is scorned.
As for the statement: "And by kissing it and honoring it with veneration, we will receive sanctification," it would be as meaningful as saying: "We kiss it and honor it with veneration, desiring to receive sanctification from it, which it neither has nor can impart to us."
Therefore, as much as it can give light to the blind when it itself cannot see; a sense of smell to the scentless when it lacks the same sense; hearing to the deaf when it does not hear; speech to the mute when it does not speak; touch to the weak-handed when it cannot feel anything; walking to the lame when it completely lacks this ability; life to the dead when it itself does not live — it can equally impart to us the sanctification that it completely lacks.
In the small remaining part of the passage, there is no need to dwell further because almost all of it seems to be connected to the previous parts. For it says: "For having different sacred vessels, we kiss and embrace these and hope for some sanctification." Sanctification does not come to men through vessels, but to vessels through men by the invocation of the divine name and the celebration of sacred mysteries; nor are images to be equated with vessels, for the sacrifice to God is offered in vessels, not in images. For if sanctification, as we have said, is not imparted to men by vessels that are indeed sanctified, much less will it be imparted by images, which neither can sanctify nor be sanctified.
Chapter 17: That Epiphanius's statement is criticized as most ridiculous
In the same synod, Epiphanius was criticized for saying: "He spoke from his own belly."
Although this statement does not affect matters of faith or this particular issue, we did not overlook it because it sounds ignorant and foolish.
New church constitutions should neither be extended nor derived from such writings, which can be criticized in so many ways.
The holy Catholic Church accepts everything that is above reproach.
However, what is criticized by many is rejected from ecclesiastical doctrine.
The judgment of that reading, which is full of reproaches and such nonsense, should not be used concerning the worship of images.
They indeed said that someone "spoke from his own belly."
This statement is rejected not only by learned ears but also by unlearned ones, and it is dismissed as some old wives' tale.
For the tongue interprets what the mind has conceived from the heart; the belly deals with matters that are expelled into the toilet.
Just as the heart, which is often used in divine writings and common speech to mean the mind or sense, cannot digest food or hold fluids, so too the belly cannot conceive thoughts and produce them as words.
Each body part has its own function, just as the five senses are distributed among five parts of the body, except for touch, which, although thought to reside in the hands, is spread throughout the body.
According to philosophers' experience, fear resides in the heart, joy in the spleen, pleasure in the liver, and the three ventricles of the brain have different roles:
The front one, towards the face, is for sensation; the back one, towards the neck, is for motion; and the middle one is demonstrated to be for memory.
The lungs are for breathing, modulating voices, and taking in air, but the belly, which resembles the shape of the sea, is clearly for digesting food and collecting fluids.
If they want to support the error of this statement with the fact that the belly is often mentioned in sacred writings, such as "My belly is troubled" or "I feel pain in my belly," and similar expressions, they should realize that the term for this body part is used metaphorically, not for speech, but for other things signified by the belly, which are too lengthy to discuss now.
Where it is said, it is metaphorical; this statement, however, is a misuse of words.
Through the metaphor, truth is allegorically shaded, while through the misuse, the purity of meaning is mutilated; the former shines with mysteries, the latter reeks of absurdities.
Moreover, if they meant to refer to the Pythons, whom the Septuagint translated as ventriloquists, about whom it is read in Deuteronomy:
"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire, or practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or a ventriloquist, or one who consults spirits, or one who inquires of the dead,"
even this is not without criticism, because when they said that a man "spoke from his own belly" like a Python, it is not actually from the Python's belly that a man speaks, but an evil spirit speaks.
So only when the Python, who is called a ventriloquist, speaks through the human mouth, the voices of unclean spirits are heard from his belly and answers are given.
It is evident that many such ventriloquists exist among the Assyrians or Egyptians, where magical arts are abundant.
Chapter 18: Against those who compare image critics to biblical figures
As it sounds in this chapter and we have experienced from other statements of theirs, they strive to introduce this argument: that because the sacrifices of slain animals, once offered by pagans to demons, were not omitted by holy men in the old law but were indeed offered to God, it should not be omitted to worship images within the holy church, even though idols were worshipped by pagans. But just as their objections in other assertions on this matter have been in vain, this objection will also be rendered ineffective by a judicious assertion.
It is evident that in ancient times, sacrifices of slain animals were offered to Almighty God by holy men and to demons by the priests of pagans. Similarly, the images of saints were kept in basilicas by Catholics for the memory of their deeds and the beauty of buildings. So, just as the use of sacrifices of slain animals was celebrated by the holy fathers before the law and handed down in the law by the Lord through Moses, they should explain where the practice of worshipping images was instituted before the law by the patriarchs, in the law by the legislator, in the New Testament by the Lord and Savior, or by the apostles or apostolic men. And since their celebration has such an authentic tradition, they should explain what authority the worship of these images holds. When they cannot explain this, they should be ashamed of presenting an unprofitable matter and recognize that they have unjustly tried to associate the worship of images with the offering of holy sacrifices.
How can it be believed that images were created by Catholics to be worshipped, when even the idols of pagans were not originally made to be worshipped?
The use of idols arose when the images or effigies of certain strong men, kings, founders of cities, or inventors of certain arts were created by their loved ones, so that the sorrow of the descendants or admirers might have some remedy from contemplating the images. But gradually, through the persuasion of demons, this error has crept in, so that those whom they had judged to be painted for the memory of their names alone, their successors considered as gods and worshipped, and demons enticed some wretched people to sacrifice to them. We see this example so clearly that the use of images has increased to the point where those that were initially made for the decoration of basilicas and the memory of deeds, are now so exalted by certain Catholics that they are worshipped, and lights, incense, first-fruits, or certain gifts are offered to them. Worse still, as we read happened in parts of Greece, some priests, who should preach that only God is to be worshipped and served, also acknowledge that they serve and worship these images, and judge those who scorn them and worship only God as heretics and seek to anathematize them.
In a similar and almost equal way, as we have mentioned, the use of worshipping and honoring idols or rather demons has grown among pagans, and among Catholics, the most foolish custom of worshipping images has increased, and things made for one purpose seem to be misused for another.
We do not call the images placed in basilicas idols, but to avoid them being called idols, we refuse to worship them, revere them, or offer them service because often it is not the thing itself but the reason for the thing that is considered a sin. Just as many things that can be used well are turned into wickedness when used badly, so the same thing is not a cause of sin for those who use it well and is a cause of danger for those who use it badly.
So, we must be very careful and work extremely hard to ensure that, while some of us try to elevate certain matters beyond what order requires, the ashes of that very old and decayed error don't come back to life and cause us to lose the victory we achieved in the field within the city's walls. The deceptive illusion of a civil war could secretly subdue us in a way that an open attack by an external enemy could not.
So, when they accuse the holy fathers, namely Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and David, we do not want to accuse them but to praise them, as Ecclesiasticus says: "Let us praise famous men and our fathers in their generations. The Lord has done great things by his majesty since the beginning, ruling in their power, great men with virtue and wisdom, honored as prophets, ruling the people in the present and the holy words of wisdom guiding the people," and so on.
Who would have such a profane mind to dare accuse Abel, who was called just by the Lord himself, whose blood is said to have cried out to the Lord from the ground, who is the example and standard for all the just, who first endured persecution and laid the foundations of the city of God, which is gladdened by the river's streams?
Or who would presume to accuse Noah, a just man whom the Lord testified found grace before Him, who was the second father of the human race after Adam, the restorer of the world, and a type of Christ, who was to govern the Church filled with people from various nations amid the immense storms of the world? He was the governor of the ark filled with various animals amid the dreadful waves' crashes, adorned with so many merits that he, along with Daniel and Job, is said to be saved on the day of judgment, according to Ezekiel, who says, "If I send a pestilence upon that land and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it, and Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst, as I live, says the Lord God, they would not save son or daughter; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness." In these three saints, the entire multitude of saints is symbolized: Noah represents the governors of the Church, Daniel the virgins and the continent, and Job the married and the penitent.
Or who would dare accuse the patriarch Abraham, who is the first path of believers and the father of the blessed seed, whose righteousness was counted not by legal observance but by faith, who saw the Trinity in type and venerated the unity in mystery, who was privileged to hear the divine judgment's secret and the miraculous promise of offspring from his aged wife, who symbolically felt the future end-of-the-world tribulations by the excessive terror and darkness that fell upon him at the end of the day?
Or who would presume to accuse Moses, the lawgiver, of whom it is written that he was the meekest of all men on earth, who, as a type of Christ, stood as a mediator between God and men, and after defeating the wickedest enemy, freed the people from Egyptian slavery with terrifying signs and wonders?
Or Samuel, who was consecrated to the Lord from infancy and served in the Lord's army until old age?
Or David, who is said to be a man after the Lord's own heart and was elevated among the merits of the saints, so he prophesied more openly about Christ and is called the father according to his form of service?
If we were to individually recount the praises and mysteries of each, our words would end before the days do. They did not offer pagan sacrifices to God but those full of mysteries, for pagans were not yet called by that name by the villagers of Athens when they were already offering sacrifices to God. And, so to speak, neither was the city of Athens founded, nor had Cecrops handed down to the Gentiles the customs of sacrifices, the erection of altars, and the names of demons, when Abel, Noah, and Abraham had already offered sacrifices to God.
They offered, I say, holy sacrifices either before the law or under the law, hidden in typical mysteries, which were fulfilled in the New Testament by the Mediator.
The prophecies of God and men, having been fulfilled and handed down to the church, will be preserved with the help of God until the end.
Why, then, did the ancient fathers offer visible sacrifices and make offerings to God with physical sacrifices? Let the reader understand through the words of the blessed Augustine. He says,
"What are the spiritual sacred rites, whose images the physical people had to celebrate, so that the prefiguration of the new people would be made through the servitude of the old."
We can also observe the difference between these two peoples in each one of us. It is necessary for everyone to act as the old man from the mother's womb until they reach the age of youth. At that point, it is no longer necessary to think in a physical manner, but they can move towards spiritual matters with a determined will and be regenerated internally.
What happens in the rightly educated individual through the order of nature and discipline is most beautifully carried out in the entire human race through divine providence.
Chapter 19: On the contradiction between Epiphanius's views and his disciples' actions
Those people, about whom we are speaking, rejoice greatly that they have found tools to defend their error in that a basilica is said to have been painted by the disciples of a certain holy man, Epiphanius, on the island of Cyprus, as if nothing can be painted that should not immediately be worshipped.
Since the practice of having or not having images does not harm the purity of the Catholic faith, it is clear that Epiphanius or any other holy man was neither a destroyer nor a worshipper of images, and his disciples or any Catholic men did not paint basilicas with colors so that the paintings would be worshipped, but so that "beauty would be brought to the walls and the memory of events would be instilled in those who looked at them." For just because Epiphanius' disciples are said to have painted a basilica on the island of Cyprus, it does not mean that images will be worshipped, since not everything that is painted is immediately worshipped. If everything painted had to be worshipped, very few created things would remain that were not worshipped. We see in metals molded or sculpted, in gems and notable stones with the amazing skill of the sculptor, in marbles and other stones by the industry of stonecutters or sculptors, in woods carved by chisels, in mosaics of various colors assembled by an artisan, in silk, wool, and colorful linen garments formed with embroidery and weaving, images are made.
Is it because the aforementioned men, namely the disciples of Saint Epiphanius, painted a basilica in Cyprus that all images must be worshipped? Or because they adorned a place dedicated to divine worship with various materials, should we bow our knees, bend our necks, and with frequent sighs, lift our reverently half-closed eyes to each material we mentioned as images? Therefore, it does not follow that because they are said to have painted a basilica, images should be worshipped.
Another reasonable response can be made to this objection, so that their assertion, just as it could not be supported by other objections, cannot be confirmed by this painting in the basilica by Epiphanius' disciples; especially since, even if the disciples of the same holy man had decided to worship the images on the walls, their judgment would have no force, because often well-taught students from good teachers later become corrupt by neglecting their teachers' teachings. If this is carefully investigated, it will be proven with examples from the Holy Scriptures.
Thus, such a great love of money crept into the disciple of the holy man Elisha, who was endowed with the double spirit of Elijah, that having received a gift from a foreigner, he was also infected by a deadly illness, despite the master's rebuke. Neither the prophetic speech, nor the master's teaching, nor the display of terrifying signs, nor the common dwelling with such a great prophet restrained him from the great plague of greed, but the greed that seized him also branded him with leprosy along with the wealth of the Syrian.
Judas also, about whom it is written by the prophet: "The man of my peace, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me," to whom it was once said "But you, O man of one mind, my guide and my acquaintance, who took sweet meals with me," neglected the teaching of the good master - and truly good, who said of himself, "Is your eye evil because I am good," and to whom it is said by David: "You are good, Lord, teach me your goodness;" about whom it is also said by Jeremiah: "The Lord is good to those who hope in him, to the soul who seeks him," - the fury of greed, most capacious and rapacious, seized him so much that he did not hesitate to betray his master, who was not restrained by heavenly words, nor the flood of the fountain of life, nor the display of signs, nor the apostolic fellowship.
Here is the translation of the provided Latin text into modern, easy-to-understand English:
Even the dignity of the apostolic name did not prevent him from committing such a great crime. When he realized his wickedness, he ended his unworthy life with a deserved death. Sedulius says of him:
"Then an apostolic man, now made a worthless apostate."
Nicholas, a disciple of the apostles and one of the seven who, along with the blessed Stephen, was consecrated to the ministry of deacon, later neglected the teachings of his good teachers and the company of good deacons. He became a heresiarch and, instead of instructing in good works with examples and words, as a disciple of the apostles should, he shamefully established a wicked heresy. About this, it is written in the Book of Revelation:
"But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
If therefore, a good prophet's bad disciple is rejected because of greed, and the disciple of our Lord and Savior, a good teacher, becomes a thief and a traitor and is abhorred, and the bad disciple of the holy apostles is cursed for establishing impious doctrines, is it any wonder that the bad disciples of the good teacher Epiphanius become so by instituting the worship of images?
And in saying this, we do not judge them as reprobates, since we do not know their life and conduct, but we assert that if they thought it right to worship images, they are in error. Let us consider Novatus, a priest of Bishop Cyprian, who established the Novatian heresy and followed his own judgment, ignoring the advice of his holy teacher. We also know that Arius, educated by a Catholic teacher, later sowed the seeds of a destructive doctrine. What should I say of each one? Almost all heresiarchs are known to have been disciples of Catholics, for no one could establish a heresy in his own name unless he invented it according to his own judgment.
From these examples, it is clear that the sanctity of the teacher Epiphanius did not benefit his disciples if they are believed to have deviated from ecclesiastical constitutions by neglecting the teachings of their good teacher.
Chapter 20: That equating emperors with apostles is flattery
We find in the true voice of the Lord that the apostles will sit with the Lord to judge: "You," he said, "who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his majesty, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." He himself testifies that he chose them out of the world, so that they would not be of the world, but to bear much fruit: "I have chosen you out of the world," he says, "so that you would not be of the world, and that you would bear much fruit, and that your fruit would remain forever."
They are the salt of the earth, the seasoning of the people, by which all insipid and tasteless things are seasoned and flavored. They are the light of the world, who, with the true light, that is, Christ, illuminate the darkness of the world with the brilliance of their preaching, the darkness of disbelief. It is evident that the Holy Spirit is given to them by the Lord on earth through breathing and from heaven in the fire and division of tongues to indicate the love of God and neighbor.
They are given the power to bind and loose, to forgive and retain sins, to raise the dead, to cast out demons, to heal the sick, and to do other such works. They are granted the authority to teach all nations and to baptize in the name of the Holy Trinity. They are commanded to rejoice because their names are written in the book of eternal life in heaven. They are told: "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see, and the ears that hear what you hear," because, according to the most truthful testimony of the same Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, many prophets and kings desired to see what they saw and to hear what they heard.
For although the distinguished gatherings of all patriarchs and prophets knew by the instruction of the spirit of prophecy that the Redeemer of the world was to come for the salvation of the world and somehow saw him with the eye of inner vision, they burned with desire to see corporeally the one whom they knew was coming corporeally.
While they stand out with so many distinctions of merit and excel in such excellence of blessedness, it is in vain that those whose errors we refute strive to liken their emperors to them. It is clearly evident that the apostles are above the prophets. If, as they dream, their emperors are similar to the apostles, then they are preferred above the prophets, who did not see corporeally Christ, whom they knew was to come corporeally. If they are preferred above the prophets, then they saw the Redeemer of the world corporeally. However, it is very clear that they did not see the Redeemer of the world corporeally. Therefore, their emperors are not preferred above the prophets nor are they similar to the apostles, as they say.
How then can they be likened to the apostles when they are not only not equal to them in merits or endowed with the same brilliance of holiness, but are also seen to oppose their most sacred preachings in many ways? Or how can they be similar to those whose followers they neglect to be?
The apostles followed heavenly things that will last forever, while these follow earthly and perishable things. The apostles, spurning the world, preferred to adhere to the Lord, while these, clinging to the pomp of the world and its fleeting joys, often scorn the Lord's commandments. The apostles suffered persecution for righteousness, while these often persecute for righteousness.
The apostles were handed over in councils and scourged in synagogues, while these are praised in subject cities and acclaimed among the people. The letters of the apostles, bearing the commerce of eternal life, were carried to be read throughout provinces and regions, while the images and effigies of these, referring to some old and pagan error, are carried around to be worshipped in towns and cities. The apostles are said to be blessed by the Lord when people hated and persecuted them and uttered all kinds of evil against them falsely.
When six hundred and eight adversaries lied, they considered themselves blessed because they saw that they were loved, obeyed, and praised by people. To them, it is said, "Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh." To these, it is said,  "Laughter is mixed with pain, and the end of joy is occupied by grief." They were saddened while the world rejoiced, but they will rejoice when the world is saddened again. These rejoice when the world rejoices and will be saddened when the world is saddened. They mourned the harmful acts of the world, whose form they proclaimed would pass away, sowing the seeds of eternal fruit. While these, grounded in the world, embrace the prosperity of the present life, rejoicing in the world's prosperity. They will come to judgment rejoicing, confident of eternal reward, bringing the sheaves of people converted through their preaching. These will come with great trembling to give an account of their works.
But why do we delay further? Why do we wander longer? Why do we gather small flowers from vast forests, of which we cannot even gather a thousandth part? The distance between apostles and emperors is as great as that between saints and sinners. While apostles stand out among all the saints of the New Testament, they are believed to stand out much more above sinners.
Oh, flattery, why do you presume so much? Oh, oil of rancor, exuding more the stench of bitterness than the sheen of sweetness or nectar! You are sold by priests, smeared by bishops on the heads of certain readers. And what the prophet shuddered to have applied to himself: "Let the oil of the sinner not anoint my head," he said, this the assembly of bishops places on the heads of emperors. And what the evangelical virgins said should be bought from sellers, this, alas! the faithful and especially the leaders of the people buy from the bishops.
Therefore, when they confess that the same emperors are made wise and suitable by the Holy Spirit to their perfection, it is evident that all the faithful, who are truly Christians, have the Holy Spirit. As the Apostle says: "Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Him," which is the gift of the Holy Spirit and is poured out after baptism through the laying on of hands and is distributed according to the purity of life in different measures. As the chosen vessel says: "To each one, grace is given according to measure."
Although it is written elsewhere: "For God does not give the Spirit by measure," yet it is imparted to the faithful each according to their measure. But what is said: "For God does not give the Spirit by measure," is understood to refer to the Son alone, who is consubstantial with the Father and the Holy Spirit. To whom the Spirit is not given by measure, for according to Paul's words, it is believed that in Him dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily. But that the Spirit is given by measure and distributes to each one as He wills, this is undoubtedly understood to be said of the faithful. But although it is evident that each of the Catholics has the Holy Spirit, as we mentioned above and illustrated with examples, we do not dare to say or affirm that any man of our age has received the Holy Spirit according to the measure of apostolic grace.
Chapter 21: On their interpretation of the prophecy about the virgin and child
The prophecy, which proclaims that a virgin will conceive and bear a son, should no longer be sought in uncertain and ambiguous terms, but held in the heart. Its hidden mysteries are not in pictures, but in the divine scriptures and their interpreters, namely the apostles and their successors. These should be investigated and viewed with faith rather than with eyes.
For did not the most noble prophet Isaiah, referring to the gospel rather than prophecy, say: 'Unless you draw and worship images, you will not remain'? No, he said: 'If you believe, you will remain.'
Therefore, it is clear that anyone who wants to remain in the integrity of faith in the divine commands and come to eternal reward must have and believe in the instruments that lead to these, not in walls, not in panels, not in paintings, not in any visible things, but in the heart through faith, in the mouth through confession, and in the work through the exhibition of good deeds.
And one should believe that the virgin who brought forth the Savior of the world is not in the works of worldly artists, but in the work of the eternal and indescribable artist, that is, in the heavenly realms. Hence, it is necessary that anyone who wishes to worship her should fix their mind's eye, not on the dyes of colors, not on material works, not on any workshops, but where she reigns with Christ in heaven.
For when they said: 'Seeing this prophecy in a picture, namely a virgin holding the one she bore in her arms, how can we not worship and kiss it? Who would dare to resist with an undisciplined mind?' And we, following almost the same words in sound, not in sense, ask: 'Seeing this painting on a panel or wall, namely a virgin depicted holding a child in her arms, how can we presume to worship an insensate thing and kiss the work of any artist? Who would dare to commit such an act of folly, to give worship due to the Creator alone to created things and, while wishing to favor paintings, resist the holy Scriptures?'
Granted, the image of the holy mother of God is to be worshiped, but how can we know which image it is, or by what signs it is distinguished from other images, especially when there is no difference among them except the skill of the artists and the quality of the materials they work with?
When, therefore, we see a beautiful woman depicted holding a child in her arms, if no inscription has been made or if some inscription has been removed by chance, by what skill can we discern whether it is Sarah holding Isaac or Rebecca carrying Jacob or Bathsheba carrying Solomon or Elizabeth carrying John, or any woman holding her child?
And to come to the myths of the pagans, which are often found depicted, how can we know whether it is Venus holding Aeneas or Alcmene carrying Hercules or Andromache bearing Astyanax? For if one is worshiped for another, it is folly; if something is worshiped that should not be worshiped at all, it is madness. Both must be avoided.
The same blessed virgin is also depicted as having descended into Egypt bearing the child in her arms on a donkey, with Joseph leading, and as having returned from Egypt to the land of Israel. This story is depicted in many materials and not always in churches, but sometimes on dining or drinking vessels, sometimes on silk garments, often on tapestries. Are all these things to be worshiped?
When, therefore, in any of these items the image of the holy virgin holding the child on the back of a particular animal is worshiped, is not the image of the animal also worshiped along with her? For in no way can a separation be made in the worship of the image of both the virgin and the animal, especially since they are of the same material and made by the same artist.
Ingeniously woven together. Either the worship of both is to be scorned, or both should be worshipped. But perhaps some prickly individual will say:
"This assertion of worshipping a living being is to be frustrated, because when we greet any man sitting on a chair or leaning on a staff, we are not shown to be worshipping the chair or staff, but after greeting the man, those remain un-greeted."
These sharp points should be shaken off in this way:
The definition of a man is different from that of a staff or chair; because indeed a man is defined as follows: A man is a rational, mortal, visible animal, and other things of this kind, while a chair or staff is not defined in the same way, but as objects lacking sense and life, prepared by the skill or will of the craftsman for the tasks for which they are necessary, and other such things.
Thus, it is clear that it is one thing to worship a rational man by greeting him, and another to leave a chair or staff, as insensate things, un-greeted.
But in the definition of an image of a virgin or a peculiar "living creature," since both lack sense and life, being made from one material, formed by one and the same craftsman, so cohering together that they cannot be separated from each other without division in the material in which they are placed, there is almost no difference in defining them.
Where there is such a similarity, such a society, such a union of material, either the worship of both is to be accepted, or the worship of both is to be scorned.
Since one cannot be separated from the other without division, and both should not be worshipped lest perhaps the image of the living creature be worshipped, it remains that both should lack the honor of worship and hold their place merely as ornaments in basilicas or in any places, providing a memory of past events to those who look upon them.
Because, with so many branches leading to so many errors, the worship of images cannot be shown to stand within the holy Church by any clear reason.
Therefore, they urge each other to make themselves worthy of kissing or worshipping insensate things, saying:
"Let us make ourselves worthy for such a kiss of worship, so that we may not approach unworthy and suffer the punishment of Uzzah.
Let us indeed make ourselves worthy to worship the divine majesty, or rather be made worthy by Him from whom comes the will and the act, so that as true worshippers we may not worship the Lord in some image according to their vanity, but in spirit and truth, as Truth itself says: 'The true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.'
And that they urge themselves to be made worthy of kissing and worshipping images, lest perhaps they suffer the punishment of Uzzah, let them see that, just as Uzzah presumed without the aid of priests and Levites to think that the Ark of the Lord would fall, these people similarly think that the realm of divine worship would be frustrated without the aid of images, and they may undergo the same fatal punishment.
For just as the Ark did not need the support of Uzzah to avoid falling, nor does the Church need the support of images to stand firm.
And as the Ark, without any need of God, was carried without falling when Uzzah's support was absent, so indeed the Church, governed by the Lord, is preserved unstained without any shipwreck, even when the aid of images is set aside.
What, then, is the meaning of wishing to put a hand to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, which was governed by the Lord to prevent it from falling, if not wishing to admit the worship of images to the Catholic religion, which is governed by the Lord to prevent it from stumbling in this life's journey?
Or to whom can Uzzah be compared, who without the counsel of priests and Levites presumptuously wished to provide new support for the Ark of the Lord, if not to those who, without the teaching of the holy fathers and the consensus of priests established in various parts of the world, arrogantly and haughtily strive to introduce new worship of images into the Christian religion?
Therefore, he lost his life who presumptuously attempted to support the Ark of God, because whoever believes that God, who is everywhere whole and wondrous, needs something in which to be worshipped and worships Him in visible things, must beware lest he lose his life when he resists God's vital teachings with a reckless mind.
Therefore, the same Levite rightly calls Uzzah...
It is said that those who are strong interpret, because those who presume, and who, unless they believe themselves to be strong with a bold mind, would not at all address synods, in which a new decree for the veneration of images would be considered, are active.
Chapter 22: That they disobey their own teachings and wrong their parents
Their unrestrained madness is criticized as in other matters, so also in this one, because they said that their elders "sowed tares instead of wheat in the fields of the Church and mixed water with wine and gave their neighbors a turbulent drink," especially since in this matter, almost in all things in which they are believed to have sinned, these people are considered not only to have not corrected them, but even to have sinned more.
Finally, according to the poet who said:
For soft violet, for purple narcissus,
Let thistle and thorny paliurus arise,
For their ancestors, tares rose instead of wheat, but for these people, with the tares not yet pulled out, paliurus arose, because indeed, neglecting the prophetic and evangelical or apostolic preaching of the wheat, in which places dedicated to divine worship are adorned and only God’s worship and adoration are recommended, they are shown to have received the pernicious doctrine of tares and thorny paliurus in either the abolition of ornaments from the churches or the adoration of those same ornaments.
And those who ought to have refreshed the minds of the faithful with the fullness of the divine word, which satisfies without satiety, strive to infect them with that doctrine, which nurtures immense satiety and madness and injects the stings of errors.
They also said that their elders "mixed water with wine and gave a turbulent drink to their neighbors."
To whom it cannot be objected without reason, that their elders made the wine of the sacred word, which they should have used, insipid by mixing it with water, when they decreed the abolition of ornaments from the churches, but these people have sharpened the drink of the same wine corrupted by water from their predecessors with venom, as they profess to adore images and to render worship to them, and trying to condemn those who disdain their adoration with anathemas.
Then, both do not blush to give a turbulent drink to their neighbors, as they do not delay to corrupt their preaching, which they ought to adorn with sacred words and examples of good works, with vain and extraordinary constitutions and do not hesitate to show it to the present by life or action and to commit it to posterity’s memory by writings.
As for them asserting that they are "wolves in sheep’s clothing and embracing lies while rejecting the truth," they will see this happening in themselves if they carefully consider it.
For while they pretend to have great sanctity, as if burning with its zeal, they rejected images from the churches, so they would not be worshiped, which were not placed for worship by the ancients, and these people establish them to be worshiped, as if burning with excessive love of sanctity, and do not think the gifts of the Catholic faith are sufficient unless they render them worship service, while both act from a vain desire for praise, what else do they do but cover wolves with sheep’s clothing?
Because, indeed, while they pretend outwardly either zeal or diligence of sanctity, they show that they have the wolfish rage inwardly, by which they aim to surpass others and gnaw them with the teeth of anathemas.
Therefore, both pass over the truth and embrace lies, because, while they arrogantly and proudly strive to establish new things, not following the examples of the ancient fathers with humility as leader, they depart from the Truth which neither deceives nor can be deceived, and adhere to that lie, about which it is written: From the beginning, he was a liar and did not stand in the truth.
What, then, is passing over the truth, but opposing the precepts of Christ, who is the author of humility, through boasting?
What is following a lie, but adhering to the examples of him who is the author of pride, by establishing new and illicit constitutions and neglecting the ancient and salutary traditions?
Resisting in their actions:
Both groups act this way when, puffed up with pride, they fall into the error of either breaking or worshipping images.
Furthermore, when they claim their ancestors "brought forth vipers' eggs and weaved spiders' webs," they insult themselves significantly in this respect.
They are their ancestors' eggs because they were either propagated through their flesh, influenced by their teachings, or consecrated through the laying on of hands in church orders.
Therefore, they are their webs, because they were physically descended from them or spiritually instructed by their doctrine.
They rightly call themselves vipers' eggs and spiders' webs because they block their ears to avoid hearing the words of Scripture with their inner ear, which establish the worship and adoration of the one and only God.
They do not fear to weave a web through preaching to capture or entice souls with new and useless regulations.
According to their profession, anyone who desires to be those same eggs will find a basilisk within.
Anyone who seeks to use their preaching finds the deadly breath of tradition in them.
While wishing to find some remedy to satisfy the hunger for the word through preaching, they find the loss of internal salvation and lose life.
Therefore, we do not take their arguments lightly in our debate because we have found that they did not spare themselves in their "debate."
Having received material for reproach from them, we attack them with their own darts.
We do all this not without love, but because we seek their conversion from error, hoping that someday they may despise the monstrosities of their error and desire to follow the path that leads to life forever.
Chapter 23: On their interpretation of adoration and kissing being the same
In the difference between kissing and adoring, which those two think is the same, there is no need to labor much, since these two names differ as much as the things between which these names exist differ. And necessarily, they have a great distinction from each other, as the things themselves often have a great separation between them, especially since sometimes what is adored is not kissed, and what is kissed is not adored. For God is adored but not kissed; saints who have departed from the world with triumphs of merits are venerated, but they should neither be adored with divine worship nor can they be kissed. Conversely, spouses, children, and even servants kiss, but they are not adored.
It is clear that a kiss and adoration are names of two different things. So how can there be such unity in the sense of the names when there is such diversity in the understanding of the things? Or why can't words differ in sense when the origins of the words can differ in practice? For things are not created for names, but names for things. Nor is it to be believed that things are fitted to names, but names rather to things, since it is read that animals were brought to the first man by the Lord to see what he would call them; for the things created by God, the father of the human race gave names, not things created by him to which he would give names, having seen them brought to him.
Finally, the philosopher Plato stated that names are natural and tried to prove this by saying that they are a kind of furniture and instrument for producing senses. The furniture of natural things are natural: like eyes are instruments for seeing, which is a natural sense; therefore, eyes also must be natural. Likewise, speech is the furniture and instrument of natural things, that is, sentences; therefore, it too is natural. Aristotle, however, says that speech is not according to nature but according to convention; hence, speech is not natural furniture. For he does not say that it is not an instrument, but only that speech is a thing according to position, through which we demonstrate our own sentences. The same philosopher, to whom the greatest faith is to be given in this part, says in the book "On Interpretation" that a name is a significant voice according to convention without time, that is, a name is a voice. But some things signify, others do not; however, a name signifies that of which it is a name. Therefore, a name is a significant voice. Some significant voices are natural, some are not natural. A natural significant voice is like that which naturally shows pain or joy, such as interjections; not naturally significant voices are those which we say exist according to position. According to position are those which humans have placed themselves, as shown in the earlier example taken from Genesis, which would be too long to follow individually. Meanwhile, it is clear that "kiss" and "adoration," or "to kiss" and "to adore," are two things often very different from each other.
According to the masters of secular literature, there are three things through which every conversation and dispute is perfected: things, intellect, voices. Things are what we perceive with the mind's reason and discern with intellect, such as to adore or to kiss or something similar; intellect is a certain vigor of the mind, by which we learn the things themselves and discern how they differ from each other; voices are those by which we capture what we understand with intellect.
We clarify that for what is worship, we say worship; for what is to kiss, we say a kiss. There is another thing that signifies sounds: these are letters; for the writing of these letters signifies sounds.
So, when there are four things: object, understanding, speech, and letter, the understanding grasps the object, speech designates the understanding, and letters signify the speech itself.
Hence, the aforementioned Aristotle in his "Peri Hermeneias" said: "Those things which are in speech are the symbols of the affections of the soul; and those things which are written are the symbols of those that are in speech; and just as letters are not the same for all, neither are sounds the same."
But the affections of the soul, which these first symbols signify, are the same for all, and their likenesses are also the same objects, according to the explanation of the most learned man, Boethius, who designates a certain passion of the soul as understanding; because, as Boethius says, unless the soul receives a certain likeness of the thing that one understands in the rational soul, there is no understanding.
For when I see a square circle of the sky, I conceive its shape in my mind, and its likeness is formed in the reason of my soul, and the soul receives the likeness of the understood thing. Hence, understanding is both the likeness of the thing and the passion of the soul.
Of these four, two are natural, and two are according to human convention. Voices and letters are according to convention, but understanding and objects are natural. This is proven by the fact that different peoples use different voices and letters; because they themselves composed the voices they would use and the letters they would write.
However, no one created understanding and objects; they exist naturally. For what is a horse among the Romans is not a deer among the barbarians, but the nature of things is the same among different peoples. Therefore, what we understand to be a horse, the barbarians do not consider a deer, but the understanding and reason of substances are established the same among very different peoples.
Therefore, two of these are according to human convention: voices and letters; and two are according to nature: objects and understanding.
These teachings show that worship and a kiss are not the same thing, even though among the Greeks these two names have some consonance. Often, two or more names have the same meaning as synonyms, and often one name signifies two or more things as homonyms: yet the order of things is not confused or somehow mutilated if names are given to them by humans in very different ways according to their pleasure.
Meanwhile, they add a third thing to these two, so that 'to worship', 'to kiss', and 'to embrace' are all one. But just as those two are separated from each other, so certainly this third one is separated from those two; because, as we mentioned above, some things are worshipped but not immediately kissed, some things are kissed but not immediately worshipped, and many things are embraced which are neither worshipped nor kissed.
Anyone embraces a tree or a stone or any other thing in a certain situation, to which it would be superfluous to give a kiss, yet does not worship it. One also kisses someone of higher status, to whom one scarcely dares to approach with reverence restraining them, yet does not embrace them. As much as these three are seen to differ from each other in sense, so certainly the same examples, which are set forth to prove that they are one, are seen to differ from reason, since they have a great distance from each other and no consonance with reason.
They say: "The same of the holy princes of our doctrine and their successors, the excellent fathers of our fathers, and these are worshipped, that is to say, kissed; for both are the same; the common ancient Greek expression signifies to kiss and to embrace, and it signifies some extension of love, just as I bear and offer, I affirm and confirm, I participate and adore, which demonstrates the kiss and the extension of friendship."
O sense, confusing rather than arranging sentences, breaking words rather than pronouncing them! O acumen, blunter than any pestle, O leaden maces, blunting the edge before cutting the thing for which they are applied! O sword, more like a hammer delivering blows rather than cutting!
Sword cut, breaking the material rather than cutting it! Oh, argument that asserts nothing except the madness of its authors, valid only in its own case, showing no firmness regarding the proposed matter, but only revealing that its bearers are foolish!
From the fact that "fero" (I bring) and "offero" (I offer), "adorare" (to adore), "osculari" (to kiss), and "amplecti" (to embrace) are said to be one and the same, while ignoring the power of prepositions, which often corrupt other parts, are often corrupted by other parts, sometimes both corrupt and are corrupted, and sometimes neither corrupt nor are corrupted, and these meanings sometimes increase, sometimes decrease, sometimes change, while seeking to assert some empty things, it strives to prove them with empty assertions!
Who then does not know that "offero" (I offer), "affero" (I bring to), "effero" (I carry out), "infero" (I bring in), "confero" (I confer), "aufero" (I take away), "defero" (I bring down), "refero" (I bring back), "suffero" (I endure), "differo" (I differ), "profero" (I bring forth), "prefero" (I prefer), "perfero" (I carry through), and so on, although they come from the verb "fero" (I bring), with prepositions added and in some part corrupted, they differ greatly from each other in meaning?
Or who does not know that "participo" (I share) and "adoro" (I adore) have almost no agreement in sense? For "firmo" (I strengthen) and "confirmo" (I confirm), although they are common in sense, seem to be entirely foreign to the thing to which they are applied. If we were to discuss all these things individually as it is taught in grammar schools, these matters would barely be contained in the text of one book.
But it must not be overlooked that they complete their very vain argumentation with a certain frivolous and empty conclusion, as if by a certain convertible syllogism, saying: "For what one loves, one also adores, and what one adores, one also loves," not knowing that these two can hardly be interchanged, because they are unequal and "to love" can extend further than "to adore." For one loves his wife or child, yet does not adore them; he loves a servant, a maid, a horse, a dog, a hawk, and so on, yet does not adore them. Therefore, as it is true when one says, "what one adores, one also loves," it cannot be equally true when one says, "what one loves, one also adores"; for this inversion cannot reasonably stand, since one of them, as we said, extends further and there is no such property in these that they can be believed to be mutually interchangeable.
Thus, as it can be said in reverse order: "what is neighing is a horse, and what is a horse is neighing," it cannot be rightly said: "what one loves, one also adores, and what one adores, one also loves," because even in the same topics from which these arguments proceed, in the same argumentation called by the name of consequent, in which something inevitably follows the proposed matter, like what we said about neighing and the horse, many things can be reversed, but some things cannot be reversed. For example, it can be reversed if someone says: "If it is laughable, it inevitably follows that it is a human, and if it is a human, it is necessarily laughable," and other similar things. However, it cannot be reversed if someone says: "If it is day, it is light"; for it follows that, if it is day, it is light; if one is full, it follows that he has eaten; if he is drunk, it is certain that he has drunk; if he is learned, it follows that he has studied; if he adores, it follows that he loves what he adores.
It cannot be said in reverse order: "if it is light, it is necessarily day"; "if he has eaten, it follows that he is full," since many things are light but not day, and often eating does not reach fullness; nor can it be said: "if he has drunk, he is drunk," "if he has studied, he is learned," "if he loves, he adores," since sometimes drinking does not reach drunkenness, nor does learning reach mastery, nor does love reach adoration.
Therefore, let each be considered according to the experience of dialecticians, so that it may be more easily apparent how much these two differ from each other or how this inversion cannot stand. For there are four propositions somehow related to each other, which philosophers have been accustomed to write in a square form for examination, so that the first two are: "Everything that loves who...
Yes, he worships, and nothing that one loves is worshiped. There are two characters:
Something that one loves is worshiped. Something that one loves is not worshiped. The first two are called universal affirmation and universal negation, and the next two are called particular affirmation and particular negation. The two higher ones are completely contrary to each other, whereas the two lower ones are mutually subcontrary. The universal or particular affirmation and the universal or particular negation are nonetheless called subaltern.
Then sense inquiries are drawn almost like two angular lines: one from this universal affirmation, "Everything that one loves is worshiped," to this particular negation, "Something that one loves is not worshiped." The other from this particular affirmation, "Something that one loves is worshiped," to this universal negation, "Nothing that one loves is worshiped." They are contrary or opposite to each other. With these thus opposing each other, since both the universal affirmation and particular negation or the particular affirmation and universal negation cannot truly exist, one will be false and the other true. Thus, the true one will invalidate the false one. If that one is true, the other will soon depart from the truth.
Apuleius, the Platonic philosopher of Madauros, who very subtly debated this kind of syllogistic industry in the book titled On Apuleian Periermenias, says: "The universal, he says, when proven, confirms its particular, but when refuted, it does not inform it. The particular, however, when reversed, securely weakens the universal truth. When proven, it confirms it, but when refuted, it does not confirm it."
Therefore, in this argumentation, there are two higher universals: "Everything that one loves is worshiped," and "Nothing that one loves is worshiped," which are false because, as stated above, a person loves many things that are not worshiped, and some of the things that one loves are worshiped. There are also two lower particulars: "Something that one loves is worshiped," and "Something that one loves is not worshiped," both of which are true because one loves God according to: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart," and worships Him, from whose most holy love the nourishment of all virtues proceeds. One loves one's neighbor and venerates him with the duty of greeting. In this, the proposition "Something that one loves is worshiped" is proven true. This is also true: "Something that one loves is not worshiped," according to examples of a spouse, child, horse, dog, hawk, and other things mentioned above, each of which is loved but not worshiped.
Universals and lower particulars are alternately opposed to each other. If this universal affirmation is false: "Everything that one loves is worshiped," then this particular negation is true: "Something that one loves is not worshiped." If this particular negation is false, the universal affirmation is true. Again, if this universal negation: "Nothing that one loves is worshiped," is false, this particular affirmation: "Something that one loves is worshiped," is true. If this is not true, neither is that false. However, the two lower ones are completely true, so the two higher ones are to be believed as entirely false.
Regarding the conversion of such propositions, about which we have discussed a little above, the aforementioned philosopher says thus: Convertible propositions are called universal negation and either of its particulars, that is, particular affirmation, because their parts, subjective and declarative, can always maintain their positions with each other while retaining the condition of truth or falsity. For if this proposition is true: "No wise man is impious," then, if you reverse the parts, it will certainly be: "No impious man is wise." Similarly, if it is false: "No man is an animal," then, if you reverse it, it will be false: "No animal is a man." By the same reasoning, the particular affirmation is reversed: "Some grammarian is a man," and conversely: "Some man is a grammarian." The other two propositions cannot always do this, although they are sometimes converted. Yet, they are not called convertible for that reason.
Finding the meaning through all indications is necessary. Even if it is converted, it should match. There are not just one of these, but five, for it either declares a property, a kind, a difference, an end, or an accessory.
Therefore, to counter their statement and support our claim, many arguments of this kind could be used. What has been used could have been discussed more extensively, but for the sake of brevity, these and similar ones are omitted.
For this reason, we have prepared, with the Lord's help, to refute their assertion with arguments derived from the deliberate art of dialectics. We have found that they, by some kind of conversion, wanted to support their nonsense with a sort of syllogistic argumentation.
Chapter 24: On their arrogant claim of presiding with Christ as head
About what they said arrogantly and ignorantly: “Similarly, we joined those who came from the East in the same metropolis of Nicaea and made Christ the head while all of us presided.”
The most arrogant and rather absurd statement of those who boasted that they made Christ their head, saying, “While all of us presided, we made Christ the head,” is strongly criticized. For the same Lord, who is the head of the Church, made the Church His body, not that He was made head by the Church. The Apostle himself testifies, saying: “You did not choose me, but I chose you”  John 15:16. For if, according to their foolishness, Christ was made head by them, then He was indeed chosen by them; and if He was chosen by them, the aforementioned statement of the Lord is invalidated. However, the aforementioned statement of the Lord is not invalidated, so according to their vanity, Christ was not made head by them.
Therefore, it must be avoided that these people might be exempt from His selection, who boast that they made Him their head, for indeed, as we infer, if they had been chosen by Him, they would seek His glory, not their own, and they would preach the worship of one God, not senseless things. For by the fruits, a tree is known according to the statement of Truth, and in the nature of things, the cause is often known by the effects. When someone sees smoke, they do not doubt that there is fire beneath; or when they see the footprint of an animal, they do not doubt that the same animal has passed by; and when someone sees a good work, they do not doubt that it is from God, who is the author of all good things; and when someone sees something wrong, they believe it is perpetrated by the machinations of the ancient enemy.
Saying this, we do not rashly judge anything about their selection, as often well-established things are found to be corrupted, but we firmly affirm that they are not chosen to establish ecclesiastical constitutions through them and boast that they made Christ, who is the life of all who believe in Him, their head.
Suppose they were chosen by Him and appointed to the priesthood by Him. Why do they not follow Him in humility? Why do they seek their own glory rather than His, who testified that He sought not His own glory but the glory of Him who sent Him? Why do they neglect to put aside arrogance? Why do they inappropriately seek high positions? Why do they disturb the prosperity of the Church with a kind of civil war? If they were content with the teachings or examples of the ancient fathers, they would neither disrupt domestic peace with erroneous constitutions nor turn the weapons of their allies, who would fight against the enemies with them, against themselves. This indeed is a useless statement, in which they dream that they made Christ their head, although it does not detract from the faith, it is not free from criticism. For we do not believe them to be of such immense insanity that they meant to say that the same Lord was made by them, which indeed no faithful ears can bear to hear.
But because they wanted to signify something else and signified something different, we were pleased both to discuss what they said and not to leave undiscussed what they intended to say. For, if we are not mistaken, they wanted to say: “While we, who are members of Christ, preside, we have placed all firmness of our work and hope in Him, who is our head, and we have decided to follow Him,” or something of that kind, which can be inferred. And from what they intended to say, they, uplifted by their inept words, said “we made Christ our head,” and they say that what John the Evangelist said: “All things were made through Him”  John 1:3, was made by them.
In the creed of the synodal constitution, it says about Him: “Begotten, not made”; and the Apostle says: “Who was made of the seed of David”  Romans 1:3. This is resolved thus: because as God, all things were made through Him, but as a man, He Himself was also made, as Solomon says: “Wisdom has built her house”  Proverbs 9:1, that is, the wisdom of God the Father, without whom the Father was never, which was not made by Him, but born, namely the Son, who is of one substance with the Father, built for Himself a body in the womb of the Virgin, which He called a temple, saying: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up”  John 2:19.
It may seem to contradict what is said: "For what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
It should be noted that the works of the Trinity are inseparable, and what the Father does, the Son does, and the Holy Spirit does as well.
Just as they are of one majesty, one substance, and one will, so too are they of one operation.
The entire Trinity was involved in the incarnation of the Lord, but only the person of the Son took on flesh.
For if the body was made by the action of the Holy Spirit, which we also consider to be possible, why was it attributed to the person of Christ? This can be questioned.
The action of the Son is the action of the Father, because their power is one and the same; similarly, the action of the Holy Spirit is the action of the Son of God due to the unity of their nature and will.
Whether the Father acts, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit, it is the Trinity that operates, and whatever the three do, it is the operation of one God.
The church can also be understood as the house of Christ, which he built for himself with his blood and adorned with the gems of virtues and the most elegant ornaments of teachings.
Those who are not content with these, while they seek to add something new to its beauty, are known to impart ugliness rather than beauty to it.
Chapter 25: Against those who argue Epiphanius would have listed image worship as a heresy
They thought they had found a great defense for image worshipers in the fact that Epiphanius, who distinguished the varieties of heresies in eighty chapters, if he knew the worship of images was a heresy, would count the worshipers of those images among the heretics. They tried to attack us, who are content with the worship and adoration of God alone, using these weapons. They attempted to pierce us with these arrows, to defeat us with these spears, and believed they would be the invaders of our freedom with these swords, saying: 'If he, who generally discussed all heresies, knew this to be a heresy, he would also include it among the other heresies in his discussion'; but he did not place it among the heresies he discussed, so it should not be considered a heresy.
We thought it appropriate to respond to them in turn and, with the Lord's help, to defeat them with their own weapons and to direct the same spears they threw at us back at them, saying: 'If the same Epiphanius knew that those who scorn the worship of images were heretics, he would undoubtedly count them among the heretics in his general discussion of heresies'; but he did not count them among the heretics, so he must not have believed them to be heretics.
However, it is shown by these signs that Epiphanius not only spurned the worship of images but also did not want them to be in churches. In the letter that he sent to Bishop John, which Jerome translated from Greek into Latin, it reads: 'I heard some murmuring against me when we were going together to the holy place called Bethel to hold a church service with you as usual, and when I returned to the village called Anablata, I saw a lamp burning there and asked what place it was, learned that it was a church, and entered to pray, I found a curtain hanging in the doorway of that church, dyed and painted, having the image of Christ or some saint—I do not remember whose image it was. When I saw this in the church of Christ, contrary to the authority of Scriptures, I tore it down and advised the guardians of that place to use it to wrap a poor dead person and bury him'; and they murmured against me, saying: 'If he wanted to tear it down, he should have given another curtain and changed it.' When I heard this, I promised to give one and immediately send it. There was a slight delay as I was seeking the best curtain to send; I thought it would have to be sent from Cyprus. Now, however, I have sent what I could find, and I ask you to order the presbyter of that place to accept the curtain from the bearer, which was sent by us, and henceforth to instruct that such curtains, which go against our religion, should not be hung in the church of Christ. It is fitting for your honor to show this greater concern and meticulousness, which is worthy of the church of Christ and the people entrusted to you.' This is the opinion of Epiphanius on this matter, which whether it is praiseworthy or blameworthy is left to the reader's judgment.
Furthermore, let us come to the blessed Augustine, let the very wise man be asked, let the excellent doctor be inquired, let him say whether any heresy uses the worship of images. For the same venerable man wrote a book on eighty-nine heresies, among which two include the worship of images, namely the Simonians and Carpocratians. To make this clearer, let the opinions of the aforementioned doctor, as found in the same book, be stated one by one. He says: 'The Simonians are named after Simon Magus, who, baptized by Philip the deacon, as it is read in the Acts of the Apostles, wanted to buy the power from the holy apostles with money so that the Holy Spirit would be given through the laying on of his hands. He deceived many with magical tricks. He taught detestable depravity...'
Using women differently. He did not say that God made the world.
He also denied the resurrection of the flesh and claimed to be Christ.
He also believed he was Jupiter and worshiped himself, while considering Minerva to be a certain prostitute named Selene, whom he made his partner in crimes.
He provided images of himself and this prostitute for his disciples to worship, which he had established in Rome as public idols.
In that city, the blessed apostle Peter extinguished him through the true power of the omnipotent God.
For he had claimed to have given the law to Moses on Mount Sinai in the person of the Father, to have appeared in the time of Tiberius in the person of the Son, and later to have come over the apostles in tongues of fire as the Holy Spirit.
But he said Christ neither came nor suffered anything from the Jews.
Just as the heresy that originated from Simon, called Simoniaca, is completely rejected by the faithful, so too should the practice of worshiping images be entirely rejected.
There is another heresy which recounts this error, which the mentioned doctor wrote about: The Carpocratians began from Carpocrates, who taught every vile act and every invention of sin, claiming that there was no other way to escape and surpass the rulers and authorities who approved of these things, in order to reach the higher heaven.
He is also said to have considered Jesus to be merely a man born of both sexes but to have received such a soul that he knew heavenly things and announced them.
He rejected the resurrection of the body along with the law.
He denied that the world was made by God, but by certain powers.
A woman named Marcellina is said to have been associated with his sect, who worshipped images of Jesus, Paul, Homer, and Pythagoras by offering incense.
For if perhaps someone advocating this error says: Blessed Augustine considered the worship of images among heresies because some pagans, that is Simon, Selene, and even Homer and Pythagoras, worshipped images, let him note that images of Jesus and Paul were also said to have been worshipped, and this was counted among heresies by the aforementioned man.
For if he knew that images made by human hands of the Lord, the apostles, or any saints were to be worshipped, he would never have counted the worship of images of Jesus and Paul among the heresies.
Chapter 26: Against those who place sacred images in polluted areas
So, these people, about whom we are speaking, combine two things that contradict each other in this matter.
Namely, they often call these images holy and venerable and assert that they should be placed in streets or squares, which are often polluted.
Just as light and darkness, heat and cold do not agree, it is clear that holiness and contamination, purity and impurity do not agree.
Hence, it is evident that they make a great error when they assert that these images are holy and decide that they should be placed in contaminated places.
For it becomes somewhat clear in this judgment of those who order them to be placed in the streets or squares of cities and towns, that these images lack holiness, as they indeed do lack it.
If they were believed to be holy, they would be placed in holy places.
Everything holy is clean, nothing clean is impure, therefore nothing holy is impure.
If they seek to place these images in the seats of impure places, they do not scorn uncleanness, which is contrary to holiness.
If they do not scorn uncleanness, they can by no means be called holy.
If they seek the seats of impure places, they can by no means be called holy.
For, to pass over other examples, which can teach that each thing should be applied to a suitable thing rather than an unsuitable one, let us bring forth the precepts of the very leaders of eloquence.
They have thoroughly decreed in eloquence that the thing, place, time, and person should be considered.
Lest grave matters be spoken to light-minded people, modest things to shameless people, wanton things to serious people, immodest things to modest people, unchaste things to chaste people, ridiculous things to sad people, profane things to religious people.
Everything in the art of eloquence should be so appropriate that nothing is inappropriate, nothing contradictory, but that everything remains moderated according to the quality of places and times.
If this has been commanded to be observed by orators in the art of eloquence, it must be observed by us much more in the practices of our religion.
So that everything pertaining to religion is observed and held as reason and order require.
Chapter 27: On the potential for deception by poorly painted images and the poor's lack of access
All arts involve various practices, and painting is an art.
Therefore, the practice of painting involves various activities; and those who practice it, called painters, understand it to varying degrees: some more, some less.
Some produce more beautiful works, others less attractive ones; some create lovely images, others create ugly ones.
Thus, it is evident that those who place almost all their faith on images and do not hesitate to count their worship among the tools of good works are in some way deceived by worshipping sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly images.
For if any image is more sacred and virtuous the more beautiful it is, then it must be that the less beautiful an image is, the less sacred and virtuous it is; and if the less beautiful one is less sacred, then any very ugly image must have little or no sanctity and virtue.
And if the more beautiful one is worshipped more attentively because it has more virtue due to its beauty, then its sanctity does not come from a certain religious aspect but from the work of the artist.
And if an image that is less beautiful or has no beauty at all is worshipped, its worshippers are greatly deceived, as they worship things without beauty.
If, therefore, it is appropriate to worship all images equally, whether beautiful, less beautiful, or lacking beauty, justice, which gives each its due, must be removed from things.
For when they worship beautiful images, thinking by some chance that they are worshipping something holy, they are deceived; and when they worship ugly paintings deliberately, they are also deceived, as they worship ugly things as if they were holy things.
So, whether they worship them by chance or deliberately, they are deceived.
Truly, they are rightfully deceived, who, when God, the creator of all, has decreed that He alone should be worshipped, strive to worship certain insensible things; and while they think they are showing some veneration to saints by worshipping images, they actually extend a certain community to divine worship alone.
Since, therefore, only God should be worshipped, while martyrs or any saints should be venerated rather than worshipped, as we have already said and as is proven by the teachings of the illustrious doctor Jerome: who, while writing against a certain heretic Vigilantius, who claimed that the relics of martyrs should not be venerated, said among other things: "Who ever, O insane head, worshipped the martyrs?"
Therefore, according to his statement, if martyrs are not worshipped, much less should their images be worshipped by the faithful.
As for what is read in the books of Kings, that Saul worshipped Samuel, who was raised by the witch of Endor, it can be understood that it was not the soul of Samuel that was raised, but some deceptive image of diabolical trickery appeared to King Saul, either because he allowed himself to be worshipped, which a holy man would not permit, or because he told the wicked king: "Tomorrow you will be with me," when clearly the heinously wicked king would not be with the prophet after dying but with the devil, who, leading those he lures to commit evil deeds in this world, drags them with him to eternal punishments in the future.
Hearing this prophecy, the king of immense guilt, understanding in what guise he had been raised, thought it to be Samuel.
He reported what he understood, and because he did not understand correctly, he worshipped someone other than the Lord, and thinking he was worshipping Samuel, he worshipped the devil, so that Satan might enjoy the fruit of his deception.
For Satan strives to be worshipped as if he were God.
If Samuel had truly appeared to him, the just man would not have allowed himself to be worshipped, having preached that only the Lord should be worshipped.
And how could the man of God, who was with Abraham in comfort, have said to the man deserving the torment of hell: "Tomorrow you will be with me?"
With these two points, foolish Satan exposed the subtlety of his deception, for he allowed himself to be worshipped under the guise and name of Samuel, which I believe Samuel would never have done.
He wouldn't allow it, and a man burdened with sins, with a great distance between sinners and the righteous, would be, as he falsely claimed, with the most righteous Samuel. The truth can be seen if Samuel's name is not mentioned, because Saul was going to be with the devil. For he transferred to him, whom he worshipped, although both blessed Augustine and other teachers have different opinions on this matter, and the book of Sirach praises Samuel because he prophesied after death.
Now, those who think that almost all the privileges of the Christian faith lie in the adoration or worship of images should be asked whether the poor suffer a loss of faith because they lack the means to acquire pictures due to their poverty. If a poor person is therefore deprived of good merits because he lacks the resources to acquire images, does a wealthy person gain the privilege of merit because he has the resources to buy pictures?
And if one receives rewards or punishments for possessions, not merits, and the other is judged for his lack, not works, the adoration of images will rise to a great height in the Christian religion, and justice, which examines anyone's merits, not possessions, will lose much of its power. Since none of these things can be confirmed by any logical consequence, it remains that the worship of images is believed to hold no principal place in the Christian religion.
Chapter 28: That they wrongly call their synod 'universal'
Among the various absurdities said to be done or written in that same synod, this one is no less absurd than the others: they call the same synod universal, even though it neither holds the unshaken purity of universal faith nor is confirmed by the actions of all churches.
As the universal church is what is called "catholic" in Greek, similarly, anything that does not depart from its unity can be called catholic.
For all Christian doctrine or any constitution or tradition must be such that it agrees with the universal church.
Heretics, however, have not observed this, as they have established certain small gatherings in various parts of the world, confined to some regions, thereby separating both themselves and many others from the fellowship of church unity.
When the bishops of two or three provinces come together, if they establish something in preaching or doctrine based on the institution of the ancient canons and it does not differ from the doctrines of the ancient Fathers, what they do is catholic and perhaps can be called universal;
because, even though it was not done by the bishops of the entire world, it does not differ from the faith and tradition of all.
We know that this has often happened in many parts of the world due to certain pressing needs.
For many councils have been held, whose institutions strengthen and support the holy church.
However, if the bishops of two or three provinces come together and, desiring to establish some new things, form certain small gatherings which do not agree with the universal church but differ from it in some way, what they do is not catholic and therefore cannot be called universal.
Everything that belongs to the church is catholic, and everything that is catholic is universal; and everything that is universal is free from the novelty of profane words.
Therefore, everything that belongs to the church is free from the novelty of profane words.
For if this synod were free from the novelty of words and content with the doctrines of the ancient Fathers, it could be called universal.
However, it is not content with the doctrines of the ancient Fathers, and thus it cannot be called universal.
The term "universal" comes from "URO," which means "to turn many times into one"; a multitude of units gathered into one by turning becomes a universality.
We would certainly not hesitate to declare the same synod universal, if we did not feel that it contradicts the doctrines of the universal church.
