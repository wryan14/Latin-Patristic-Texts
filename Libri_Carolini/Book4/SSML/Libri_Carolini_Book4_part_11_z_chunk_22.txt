    <s>The apostolic preaching advises us to test everything and retain what is good.</s>
    <s>This can be understood especially regarding the diversity of doctrines.</s>
    <s>It did not permit us to taste all acts or even things, as if pre-tasting everything, retaining only the good and discarding the bad, which cannot be done without committing some unlawful acts.</s>
    <s>Instead, we are commanded to test and taste all doctrines with a spiritual palate, retaining only those that refresh our minds with internal satisfaction from the most proven men, while rejecting all others along with their authors.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Thus, while this rule is to be strictly observed in almost all such writings, it must also be thoroughly maintained in books that recount the deeds of certain holy fathers.</s>
    <s>This is because there is a large number of those books, and their narratives and preachings are varied.</s>
    <s>The more their authors are unknown, the more believers often doubt their sayings.</s>
    <s>Therefore, not all of these books are to be brought forth as testimony for doubtful matters, because not all are endowed with the preface of their authors or composed in the style of strong and eloquent men.</s>
    <s>Thus, we are instructed by the teachings of the venerable Pope Gelasius and other fathers to receive with all honor the lives of the fathers Paul, Anthony, Hilarion, and others, which were either written or translated into Latin by the blessed Jerome or composed in the style of those learned men, whose other works are received by the holy catholic and apostolic church.</s>
    <s>The other books, whose authors are unknown, should be considered among the apocryphal writings.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, when they attempt to prove the veneration of images using sections of divine scriptures inappropriately applied, statements of some unknown teachers, or apocryphal tales, they should realize they have undertaken an impossible task.</s>
    <s>This is because neither can nor should the testimonies of divine scriptures be forcibly used for foreign intentions, nor should the preachings of unknown authors, whose spirits have not yet been tested to see if they are from God, be produced as testimony.</s>
    <s>Neither can the frivolous and uncertain matters of apocryphal writings provide firmness.</s>
    <s>For if the words of any person must not be tainted with falsehood, much less should the divine words, which are pure words like silver refined in a furnace, be misused for other purposes than intended.</s>
    <s>And since in human affairs, lowly or unknown persons are not admitted to approve matters in dispute, much less in such great matters that require heavenly teaching should the testimonies of unknown teachers or apocryphal writings be admitted.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Scriptures must indeed be tested, scrutinized with subtle examination, and strengthened by the testimonies of the holy fathers, which are to be produced as testimony within the holy church to confirm doubtful matters.</s>
    <s>For even the wicked servant in the gospel is reproached by the Lord for not giving the money to the bankers.</s>
    <s>Therefore, we ought to give the money to the bankers, lest we be reproached with the same servant.</s>
    <s>We give the money to the bankers when we submit any writings of the holy fathers to the examination of the discerning.</s>
    <s>The bankers examine the money in four ways: whether the gold is proven, whether it is pure and not internally tainted with any falsehood, whether it is stamped with the inscription of the king rather than a tyrant, and whether it has the full weight of equality.</s>
    <s>All these things are sought in the money of the great householder, that is, in the teachings of our Redeemer by the bankers, that is, by the holy and most eloquent men, who test them with the fire from above.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Thus, it is sought whether each scripture's coin is the most proven gold, so that it may adorn the Lord's threshing floor or make the whole work of the sanctuary shine, so that the spiritual brilliance may shine forth in it, by which the divine law is understood and the whole church...</s>
  </p>


    <p>
        <s>Beauty shines forth.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>It is inquired whether it is pure and not tainted inside by any stain of falsehood, lest perhaps the perverse doctrine of some heresy, cloaked in softer eloquence and seemingly mixed with spiritual meanings, lies hidden and obscured within.</s>
        <s>And while someone thinks they are receiving the coin of the divine word, they might instead receive the deadly poison of a harmful doctrine.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>It is asked whether the inscription belongs to a king or a tyrant, because this is scrutinized with the most diligent investigation by the most learned men in such writings, to see if they pertain to the salvation of the soul and contain the healthy teachings of our King, who is called Savior or Healer.</s>
        <s>Lest perhaps by putting these aside, they contain some harmful schemes of the ancient enemy.</s>
        <s>And while one should follow Him who said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me,"</s>
        <s>who through humility united earthly with heavenly things, one might instead, heaven forbid, follow him who wanted to arrogantly be like the Most High through tyranny and miserably fell by divine and just judgment to the lower realms.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>It is also asked by such money changers whether the coin of such a great householder bears the equality of the fullest weight, that is, whether any doctrine conforms to the prophetic and apostolic teachings, lest perhaps it somewhat disagrees with them or promulgates anything superfluous or less complete.</s>
        <s>For the gifts of gold and silver, which were offered by the people for the work of the tabernacle, were received by the legislator weighed by the sanctuary's standard.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>From this, it is understood that those scriptures or doctrines or even works are truly to be accepted within the holy church by the true legislator, namely the Mediator between God and men, which are not deviated from the standard of the sanctuary, that is, from the norm of the ancient fathers, in their meanings or deeds.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Thus, all these things, when they have been individually examined with prudent scrutiny in the books entitled 'Deeds of the Fathers' or in all doctrines everywhere and found with the utmost diligence, the doctrines or testimonies of those same books are confidently to be brought forward to confirm doubtful matters.</s>
        <s>Nor can such currency be disapproved by anyone, which by such bankers has been approved through the investigation of such an examination.</s>
