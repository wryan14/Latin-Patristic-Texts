        It is also read in the reading of the same synod that Dionysius, a priest of the church of Ascalon, reported in the frequently mentioned synod that a certain monk had placed a lamp in front of the image of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and found it still burning after four, five, or even six months.

        When this was reported, like the other things mentioned there, it was not brought up for any reason except to establish the veneration of images. However, the same veneration of images cannot obtain any validity from this, as there is doubt about the faith of the one who reported it, whether it actually happened, the time it happened, the place it happened, and the manner in which it happened.

        For, since it is entirely unknown whether what the same priest reported actually happened, even if it were proven to have happened in truth, it would need to be more carefully investigated how it is claimed to have happened. Miracles sometimes occur through the unworthy, sometimes through aerial powers, but most often through saints or angelic ministries.

        But if it was done through some intricate scheme of the ancient enemy, the veneration of images cannot be established from it and must be rejected along with its author and all his deceptions. If, however, it was done through angelic preparations, as many signs are usually done, even from this, the veneration of an irrational thing cannot grow. It is more credible that this miracle was done out of reverence for the holy place rather than the presence of any image, if it indeed happened.

        For basilicas are more venerable than images, and places dedicated to divine worship are more revered than any paintings, as the Lord testified when He said that the altar is greater than the gift offered on it, and the temple is greater than the gold in it, because the gold and gifts are consecrated by the temple and the altar. We read that the blessed Gregory said that in a certain basilica, when an unusually severe flood of waters came, the waters rose up to the windows but could not enter, resisted by the power of the Lord, and the lamps that had been extinguished by the basilica's keepers were later found to be relit by the same keepers. This miracle is said to have been done not by any image, but out of reverence for the holy place.

        Therefore, if the miracle reported by the priest of the Ascalon church appeared because of the image, it does not follow that images should be venerated, as not everything through which or in which miracles appeared is believed to be venerated. If everything in which or through which certain miracles appeared is to be venerated, almost nothing will remain that is not venerated, as divine miracles have appeared in so many ways and in almost all creatures. It is idle to dwell on this in our current discussion, as in earlier parts of this work, with the Lord's guidance, a little has already been discussed about this matter.
