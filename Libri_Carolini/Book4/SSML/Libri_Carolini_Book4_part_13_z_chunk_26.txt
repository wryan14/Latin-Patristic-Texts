    Although this synod was held in the city of Nicaea in Bithynia, it cannot in any way be equated with the holy Nicene synod according to their boast and the flattery of John the priest, because it not only disagrees with it in many respects but does not even fully agree with it in the creed.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this synod has new and unusual words in its profession of faith that are not noted in the creed of the holy Nicene synod, about which we have discussed at the beginning of the third book of this work, as much as we were able, with the Lord's help. It also includes, after the confession of the Holy Trinity, a confession of venerating images, which we have not found inserted in the oracles of the prophets, the thunderings of the gospels, the teachings of the apostles, nor in the accounts of earlier holy synods or the doctrines of any orthodox fathers.
  </p>
  <p>
    This synod is far, far removed from that one, especially since that synod brings the Catholic Church back from error, while this one leads it into error; that one drives it away from the most dangerous shipwreck of Arius, while this one pushes it into the shipwreck of image worship; that one teaches that the Son is consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, while this one considers the worship of insensate objects; that one affirms that the Son is equal to the Father in divinity, while this one equates any images of the Lord's ark, the Lord's cross, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, or other most sacred things; that one wisely teaches that the one substance of divine majesty is to be worshipped in three equal, consubstantial, coeternal persons, while this one shamelessly says that images should be worshipped according to the service of the Holy Trinity; in that one, the errors of the Arian dogmas are condemned, in this one their greater errors are nonetheless rejected; in that one, the blasphemies of those who stubbornly neither believe nor confess that the Son is consubstantial with the Father are accursed, in this one the purity of those who, scorning the worship of images, profess with a strong mind and devoted heart that they will serve God alone, is abominated. In that one, after the confession of the Holy Trinity, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come are thoroughly taught by the bishops, in this one, after the confession of the same holy and unique Trinity, the worship of images is improperly established. In that one and other synods, the offering of sacrifices to God for the faithful departed is not prohibited, in this one, curses are laid upon deceased predecessors or parents by their children or successors; and to keep silent about other matters, which are too long to recount, there were 318 bishops in that synod, in this one, as they themselves assert, there were 306.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, not unjustly, this synod is removed from that one by the number twelve, either because that number contains two perfect numbers, or because in the three, which it has four times, and in the four, which it has three times, the mystery of the Holy Trinity in the four gospels and the Holy Trinity itself as the source of the four gospels is demonstrated, or because that number twelve represents all discipline, distinguishing between creature and creator and leading to higher things, which is entirely lacking in this synod.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, God is the creator, from whom all things are, through whom all things are, in whom all things are, as the Apostle says: "For from him and through him and to him are all things"; and therefore the Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The creature, on the other hand, is partly invisible, like the soul, and partly visible, like the body. The number three is attributed to the invisible - therefore we are commanded to love God in three ways: with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind; the number four, because of its most evident nature, that is, hot and cold, wet and dry, is attributed to the body; hence the number seven represents the entire creation. When this is joined with the knowledge of the Holy Trinity, the number ten is completed, in which all wisdom is contained.
  </p>


  <p>
    Discipline related to the education of people: to recognize the Creator and creation, to worship the former as the ruler, and to acknowledge the latter as subject. With this discipline, two most eminent precepts are attached: the love of God and neighbor, forming the number twelve.
  </p>
  <p>
    For if the previously mentioned number seven, which we said demonstrates human nature as partly visible and partly invisible, is added to the five books of the law, through which we come to the knowledge and love of God and neighbor, the number twelve is nonetheless completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the four books of the Gospels are added to this, the order extends to the number sixteen, because the same number twelve, when multiplied by its parts, reaches the number sixteen: for the six parts it contains twice, the two parts it contains six times, the three parts it contains four times, the four parts it contains thrice, and the one part it contains twelve times, make up the number sixteen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, through these five parts, in which the figure of the five books is held, and the seven parts, in which visible and invisible creation is demonstrated, and the four parts, in which the holy Gospels are designated, the number sixteen is reached; where the ten commandments of the Decalogue and the sum of six, which in the New Testament is given through the Mediator of God and men, are shown, so that through the twelve apostles and the four Gospels and the sixteen most noble prophets who have books, the minds of mortals are raised to the worship and adoration of one God alone, spurning all vanities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, since there are twelve patriarchs, twelve minor prophets, twelve apostles, and many such things that can be investigated by diligent readers in the divine scriptures, there are also many things in the same number that pertain to the physical world.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are twelve signs in the zodiac circle, which encircle it like a row of gems. There are twelve winds blowing around the world in groups of three from the four parts of the sky. There are twelve months that complete the year. There are twelve hours that complete the day, and many such things that are investigated by learned men according to secular knowledge and understood spiritually according to ecclesiastical doctrine.
  </p>
  <p>
    For if perhaps some detractor of this work attempts to criticize us for using examples from physical things, that is, those found in "mathematics," let him read blessed Jerome and either criticize us with him or recognize that we follow his teaching and that of the other fathers, who were not ignorant of letters. For the same teacher, while discussing the priestly garment, said: The rationale placed in the middle explains the earth, which, like a point, although it contains all things, is still surrounded by all elements. The twelve stones or the zodiac circle interpret the twelve months, and each verse assigns a specific time, and to these they assign three months each.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let no one consider this explanation pagan. For if celestial things and God's disposition are defamed by the names of idols, it is not for that reason that the providence of God, which runs, moves, and governs all things by a certain law, should be denied. And in Job, we read about Arcturus, Orion, and Mazuroth, that is, the zodiac circle, and other star names, not that these are the same vocabulary among the Hebrews, but because we cannot understand what is said except with familiar words.
  </p>
  <p>
    This number is also consecrated with many mysteries, which we cannot recount in detail for the sake of brevity, and so we can know that this synod of twelve bishops was less than that holy Nicene synod, because it is known that it was fortified by the most sacred preaching or authority of the twelve apostles, while this one is mostly foreign; and while that one, adorned with them as with certain impregnable towers, rises to higher things, this one, finding fewer, is mutilated and runs to worse things; that one is adorned with these twelve gems, in which the names of the twelve tribes, that is, the knowledge or examples of virtues of the ancient fathers, are written, which this one completely lacks.
  </p>


  <p>It is known that through these twelve gates of that beautiful city, namely, the most sacred constitutions, mysteries are penetrated, which are not found in this one.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, we could find no agreement between that city and this one in terms of merits, except for the similarity of names. The former is called Nicene because it was held in the metropolis of the city of Nicaea for the benefit of the Church, and the latter also bears the name Nicene, although it was held there with a different intent and merit. It is not believed that the similarity of names always has the same power, because many names of saints and illustrious men are often found given to unknown people. Indeed, the name does not confer merit equality, but the equality of merit bestows the name's dignity.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, when they attempt to elevate it with the great insignias of merit because it was held in the same place where the holy synod was previously held, they should notice that the merit is not always the same, just as the merit of any name or place is not always the same.</p>
  
  <p>For places were created for humans, not humans for places, and like other earthly creatures, places do not provide advantages based on their location, but on the eminence of merits. The holiness of any place does not matter much if there is impurity in the actions and merits of people. Evil deeds can be done by the wicked and righteous deeds by the just in the same places.</p>
  
  <p>In the city which was the metropolis of Egypt, said to be founded by the Titans, that is, giants, and called Thanes by them, many astonishing miracles were performed by Moses through the invocation of the divine name, and many tricks were performed by Pharaoh's magicians through their insolent exercises. In the suburbs of the same Thanes, memorable prodigies were performed by the holy men Moses and Aaron, and infamous fabrications by the worshippers of demons with their wicked consecrations and invocations. Thus, the commonality of the place brought no prejudice to the holy men performing pious deeds or to the wicked performing shameful acts, providing a common hospitable ground for both.</p>
  
  <p>The city of Luz in Samaria, which was named Bethel, meaning "house of God," by the holy patriarch Jacob, where he saw a ladder touching the sky with angels ascending and descending, later became a place of offense for the house of Israel with golden calves set up by the wicked king Jeroboam for worship. The place, of which the holy man said, "Truly the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it," and which he admired with great astonishment, calling it terrible and saying there was nothing there but the house of God and the gate of heaven, was later made into an idol's house and a danger for the Israelite nation. Neither the consecration of the stone set up by the patriarch nor the anointing with sacred oil nor the reverent naming could restrain the wickedness of the evil king Jeroboam from his perverse actions, but he did not fear to pollute with idols the place admired by such a great patriarch.</p>
  
  <p>Hence, it is easy to understand that a perverse dogma of worshiping images could be established in the city of Nicaea in Bithynia, where a holy synod was once celebrated, just as idols could be placed in Bethel by the wicked king Jeroboam, where Jacob declared it to be the house of God and the gate of heaven. If, in the future, the place consecrated by such a great patriarch could not retain its vigor, the city of Bithynia in these times will have no defense from the ancient fathers in this matter. It is clear that places can be sanctified by the holy and polluted by sinners due to the diverse movements of people.</p>
  
  <p>We read that the house of God in Shiloh was consecrated by Eleazar and Phinehas, priests, through the placement of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the tabernacle with the fires of sacrifices and offerings, and later polluted by the vile actions of Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, priests.</p>
  
  <p>We also read about the once most noble city of Salem, later called Jebus or Solyma, which is now called Jerusalem by derivation, the first city built after the flood by the holy man Shem.</p>


    <p>Tea, as they say, was called Melchizedek, founded and inhabited, and later conquered and occupied for a long time by the abominable race of the Jebusites until the time of David.</p>
    
    <p>We also read that the most sacred and revered Temple of the Lord was planned by David, the most holy of prophets, and dedicated by Solomon. It was frequently attended by angels, illuminated by divine oracles, and prepared by the perpetual observance of the most sacred ceremonies. Because of these notable endowments, it was revered by the ancient fathers. However, it was defiled by the filth of idols and other abominations by subsequent evil kings of the same line, alas! where the Lord had established His sanctuary and the place of His glory. King Manasseh erected altars to the twelve signs and all the host of heaven.</p>
    
    <p>After its restoration and the prophecy of Haggai and Zechariah, we read that the same house was profaned by the Greek kings. The reverence of the place did not restrain the people of those times from committing unlawful acts, their minds having been corrupted by the cruelty of diabolical temptations. The crowds of Jews, relying only on the fortification of the temple and lacking notable merits, were rebuked by the Lord through Jeremiah with these words: <break time="500ms"/> “Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, <break time="500ms"/> 'This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,' and so on.”</p>
    
    <p>If we come to the times of the New Testament, we find the same profanations of holy places committed by wicked men. It is said that idols were placed by pagans on the rock of the cross, in the place of resurrection, and even in the cave of Bethlehem, where the Lord as a little child cried. Blessed Jerome says that from the time of Hadrian up to the reign of Constantine, for about 180 years, a statue of Jupiter was placed by pagans on the site of the resurrection, and a marble statue of Venus on the rock of the cross, with the persecutors believing that they would destroy our faith in the resurrection and the cross if they defiled the holy places with idols.</p>
    
    <p>Bethlehem, our revered place, about which the Psalmist sings, <break time="500ms"/> “Truth has sprung up from the earth,” <break time="500ms"/> was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is, Adonis, and in the cave where Christ once cried as a little child, the lover of Venus was mourned.</p>
    
    <p>If the grove of Adonis could defile the place of Christ's birth, is it any wonder if a crowd of perverse gatherings could usurp the place of the holy synod for setting up unlawful things? If the place of Calvary, which Christ trod on his glorious path to the triumph of the cross, was defiled by a statue of Venus placed by pagans, is it any wonder if the place once occupied by the notable crowd of holy fathers to strengthen the Catholic faith was later sought by a mad multitude of priests to establish new and contrary constitutions for the church?</p>
    
    <p>And if the place of resurrection, which Christ consecrated by rising and showing angelic hosts to mortals, was profaned by a statue of Jupiter, is it any wonder if the worship of images was established by certain madmen in the same city of Bithynia, where Christ was once proclaimed by venerable prelates to be of one substance with the Father?</p>
    
    <p>These examples can prove that certain power of places cannot always hold the same consistency, because people, being mutable, are not always held by the strictness of one tenacity. Especially since even Judas, who was once an apostle, later became an apostate, and Paul, who was once Saul and a persecutor, later became a teacher of the Gentiles and a preacher. Places that were once dedicated to divine worship were later profaned by pagans, and often, after the abominations were expelled, places that were considered impure were later dedicated to divine worship.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, with insolent desire, both these and their predecessors seek to hold a synod and associate it with the six venerable synods, which were held by holy men at various times for certain church benefits, but not with a different faith, and to be considered under the designation of the seventh synod.</p>


  <p>
    Both groups in this matter are believed to have pursued their goals inappropriately, but neither of them managed to achieve their ambitious aims.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, desiring to abolish what was rashly and excessively done by their predecessors and to establish their own, which was similarly foolish and inept, they recounted a certain parable. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Someone, wanting to add a seventh gold coin to six gold coins, tried to insert the gold coin but is said to have mistakenly inserted a bronze coin instead. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the bronze coin was removed, they boasted of having added a gold coin to the gold coins. If they pay close attention, they are believed to have inserted a tin coin instead of a bronze coin. 
  </p>
  <p>
    And the seventh number of the council, which their predecessors wanted to complete with an ecumenical council, they are trying to complete by adding a tin council. But once the bronze coin is removed from the mystery of the seventh number, and the tin coin is also rejected, only six coins will remain.
  </p>
  <p>
    These six are illuminated by both the perfection of the number and the brilliance of Catholic teaching, in which the purest gold shines in the purity of faith, and the glory of perfection reigns in the number. For in the number six, which is indeed perfect, they seem to hold the perfection of ecclesiastical preaching, so that in three, which is its half, the confession of the Holy Trinity is declared; in two, which is its third part, the unity of the two Testaments or the two talents, namely understanding and action, granted by the Holy and Only Trinity is shown; furthermore, in one, which is its sixth part, either the condition of the old man, who was formed on the sixth day, or the assumption of the new man, whom the Son received on the sixth age of the world for the salvation of humanity, is most clearly demonstrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, in these six most sacred councils, both the mystery of the Holy Trinity is preached, the harmony of the two Testaments or the gift of understanding and action is held, and the faith of the Lord's incarnation for human salvation is taught. And, since none of these is lacking to them, they are fortified by the perfection of the number six.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now, because they so eagerly wish to associate their council with the ancient councils, these ancient councils can indeed be associated with a certain council of the Ariminenses and be numbered together. For just as in that council the confession of the same substance <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoˈusjon">homoousion</phoneme> was rejected, so in this one the worshippers and true adorers of God alone are condemned. And just as in that council the most pernicious doctrine of different substances in the Trinity was established, so in this one the worship and adoration of various things is counted as due to God alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, let the first council in this number be the Ariminensian, the second, the one conducted by their predecessors to abolish the ornaments of the basilicas, and the third, this one, which was conducted by them in the city of Nicea over the worship and adoration of images. However, let the first be a bronze coin, the second a tin one, and the third a lead one, because although they have a great temporal distance between them, they have a concordance in certain errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if the second one is rejected by their pride and ostentation, let us also help them to reject it from this number: and the first, as we said before, be the Ariminensian, and the second, this one conducted by them; the first, as we said before, being a bronze coin, and because it is despised, let the second be counted as a lead coin held by them. And setting these aside, let us be content with only the six holy universal councils and local synods, which neither differ in faith nor in preaching from these, and let us fully prepare ourselves with the integrity of faith and the increase of good works for the dreadful arrival of the final day of judgment, which will be celebrated by His glorious return, about which it was said by the angels to the apostles:
