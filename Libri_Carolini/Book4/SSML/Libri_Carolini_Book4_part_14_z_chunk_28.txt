      Therefore, Gregory, Bishop of Neocaesarea, is criticized for speaking uselessly and covering it with the cloud of incompetence and ineptness.
    </s>
    <s>
      He is also criticized for saying: "Let them be glad and rejoice and be presumed, those who make, love, and venerate the true image of Christ for the salvation of soul and body," and the rest.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For what it means to "be glad and rejoice" in this statement is easy to understand; but what is meant by "be presumed" does not make any sense to the reader, because it is alien to the rules of meaning and completely foreign to the integrity of Latin expression.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if he wanted to speak of presumption, this third term does not fit with the sense of the preceding two, unless perhaps he meant those who "rejoice and be glad" are those who presume to worship something illicit and forbidden by the holy fathers, and who are driven by the goads of such presumption, that in the worship of senseless things, they seem to contradict all authentic scriptures.

    <s>
      O demented and laughable statement of the bishop, who, when he said "the true image of Christ," did not clearly show what he meant!
    </s>
    <s>
      For if he said "true," he spoke most absurdly and incompetently, as it is clear that no mortal can form the "true image of Christ."
    </s>
    <s>
      For when "true" is said, it is far removed from what is made by artisans, for as much as truth differs from falsehood, so much does the true image of Christ differ from that which is formed by the skilled or unskilled hand of an artisan.

    <s>
      But if he meant the mystery of the body and blood of the Lord, which is taken daily in the sacrament by the faithful - which he almost revealed amidst his nonsensical conglomeration when he said: "Which the perfecter of sacrifice and God, taking from us our whole being, voluntarily handed over to his disciples as a sign and clear memory according to the time of his passion" - he also erred considerably in this.
    </s>
    <s>
      For he did not offer an image or any prefiguration, but he offered himself to God the Father as a sacrifice for us, and he who was once prefigured to be offered under the shadow of the law in the immolation of the lamb or in certain things imaginatively, truly fulfilling what was prophesied about him by the oracles of the prophets, was presented as a saving victim to God the Father.
    </s>
    <s>
      Nor did he give us an imaginary sign as the shadows of the law passed, but he gave the sacrament of his blood and body.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the mystery of the blood and body of the Lord is not to be called an image now, but truth, not a shadow but the body, not an exemplar of future things, but what was prefigured by exemplars.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Now, according to the Song of Songs, the day has breathed, and the shadows have been removed; now the end of the law has come to Christ for the righteousness of every believer; now he has fulfilled the law; now he who sat in the region of the shadow of death has seen a great light, the veil on the face of Moses has fallen, and the veil of the temple has been torn, revealing to us the hidden and unknown things; now the true Melchizedek, that is, Christ, the righteous king, the king of the Father, has given us the sacrament of his body and blood, not the victims of animals.
    </s>
    <s>
      Nor did he say: "This is the image of my body and blood," but: "This is my body, which will be given up for you," and: "This is my blood, which will be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, as we have said, since neither the work of artisans can be called the true image of Christ, nor the mystery of his body and blood, which is known to have been carried out in truth, not in figure, Gregory, Bishop of Neocaesarea, is rightly criticized for speaking such foolishness with so many indications and documents.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, in this matter...
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>The bishop said about Christ: "Since He is both the perfecter of the sacrifice and God, taking upon Himself our entire human nature from us," it is justly criticized because, although humanity is called a mass of perdition due to original sin, the same bishop carelessly stated that Christ took upon Himself our entire human nature from us.</s>
    <s>This is incorrect because, although Christ took on the whole of human nature, namely the flesh with its senses and the soul with its reason—without divinity being changed into humanity or humanity into divinity, but with both natures retaining their properties—God the Word became man in the unity of His person.</s>
    <s>However, He did not take on human original sin, and thus it is absurd to say that He took on our entire human nature from us.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, He did not take on our entire human nature, because He is not to be believed to have taken on the guilt of original sin, which binds all humankind before baptism.</s>
    <s>The mass of that ancient sin, with which we are born, is so great that if it is carefully divided, all criminal sins can be found in it: for there is pride, because man loved to be in his own power rather than in God's; sacrilege, because he did not believe in God; homicide, because he cast himself into death; spiritual fornication, because the integrity of the human mind was corrupted by the serpent's persuasion; theft, because the forbidden food was taken; and avarice, because he desired more than was sufficient for him.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>With all these sins, the human race is so entangled that even someone conceived in legitimate marriage says: "In iniquities I was conceived, and in sins did my mother bring me forth."</s>
    <s>Therefore, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God, took on human nature, not the mass of sin.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But, to return to the point from where we digressed, there is some ambiguity about the profession of the same bishop, who is reported to have said that "Christ took on our entire human nature from us," because either great ignorance compelled him to profess this or enormous error led him to say it.</s>
    <s>For while we want him to be both learned and orthodox, desiring that no one should perish following the Lord's example, if he lacks either of these qualities—and he truly does—we would prefer to attribute what he said to ignorance rather than to heresy.</s>
