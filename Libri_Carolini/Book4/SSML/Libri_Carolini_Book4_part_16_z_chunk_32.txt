        Through these actions, we hope to drive away demons by making the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and by making the sign in the air with a finger, we hope to drive away demons. Similarly, we bring the image 'through the name's signification to the first form of honor, and by kissing it and honoring it respectfully, we will receive sanctification; for we also kiss and embrace various sacred vessels and hope for some sanctification.'

        "If you see," says Scripture, "a man quick in his words, know that a fool has more hope than he"; and: "In the multitude of words, sin will not be lacking."

        According to this sacred Scripture's judgment, Epiphanius the deacon, who is said to have been 'quick in his words' and used 'many words' in the same synod, showed himself to 'have the hope of a fool' more than himself and 'contracted various errors in his multitude of words.'

        For while in the previous chapter we discussed some of his nonsense, in this one we must nonetheless discuss it a little more.

        We have decided to examine their professions not by their words, but by their meanings, and not to scrutinize their literature, but their sense, because it is endless to seek the order of literature in these things.

        No sentence can stand in the lengthy text of the same reading through it, and in the few errors of words and the roughness of unpolished learning, it is easy to argue about the errors of meanings.
        <break time="500ms"/>
        Therefore, where there is neither purity of meaning nor integrity of words in the lengthy series of reading, it is difficult to argue about individual points, because the order of disputation is extended infinitely.
        <break time="500ms"/>
        For if we dispute about each error of words, while the secrets must be examined and the things pertaining to ecclesiastical matters must be diligently investigated, the multiple rules of grammatical art, which are learned in schools, will seem to be taught.

        But while in this work our progress is greatly hindered - either because due to the difficulty of their speech some things they want to signify are difficult to understand, or because their statements, infected with barbarisms and solecisms and other faults, are interspersed in our disputes, because the matter requires it, or because, among their corrupted words, the meanings are likewise corrupted - we, omitting the reproach of words for the sake of brevity, will only touch upon the series of meanings and laboriously make this - since one thing depends on another and one is inserted into another.
        <break time="500ms"/>
        It remains, with the Lord's consent, that after postponing the reproach that occurs due to the faults of words, we should only shake the disordered conglomerations of meanings with the blow of a spiritual fist and continue the journey begun and largely completed.

        For the aforementioned deacon Epiphanius, whose statement we began to examine, says: "Many things that are consecrated in us do not receive consecration through prayer." Although this, as it is said, has no full sense, we conjecture that he meant to say: "Many things are consecrated in us, which are not consecrated through the priest's prayer or the imposition of hands."
        <break time="500ms"/>
        If this is so, how it can be true is not sufficiently clear; for whatever is consecrated in the church: whether ecclesiastical orders, the dedications of temples to be consecrated, or other such constitutions, are done through priestly consecrations according to ecclesiastical custom, since even to the very nobility of the Christian faith, by which one ascends to other degrees, it comes through the imposition of hands by priests and prayers to God in the very beginnings of infancy.
        <break time="500ms"/>
        If he wanted to speak about places or vessels or any utensils dedicated to divine worship, in this his statement can be frustrated because there is almost nothing in these, which we have enumerated, that is not consecrated through the prayers and consecrations of priests.

        But also, through exorcisms and the sprinkling of salt and water...
    </p>


    <p>The church customarily, all of whose consecrations or institutions are known to have been handed down by the bishops of the church from the very beginnings of the church and are recorded in priestly books.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore, when the deacon brought forward the idea that images, whose worship they absolutely refuse to establish, and of whose consecration there is no ecclesiastical institution, should be associated with vessels or other items dedicated to divine worship, he aimed to introduce the notion that just as these are consecrated without prayers, so too those could be consecrated without prayers.</p>
        
        <p>This effort can be nullified because the consecration of these items is written in priestly books and celebrated solemnly by the priests according to ancient tradition. However, there is no institution anywhere in what is accepted by the church for either consecrating or worshiping images.</p>
        
        <p>As for what he said: "Nor as much as we are venerated and honored and exalted; for he claims that the sign of the life-giving cross without sacred prayer is to be venerated by us," I think he meant that the sign of the venerable cross, which we honorably carry, is held sacred without any specific prayer or consecration by priests, and yet it is considered sacred.</p>
        
        <p>In saying this, as in other matters, he demonstrates his considerable madness, as he does not seek any other consecration for the sign of the cross than that which was made through the Mediator of God and men.</p>
        
        <p>What he added: "And we will be content to receive the sign of its sanctification, through which, made by us, a certain adoration is given on the forehead with sanctification, and which in the air is made with a finger to drive away demons," pertains to what was mentioned earlier.</p>
        
        <p>Therefore, it is evident from clear signs that the sign of the cross holds a great mystery and that images cannot be equated with it, as demonstrated in the earlier parts of this work, as the Lord has deigned to grant.</p>
        
        <p>For while images, as we said earlier, are not sanctified by any prayer or laying on of hands, the sign of the cross, wherever it is brought, is invoked with the divine name. And while these do not have nor can they have any form of consecration, that sign is so sacred by the Redeemer of the world that it needs no consecration, but being invoked with the divine name, it consecrates and blesses other things.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, when he said: "Similarly, we lead the image by the name of its signification to its primary form of honor, and by kissing it and honoring it respectfully, we receive sanctification," it is clearly shown to be absurd and irrational.</p>
        
        <p>He claimed that an image could be led to the honor of its primary form, that is, to the veneration of the saint in whose name it is titled. This can in no way be demonstrated by clear reasoning. If merely writing the name leads these items to the honor of the saints whose names are inscribed, then any object to which the name of a saint is attached ascends to the honor of that saint. Therefore, stones, woods, clothes, or certain animals inscribed with the names of some saints would pass to the honor of those saints whose names they bear.</p>
        
        <p>And if the names inscribed cannot lead these enumerated items to the honor of those whose names they bear, then the inscriptions of names do not lead to the honor of the saints either. If this is denied with prudent consideration, it is also rejected with diligent investigation.</p>
        
        <p>Suppose two images of beautiful women without inscriptions are presented to someone who worships images, and he disregards and discards them wherever. Someone says to him: "One of these is an image of Saint Mary, and should not be discarded; the other is of Venus, which should be completely discarded."</p>
        
        <p>He turns to the painter, asking him, since they are very similar in all respects, which one is the image of Saint Mary and which is of Venus. The painter gives one the inscription of Saint Mary, and the other the inscription of Venus: this one, because it bears the inscription of the Mother of God, is elevated.</p>
    <p>One is honored and kissed; the other, because it bears the name of Venus, the mother of a certain Aeneas, is cast down, reproached, and cursed. Both are of the same shape, the same colors, and made of the same materials, differing only in their inscriptions.</p>
    <p>Let Epiphanius the deacon, who said that images could be "brought to the honor of the original form" through the inscription of a name, tell me, please, where was the sanctity of this one before it was inscribed? Or where was the reproach of that one before it was inscribed?</p>
    <p>Therefore, the inscription, which is customarily placed on images, according to the manner of letters, which have so much power that they speak silently and sometimes convey the words of the absent, sometimes even the present without a voice, can bring knowledge, but it cannot bestow sanctification on those images to which it is applied.</p>
    <p>For sanctification is granted to rational creatures by the exhibition of good works and the prerogatives of merits; but to irrational and senseless things, such as vessels dedicated to divine worship and similar items, it comes not through any inscription, but through priestly consecration and the invocation of the divine name.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is clearly shown by this evident reasoning that no sanctification can adhere to images through any inscription, since this one, which now bears the inscription of the blessed mother of God, Mary, and which once lay despicably discarded, is now adorned with reverence. As much as it could harm its scorners while lying despised, it can equally benefit its worshipers when raised and honored. And as much as it could help if it were raised, it can harm when it is scorned.</p>
    <p>As for the statement: "And by kissing it and honoring it with veneration, we will receive sanctification," it would be as meaningful as saying: "We kiss it and honor it with veneration, desiring to receive sanctification from it, which it neither has nor can impart to us."</p>
    <p>Therefore, as much as it can give light to the blind when it itself cannot see; a sense of smell to the scentless when it lacks the same sense; hearing to the deaf when it does not hear; speech to the mute when it does not speak; touch to the weak-handed when it cannot feel anything; walking to the lame when it completely lacks this ability; life to the dead when it itself does not live — it can equally impart to us the sanctification that it completely lacks.</p>
    <p>In the small remaining part of the passage, there is no need to dwell further because almost all of it seems to be connected to the previous parts. For it says: "For having different sacred vessels, we kiss and embrace these and hope for some sanctification." Sanctification does not come to men through vessels, but to vessels through men by the invocation of the divine name and the celebration of sacred mysteries; nor are images to be equated with vessels, for the sacrifice to God is offered in vessels, not in images. For if sanctification, as we have said, is not imparted to men by vessels that are indeed sanctified, much less will it be imparted by images, which neither can sanctify nor be sanctified.</p>
