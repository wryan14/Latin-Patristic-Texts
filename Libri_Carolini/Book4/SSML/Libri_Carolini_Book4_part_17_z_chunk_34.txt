        <s>In the same synod, Epiphanius was criticized for saying: "He spoke from his own belly."</s>
        <s>Although this statement does not affect matters of faith or this particular issue, we did not overlook it because it sounds ignorant and foolish.</s>
        <s>New church constitutions should neither be extended nor derived from such writings, which can be criticized in so many ways.</s>
        <s>The holy Catholic Church accepts everything that is above reproach.</s>
        <s>However, what is criticized by many is rejected from ecclesiastical doctrine.</s>
        <s>The judgment of that reading, which is full of reproaches and such nonsense, should not be used concerning the worship of images.</s>

        <s>They indeed said that someone "spoke from his own belly."</s>
        <s>This statement is rejected not only by learned ears but also by unlearned ones, and it is dismissed as some old wives' tale.</s>
        <s>For the tongue interprets what the mind has conceived from the heart; the belly deals with matters that are expelled into the toilet.</s>
        <s>Just as the heart, which is often used in divine writings and common speech to mean the mind or sense, cannot digest food or hold fluids, so too the belly cannot conceive thoughts and produce them as words.</s>

        <s>Each body part has its own function, just as the five senses are distributed among five parts of the body, except for touch, which, although thought to reside in the hands, is spread throughout the body.</s>
        <s>According to philosophers' experience, fear resides in the heart, joy in the spleen, pleasure in the liver, and the three ventricles of the brain have different roles:</s>
        <s>The front one, towards the face, is for sensation; the back one, towards the neck, is for motion; and the middle one is demonstrated to be for memory.</s>
        <s>The lungs are for breathing, modulating voices, and taking in air, but the belly, which resembles the shape of the sea, is clearly for digesting food and collecting fluids.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>If they want to support the error of this statement with the fact that the belly is often mentioned in sacred writings, such as "My belly is troubled" or "I feel pain in my belly," and similar expressions, they should realize that the term for this body part is used metaphorically, not for speech, but for other things signified by the belly, which are too lengthy to discuss now.</s>
        <s>Where it is said, it is metaphorical; this statement, however, is a misuse of words.</s>
        <s>Through the metaphor, truth is allegorically shaded, while through the misuse, the purity of meaning is mutilated; the former shines with mysteries, the latter reeks of absurdities.</s>

        <s>Moreover, if they meant to refer to the Pythons, whom the Septuagint translated as ventriloquists, about whom it is read in Deuteronomy:</s>
        <s>"There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire, or practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or a ventriloquist, or one who consults spirits, or one who inquires of the dead,"</s>
        <s>even this is not without criticism, because when they said that a man "spoke from his own belly" like a Python, it is not actually from the Python's belly that a man speaks, but an evil spirit speaks.</s>
        <s>So only when the Python, who is called a ventriloquist, speaks through the human mouth, the voices of unclean spirits are heard from his belly and answers are given.</s>
        <s>It is evident that many such ventriloquists exist among the Assyrians or Egyptians, where magical arts are abundant.</s>
