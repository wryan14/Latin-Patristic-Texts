  <p>As it sounds in this chapter and we have experienced from other statements of theirs, they strive to introduce this argument: that because the sacrifices of slain animals, once offered by pagans to demons, were not omitted by holy men in the old law but were indeed offered to God, it should not be omitted to worship images within the holy church, even though idols were worshipped by pagans. But just as their objections in other assertions on this matter have been in vain, this objection will also be rendered ineffective by a judicious assertion.</p>

  <p>It is evident that in ancient times, sacrifices of slain animals were offered to Almighty God by holy men and to demons by the priests of pagans. Similarly, the images of saints were kept in basilicas by Catholics for the memory of their deeds and the beauty of buildings. So, just as the use of sacrifices of slain animals was celebrated by the holy fathers before the law and handed down in the law by the Lord through Moses, they should explain where the practice of worshipping images was instituted before the law by the patriarchs, in the law by the legislator, in the New Testament by the Lord and Savior, or by the apostles or apostolic men. And since their celebration has such an authentic tradition, they should explain what authority the worship of these images holds. When they cannot explain this, they should be ashamed of presenting an unprofitable matter and recognize that they have unjustly tried to associate the worship of images with the offering of holy sacrifices.</p>

  <p>How can it be believed that images were created by Catholics to be worshipped, when even the idols of pagans were not originally made to be worshipped?</p>

  <p>The use of idols arose when the images or effigies of certain strong men, kings, founders of cities, or inventors of certain arts were created by their loved ones, so that the sorrow of the descendants or admirers might have some remedy from contemplating the images. But gradually, through the persuasion of demons, this error has crept in, so that those whom they had judged to be painted for the memory of their names alone, their successors considered as gods and worshipped, and demons enticed some wretched people to sacrifice to them. We see this example so clearly that the use of images has increased to the point where those that were initially made for the decoration of basilicas and the memory of deeds, are now so exalted by certain Catholics that they are worshipped, and lights, incense, first-fruits, or certain gifts are offered to them. Worse still, as we read happened in parts of Greece, some priests, who should preach that only God is to be worshipped and served, also acknowledge that they serve and worship these images, and judge those who scorn them and worship only God as heretics and seek to anathematize them.</p>

  <p>In a similar and almost equal way, as we have mentioned, the use of worshipping and honoring idols or rather demons has grown among pagans, and among Catholics, the most foolish custom of worshipping images has increased, and things made for one purpose seem to be misused for another.</p>

  <p>We do not call the images placed in basilicas idols, but to avoid them being called idols, we refuse to worship them, revere them, or offer them service because often it is not the thing itself but the reason for the thing that is considered a sin. Just as many things that can be used well are turned into wickedness when used badly, so the same thing is not a cause of sin for those who use it well and is a cause of danger for those who use it badly.</p>


  <p>
    So, we must be very careful and work extremely hard to ensure that, while some of us try to elevate certain matters beyond what order requires, the ashes of that very old and decayed error don't come back to life and cause us to lose the victory we achieved in the field within the city's walls. The deceptive illusion of a civil war could secretly subdue us in a way that an open attack by an external enemy could not.

    So, when they accuse the holy fathers, namely Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and David, we do not want to accuse them but to praise them, as Ecclesiasticus says: "Let us praise famous men and our fathers in their generations. The Lord has done great things by his majesty since the beginning, ruling in their power, great men with virtue and wisdom, honored as prophets, ruling the people in the present and the holy words of wisdom guiding the people," and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who would have such a profane mind to dare accuse Abel, who was called just by the Lord himself, whose blood is said to have cried out to the Lord from the ground, who is the example and standard for all the just, who first endured persecution and laid the foundations of the city of God, which is gladdened by the river's streams?
  </p>
  <p>
    Or who would presume to accuse Noah, a just man whom the Lord testified found grace before Him, who was the second father of the human race after Adam, the restorer of the world, and a type of Christ, who was to govern the Church filled with people from various nations amid the immense storms of the world? He was the governor of the ark filled with various animals amid the dreadful waves' crashes, adorned with so many merits that he, along with Daniel and Job, is said to be saved on the day of judgment, according to Ezekiel, who says, "If I send a pestilence upon that land and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off man and beast from it, and Noah, Daniel, and Job were in its midst, as I live, says the Lord God, they would not save son or daughter; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness." In these three saints, the entire multitude of saints is symbolized: Noah represents the governors of the Church, Daniel the virgins and the continent, and Job the married and the penitent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or who would dare accuse the patriarch Abraham, who is the first path of believers and the father of the blessed seed, whose righteousness was counted not by legal observance but by faith, who saw the Trinity in type and venerated the unity in mystery, who was privileged to hear the divine judgment's secret and the miraculous promise of offspring from his aged wife, who symbolically felt the future end-of-the-world tribulations by the excessive terror and darkness that fell upon him at the end of the day?
  </p>
  <p>
    Or who would presume to accuse Moses, the lawgiver, of whom it is written that he was the meekest of all men on earth, who, as a type of Christ, stood as a mediator between God and men, and after defeating the wickedest enemy, freed the people from Egyptian slavery with terrifying signs and wonders?
  </p>
  <p>
    Or Samuel, who was consecrated to the Lord from infancy and served in the Lord's army until old age?
  </p>
  <p>
    Or David, who is said to be a man after the Lord's own heart and was elevated among the merits of the saints, so he prophesied more openly about Christ and is called the father according to his form of service?
  </p>
  <p>
    If we were to individually recount the praises and mysteries of each, our words would end before the days do. They did not offer pagan sacrifices to God but those full of mysteries, for pagans were not yet called by that name by the villagers of Athens when they were already offering sacrifices to God. And, so to speak, neither was the city of Athens founded, nor had Cecrops handed down to the Gentiles the customs of sacrifices, the erection of altars, and the names of demons, when Abel, Noah, and Abraham had already offered sacrifices to God.
  </p>
  <p>
    They offered, I say, holy sacrifices either before the law or under the law, hidden in typical mysteries, which were fulfilled in the New Testament by the Mediator.

    <p>
        The prophecies of God and men, having been fulfilled and handed down to the church, will be preserved with the help of God until the end.

        Why, then, did the ancient fathers offer visible sacrifices and make offerings to God with physical sacrifices? Let the reader understand through the words of the blessed Augustine. He says, 
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            "What are the spiritual sacred rites, whose images the physical people had to celebrate, so that the prefiguration of the new people would be made through the servitude of the old."
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also observe the difference between these two peoples in each one of us. It is necessary for everyone to act as the old man from the mother's womb until they reach the age of youth. At that point, it is no longer necessary to think in a physical manner, but they can move towards spiritual matters with a determined will and be regenerated internally.

        What happens in the rightly educated individual through the order of nature and discipline is most beautifully carried out in the entire human race through divine providence.
