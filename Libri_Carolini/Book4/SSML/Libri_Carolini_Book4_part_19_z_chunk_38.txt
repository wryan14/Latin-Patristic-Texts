Those people, about whom we are speaking, rejoice greatly that they have found tools to defend their error in that a basilica is said to have been painted by the disciples of a certain holy man, Epiphanius, on the island of Cyprus, as if nothing can be painted that should not immediately be worshipped.
</p>
<p>
Since the practice of having or not having images does not harm the purity of the Catholic faith, it is clear that Epiphanius or any other holy man was neither a destroyer nor a worshipper of images, and his disciples or any Catholic men did not paint basilicas with colors so that the paintings would be worshipped, but so that "beauty would be brought to the walls and the memory of events would be instilled in those who looked at them." For just because Epiphanius' disciples are said to have painted a basilica on the island of Cyprus, it does not mean that images will be worshipped, since not everything that is painted is immediately worshipped. If everything painted had to be worshipped, very few created things would remain that were not worshipped. We see in metals molded or sculpted, in gems and notable stones with the amazing skill of the sculptor, in marbles and other stones by the industry of stonecutters or sculptors, in woods carved by chisels, in mosaics of various colors assembled by an artisan, in silk, wool, and colorful linen garments formed with embroidery and weaving, images are made.
</p>
<p>
Is it because the aforementioned men, namely the disciples of Saint Epiphanius, painted a basilica in Cyprus that all images must be worshipped? Or because they adorned a place dedicated to divine worship with various materials, should we bow our knees, bend our necks, and with frequent sighs, lift our reverently half-closed eyes to each material we mentioned as images? Therefore, it does not follow that because they are said to have painted a basilica, images should be worshipped.
</p>
<p>
Another reasonable response can be made to this objection, so that their assertion, just as it could not be supported by other objections, cannot be confirmed by this painting in the basilica by Epiphanius' disciples; especially since, even if the disciples of the same holy man had decided to worship the images on the walls, their judgment would have no force, because often well-taught students from good teachers later become corrupt by neglecting their teachers' teachings. If this is carefully investigated, it will be proven with examples from the Holy Scriptures.

<p>
Thus, such a great love of money crept into the disciple of the holy man Elisha, who was endowed with the double spirit of Elijah, that having received a gift from a foreigner, he was also infected by a deadly illness, despite the master's rebuke. Neither the prophetic speech, nor the master's teaching, nor the display of terrifying signs, nor the common dwelling with such a great prophet restrained him from the great plague of greed, but the greed that seized him also branded him with leprosy along with the wealth of the Syrian.

<p>
Judas also, about whom it is written by the prophet: "The man of my peace, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me," to whom it was once said "But you, O man of one mind, my guide and my acquaintance, who took sweet meals with me," neglected the teaching of the good master - and truly good, who said of himself, "Is your eye evil because I am good," and to whom it is said by David: "You are good, Lord, teach me your goodness;" about whom it is also said by Jeremiah: "The Lord is good to those who hope in him, to the soul who seeks him," - the fury of greed, most capacious and rapacious, seized him so much that he did not hesitate to betray his master, who was not restrained by heavenly words, nor the flood of the fountain of life, nor the display of signs, nor the apostolic fellowship.

    Here is the translation of the provided Latin text into modern, easy-to-understand English:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even the dignity of the apostolic name did not prevent him from committing such a great crime. When he realized his wickedness, he ended his unworthy life with a deserved death. Sedulius says of him:
    <s>
      "Then an apostolic man, now made a worthless apostate."
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Nicholas, a disciple of the apostles and one of the seven who, along with the blessed Stephen, was consecrated to the ministry of deacon, later neglected the teachings of his good teachers and the company of good deacons. He became a heresiarch and, instead of instructing in good works with examples and words, as a disciple of the apostles should, he shamefully established a wicked heresy. About this, it is written in the Book of Revelation:
    <s>
      "But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If therefore, a good prophet's bad disciple is rejected because of greed, and the disciple of our Lord and Savior, a good teacher, becomes a thief and a traitor and is abhorred, and the bad disciple of the holy apostles is cursed for establishing impious doctrines, is it any wonder that the bad disciples of the good teacher Epiphanius become so by instituting the worship of images?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And in saying this, we do not judge them as reprobates, since we do not know their life and conduct, but we assert that if they thought it right to worship images, they are in error. Let us consider Novatus, a priest of Bishop Cyprian, who established the Novatian heresy and followed his own judgment, ignoring the advice of his holy teacher. We also know that Arius, educated by a Catholic teacher, later sowed the seeds of a destructive doctrine. What should I say of each one? Almost all heresiarchs are known to have been disciples of Catholics, for no one could establish a heresy in his own name unless he invented it according to his own judgment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From these examples, it is clear that the sanctity of the teacher Epiphanius did not benefit his disciples if they are believed to have deviated from ecclesiastical constitutions by neglecting the teachings of their good teacher.
