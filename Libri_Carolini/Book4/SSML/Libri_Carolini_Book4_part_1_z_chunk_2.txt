    He gave one of the Orientals, who among other absurdities of his profession neither avoided being deceived in this matter, which is being discussed, nor feared to deceive, nor was ashamed to lie or to encourage others to lie. He did not avoid being deceived, as he strayed from the narrow path of the Holy Scriptures, which advocate the worship and adoration of one and only God, and he turned his mind to worshiping senseless objects. He did not fear to deceive, as he persuaded others with many assertions and vanities to stray with him from the right path. He was not ashamed to lie and to encourage others to lie, asserting that committing an illegal act and telling a lie was not a sin. For he says: <s>"Whoever worships an image and says, 'This is Christ, the Son of God,' does not sin."</s>

    This vanity can be easily refuted with the following argument: if saying what is not true is not a lie, then saying what is true cannot be considered truth. Therefore, if lying is not a vice, then speaking the truth is not a virtue. And if speaking and following the truth is a virtue, then lying and following falsehood is undoubtedly a vice. Hence, when someone says that a picture is Christ, the Son of God, they are lying. And when they lie, they act wrongly, and when they act wrongly, they sin. Therefore, when they say that a picture is Christ, the Son of God, they sin.

    For no picture has taken on human form for our salvation, allowed itself to be scourged, and crucified for us, nor has any image risen from the grave, having conquered death and the underworld, nor has any earthly artist's work ascended to heaven with the apostles' teachings and directives, and sat at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. All these things were done not by any picture, but by Christ, who is the only Son of God the Father, begotten ineffably by the Father before all ages, sent to earth for human salvation at the end of ages, anointed by the Father with the oil of gladness above his companions, who according to the Apostle reconciled all things by the blood of his cross, whether things on earth or things in heaven, to whom every knee bows, whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth. Therefore, if anyone worshiping an image says: <s>'This is Christ, the Son of God,'</s> not only does he sin, but he acts insanely and wickedly, attempting to apply such a sublime and excellent name—if it can even be called a thing and not rather the origin and cause of all things—to such a vile and abject thing, lacking not only mysteries but also life. Just as no image can be equated to Christ in nature, it also cannot be equated to him in name.

    If anyone thinks that the reasoning of equivocal names can apply here, let him know that the statement we are now discussing is far from the reasoning of equivocal names. It is one thing to say: <s>'a painted man and a true man, a painted lion and a true lion, and a celestial lion,'</s> and quite another to declare that an image is Christ, the Son of God. In the former, there is only a sound similarity in name, while in the latter, the full meaning is clear. The reasoning of equivocal names only holds a community in name, but as soon as it reaches the definition, what the sound similarity of the name covered is revealed by the definition. As we have said, it is one thing and quite another to call a picture by the name of the thing it represents, according to the reasoning of equivocal names, and another to worship a senseless thing and declare with full meaning: <s>'This is Christ, the Son of God.'</s> For if uttering such a lie, as he confessed, is not a sin, then committing any illegal act is not a sin, and the authority of the Holy Scriptures, which certainly advocate abstaining from illegal acts, must be considered to have failed.

    The strength of the holy Scriptures, which command abstaining from all illicit things, must not be considered weak; therefore, to tell such a lie is a sin. For while almost every lie told with the intent to deceive is a sin, this kind of lie is much more of a sin, since it seeks to call such a low thing by the confession of such a great name. To produce a confession, which the pastor of the church offers to the Redeemer and which the entire holy catholic and universal church offers daily, through which it is saved and attains its own salvation, how can someone attempt to produce it about an insensible thing? Therefore, just as other vices, so too the vice of lying is forbidden by the teachings of the divine Scriptures.

    Whoever obeys the warnings of the same John, to worship images and to call them the Christ, the Son of God, and practices wicked vanity and shows himself to be undisciplined, if this crime, as he professed, were to be committed, it would fulfill what is said in the prophecy of Jeremiah in the voice of the Lord: "Lies and not faith have prevailed over the land, because evils came out from evil people, and they have not known me." 
  </p>
  <p>
    Paul also, the eminent preacher, persuades to put away lying and to speak truth with these words; for he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians: "Putting away lying, speak truth each one with his neighbor, because we are members of one another." Similarly, to the Colossians: "Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds." John the Apostle also says: "Every lie is not of the truth."
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is clearly evident that, if the picture, as he urges to confess, is not Christ, the Son of God, it is a lie what is said; and if what is said is a lie, according to the Apostle's voice, it is not of the truth, who says: "I am the way and the truth and the life." For the worship of adoration is to be shown to God alone and the confession of the Son of God to him alone, who is truly his consubstantial Son, not adopted.

    But if this word ‘here’ in the same place is used as an adverb of place, not as a pronoun, this sentence can stand because God is everywhere.
