    We find in the true voice of the Lord that the apostles will sit with the Lord to judge: "You," he said, "who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his majesty, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." He himself testifies that he chose them out of the world, so that they would not be of the world, but to bear much fruit: "I have chosen you out of the world," he says, "so that you would not be of the world, and that you would bear much fruit, and that your fruit would remain forever."

    They are the salt of the earth, the seasoning of the people, by which all insipid and tasteless things are seasoned and flavored. They are the light of the world, who, with the true light, that is, Christ, illuminate the darkness of the world with the brilliance of their preaching, the darkness of disbelief. It is evident that the Holy Spirit is given to them by the Lord on earth through breathing and from heaven in the fire and division of tongues to indicate the love of God and neighbor.

    They are given the power to bind and loose, to forgive and retain sins, to raise the dead, to cast out demons, to heal the sick, and to do other such works. They are granted the authority to teach all nations and to baptize in the name of the Holy Trinity. They are commanded to rejoice because their names are written in the book of eternal life in heaven. They are told: "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see, and the ears that hear what you hear," because, according to the most truthful testimony of the same Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, many prophets and kings desired to see what they saw and to hear what they heard.

    For although the distinguished gatherings of all patriarchs and prophets knew by the instruction of the spirit of prophecy that the Redeemer of the world was to come for the salvation of the world and somehow saw him with the eye of inner vision, they burned with desire to see corporeally the one whom they knew was coming corporeally.

    While they stand out with so many distinctions of merit and excel in such excellence of blessedness, it is in vain that those whose errors we refute strive to liken their emperors to them. It is clearly evident that the apostles are above the prophets. If, as they dream, their emperors are similar to the apostles, then they are preferred above the prophets, who did not see corporeally Christ, whom they knew was to come corporeally. If they are preferred above the prophets, then they saw the Redeemer of the world corporeally. However, it is very clear that they did not see the Redeemer of the world corporeally. Therefore, their emperors are not preferred above the prophets nor are they similar to the apostles, as they say.

    How then can they be likened to the apostles when they are not only not equal to them in merits or endowed with the same brilliance of holiness, but are also seen to oppose their most sacred preachings in many ways? Or how can they be similar to those whose followers they neglect to be?

    The apostles followed heavenly things that will last forever, while these follow earthly and perishable things. The apostles, spurning the world, preferred to adhere to the Lord, while these, clinging to the pomp of the world and its fleeting joys, often scorn the Lord's commandments. The apostles suffered persecution for righteousness, while these often persecute for righteousness.

    The apostles were handed over in councils and scourged in synagogues, while these are praised in subject cities and acclaimed among the people. The letters of the apostles, bearing the commerce of eternal life, were carried to be read throughout provinces and regions, while the images and effigies of these, referring to some old and pagan error, are carried around to be worshipped in towns and cities. The apostles are said to be blessed by the Lord when people hated and persecuted them and uttered all kinds of evil against them falsely.

        When six hundred and eight adversaries lied, they considered themselves blessed because they saw that they were loved, obeyed, and praised by people.
