<p>The prophecy, which proclaims that a virgin will conceive and bear a son, should no longer be sought in uncertain and ambiguous terms, but held in the heart. Its hidden mysteries are not in pictures, but in the divine scriptures and their interpreters, namely the apostles and their successors. These should be investigated and viewed with faith rather than with eyes.</p>

<p>For did not the most noble prophet Isaiah, referring to the gospel rather than prophecy, say: 'Unless you draw and worship images, you will not remain'? No, he said: 'If you believe, you will remain.'</p>

<p>Therefore, it is clear that anyone who wants to remain in the integrity of faith in the divine commands and come to eternal reward must have and believe in the instruments that lead to these, not in walls, not in panels, not in paintings, not in any visible things, but in the heart through faith, in the mouth through confession, and in the work through the exhibition of good deeds.</p>

<p>And one should believe that the virgin who brought forth the Savior of the world is not in the works of worldly artists, but in the work of the eternal and indescribable artist, that is, in the heavenly realms. Hence, it is necessary that anyone who wishes to worship her should fix their mind's eye, not on the dyes of colors, not on material works, not on any workshops, but where she reigns with Christ in heaven.</p>

<p>For when they said: 'Seeing this prophecy in a picture, namely a virgin holding the one she bore in her arms, how can we not worship and kiss it? Who would dare to resist with an undisciplined mind?' And we, following almost the same words in sound, not in sense, ask: 'Seeing this painting on a panel or wall, namely a virgin depicted holding a child in her arms, how can we presume to worship an insensate thing and kiss the work of any artist? Who would dare to commit such an act of folly, to give worship due to the Creator alone to created things and, while wishing to favor paintings, resist the holy Scriptures?'</p>

<p>Granted, the image of the holy mother of God is to be worshiped, but how can we know which image it is, or by what signs it is distinguished from other images, especially when there is no difference among them except the skill of the artists and the quality of the materials they work with?</p>

<p>When, therefore, we see a beautiful woman depicted holding a child in her arms, if no inscription has been made or if some inscription has been removed by chance, by what skill can we discern whether it is Sarah holding Isaac or Rebecca carrying Jacob or Bathsheba carrying Solomon or Elizabeth carrying John, or any woman holding her child?</p>

<p>And to come to the myths of the pagans, which are often found depicted, how can we know whether it is Venus holding Aeneas or Alcmene carrying Hercules or Andromache bearing Astyanax? For if one is worshiped for another, it is folly; if something is worshiped that should not be worshiped at all, it is madness. Both must be avoided.</p>

<p>The same blessed virgin is also depicted as having descended into Egypt bearing the child in her arms on a donkey, with Joseph leading, and as having returned from Egypt to the land of Israel. This story is depicted in many materials and not always in churches, but sometimes on dining or drinking vessels, sometimes on silk garments, often on tapestries. Are all these things to be worshiped?</p>

<p>When, therefore, in any of these items the image of the holy virgin holding the child on the back of a particular animal is worshiped, is not the image of the animal also worshiped along with her? For in no way can a separation be made in the worship of the image of both the virgin and the animal, especially since they are of the same material and made by the same artist.</p>


    <p>
        Ingeniously woven together. Either the worship of both is to be scorned, or both should be worshipped. But perhaps some prickly individual will say:
        <s>
            "This assertion of worshipping a living being is to be frustrated, because when we greet any man sitting on a chair or leaning on a staff, we are not shown to be worshipping the chair or staff, but after greeting the man, those remain un-greeted."
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        These sharp points should be shaken off in this way:
        <s>
            The definition of a man is different from that of a staff or chair; because indeed a man is defined as follows: A man is a rational, mortal, visible animal, and other things of this kind, while a chair or staff is not defined in the same way, but as objects lacking sense and life, prepared by the skill or will of the craftsman for the tasks for which they are necessary, and other such things.
        </s>
        <s>
            Thus, it is clear that it is one thing to worship a rational man by greeting him, and another to leave a chair or staff, as insensate things, un-greeted.
        </s>
        <s>
            But in the definition of an image of a virgin or a peculiar "living creature," since both lack sense and life, being made from one material, formed by one and the same craftsman, so cohering together that they cannot be separated from each other without division in the material in which they are placed, there is almost no difference in defining them.
        </s>
        <s>
            Where there is such a similarity, such a society, such a union of material, either the worship of both is to be accepted, or the worship of both is to be scorned.
        </s>
        <s>
            Since one cannot be separated from the other without division, and both should not be worshipped lest perhaps the image of the living creature be worshipped, it remains that both should lack the honor of worship and hold their place merely as ornaments in basilicas or in any places, providing a memory of past events to those who look upon them.
        </s>
        <s>
            Because, with so many branches leading to so many errors, the worship of images cannot be shown to stand within the holy Church by any clear reason.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, they urge each other to make themselves worthy of kissing or worshipping insensate things, saying:
        <s>
            "Let us make ourselves worthy for such a kiss of worship, so that we may not approach unworthy and suffer the punishment of Uzzah.
        </s>
        <s>
            Let us indeed make ourselves worthy to worship the divine majesty, or rather be made worthy by Him from whom comes the will and the act, so that as true worshippers we may not worship the Lord in some image according to their vanity, but in spirit and truth, as Truth itself says: 'The true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.'
        </s>
        <s>
            And that they urge themselves to be made worthy of kissing and worshipping images, lest perhaps they suffer the punishment of Uzzah, let them see that, just as Uzzah presumed without the aid of priests and Levites to think that the Ark of the Lord would fall, these people similarly think that the realm of divine worship would be frustrated without the aid of images, and they may undergo the same fatal punishment.
        </s>
        <s>
            For just as the Ark did not need the support of Uzzah to avoid falling, nor does the Church need the support of images to stand firm.
        </s>
        <s>
            And as the Ark, without any need of God, was carried without falling when Uzzah's support was absent, so indeed the Church, governed by the Lord, is preserved unstained without any shipwreck, even when the aid of images is set aside.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            What, then, is the meaning of wishing to put a hand to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, which was governed by the Lord to prevent it from falling, if not wishing to admit the worship of images to the Catholic religion, which is governed by the Lord to prevent it from stumbling in this life's journey?
        </s>
        <s>
            Or to whom can Uzzah be compared, who without the counsel of priests and Levites presumptuously wished to provide new support for the Ark of the Lord, if not to those who, without the teaching of the holy fathers and the consensus of priests established in various parts of the world, arrogantly and haughtily strive to introduce new worship of images into the Christian religion?
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, he lost his life who presumptuously attempted to support the Ark of God, because whoever believes that God, who is everywhere whole and wondrous, needs something in which to be worshipped and worships Him in visible things, must beware lest he lose his life when he resists God's vital teachings with a reckless mind.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, the same Levite rightly calls Uzzah...
        </s>
    </p>


  <p>
    It is said that those who are strong interpret, because those who presume, and who, unless they believe themselves to be strong with a bold mind, would not at all address synods, in which a new decree for the veneration of images would be considered, are active.
