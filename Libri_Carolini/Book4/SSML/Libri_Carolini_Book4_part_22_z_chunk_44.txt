<s>Their unrestrained madness is criticized as in other matters, so also in this one, because they said that their elders "sowed tares instead of wheat in the fields of the Church and mixed water with wine and gave their neighbors a turbulent drink," especially since in this matter, almost in all things in which they are believed to have sinned, these people are considered not only to have not corrected them, but even to have sinned more.</s> 
<s>Finally, according to the poet who said:</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>For soft violet, for purple narcissus,</s>
<s>Let thistle and thorny paliurus arise,</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>For their ancestors, tares rose instead of wheat, but for these people, with the tares not yet pulled out, paliurus arose, because indeed, neglecting the prophetic and evangelical or apostolic preaching of the wheat, in which places dedicated to divine worship are adorned and only God’s worship and adoration are recommended, they are shown to have received the pernicious doctrine of tares and thorny paliurus in either the abolition of ornaments from the churches or the adoration of those same ornaments.</s>
<s>And those who ought to have refreshed the minds of the faithful with the fullness of the divine word, which satisfies without satiety, strive to infect them with that doctrine, which nurtures immense satiety and madness and injects the stings of errors.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>They also said that their elders "mixed water with wine and gave a turbulent drink to their neighbors."</s>
<s>To whom it cannot be objected without reason, that their elders made the wine of the sacred word, which they should have used, insipid by mixing it with water, when they decreed the abolition of ornaments from the churches, but these people have sharpened the drink of the same wine corrupted by water from their predecessors with venom, as they profess to adore images and to render worship to them, and trying to condemn those who disdain their adoration with anathemas.</s>
<s>Then, both do not blush to give a turbulent drink to their neighbors, as they do not delay to corrupt their preaching, which they ought to adorn with sacred words and examples of good works, with vain and extraordinary constitutions and do not hesitate to show it to the present by life or action and to commit it to posterity’s memory by writings.</s>

<s>As for them asserting that they are "wolves in sheep’s clothing and embracing lies while rejecting the truth," they will see this happening in themselves if they carefully consider it.</s>
<s>For while they pretend to have great sanctity, as if burning with its zeal, they rejected images from the churches, so they would not be worshiped, which were not placed for worship by the ancients, and these people establish them to be worshiped, as if burning with excessive love of sanctity, and do not think the gifts of the Catholic faith are sufficient unless they render them worship service, while both act from a vain desire for praise, what else do they do but cover wolves with sheep’s clothing?</s>
<s>Because, indeed, while they pretend outwardly either zeal or diligence of sanctity, they show that they have the wolfish rage inwardly, by which they aim to surpass others and gnaw them with the teeth of anathemas.</s>
<s>Therefore, both pass over the truth and embrace lies, because, while they arrogantly and proudly strive to establish new things, not following the examples of the ancient fathers with humility as leader, they depart from the Truth which neither deceives nor can be deceived, and adhere to that lie, about which it is written: From the beginning, he was a liar and did not stand in the truth.</s>
<s>What, then, is passing over the truth, but opposing the precepts of Christ, who is the author of humility, through boasting?</s>
<s>What is following a lie, but adhering to the examples of him who is the author of pride, by establishing new and illicit constitutions and neglecting the ancient and salutary traditions?</s>
</p>
<p>
    <s>Resisting in their actions:</s>
    <s>Both groups act this way when, puffed up with pride, they fall into the error of either breaking or worshipping images.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Furthermore, when they claim their ancestors "brought forth vipers' eggs and weaved spiders' webs," they insult themselves significantly in this respect.</s>
    <s>They are their ancestors' eggs because they were either propagated through their flesh, influenced by their teachings, or consecrated through the laying on of hands in church orders.</s>
    <s>Therefore, they are their webs, because they were physically descended from them or spiritually instructed by their doctrine.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>They rightly call themselves vipers' eggs and spiders' webs because they block their ears to avoid hearing the words of Scripture with their inner ear, which establish the worship and adoration of the one and only God.</s>
    <s>They do not fear to weave a web through preaching to capture or entice souls with new and useless regulations.</s>
    <s>According to their profession, anyone who desires to be those same eggs will find a basilisk within.</s>
    <s>Anyone who seeks to use their preaching finds the deadly breath of tradition in them.</s>
    <s>While wishing to find some remedy to satisfy the hunger for the word through preaching, they find the loss of internal salvation and lose life.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, we do not take their arguments lightly in our debate because we have found that they did not spare themselves in their "debate."</s>
    <s>Having received material for reproach from them, we attack them with their own darts.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>We do all this not without love, but because we seek their conversion from error, hoping that someday they may despise the monstrosities of their error and desire to follow the path that leads to life forever.</s>
