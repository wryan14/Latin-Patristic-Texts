        <p>In the difference between kissing and adoring, which those two think is the same, there is no need to labor much, since these two names differ as much as the things between which these names exist differ. And necessarily, they have a great distinction from each other, as the things themselves often have a great separation between them, especially since sometimes what is adored is not kissed, and what is kissed is not adored. For God is adored but not kissed; saints who have departed from the world with triumphs of merits are venerated, but they should neither be adored with divine worship nor can they be kissed. Conversely, spouses, children, and even servants kiss, but they are not adored.</p>
        <p>It is clear that a kiss and adoration are names of two different things. So how can there be such unity in the sense of the names when there is such diversity in the understanding of the things? Or why can't words differ in sense when the origins of the words can differ in practice? For things are not created for names, but names for things. Nor is it to be believed that things are fitted to names, but names rather to things, since it is read that animals were brought to the first man by the Lord to see what he would call them; for the things created by God, the father of the human race gave names, not things created by him to which he would give names, having seen them brought to him.</p>
        <p>Finally, the philosopher Plato stated that names are natural and tried to prove this by saying that they are a kind of furniture and instrument for producing senses. The furniture of natural things are natural: like eyes are instruments for seeing, which is a natural sense; therefore, eyes also must be natural. Likewise, speech is the furniture and instrument of natural things, that is, sentences; therefore, it too is natural. Aristotle, however, says that speech is not according to nature but according to convention; hence, speech is not natural furniture. For he does not say that it is not an instrument, but only that speech is a thing according to position, through which we demonstrate our own sentences. The same philosopher, to whom the greatest faith is to be given in this part, says in the book "On Interpretation" that a name is a significant voice according to convention without time, that is, a name is a voice. But some things signify, others do not; however, a name signifies that of which it is a name. Therefore, a name is a significant voice. Some significant voices are natural, some are not natural. A natural significant voice is like that which naturally shows pain or joy, such as interjections; not naturally significant voices are those which we say exist according to position. According to position are those which humans have placed themselves, as shown in the earlier example taken from Genesis, which would be too long to follow individually. Meanwhile, it is clear that "kiss" and "adoration," or "to kiss" and "to adore," are two things often very different from each other.</p>
        <p>According to the masters of secular literature, there are three things through which every conversation and dispute is perfected: things, intellect, voices. Things are what we perceive with the mind's reason and discern with intellect, such as to adore or to kiss or something similar; intellect is a certain vigor of the mind, by which we learn the things themselves and discern how they differ from each other; voices are those by which we capture what we understand with intellect.</p>
    <p>We clarify that for what is worship, we say worship; for what is to kiss, we say a kiss. There is another thing that signifies sounds: these are letters; for the writing of these letters signifies sounds.</p>
  
  <p>So, when there are four things: object, understanding, speech, and letter, the understanding grasps the object, speech designates the understanding, and letters signify the speech itself.</p>
  
  <p>Hence, the aforementioned Aristotle in his "Peri Hermeneias" said: "Those things which are in speech are the symbols of the affections of the soul; and those things which are written are the symbols of those that are in speech; and just as letters are not the same for all, neither are sounds the same."</p>
  
  <p>But the affections of the soul, which these first symbols signify, are the same for all, and their likenesses are also the same objects, according to the explanation of the most learned man, Boethius, who designates a certain passion of the soul as understanding; because, as Boethius says, unless the soul receives a certain likeness of the thing that one understands in the rational soul, there is no understanding.</p>
  
  <p>For when I see a square circle of the sky, I conceive its shape in my mind, and its likeness is formed in the reason of my soul, and the soul receives the likeness of the understood thing. Hence, understanding is both the likeness of the thing and the passion of the soul.</p>
  
  <p>Of these four, two are natural, and two are according to human convention. Voices and letters are according to convention, but understanding and objects are natural. This is proven by the fact that different peoples use different voices and letters; because they themselves composed the voices they would use and the letters they would write.</p>
  
  <p>However, no one created understanding and objects; they exist naturally. For what is a horse among the Romans is not a deer among the barbarians, but the nature of things is the same among different peoples. Therefore, what we understand to be a horse, the barbarians do not consider a deer, but the understanding and reason of substances are established the same among very different peoples.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, two of these are according to human convention: voices and letters; and two are according to nature: objects and understanding.</p>
  
  <p>These teachings show that worship and a kiss are not the same thing, even though among the Greeks these two names have some consonance. Often, two or more names have the same meaning as synonyms, and often one name signifies two or more things as homonyms: yet the order of things is not confused or somehow mutilated if names are given to them by humans in very different ways according to their pleasure.</p>
  
  <p>Meanwhile, they add a third thing to these two, so that 'to worship', 'to kiss', and 'to embrace' are all one. But just as those two are separated from each other, so certainly this third one is separated from those two; because, as we mentioned above, some things are worshipped but not immediately kissed, some things are kissed but not immediately worshipped, and many things are embraced which are neither worshipped nor kissed.</p>
  
  <p>Anyone embraces a tree or a stone or any other thing in a certain situation, to which it would be superfluous to give a kiss, yet does not worship it. One also kisses someone of higher status, to whom one scarcely dares to approach with reverence restraining them, yet does not embrace them. As much as these three are seen to differ from each other in sense, so certainly the same examples, which are set forth to prove that they are one, are seen to differ from reason, since they have a great distance from each other and no consonance with reason.</p>
  
  <p>They say: "The same of the holy princes of our doctrine and their successors, the excellent fathers of our fathers, and these are worshipped, that is to say, kissed; for both are the same; the common ancient Greek expression signifies to kiss and to embrace, and it signifies some extension of love, just as I bear and offer, I affirm and confirm, I participate and adore, which demonstrates the kiss and the extension of friendship."</p>
  
  <p>O sense, confusing rather than arranging sentences, breaking words rather than pronouncing them! O acumen, blunter than any pestle, O leaden maces, blunting the edge before cutting the thing for which they are applied! O sword, more like a hammer delivering blows rather than cutting!</p>


<p>Sword cut, breaking the material rather than cutting it! Oh, argument that asserts nothing except the madness of its authors, valid only in its own case, showing no firmness regarding the proposed matter, but only revealing that its bearers are foolish!</p>

<p>From the fact that "fero" (I bring) and "offero" (I offer), "adorare" (to adore), "osculari" (to kiss), and "amplecti" (to embrace) are said to be one and the same, while ignoring the power of prepositions, which often corrupt other parts, are often corrupted by other parts, sometimes both corrupt and are corrupted, and sometimes neither corrupt nor are corrupted, and these meanings sometimes increase, sometimes decrease, sometimes change, while seeking to assert some empty things, it strives to prove them with empty assertions!</p>

<p>Who then does not know that "offero" (I offer), "affero" (I bring to), "effero" (I carry out), "infero" (I bring in), "confero" (I confer), "aufero" (I take away), "defero" (I bring down), "refero" (I bring back), "suffero" (I endure), "differo" (I differ), "profero" (I bring forth), "prefero" (I prefer), "perfero" (I carry through), and so on, although they come from the verb "fero" (I bring), with prepositions added and in some part corrupted, they differ greatly from each other in meaning?</p>

<p>Or who does not know that "participo" (I share) and "adoro" (I adore) have almost no agreement in sense? For "firmo" (I strengthen) and "confirmo" (I confirm), although they are common in sense, seem to be entirely foreign to the thing to which they are applied. If we were to discuss all these things individually as it is taught in grammar schools, these matters would barely be contained in the text of one book.</p>

<p>But it must not be overlooked that they complete their very vain argumentation with a certain frivolous and empty conclusion, as if by a certain convertible syllogism, saying: "For what one loves, one also adores, and what one adores, one also loves," not knowing that these two can hardly be interchanged, because they are unequal and "to love" can extend further than "to adore." For one loves his wife or child, yet does not adore them; he loves a servant, a maid, a horse, a dog, a hawk, and so on, yet does not adore them. Therefore, as it is true when one says, "what one adores, one also loves," it cannot be equally true when one says, "what one loves, one also adores"; for this inversion cannot reasonably stand, since one of them, as we said, extends further and there is no such property in these that they can be believed to be mutually interchangeable.</p>

<p>Thus, as it can be said in reverse order: "what is neighing is a horse, and what is a horse is neighing," it cannot be rightly said: "what one loves, one also adores, and what one adores, one also loves," because even in the same topics from which these arguments proceed, in the same argumentation called by the name of consequent, in which something inevitably follows the proposed matter, like what we said about neighing and the horse, many things can be reversed, but some things cannot be reversed. For example, it can be reversed if someone says: "If it is laughable, it inevitably follows that it is a human, and if it is a human, it is necessarily laughable," and other similar things. However, it cannot be reversed if someone says: "If it is day, it is light"; for it follows that, if it is day, it is light; if one is full, it follows that he has eaten; if he is drunk, it is certain that he has drunk; if he is learned, it follows that he has studied; if he adores, it follows that he loves what he adores.</p>

<p>It cannot be said in reverse order: "if it is light, it is necessarily day"; "if he has eaten, it follows that he is full," since many things are light but not day, and often eating does not reach fullness; nor can it be said: "if he has drunk, he is drunk," "if he has studied, he is learned," "if he loves, he adores," since sometimes drinking does not reach drunkenness, nor does learning reach mastery, nor does love reach adoration.</p>

<p>Therefore, let each be considered according to the experience of dialecticians, so that it may be more easily apparent how much these two differ from each other or how this inversion cannot stand. For there are four propositions somehow related to each other, which philosophers have been accustomed to write in a square form for examination, so that the first two are: "Everything that loves who...</p>


  <p>
    Yes, he worships, and nothing that one loves is worshiped. There are two characters:
  </p>
  <p>
    Something that one loves is worshiped. Something that one loves is not worshiped. The first two are called universal affirmation and universal negation, and the next two are called particular affirmation and particular negation. The two higher ones are completely contrary to each other, whereas the two lower ones are mutually subcontrary. The universal or particular affirmation and the universal or particular negation are nonetheless called subaltern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then sense inquiries are drawn almost like two angular lines: one from this universal affirmation, "Everything that one loves is worshiped," to this particular negation, "Something that one loves is not worshiped." The other from this particular affirmation, "Something that one loves is worshiped," to this universal negation, "Nothing that one loves is worshiped." They are contrary or opposite to each other. With these thus opposing each other, since both the universal affirmation and particular negation or the particular affirmation and universal negation cannot truly exist, one will be false and the other true. Thus, the true one will invalidate the false one. If that one is true, the other will soon depart from the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apuleius, the Platonic philosopher of Madauros, who very subtly debated this kind of syllogistic industry in the book titled On Apuleian Periermenias, says: "The universal, he says, when proven, confirms its particular, but when refuted, it does not inform it. The particular, however, when reversed, securely weakens the universal truth. When proven, it confirms it, but when refuted, it does not confirm it."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, in this argumentation, there are two higher universals: "Everything that one loves is worshiped," and "Nothing that one loves is worshiped," which are false because, as stated above, a person loves many things that are not worshiped, and some of the things that one loves are worshiped. There are also two lower particulars: "Something that one loves is worshiped," and "Something that one loves is not worshiped," both of which are true because one loves God according to: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart," and worships Him, from whose most holy love the nourishment of all virtues proceeds. One loves one's neighbor and venerates him with the duty of greeting. In this, the proposition "Something that one loves is worshiped" is proven true. This is also true: "Something that one loves is not worshiped," according to examples of a spouse, child, horse, dog, hawk, and other things mentioned above, each of which is loved but not worshiped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Universals and lower particulars are alternately opposed to each other. If this universal affirmation is false: "Everything that one loves is worshiped," then this particular negation is true: "Something that one loves is not worshiped." If this particular negation is false, the universal affirmation is true. Again, if this universal negation: "Nothing that one loves is worshiped," is false, this particular affirmation: "Something that one loves is worshiped," is true. If this is not true, neither is that false. However, the two lower ones are completely true, so the two higher ones are to be believed as entirely false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding the conversion of such propositions, about which we have discussed a little above, the aforementioned philosopher says thus: Convertible propositions are called universal negation and either of its particulars, that is, particular affirmation, because their parts, subjective and declarative, can always maintain their positions with each other while retaining the condition of truth or falsity. For if this proposition is true: "No wise man is impious," then, if you reverse the parts, it will certainly be: "No impious man is wise." Similarly, if it is false: "No man is an animal," then, if you reverse it, it will be false: "No animal is a man." By the same reasoning, the particular affirmation is reversed: "Some grammarian is a man," and conversely: "Some man is a grammarian." The other two propositions cannot always do this, although they are sometimes converted. Yet, they are not called convertible for that reason.
  </p>


  <p>
    Finding the meaning through all indications is necessary. Even if it is converted, it should match. There are not just one of these, but five, for it either declares a property, a kind, a difference, an end, or an accessory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, to counter their statement and support our claim, many arguments of this kind could be used. What has been used could have been discussed more extensively, but for the sake of brevity, these and similar ones are omitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reason, we have prepared, with the Lord's help, to refute their assertion with arguments derived from the deliberate art of dialectics. We have found that they, by some kind of conversion, wanted to support their nonsense with a sort of syllogistic argumentation.
