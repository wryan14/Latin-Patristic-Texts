        About what they said arrogantly and ignorantly: “Similarly, we joined those who came from the East in the same metropolis of Nicaea and made Christ the head while all of us presided.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The most arrogant and rather absurd statement of those who boasted that they made Christ their head, saying, “While all of us presided, we made Christ the head,” is strongly criticized. For the same Lord, who is the head of the Church, made the Church His body, not that He was made head by the Church. The Apostle himself testifies, saying: “You did not choose me, but I chose you” <break time="1s"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="d͡ʒɑn">John</phoneme> 15:16. For if, according to their foolishness, Christ was made head by them, then He was indeed chosen by them; and if He was chosen by them, the aforementioned statement of the Lord is invalidated. However, the aforementioned statement of the Lord is not invalidated, so according to their vanity, Christ was not made head by them.

        Therefore, it must be avoided that these people might be exempt from His selection, who boast that they made Him their head, for indeed, as we infer, if they had been chosen by Him, they would seek His glory, not their own, and they would preach the worship of one God, not senseless things. For by the fruits, a tree is known according to the statement of Truth, and in the nature of things, the cause is often known by the effects. When someone sees smoke, they do not doubt that there is fire beneath; or when they see the footprint of an animal, they do not doubt that the same animal has passed by; and when someone sees a good work, they do not doubt that it is from God, who is the author of all good things; and when someone sees something wrong, they believe it is perpetrated by the machinations of the ancient enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Saying this, we do not rashly judge anything about their selection, as often well-established things are found to be corrupted, but we firmly affirm that they are not chosen to establish ecclesiastical constitutions through them and boast that they made Christ, who is the life of all who believe in Him, their head.

        Suppose they were chosen by Him and appointed to the priesthood by Him. Why do they not follow Him in humility? Why do they seek their own glory rather than His, who testified that He sought not His own glory but the glory of Him who sent Him? Why do they neglect to put aside arrogance? Why do they inappropriately seek high positions? Why do they disturb the prosperity of the Church with a kind of civil war? If they were content with the teachings or examples of the ancient fathers, they would neither disrupt domestic peace with erroneous constitutions nor turn the weapons of their allies, who would fight against the enemies with them, against themselves. This indeed is a useless statement, in which they dream that they made Christ their head, although it does not detract from the faith, it is not free from criticism. For we do not believe them to be of such immense insanity that they meant to say that the same Lord was made by them, which indeed no faithful ears can bear to hear.

        But because they wanted to signify something else and signified something different, we were pleased both to discuss what they said and not to leave undiscussed what they intended to say. For, if we are not mistaken, they wanted to say: “While we, who are members of Christ, preside, we have placed all firmness of our work and hope in Him, who is our head, and we have decided to follow Him,” or something of that kind, which can be inferred. And from what they intended to say, they, uplifted by their inept words, said “we made Christ our head,” and they say that what John the Evangelist said: “All things were made through Him” <break time="1s"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="d͡ʒɑn">John</phoneme> 1:3, was made by them.

    <p>
        In the creed of the synodal constitution, it says about Him: “Begotten, not made”; and the Apostle says: “Who was made of the seed of David” <break time="1s"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="roʊˈmæns">Romans</phoneme> 1:3. This is resolved thus: because as God, all things were made through Him, but as a man, He Himself was also made, as Solomon says: “Wisdom has built her house” <break time="1s"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="proʊˈvɜrbz">Proverbs</phoneme> 9:1, that is, the wisdom of God the Father, without whom the Father was never, which was not made by Him, but born, namely the Son, who is of one substance with the Father, built for Himself a body in the womb of the Virgin, which He called a temple, saying: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” <break time="1s"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="d͡ʒɑn">John</phoneme> 2:19.
