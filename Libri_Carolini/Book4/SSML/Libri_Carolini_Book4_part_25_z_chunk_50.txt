  <p>They thought they had found a great defense for image worshipers in the fact that Epiphanius, who distinguished the varieties of heresies in eighty chapters, if he knew the worship of images was a heresy, would count the worshipers of those images among the heretics. They tried to attack us, who are content with the worship and adoration of God alone, using these weapons. They attempted to pierce us with these arrows, to defeat us with these spears, and believed they would be the invaders of our freedom with these swords, saying: '<s>If he, who generally discussed all heresies, knew this to be a heresy, he would also include it among the other heresies in his discussion</s>'; <s>but he did not place it among the heresies he discussed, so it should not be considered a heresy</s>.</p>
  
  <p>We thought it appropriate to respond to them in turn and, with the Lord's help, to defeat them with their own weapons and to direct the same spears they threw at us back at them, saying: '<s>If the same Epiphanius knew that those who scorn the worship of images were heretics, he would undoubtedly count them among the heretics in his general discussion of heresies</s>'; <s>but he did not count them among the heretics, so he must not have believed them to be heretics</s>.</p>
  
  <p>However, it is shown by these signs that Epiphanius not only spurned the worship of images but also did not want them to be in churches. In the letter that he sent to Bishop John, which Jerome translated from Greek into Latin, it reads: '<s>I heard some murmuring against me when we were going together to the holy place called Bethel to hold a church service with you as usual, and when I returned to the village called Anablata</s>, <s>I saw a lamp burning there and asked what place it was, learned that it was a church, and entered to pray</s>, <s>I found a curtain hanging in the doorway of that church, dyed and painted, having the image of Christ or some saintâ€”I do not remember whose image it was</s>. <s>When I saw this in the church of Christ, contrary to the authority of Scriptures, I tore it down and advised the guardians of that place to use it to wrap a poor dead person and bury him</s>'; <s>and they murmured against me, saying</s>: '<s>If he wanted to tear it down, he should have given another curtain and changed it</s>.' <s>When I heard this, I promised to give one and immediately send it</s>. <s>There was a slight delay as I was seeking the best curtain to send</s>; <s>I thought it would have to be sent from Cyprus</s>. <s>Now, however, I have sent what I could find, and I ask you to order the presbyter of that place to accept the curtain from the bearer, which was sent by us, and henceforth to instruct that such curtains, which go against our religion, should not be hung in the church of Christ</s>. <s>It is fitting for your honor to show this greater concern and meticulousness, which is worthy of the church of Christ and the people entrusted to you</s>.' This is the opinion of Epiphanius on this matter, which whether it is praiseworthy or blameworthy is left to the reader's judgment.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, let us come to the blessed Augustine, let the very wise man be asked, let the excellent doctor be inquired, let him say whether any heresy uses the worship of images. For the same venerable man wrote a book on eighty-nine heresies, among which two include the worship of images, namely the Simonians and Carpocratians. To make this clearer, let the opinions of the aforementioned doctor, as found in the same book, be stated one by one. He says: 'The Simonians are named after Simon Magus, who, baptized by Philip the deacon, as it is read in the Acts of the Apostles, wanted to buy the power from the holy apostles with money so that the Holy Spirit would be given through the laying on of his hands. He deceived many with magical tricks. He taught detestable depravity...'</p>

Using women differently. He did not say that God made the world.
</s>
<s>
He also denied the resurrection of the flesh and claimed to be Christ.
</s>
<s>
He also believed he was Jupiter and worshiped himself, while considering Minerva to be a certain prostitute named Selene, whom he made his partner in crimes.
</s>
<s>
He provided images of himself and this prostitute for his disciples to worship, which he had established in Rome as public idols.
</s>
<s>
In that city, the blessed apostle Peter extinguished him through the true power of the omnipotent God.

<s>
For he had claimed to have given the law to Moses on Mount Sinai in the person of the Father, to have appeared in the time of Tiberius in the person of the Son, and later to have come over the apostles in tongues of fire as the Holy Spirit.
</s>
<s>
But he said Christ neither came nor suffered anything from the Jews.
</s>
<s>
Just as the heresy that originated from Simon, called Simoniaca, is completely rejected by the faithful, so too should the practice of worshiping images be entirely rejected.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There is another heresy which recounts this error, which the mentioned doctor wrote about: The Carpocratians began from Carpocrates, who taught every vile act and every invention of sin, claiming that there was no other way to escape and surpass the rulers and authorities who approved of these things, in order to reach the higher heaven.
</s>
<s>
He is also said to have considered Jesus to be merely a man born of both sexes but to have received such a soul that he knew heavenly things and announced them.
</s>
<s>
He rejected the resurrection of the body along with the law.
</s>
<s>
He denied that the world was made by God, but by certain powers.

<s>
A woman named Marcellina is said to have been associated with his sect, who worshipped images of Jesus, Paul, Homer, and Pythagoras by offering incense.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For if perhaps someone advocating this error says: Blessed Augustine considered the worship of images among heresies because some pagans, that is Simon, Selene, and even Homer and Pythagoras, worshipped images, let him note that images of Jesus and Paul were also said to have been worshipped, and this was counted among heresies by the aforementioned man.
</s>
<s>
For if he knew that images made by human hands of the Lord, the apostles, or any saints were to be worshipped, he would never have counted the worship of images of Jesus and Paul among the heresies.
