<s>All arts involve various practices, and painting is an art.</s>
<s>Therefore, the practice of painting involves various activities; and those who practice it, called painters, understand it to varying degrees: some more, some less.</s>
<s>Some produce more beautiful works, others less attractive ones; some create lovely images, others create ugly ones.</s>
<s>Thus, it is evident that those who place almost all their faith on images and do not hesitate to count their worship among the tools of good works are in some way deceived by worshipping sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly images.</s>
<s>For if any image is more sacred and virtuous the more beautiful it is, then it must be that the less beautiful an image is, the less sacred and virtuous it is; and if the less beautiful one is less sacred, then any very ugly image must have little or no sanctity and virtue.</s>
<s>And if the more beautiful one is worshipped more attentively because it has more virtue due to its beauty, then its sanctity does not come from a certain religious aspect but from the work of the artist.</s>
<s>And if an image that is less beautiful or has no beauty at all is worshipped, its worshippers are greatly deceived, as they worship things without beauty.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>If, therefore, it is appropriate to worship all images equally, whether beautiful, less beautiful, or lacking beauty, justice, which gives each its due, must be removed from things.</s>
<s>For when they worship beautiful images, thinking by some chance that they are worshipping something holy, they are deceived; and when they worship ugly paintings deliberately, they are also deceived, as they worship ugly things as if they were holy things.</s>
<s>So, whether they worship them by chance or deliberately, they are deceived.</s>
<s>Truly, they are rightfully deceived, who, when God, the creator of all, has decreed that He alone should be worshipped, strive to worship certain insensible things; and while they think they are showing some veneration to saints by worshipping images, they actually extend a certain community to divine worship alone.</s>
<s>Since, therefore, only God should be worshipped, while martyrs or any saints should be venerated rather than worshipped, as we have already said and as is proven by the teachings of the illustrious doctor Jerome: who, while writing against a certain heretic Vigilantius, who claimed that the relics of martyrs should not be venerated, said among other things: "Who ever, O insane head, worshipped the martyrs?"</s>
<s>Therefore, according to his statement, if martyrs are not worshipped, much less should their images be worshipped by the faithful.</s>

<s>As for what is read in the books of Kings, that Saul worshipped Samuel, who was raised by the witch of Endor, it can be understood that it was not the soul of Samuel that was raised, but some deceptive image of diabolical trickery appeared to King Saul, either because he allowed himself to be worshipped, which a holy man would not permit, or because he told the wicked king: "Tomorrow you will be with me," when clearly the heinously wicked king would not be with the prophet after dying but with the devil, who, leading those he lures to commit evil deeds in this world, drags them with him to eternal punishments in the future.</s>
<s>Hearing this prophecy, the king of immense guilt, understanding in what guise he had been raised, thought it to be Samuel.</s>
<s>He reported what he understood, and because he did not understand correctly, he worshipped someone other than the Lord, and thinking he was worshipping Samuel, he worshipped the devil, so that Satan might enjoy the fruit of his deception.</s>
<s>For Satan strives to be worshipped as if he were God.</s>
<s>If Samuel had truly appeared to him, the just man would not have allowed himself to be worshipped, having preached that only the Lord should be worshipped.</s>
<s>And how could the man of God, who was with Abraham in comfort, have said to the man deserving the torment of hell: "Tomorrow you will be with me?"</s>
<s>With these two points, foolish Satan exposed the subtlety of his deception, for he allowed himself to be worshipped under the guise and name of Samuel, which I believe Samuel would never have done.</s>

    He wouldn't allow it, and a man burdened with sins, with a great distance between sinners and the righteous, would be, as he falsely claimed, with the most righteous Samuel. The truth can be seen if Samuel's name is not mentioned, because Saul was going to be with the devil. For he transferred to him, whom he worshipped, although both blessed Augustine and other teachers have different opinions on this matter, and the book of Sirach praises Samuel because he prophesied after death.

    Now, those who think that almost all the privileges of the Christian faith lie in the adoration or worship of images should be asked whether the poor suffer a loss of faith because they lack the means to acquire pictures due to their poverty. If a poor person is therefore deprived of good merits because he lacks the resources to acquire images, does a wealthy person gain the privilege of merit because he has the resources to buy pictures? 
  </p>

    And if one receives rewards or punishments for possessions, not merits, and the other is judged for his lack, not works, the adoration of images will rise to a great height in the Christian religion, and justice, which examines anyone's merits, not possessions, will lose much of its power. Since none of these things can be confirmed by any logical consequence, it remains that the worship of images is believed to hold no principal place in the Christian religion.
