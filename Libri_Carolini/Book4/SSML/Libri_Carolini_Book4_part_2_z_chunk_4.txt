    <s>This nonsensical idea, often mentioned by John the presbyter, he did not hesitate to add to his frivolities, to say that 'by the image, which appears through colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped.'</s>
    <s>As if the Lord needs something and by some means makes his strength, which lacks nothing, to be worshiped.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>When God created the first of all angelic nature with the heaven and earth, it is believed that from the beginning of their creation, they worshiped and praised the strength of God, because at that time there were no humans, nor were there materials to paint images on.</s>
    <s>So, should we believe that the Lord's strength was not worshiped or praised?</s> 
    <s>For Scripture says: When all the stars were created, all my angels praised me together (Job 38:7).</s>
    <s>Here it is clearly shown that not 'by the image, which appears through colors,' but by his ineffable power, God's strength has always been praised and worshiped.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>After the creation of humans, when the art of painting had not yet developed in the world, was the strength of the Lord any less worshiped by the saints?</s>
    <s>Indeed, neither righteous Abel, nor Enoch, nor Noah, nor any of the saints who lived in those times are believed to have worshiped the Lord's strength 'by the image' or 'by colors,' as in the still-primitive world, they had no experience with certain worldly arts.</s>
    <s>Therefore, if there are many parts of the world where people are unaware of the art of painting, is the strength of the Lord not believed to be worshiped there?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Hence, the strength of the Lord is worshiped not 'by the image, which appears through colors,' as he dreams, but by his ineffable power, by which it is known that the whole world was created.</s>
    <s>The strength of the Lord is also worshiped not by certain materials, but by His Word, namely the Son, whom he ineffably begot before ages and through whom and in whom he created the universe.</s>
    <s>He is the right hand and strength of the Father, through which the creation of all creatures was accomplished, and so too is the perpetual worship by angels and humans, who recognize him as the cause of all creation and the cause of the most just and fitting adoration.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, the holy and universal church does not worship God through 'the image, which is made from colors,' as often mentioned by John, but through Christ the Lord, confessing when celebrating the mysteries of his redemption that it is fitting and right, just and beneficial, that we always and everywhere give thanks to him, through whom the ineffable majesty of the Father is praised by angels, worshiped by dominions, trembled at by powers, and the heavens and the heavenly army sing a hymn of glory to him with sweet-sounding modulation.</s>
    <s>Therefore, his strength is worshiped not through a colorful image of him, but through his most sacred and life-giving incarnation.</s>
    <s>His power is worshiped not through a painting, but through his works, namely, by taking the form of a servant, being born of a virgin, giving hearing to the deaf, speech to the mute, movement to the lame, health to lepers and others afflicted with diseases, life to the dead, sight to the blind, despoiling the underworld, destroying the power of death, rising from the grave, and ascending to the heavens.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>These are the means by which the strength of the Lord is worshiped by Catholics: these are the defenses by which the faith of the church is protected; this is the confession, from which if anyone dissents, they are endangered, but if they hold it in their heart, they attain eternal salvation.</s>
    <s>This is the perpetual memorial, by which the minds of the faithful always behold Christ with their inner eyes, to which full knowledge is not reached through painting, but through faith, hope, and love.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Since John, clouded by the mist of his ignorance, as I think, said one thing while intending to say another, let these words suffice against what he said!</s>

    To address the things he wanted to say, we need to turn to the main point of this discussion, so that both what he reluctantly confirmed and what he eagerly tried to say, with this style fortified by rational arguments, can be shaken. This way, the reader will recognize that we have both understood the things said in improper words and analyzed the statements that are easy to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, when he says: <s>"By the image that appears through colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped,"</s> we guess he meant to say: <s>"Seeing the image made up of colors, the strength of the Lord is worshiped."</s> He made this almost clear in the following when he says: <s>"And we will remember His presence on earth."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can easily object to this idea because neither the reading of the Holy Scriptures nor the examples of the fathers suggest that God should be sought in man-made things. David says: <s>"I have hidden your words in my heart, not in images; with all my heart I have sought you, God, do not reject me from your commandments."</s> And Moses says: <s>"Place the words of the Lord in your hearts."</s> And the Lord through the prophet says: <s>"Return to me with all your heart."</s> Conversely, about the rejected ones, He says: <s>"This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    From this, it is understood that God is to be sought not in visible things, not in man-made things, but in the heart; not with the physical eyes, but only with the eye of the mind. For what madness it is to say: <s>"By the image that appears through colors, His strength is worshiped, and we will remember His presence on earth"!</s> It is an unfortunate memory that relies on an imaginary vision to remember Christ, who should never leave the heart of a righteous man. One cannot have the presence of Christ in oneself unless one sees His image painted on a wall or some material, because such a memory, which is nourished by images, does not come from the love of the heart, but from the necessity of vision. This is because it is not internal love that ignites the memory of Christ, but the necessity by which we even recall unpleasant things when we see them painted, led to the mind by the vision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it is to be feared for such people, who are bound by such a necessity that they can hardly remember Christ unless they see pictures, that if they were to lose their sight due to some bodily ailment or lack pictures by some accident, which cannot always be available, they would entirely forget Christ, who must always be kept before their eyes.
