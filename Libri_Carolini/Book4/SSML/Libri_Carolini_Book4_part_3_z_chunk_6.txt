        <s>Indeed, when the same synod, the reading of which we have insisted upon, advises many things to which no sane person will dare to give assent, attempts to dissuade many things from which no sane person will attempt to turn away, and criticizes many things that are entirely praiseworthy, and on the contrary, praises many things that are entirely worthy of criticism, it also advises that no one should be offended 'because lights and incense are made before images,' as if those who light candles for things that lack light and offer fragrant incense to things that lack odor are not the ones being offended.</s>

        <s>For those are indeed offended who offer to senseless things what should be offered worthily to God and encourage others to do so; and they think we will be offended, from whom they reasonably fear their madness will be mocked, and while they consider themselves to be reproached by us, they boast of being zealous for our salvation.</s>

        <s>Thus, they fear that we will be offended in this part and think they are striving for good works, but the offense of this part will harm us as much as the exhibition of their insolent service will benefit them, because the order demands that they must impart the same reward for the service offered to those images as the sense of honor imparted, since they are known to be completely senseless.</s>

    <p>
        <s>But perhaps wishing to refute our assertion, they will say: 'Why do you mock those who prepare lights and burn incense before senseless images, when we also prepare lights and burn incense in basilicas, which are equally senseless?'</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>To which an easy objection can arise, since it is one thing for places dedicated to divine worship to be illuminated with lights and for the smoke of prayers and incense to be offered to God in those places, and another thing to offer light to an image with eyes that see nothing and burn incense to a nose that smells nothing; it is one thing to venerate places dedicated to divine worship, and another to offer lights and incense to pictures decorated with various colors; it is one thing to solemnly venerate the house of the majesty of the Lord built by any of the faithful and dedicated by the pontiff, and another and far different thing to irrationally kiss images composed by painters with offered gifts.</s>

        <s>For my house, says the Lord, will be called a house of prayer; and elsewhere: Acceptable gifts will be on my altar, and my house of prayer will be honored.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>For in many ways that place must be exalted with honors, where the faithful people gather from everywhere, and their supplications are mercifully heard by God, and the mysteries of our salvation are celebrated, and a sacrifice of praise is offered to God, where an angelic assembly is made to bring sacrifices to God by the hands of priests, where the frequent harmony of those singing psalms resounds, where the flowing streams of divine reading irrigate thirsty hearts.</s>

    <p>
        <s>Indeed, in many of those places, where they boast of offering lights and incense to images, from which they think we who despise doing so are offended, the places dedicated to divine worship are so despicable that, as we have learned from our envoys or those who were sent by my father of reverent memory, or those who were destined by us to those parts, many basilicas in their lands lack not only lights and incense but even coverings themselves, whereas in the kingdom granted to us by God with His help, who deigned to preserve them, the basilicas abound in gold and silver, gems and pearls, and other most beautiful decorations, and although we refuse to prepare lights and burn incense for images, we adorn places dedicated to divine worship with the most precious things.</s>
