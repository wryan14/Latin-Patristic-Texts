        It is said that it is the same crime to despise images as it is to bring out the bones of kings from their graves. For example, Nebuchadnezzar brought out the bones of the kings of India from their graves, gouged out the eyes of the king of Judea after killing his sons, and took the cherubim from the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despising images, as we have often said, breaking them, offering them lights and incense, and worshiping them is considered to have no authority from any reading and is shown by no example of any saint to be something that should be done. Especially because breaking them or worshiping them has been prohibited by some holy fathers. And not without reason, because it is entirely removed from caution, which both those who hold synods or those who overly abolish them or even unnecessarily worship them commit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, they say that those who despise them are guilty of the same crime as Nebuchadnezzar, who, with the increasing sins of the people of Israel, destroyed the kingdom of Judea under the urging of the dreadful judgment of God's wrath. He overturned the walls of the once holy city and, with the beauty of the entire temple destroyed, also threw down the cherubim. If this were so, this crime could not fall on us, who, while allowing them in church decorations, entirely despise worshiping them, but on their predecessors or parents, who broke them when they were used in ancient basilica decorations and decreed they should be entirely abolished. Thus, the judgment of this issue seems to hang in the balance against them, so that whatever they bring forth more troublesome or detestable, they seem inevitably to condemn either themselves or their predecessors.

    <p>
        Therefore, since they despise their ancestors for the abolition of images and boast of having a great merit for worshiping them, neither can these be compared to the builders of that venerable temple in praise, nor can their ancestors be equated with the destroyers of the same in crime. For as much as there is a difference between the temple of the highest God, which was built in the time of the prophets by illustrious men, and certain images made by any artisans, so much is there undoubtedly a difference between the destroyers of the same temple and the despisers of images.
    </p>
    <p>
        But while we and those who judge that they should be worshiped inopportunely, and their ancestors, who rashly rejected them, are reproved by true reason, it remains to teach that the destroyers of the Lord's temple were involved in a greater and much greater crime than the despisers of images.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the prophet did not lament the abolition of such images, which they boast of worshiping, but looked forward with prophetic spirit to the future destruction of the temple, which was not yet founded, and of the city, which stood out among other cities, as already past, and lamented it in song, saying: "Why have you rejected us forever, God? Your fury has burned against the sheep of your pasture. Remember your congregation, which you created from the beginning."
    </p>
    <p>
        He does not call the despisers of images enemies but the destroyers of that most holy temple, when he adds: "How the enemy has acted wickedly in your holy place, and all who hate you have boasted."
    </p>
    <p>
        He does not lament signs in paintings but in the courtyard of the Lord, namely hostile standards of the Chaldean or Roman army, saying: "They have set up their standards in the midst of your courtyard, and the signs they did not recognize, as on the top of the road."
    </p>
    <p>
        Nor does he lament the doors of painters or the materials of certain craftsmen or even painted panels being cut down with axes and chisels, but the most holy doors of the temple of the Lord, in which were the holy of holies, cut down by hostile wedges, saying: "As in a forest of trees, they cut down its doors with axes and chisels."
    </p>
    <p>
        He does not follow with anguish of mind the burning or desecration of certain images, but the sanctuary of the Lord, saying: "They burned your sanctuary with fire, they polluted the dwelling place of your name on the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
        Nor in another psalm did he sing with mournful modulation about the Lord's wrath being poured out on despisers of images, but about the destroyers of the city and temple or even the devastators of the entire people of Israel, saying: "How long, Lord, will you be angry forever? Will your zeal burn like fire forever? Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you and on the kingdoms that do not call on your name."

  <p>Your name they have not called upon, because they have consumed Jacob and made his place desolate.</p>
  
  <p>Nor does it speak of those who scorn images, but under the name of the Edomites, it speaks of all nations hostile to the Israelite people: <s>Remember, Lord, the children of Edom in Jerusalem, who say: Destroy it, destroy it down to its foundations.</s></p>
  
  <p>Not of those who scorn the worship of images, but under the name of the daughter of Babylon, the Chaldean, or the people of Rome, it threatens: <s>Daughter of Babylon, miserable; blessed is he who repays you what you have done to us; blessed is he who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.</s> Nothing similar is found anywhere about those who scorn images.</p>
  
  <p>Many similar things are found in the prophecies about the destroyers of the Lord's temple or the city of Jerusalem, which we have omitted for brevity. It is also read that our Lord and Redeemer wept over the future ruin of this same temple or city. All these things, although they can be understood mystically about the destroyers of the church or soul, who seek to overthrow the virtues of the soul like certain walls, by whose defense one fights against vices, and the faith placed in the heart, in which pure sacrifices are offered to God, like a certain temple, always attacking and seeking to overthrow it, and striving to lay low pure thoughts or certain exercises of good works like a certain people, nevertheless, they are historically understood to have been said about the destruction of the aforementioned temple.</p>
  
  <p>Hence, it is clearly evident that their predecessors, although they were somewhat incautious in abolishing images from church decorations, are by no means to be equated with the subverters of that most sacred and revered temple, because in these there was lightness, in those, there was atrocity; in these, there was ignorance, in those, there was malice; these, thinking they were offering service to God, removed them from church decorations, those, provoking the angry God against themselves, cruelly destroyed His house. With the help of God, we set aside both and adorn places dedicated to divine worship and render the service of adoration to God alone.</p>
