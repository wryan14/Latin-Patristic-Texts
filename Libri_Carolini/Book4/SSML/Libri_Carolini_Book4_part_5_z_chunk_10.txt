    For if mercy is found to have restrained the emperor, what else does it do but oppose all the holy Scriptures that call for mercy to be shown? Therefore, it is very dangerous to follow the precepts of such writings that seem to oppose divine Scriptures.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    For the Lord says in the gospel: <break time="500ms"/> "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful"; <break time="500ms"/> and again: <break time="500ms"/> "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy"; <break time="500ms"/> and the teacher of the nations says: <break time="500ms"/> "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you"; <break time="500ms"/> and the Psalmist says that the Lord loves mercy, and that the earth is full of the Lord's mercy; <break time="500ms"/> and the same Lord says through the prophet: <break time="500ms"/> "I desire mercy, not sacrifice."

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Since mercy is mandated by such authentic precepts, and the prophet testifies to singing of it forever - "I will sing of your mercies, Lord, forever" - and since it is said to be loved by the Lord, whoever prohibits and despises it is found to not love God and to entirely contradict His most excellent teachings.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Hence, the Truth itself responded to the lawyer saying the one who showed mercy was the neighbor: <break time="500ms"/> "Go and do likewise." This guidance shows that not only should we love humans who share our nature, but also angels, who, although of a different nature, are considered neighbors because they exercise mercy towards us, and are commanded to be loved by anyone who loves God and his neighbor.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    By being so quick to repay evil for evil, he completely contradicted divine teachings. For he should neither have been so harsh in seeking revenge nor have incited the emperor to exercise it, since his role was not to seek or order revenge, but to love and preach acts of mercy. For the Lord says in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme>: <break time="500ms"/> "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to take it back to him." He did not obey this command, as he did not bring back the erring Samaritans, if indeed they were believed to be in error, but instead incited the emperor's mind to let them perish in that error; and he allowed those under burden to perish harshly, while the Lord says: <break time="500ms"/> "If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; help him with it." Proverbs also says: <break time="500ms"/> "If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you." For by feeding the spiritual food and drink of divine words to those he knew were enemies by sinning and in need of salvation, he would have heaped burning coals—which consume the rust of sins and ignite love for God and neighbor—upon their heads, that is, their minds.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Therefore, seeking revenge, spurning mercy, and harboring anger, all of which the aforementioned writings are said to have encouraged the emperor to do, are prohibited by these teachings of Ecclesiasticus: <break time="500ms"/> "He who does not seek revenge will find vengeance from the Lord, and his sins will be forgiven; leave vengeance to your neighbor, and your sins will be forgiven when you pray." A man keeps anger against another man and seeks healing from God? He shows no mercy to a man like himself and yet prays about his own sins? He keeps anger and asks for God’s forgiveness? Who will pray for his offenses? Likewise, the oracle of Isaiah forbids repaying evil for evil in this way: <break time="500ms"/> "Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, 'Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame." The Lord also commands in the gospel not to incite anger or exercise revenge or heap curses upon enemies or wrongdoers, but to show love towards them with these most sacred words...
  <break time="1s"/>

    The chosen vessel also admonishes us not to repay evil with evil; for he says in his letter to the Romans: “Do not be wise in your own opinion, repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. Do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay,’ says the Lord.”

    <break time="1s"/>

    Therefore, if we should not defend ourselves according to the teaching of the excellent preacher, what madness is it to defend injuries to insensible things according to the exhortation of the same letters sent to Justinian, and to lose works of piety, which we should not even lose for our own slanders, for the insults to pictures, which do not feel them at all? Thus, the writer of the same epistle did not follow the example of Saint Stephen the protomartyr, who, when he was being stoned, prayed for his persecutors with bent knees, while this man, unable to bear the injuries to images, which do not feel them, requested that the perpetrators of the same injury be swiftly and mercilessly killed and ensured that their souls were bound with the bond of anathema and destined for eternal punishment.

    <break time="1s"/>

    Meanwhile, the writer of the same letters neglected to act patiently or gently in this matter and spurned fulfilling the preaching of the one who wrote to the Thessalonians: “Be patient with all. See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.” He also disregarded the advice of the one who said, “Better is a patient man with humility than one who divides the spoils with the proud.” And while he should have restrained the king’s wrath by rescuing the miserable, as Solomon says, “Deliver those who are drawn toward death, and hold back those stumbling to the slaughter. If you say, ‘Surely we did not know this,’ does not He who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, does He not know it? And will He not render to each man according to his deeds?” Instead, he incited the emperor’s mind to slaughter and cruelty with his letters.

    <break time="1s"/>

    Therefore, since those who suffer injury should be freed, Ecclesiasticus demonstrates; for it says: “Deliver him who suffers injury from the hand of the oppressor, and do not feel resentment in your soul; in judging, be merciful like a father to orphans and like a husband to their mother, and you will be like a son of the Most High, obedient, and He will have more mercy on you than a mother.” Isaiah also speaks of this matter: “Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and plead for the widow. Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Rescue the plundered from the hand of the oppressor.” Therefore, if anyone wishes to become like a son of the Most High God, by insisting on good works and desires to be shown mercy by God and cleansed from the filth of sins, he should rather follow these most salutary advices than the cruel perversity of that letter.

    <break time="1s"/>

    Furthermore, by inciting the emperor’s mind to anger, he acted cruelly in this matter as well and completely contradicted sacred writings in this aspect as in others. For it is said by a wise man: “Blessed is the simple soul; but the passionate or angry man acts dishonorably.” Also by the same: “Do not be a friend to an angry man; with a furious man, do not go, lest you learn his ways and set a snare for your soul.”


  <p>
    Woe to the paths when learning from a wise person is prohibited; much more so are teaching and encouraging prohibited under testimony. The Book of Ecclesiasticus similarly declares about this matter: <s>"A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, and a sinner disrupts friends and introduces slander among those who have peace."</s> For Ecclesiastes also gives these instructions: <s>"Do not be quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools."</s> Therefore, the Teacher of the Gentiles writes to the Ephesians: <s>"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger."</s> Also: <s>"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and slander be put away from you, along with all malice."</s> Furthermore: <s>"But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth."</s> These admonitions, if examined carefully, can all be found in the text of the aforementioned epistle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let the most righteous man and beloved of God, the Apostle James, declare whether, according to this epistle's exhortation, anyone should be quick to anger! Let him thunder whether it is to be agreed upon with this letter, which decreed that the emperor should be provoked to anger! He says: <s>"Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God."</s> Let the Truth itself also declare what its members should follow concerning this matter! Speak, holy Matthew, what you have proclaimed from the eternal fountain of paradise with the life-giving streams of your river. For the eternal fountain, the fountain of life, the fountain of light says: <s>"Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since anger, which is counted among the principal vices, is declared detestable by so many divine laws and oracles of divine words, it is easy to understand that these letters are not suitable for reinforcing the matters in question, through which the emperor is committed under great testimony and supplication to have and perpetrate the work. The author of the same epistle indeed ought to have exhorted those he saw in peril to repentance; if they perhaps despised repentance, he could have approached the emperor with humble prayers to compel them to convert. Possibly, they might follow the good of their own profit when coerced, which they had despised voluntarily, since God Almighty wants no one to perish, attested by Paul, who says: <s>"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."</s> If indeed he was concerned with saving souls, he ought to have provoked those he saw erring to repentance rather than inciting the prince's mind to shed blood, since the virtue of repentance should not be put behind other virtues but rather should be equated with the best of them. It consolidates what is broken, heals what is weak, restores what is lost, and often brings sinners back to their former state after a fall.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this, the Psalmist commends when he says: <s>"I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,' and you forgave the iniquity of my heart."</s> Isaiah commands to have this saying: <s>"Remember these things and groan, repent, you who err, and return from the heart."</s> This is considered the oracle of the prophet Jeremiah saying: <s>"Return, O faithless children; I will heal your faithlessness."</s> In another place, he says: <s>"Let everyone turn from his evil way, and improve your deeds."</s> Joel also thunders with the voice of the Lord saying: <s>"Return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Book of Ecclesiasticus also says: <s>"If we do not repent, we will fall into the hands of the Lord according to his greatness; and his mercy is with him."</s> Indeed, it is written in the Acts of the Apostles: <s>"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out."</s> The pastor of the church in his epistle...
  </p>


    <p>
        <s>
            The second says: The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, the greater this virtue in saving, the more He neglected to preach to those who were erring, the more without a doubt this cruelty excels in harming others, because He neither allowed mercy to prevail as a prince nor restrained from anger and from exercising revenge with serious adjurations.
        </s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            Therefore, according to the Lord's statement, it is a grave sin to cause one of the little ones to stumble. 
        </s>
        <s>
            How grave do you think it is to not only promote a certain little one but a king, who is indeed the head of the people, to stumble?
        </s>
        <s>
            For in that preface of the letter, the writer lists among other cruelties that he exercised towards those he saw erring, he used curses, which is notably condemned by the sacred scriptures, with the chosen vessel saying: "Bless and do not curse"; and elsewhere: "Nor will the revilers inherit the kingdom of God."
        </s>
        <s>
            The rock of the church also forbids the use of curses with these words; for in the First Peter it says: "Finally, be all like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing."
        </s>

        <s>
            But lest anyone thinks we judge or speak ill of someone whose merit we are most unaware of, let it be known that we do not discuss the life or merit of any just person, but only diligently examine the words with the winnowing fan of the divine scriptures, which have been improperly brought forth to nurture error, being entirely bound by the sinews of errors. 
        </s>
        <s>
            For we do not discuss other words of the same Symeon, which, as we said above, we do not remember reading anywhere, but only those which we perceive through the narrators of their details; and since we do not know whether they are indeed the words of the same Symeon, as they confess, or of some other person written under his name, we know that they are alien to the senses of the holy scriptures and rightly should be rejected from all ecclesiastical doctrine.
