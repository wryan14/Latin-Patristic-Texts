    <p>It wasn't enough for them to reject their predecessors or parents with dreadful curses and tear them apart with various insults. They even claimed that they were worse than all heretics. The more they try to condemn them with harsh injuries, the more they contradict divine teachings. They say the Samaritans are worse than all heretics and prefer those who destroy images over them. It's clear that their ancestors destroyed images; and according to those who destroy images, they are worse than the Samaritans. And the Samaritans, as they say, are worse than all heretics. So, according to them, their ancestors were worse than all heretics, and it's clear they destroyed images.</p>

    <p>Since they claim they were taught or consecrated by the worst of all heretics through the flesh, in the teachings of the Scriptures, or through the laying on of hands to perform the mysteries of the Christian religion, it is surprising that they consider themselves superior to other Catholics in establishing regulations and traditions of the Church. They boast of having such a great authority, even though their actions, teachings, and the examples of their ancestors do not prove this. For if they are to be preferred over all Catholics because of their worship of images, then it is not followers of virtues but worshippers of images who will hold a higher place in the Church. And if worshippers of images hold a higher place within the holy Church, then errors, not virtues, will be followed.</p>

    <p>It is virtues, not errors, that should be followed. Therefore, these people should not be preferred over all Catholics just because of their worship of images.</p>

    <p>The Samaritans, whom they call 'worse than all heretics,' are not heretics among Christians but among Jews, and they hold to the Old Testament, not the New Testament. While the Jews believe in bodily resurrection and accept the prophets and the writings, the Samaritans reject the resurrection and, except for the five books of the law, they disregard all the Scriptures of both the Old and New Testaments. They are remnants of the people whom Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, sent to guard the land of Israel after moving the ten tribes of Israel to the Medes. When they were devastated by lions and other wild animals and various misfortunes in the land of Israel, they sent a message to the king saying they could not survive there unless they followed the laws of the God of the land. It is said that some Levites were sent to them to teach them the ceremonies of the law. They accepted these teachings partially and adopted many heretical practices, to the point that their barbarous pride led them to consider themselves the true children of Jacob and reject the Jews, who are believed to have descended from Jacob, as well as the communion of the Jews and other nations with arrogance.</p>

    <p>The Samaritan woman, who spoke with the Lord at the well, boasted with empty pride that her father Jacob, who gave her the well, was greater than the Redeemer of the world. She stubbornly insisted that her ancestors worshipped not in Jerusalem but on the mountain. She eventually laid down her stubbornness along with her water jar and accepted the saving teachings.</p>

    <p>If we briefly explain the symbolic mysteries implied by these events, it is not irrelevant. She represented the entire human race, which came to the Lord as the world was growing old. The Lord sat by the well during the sixth age of the world, signifying the earthly labor and error of this dark world. He 'sat down,' signifying the humility of the flesh He took on for us, and 'was tired,' indicating the weakness of that same flesh, although in another sense, His sitting demonstrates the dignity of His teaching and authority. He 'was thirsty,' not just for water but for the faith of the nations.</p>


  So when the disciples urged him to eat, he said he had food that they did not know about. He thirsted for the faith of the Gentiles, to do the will of the Father and complete His work. He promised to give her living water, meaning the Spirit, which those who believed in him would receive. He said she had had five husbands, that is, she had used the five carnal senses, and that the sense she would finally have, with which she would believe in Christ, she no longer had; for after the five carnal responses, she names Christ in the sixth response.

  Her first response was: "You, being a Jew, how do you ask me for a drink?"
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The second: "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep."
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The third: "Sir, give me this water, so that I may not thirst or come here to draw."
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The fourth: "I have no husband."
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The fifth: "I see that you are a prophet; our fathers worshiped on this mountain."

  <p>
    For this response was carnal; a place on earth had been given to the carnal, where they might pray, not to worship a place or any object placed in it, but to worship the Lord in that place. But the spiritual ones will pray in spirit and truth, not in images, not in paintings, not in things that lack sense, as the Lord said. After he spoke, the woman's sixth response acknowledges Christ as the teacher of all these things. She says: "I know that the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when he comes, he will tell us all things." But she was still mistaken because she did not see that the one she hoped would come was already there, which error was dispelled by the Lord's mercy saying: "I am he, who speaks to you."
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Upon hearing this, she said nothing but left her water jarâ€”meaning her desire and love for this world, by which people draw pleasure from the dark depths and earthly conversation, which, once perceived, they burn with desire for again, as it is said: "Whoever drinks of that water will thirst again." She went into the city, meaning she proclaimed to the world what she believed, believing with her heart unto righteousness, confessing with her mouth unto salvation.

    Since we have diverged somewhat from the proposed topic, let us return to it. The Samaritans, being Gentiles and seemingly adhering to Judaism only superficially, are not known to attack the church more fiercely than other unbelievers. Although these people consider the Samaritans to be heretics and worse than all other heretics, they show them a certain favor, teaching that their ancestors should be preferred to them in wickedness; for he is not the worst of all, who has someone else found worse in fault.
