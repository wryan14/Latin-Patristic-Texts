  <p>VII. On the fact that the more examples and images of heretics they despise, the more they dishonor their parents with greater insults and injuries, whom they undoubtedly claim to follow in this matter.</p>
  
  <p>It is a very old custom, not only among philosophers but also among orators, when they want to prove something, to take arguments either from the matter itself in question, or from other things, or certainly from external sources. While these people despise following in other matters due to ignorance intervening, they strive to follow in this particular part when they decide to condemn and insult their predecessors or parents for the abolition of images, taking arguments either from the matter itself or from elsewhere or from external sources. They do not fear to damage them with insults, to curse them with anathemas, and to dishonor them with the most insane words.</p>
  
  <p>The more examples of certain heretics they bring in as testimony, whom they claim to follow, the more they renounce them with severe curses and demonstrate that they go against divine instructions, which command honor to be given to parents.</p>
  
  <p>The Lord says, "Honor your father and your mother, so that it may go well with you." This commandment holds such authority that it is written by the finger of the Lord on the tablets and is called the first commandment by the Apostle; for he says: "Honor your father and your mother," which is the first commandment with a promise, specifically in the promise that follows: "that you may live long on the earth and that it may go well with you."</p>
  
  <p>It must be seriously considered how great the condemnation is for those who tear their parents apart with insults or curse them with anathemas, given the merit and promise held by those who honor their parents according to the command of the Lord's voice. For the better the promise rewards those who keep this commandment, the more dreadful the condemnation should deter those who resist this commandment of the Lord.</p>
  
  <p>It is also written in Leviticus: "Each of you must respect his father and mother." And in Ecclesiasticus, it is written about honoring parents: "He who honors his father will live a long life; and he who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother, and serves those who gave birth to him in work and word and all patience, and his blessing remains in the end." Also in Ecclesiasticus: "My child, support your father's old age, and do not grieve him during his life; and if he lacks understanding, excuse him and do not despise him in your strength. It is not glory for you but a disgrace."</p>
  
  <p>The teacher of the nations also says: "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." For if honoring and obeying parents pleases God, then insulting them and bringing curses upon them displeases God in every way; and if the latter does not displease, then neither does the former please.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, it is grave and fearful not to honor parents; but it is gravest and most fearful to abominate or anathematize them, as the Lord says: "Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death." And again: "Cursed is anyone who dishonors his father or mother, and all the people shall say, Amen, Amen." It is also written in Proverbs: "Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness." Also there: "Whoever drives away his father or mother and thinks he does not sin, he is a partner to a man of destruction."</p>
  
  <p>Hence, it must be understood that those who do not fear to heap curses upon their elders for lifeless things are not of moderate insanity, and while they want to favor images, they do not fear to dishonor their parents nor to go against divine oracles. We, while saying this, do not favor their elders, whom we also find to have acted absurdly in this matter, but we show by the testimonies of divine law how presumptuous these people are in such audacities.</p>
