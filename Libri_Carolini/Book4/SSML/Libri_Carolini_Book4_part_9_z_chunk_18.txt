  <p>In that book, two pages had been cut out because of a mention of images in a previous synod, which was held to abolish images. There were images on silver tablets, as they are usually found on vessels or many other objects. In the second synod gathered to worship images, Leontius, as soon as he saw them, believed he had found a great correction of his error and judged those who had cut out the two pages from the same book, where the images were, to be exceedingly foolish for doing so because of a mention of images.</p>
  <p>And so, the same book, over different periods, with various events and in different ways, was judged by some to be cut because of the mention of images and by others to be worshipped because of the images on the tablets. It suffered the unjust loss of pages from those and was elevated by unlawful worship from these. Those who took away what it had and should have had wrongly caused it to lose, and those who provided what it neither had nor should have had illogically acquired it. It neither lost the pages because of any pressing guilt nor found worship because of any notable merits, and as much as it rightly deserved to lose what it had, it deserved to acquire what was forbidden.</p>
  <p>Should all books, which have histories inserted among writings with artistic painting in gold and silver or any colors, be burned or cut by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them because they contain images? Should silk or garments of any materials, suitable for human use or divine worship, decorated with certain figures and dyed with various colors, be burned by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them because they contain images? Should metals or woods, shaped for any uses and decorated with certain images by sculpting or engraving, therefore be burned or broken by those who oppose them or worshipped by those who support them?</p>
  <p>Unfortunate is the mind that always struggles between either cursing or, on the contrary, worshipping images! Unfortunate is the sense that always pants for rejecting things that can be possessed without offense and cannot be worshipped without offense! Unfortunate is the custom that, having scorned the right path of moderation, not knowing how to hold a fixed rule, always wavers this way and that, sometimes improperly rejecting what should not be rejected, sometimes unhappily worshipping what should not be worshipped at all, sometimes excessively discarding what should not be discarded, sometimes excessively extolling what should not be excessively extolled, and, neglecting necessary things, focusing on unnecessary things, either because of the abolition of images or their worship.</p>
  <p>Both are unsuitable, as they convene synods, as if they could bring any harm to Christian religion either by having or not worshipping something, when images, if they are not possessed, do not detract, and if they are possessed, do not add anything, while rejected images bring some lightness of cause, but worshipped images bring guilt!</p>
