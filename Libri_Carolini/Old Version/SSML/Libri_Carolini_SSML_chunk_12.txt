<s>Indeed, those who reign with Christ in the heavens are not depicted by the works of painters, nor do they desire to be painted on panels or walls by artists.</s>
<s>They have been deemed worthy by Christ to be inscribed in the book of life as mentioned in Philippians 4:3.</s> 
<s>So, let them say, who find it so special to declare, what image...</s>

<p>
<s>Honor moves into the first form, they say.</s>
<s>Where did they read this or by what testimonies can they prove it?</s>
<s>For our Lord and Savior did not say: “As long as you did it for images,” but: “As long as you did it for one of the least of these, you did it for me.”</s>
<s>He did not say: “Whoever receives images,” but: “Whoever receives you, receives me.”</s>
<s>Nor did the Apostle say: “Let us love images,” but: “Let us love one another, for love is from God.”</s>
<s>He did not count burdens of images, but our mutual burdens to be carried, saying: “Carry each other's burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.”</s>
<s>For since images are often made according to the skill of the artist, sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly, sometimes lovely, sometimes even hideous, some very similar to those they represent and some very different, some shining with newness and some decaying with age, it must be asked, which of them are more honorable?</s>
<s>Is it those that are more precious, or those that are known to be cheaper?</s>
<s>Because if the more precious ones have more honor, then the cause of the work or the quality of the materials receives veneration, not the fervor of devotion.</s>
<s>If the cheaper ones, which are less like those they are meant to represent, are more honored, it is unjust, since they neither excel in workmanship nor in material.</s>

  <p>
    <s>
      They neither resemble persons nor are they known, yet they are venerated more greatly and fervently.
    </s>
    <s>
      For while we do not disdain anything in images except for worship, since we permit images in the basilicas of saints not for worship, but for the memory of events and the beauty of the walls, they place almost all their hope in their beliefs in images.
    </s>
    <s>
      It remains, then, that we venerate the saints in their bodies or rather the relics of their bodies or even their clothing, according to the tradition of the ancient fathers.
    </s>
    <s>
      They, however, worship walls and boards, considering it to be a great gain of faith because they are subject to the works of painters.
    </s>
    <s>
      For although it may be avoided by the educated, what they practice in worshiping images, venerating not who they are but what they signify, it generates scandal among the uneducated, who venerate and worship nothing other than what they see.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence, it must be avoided that they fall under the gospel sentence, pushing so many little ones to scandal.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if he who scandalizes one of the little ones is subject to a fearfully severe sentence, much more will he be struck with a more ruinous severity, who pushes almost the entire Church of Christ either to worship images or to disdain the worship of images.

It is necessary to avoid both of these with great caution, so that while someone leans too much in either direction, beyond what order requires, they cannot avoid the loss of their own safety.

Constantine, the bishop of Constantia of Cyprus, unfortunately and hastily said: 'I accept and honorably embrace the holy and venerable images according to the worship that I offer to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity; and those who do not feel or glorify in this way, I separate and anathematize from the holy, catholic, and apostolic church and submit them to the part of those who denied the incarnate and saving dispensation of Christ, our true God.'

<break time="1s" />
<s>
How hastily and, so to speak, foolishly Constantine, the bishop of Constantia of Cyprus, said with the agreement of others that he would 'honorably accept and embrace images' and would 'render to them the worship that is owed to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,' is not something that needs much discussion in our debate, since it is clear to everyone who either reads or hears this that he is deeply immersed in significant error.
</s>
<break time="1s" />

For he admits to offering worship that is due only to the Creator to created things, and while he desires to favor pictures, he goes against all the holy Scriptures.
</s>
<break time="1s" />
<s>
Who then, of sound mind, could ever have said or agreed with such absurdity, that the variety of pictures should be held in the same honor as the holy, life-giving and creator of all, the Trinity?
</s>
</p>


<p>
How can the service of pictures, like that shown in Judith 19, be offered to the Lord of all creation? Or who would listen to such nauseating words rather than speak them?
</p>
<p>
Who would dare to hear it? Or what ears would not reject the blame of such a great crime rather than receive it? For it is perverse to offer such service of worship to any insentient things as to the Almighty God, to whom there is none like, to whom Solomon says: "Lord, there is none like you in heaven above nor on earth below."
</p>
<p>
With what front, then, to pass over the rest, does this one clause of the divine law hear: "You shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only," who, having rejected this, not only serves creatures but also tries to equate their service with the service due to God? For the bishop stands in the church and reads: "You shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only."

        <s>
            But on the contrary, this one, revealing their error and openly exposing his own thought without any shadowing, admits that he offers them the same service and adoration as to the Holy Trinity, thus making clear the absurdity that they secretly hold inwardly.

They refused to believe what I carried and tried to admit how foolish it was. Anyone who reads this can clearly recognize it. Indeed, he is immersed in his own laziness and tries to drag others along with him to share in such misfortune. When he sees those trying to avoid this great danger, he strives to insult and berate them with offensive and abusive words.

<p>
What madness or folly is it to try to tear the Christian people away from the nourishment of the Church just because they refuse, with stubborn minds, to believe in the life-giving incarnation of Christ, the mediator between God and humans? How perverse is it to judge those who refuse to worship anything but God—the one whom all creatures serve—equally with those who reject the world's salvation? It’s one thing not to believe in the world’s redemption; it's another to want to serve only God. It's one thing to scorn the world's salvation; it's another to despise the adoration of images. It's one thing to oppose saving advice; it's another to resist vain and superstitious practices.

For the same Lord and Savior, both through the Old Testament's writings, prohibited the worship of images, and through his physical presence, he taught that the image of Caesar should be given back to Caesar rather than worshipped.

    <s>Although this grape and fruit are understood to represent Christ the Lord, who came from the mountains of Israel, taking on human form from the patriarchs, it can also be understood as the sweetness of preaching encompassed in the Old and New Testaments.</s>

    God liberated us from Egyptian slavery and led us to the promised land, that is, from the misery of this world to the eternal homeland, as the most holy of prophets rejoices in saying: "The mountains skipped like rams," Psalm 113:4, "and the hills like lambs." Therefore, whoever, despising all vanities and worship of other creatures, serves only God, lifting the eyes of their mind free from the sleep of infidelity, will not fear the powers of the air or the proud followers who have descended into the deadly darkness of Erebus. With great jubilation, they will sing with others of their kind: "Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change and the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea," Psalm 45:3-4. "The waters roared and were troubled, the mountains shook with His power."

    The useless and foolish statement made by Agapius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, is criticized because he said: "It is written in our divine Scriptures."
  </p>
  <p>
    Often, ignorance is both guilty and innocent. <break time="1s" /> Guilty ignorance frequently tries to cause harm, while innocent ignorance does not intend to harm anyone. <break time="1s" /> Although neither type of ignorance is subject to sin, both are still subject to reproach. <break time="1s" /> Guilty ignorance is subject to sin because it is driven by a disgraceful desire to cause harm and thus deserves reproach, whether because sin cannot escape reproach or because what it says or does is done foolishly and unlearnedly. <break time="1s" /> Innocent ignorance, while free from sin since it harms no one, is still not free from reproach, because all ignorance is unlearned and all that is unlearned is subject to reproach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the most ridiculous statement by Agapius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, who said: "It is written in our divine Scriptures."
  </p>


  <p>
    In the Scriptures, or subject to the same reproach, which is liable to sin, or to the same, which is subject to ignorance, it is proven to yield, since it is either subject to sin, because, just as their leaders, while being human and not unlike other mortals, say that 'God reigns with them' and call themselves 'divine' and their deeds or words 'divine,' in the same way they call their writings 'divine.' Or it succumbs to reproach, because, being unskilled in eloquence, ignorant of the beauty of speaking, while they should have said, 'in our books containing divine Scriptures' or something similar, instead they are said to have spoken incongruously and ridiculously 'in our divine Scriptures.' This is indeed believed to have been uttered with the arrogance of presumption, by which they assume 'God reigns with them' and call themselves 'divine,' it is madness. But if, wishing to say one thing, they said another, and so little is their sharpness of intellect, that what they conceive in their hearts, they can scarcely express with certain and proper words, it is laziness. And thus, in either case, they deviate.
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>Some are carried away by pride or believed to be bound by the dark chains of ignorance.</s>
    <s>So, who in their right mind would say such a thing?</s>
    <s>Who of sound mind would put forth such a statement?</s>
    <s>What madness or folly would lead a mortal human, subject to passions, to say: 'It is written in our divine Scriptures'?</s>
    <s>If they are 'ours', how are they 'divine'?</s>
    <s>And if they are 'divine', how are they 'ours'?</s>
    <s>Human things come from humans, divine things come from God.</s>
    <s>Our writings are human, God's writings are divine.</s>
    <s>However, reason permits us to call the books of the holy law 'our books', but when it comes to divine Scriptures, we can rightly and properly only call them 'divine Scriptures'.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Granted, this statement could reasonably stand, although it cannot, as it would neither be known to arise from a source of boasting nor be believed to have come from the depths of ignorance.</s>
    <s>In the end, they could be reproached in every way, because it is useless, and it is shown to have been presented uselessly for an unimportant matter, namely, the adoration of images.</s>
    <s>Nor can simplicity, which often adheres to what is right, support it, because it is clear that it was put forward not with a pure, not a right, but a perverse will.</s>
    <s>For if it were known to have come simply and innocently from holy rusticity, which sometimes benefits only itself, and not to assert something illicit, it would be judged by God, who is the searcher of hearts and minds, who often considers wills rather than acts.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>Without a doubt, he would be forgiven for it.</s> 
<s>Just as a bad intention, even if it doesn't result in a bad action, is often held accountable as if it did, so too is a good intention always recognized for a good deed.</s> 
<s>To illustrate this with examples, Balaam's bad intention, where he wished to curse God's people, although he did not achieve what he desired, was not free from blame.</s>
<s>And David's good intention, where he wished to build a temple for the Lord, although it was not fulfilled in action, was praised by divine oracles.</s>

<p>
<s>John the presbyter said to Theodosius, abbot of the monastery of Saint Andrew, while reciting the words of John Chrysostom and saying:</s>
<s>'I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians,'</s>
<s>he said: 'Who is this angel, if not the one about whom it is written: For the angel of the Lord struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem.'</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Theodosius, abbot of the monastery of Saint Andrew, said that John Chrysostom mentioned in the often-referenced synod, which was convened for the worship of images:</s>
<s>'I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians.'</s>
<s>Now, while those who are remembered to have been in that synod try to distort the words of patriarchs, prophets, and other saints and illustrious men to establish the worship of images, and lie about the patriarchs having done things they did not do, it is not surprising if they also...</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>They accuse John Chrysostom of saying such things.</s>
<s>Would a man so eloquent and learned have said: 'I saw an angel in the image pursuing a multitude of barbarians', knowing that the immortal nature of angels is such that they cannot be seen by humans and have no need for pictures?</s>
<s>For they are by nature spirits, functioning as angels, who, in order to be seen by humans, are believed to take on bodies from the clearest ether, not from the works of painters.</s>
<s>Hence, it is not to be believed that such a statement was made by John, a most eloquent man, since it is neither polished in words, nor clear in meaning, nor supported by any reason.</s>
<s>For this statement contains the fault that grammarians call amphiboly, that is, ambiguity of speech, because, when it is said: 'I saw an angel in the image pursuing the army of barbarians', it is not clear whether he saw an angel in the image who was pursuing the multitude of barbarians elsewhere or if the angel was seen elsewhere and was imagined to be pursuing the multitude of barbarians.</s>
<s>Even if this statement were free of this fault, other indications would make it apparent that it could not belong to a man of such stature, who, not being of that time, would find it laughable.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    It would be completely wrong and rather false for him to say, "I saw an angel chasing away barbarians," who, if I'm not mistaken, had seen the same story depicted in a painting by an artist, where an angel had long ago struck down the barbarian ranks. Many eloquent and learned men, in the vast fields of their discussions, as order and reason dictate, also mention paintings and images, just as they do other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    When those who are obsessed with the worship of these things read this, they try to twist everything to support their adoration. They attempt to arm their weak argument by claiming that the most eloquent men made some mention of the images, as if the mere mention in a treatise gives it immediate approval.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, John the Presbyter, when the mentioned Abbot Theodosius falsely claimed that John, the Bishop of Constantinople, had said, "I saw an angel in an image chasing a multitude of barbarians," is said to have immediately added and said: "Who is this angel, if not the one about whom it is written: 'For the angel of the Lord struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem'?" In many places of that vain reading, which was compiled by them from this matter, he is found to have spoken many notable and reckless things.
  </p>


  <p>
    There, he is noted for having spoken too carelessly, and the faster he is in his words, the slower he is judged to be in his understanding. Solomon says, "If you see someone quick in their words, know that a fool has more hope than they do."
  </p>
  <p>
    When he mentioned a painting, he reportedly said, "Who is this angel, if not the one about whom it is written: 'The angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrians?'" This showed how careless and delusional he was, for the angel in the painting did not strike the Assyrians, but the one who was sent to fulfill that task did. He also said, "In the circuit of Jerusalem of those practicing," as if it were written that way, but nowhere is it found written in that order. Although Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, nearly captured all the fortified cities of Judah, as Scripture says, "And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign."
  </p>


    <p>
        <s>Sennacherib set up camp with the intention of attacking the city's walls with his siege engines, but he sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, as recorded in Isaiah 36:2.</s>
        <s>The Rabshakeh stood by the upper pool on the road to the Fuller's Field.</s>
        <s>The same event is documented in the book called "The Words of the Days," known in Hebrew as "Dibre Hayamim" and in Greek as "Paralipomenon," which is the chronicle of divine law.</s>
        <s>It states, "Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem while he himself, with his entire army, was besieging Lachish" (2 Chronicles 32:9).</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>What John mentioned in his usual manner, as if it were written, "Around Jerusalem, those who were exercising," is not found in any authentic manuscripts of the Holy Law.</s>
        <s>To clarify this more clearly, the very words of the Holy Law, as they are found in the manuscripts, should be presented in order.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Thus, it is written in the Book of Kings: "And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians.</s>
        <s>When morning dawned, they saw all the dead bodies, and Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed and returned to Nineveh" (2 Kings 19:35-36).</s>
        <s>The Book of the most holy and eloquent prophet Isaiah recounts this history in the same way: "Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians.</s>
        <s>When morning came, they saw all the dead bodies.</s>
        <s>Sennacherib departed, returned to Nineveh, and the rest" (Isaiah 37:36-37).</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The Book of the Words of the Days, which, as we have mentioned, is the chronicle of the entire divine law, also recounts the histories of the kings.</s>
    </p>


<p>
And the Lord sent an angel who struck down every strong man, warrior, and leader in the army of the king of Assyria. He returned to his own land in disgrace.
</p>
<p>
In these examples, what was mentioned by John is not found at all.
</p>
<p>
There is no authority or mention in any authentic books for what they say, that a certain Polemon's image stopped someone from committing adultery, which some try to compare to the miracle where touching the hem of the Lord's garment healed a woman.
</p>
<p>
Among other things, which are found in the reading of that vain synod to support their error, this is very familiar to them, that they assert that a certain Polemon's image stopped someone from committing adultery. Although this act is not found in any authentic books of either the Old or New Testament, nor is it mentioned by any of the teachers accepted by the holy Roman, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, they use it to support their error as if it were some kind of proof.

<p>It is also said of him in the Song of Songs: His head is finest gold, for just as the nature of gold cannot be equaled by any other metal, so no creature can be equaled to the Creator of all, who is indeed the head of Christ.</p>
<p>Of whom also in the same Song of Songs, the bride says: As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the sons, for just as the apple, beautiful in appearance and sweet in fragrance, surpasses the trees of the forest, so indeed our Redeemer, who is the fragrance of life unto life, whom the church daily follows in the fragrance of his ointments, surpasses all the assemblies of the saints, who are therefore called sons, because they are known to cling not to the world to which they were born, but to Christ to whom they were reborn.</p>
<p>Also in Revelation, the twenty-four elders are read to have cast their crowns before the Lamb, because all the virtues of the saints and all their victories, in which they shone with his help, are seen to be lesser when compared to his virtues and victories, for just as a stream derived from a perennial source is considered lesser when compared to the same source, and a worthless tendril is believed to be altogether inferior when compared to the vibrant roots of the vine or even to the fruitful branches.</p>

<s>Let's briefly discuss the garment that they compare to the image of Polemon, which signifies ancient and symbolic mysteries.</s>
<s>The hem of the Lord's garment represents faith in the incarnation, through which gentiles were healed from the sickness of idolatry.</s>
<s>Just as the hem is the smallest part of the garment compared to the whole body or garment, in the same way, the incarnation of the Redeemer seems minimal compared to His divine and ineffable generation, by which He was begotten by the Father before all ages.</s>
<s>About this generation, Isaiah says: "Who can describe His generation?"</s>
<s>It is implied: 'no one'.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>However, the evangelist describes His human generation as follows: "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David."</s>
<s>Thus, the woman touching the hem of the Lord's garment from behind received the desired health, which the doctors' efforts had long denied her, because after the passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven of the Lord, the gentiles received the health of faith that neither the patriarchs nor the prophets could impart to them by touching the hem of the Lord's garment, that is, by believing in the mystery of His incarnation.</s>
<s>And, while only a small number of disciples believed in the Lord's preaching, a vast multitude was inflamed with the swift zeal of faith at the preaching of the apostles, so that it is said that five thousand men believed in one day, and another three thousand on another occasion.</s>
<s>And this is what the Truth Himself promised to the disciples, saying: "Whoever believes in me will do the works that I do."</s>

    And he will do even greater things than these. <lang xml:lang="la">John 14:12</lang> will do greater things. Some think this can be understood in the miracle performed by Peter through the Lord, as we see in <lang xml:lang="la">Acts 15</lang>, because while the Lord healed the sick by his word or touch, Peter is read to have healed the sick merely by his shadow.

    Therefore, the Lord, on his way to raise the daughter of the synagogue leader, healed a woman suffering from a blood discharge simply by the touch of his garment. This illustrates that while he aimed to awaken the synagogue from the sleep of disbelief, he also healed the Gentiles from the most insolent worship of demons through the knowledge of his faith. What the synagogue neglected to receive because of its unbelief, the Gentiles merited to receive through their devoted faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord testifies that he came to liberate the synagogue, as he says by his physical presence, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." He also instructed his disciples not to go into the way of the Gentiles or enter Samaritan towns. Allegorically, through Solomon in the Song of Songs, he promises to descend into the garden of Israel, saying, "I went down to the nut orchard to see the blossoms of the valley," indicating that he first came to the Jewish people.

        <s>Furthermore, the woman healed on the road to the synagogue leader's house where the daughter was brought back to life from the bonds of death shows that the synagogue will one day awaken from the slumber of its disbelief, rise through faith in Christ, and live with him forever.</s> 
        <s>When, according to the Apostle in Romans 11:25, the full number of the Gentiles has come in, the blindness that partially happened to it by not believing in the Mediator between God and humans will be removed, and by believing in him, who was announced long ago through the patriarchs and prophets by the oracles of the sacred, all of Israel will be saved, as stated in Romans 11:26.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Therefore, since such and similar mysteries, which are hinted at in the wearing of the Lord's hem, are completely absent in the image of Polemon, it should not be honored in the same way as the hem of the Lord's garment, which cannot be equated in the splendor of so many mysteries.</s>

        <s>XXII. The judges who were present at the aforementioned synod tried insolently and inappropriately to elevate the art of painting, saying: "For the art of the painter is pious, and not correct."</s>
    </p>


<p>
Some people criticize foolishly, but the Father himself commends the painter who acts piously.
</p>
<p>
If a harmful fluid infects the fortress of the body, which is the head, it easily spreads to the other members. And it is not surprising if, having spread to the lowest parts, it severely harms them, since it is known that the head, which is above all the members, has been injured.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the madness of worshipping images, which crept into the minds of Constantine and his mother Helena, or even Tarasius, the Bishop of Constantinople, and the other priests of those regions, should not be greatly valued. If it descends to deceive the minds of judges or common people, as shown by the previous example, when the head is invaded by the arrogance of something, it easily invades the others which are shown to be subject to the head. The prophet says, "Every head is sick and every heart is sad; from the sole of the foot to the top of the head, there is no health in them." Clearly, when the zeal for living rightly and acting rightly is neglected by kings and priests, who ought to be examples of good living to their subjects, the internal health of the subjected common people is somewhat in doubt.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if in the same synod the minds of so many priests were beset with errors, how could the error not stick to the minds of judges? Or who will lead the sheep back from their error if the pastors hold the leadership of error? For priests who are known to lead the subjected common people into error are rebuked with such reproaches through the prophet Jeremiah: "Therefore, this is what the Lord says."

<s>Immediately it is added: Behold, I will punish you according to your evil ways and raise up shepherds for them who will feed them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, says the Lord.</s> 
<s>In the prophet Ezekiel, regarding such leaders, it is written: And so, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:</s> 
<s>You devour my sheep and clothe yourselves with their wool, and you eat the fat ones and scatter my flock.</s> 
<s>You have not strengthened the weak, you have not healed the sick, you have not bandaged the injured, and you have not brought back the strays.</s> 
</p>


<p>
<s> You did not search for what was lost, and you oppressed the strong with labor.</s>
<s> And my sheep were scattered because there are no shepherds, and they became prey for all the wild animals.</s>
<s> My sheep were scattered across every mountain and high hill, and over the face of the whole earth, and there was no one to rescue or bring them back.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Therefore, in this matter, there is not as much wickedness in the judges as there is corruption in the priests.</s>
<s> In the judges, there is laziness; in the priests, there is great madness, especially since the priests profess to worship images and to offer them the service that is owed to the Holy Trinity.</s>
<s> Meanwhile, the judges claim that the art of painters is pious and should not be mocked, saying that a painter who acts piously is commended by the Father.</s>
<s> In these professions, it is evident that the priests have erred more than the judges, just as they are higher in honor by their rank.</s>
<s> The laity cannot be equated with the bishops in their absurd profession, just as they cannot be equated with them in their sitting on the priestly chair.</s>
<s> But while there is nothing in either party that can rightly be praised, there is much in both that can be justly criticized.</s>
<s> The error of the bishops, who profess to worship images and offer them the service owed only to God, has been discussed.</s>
<s> It remains to address the error of the judges as well.</s>
</p>


<p>
To say that the art of painting is pious should be questioned by our analysis.
</p>
<p>
They claim that the art of painting is pious, as if it does not share the same relationship with piety or impiety as other worldly arts. What does the art of painting have more to do with piety than the arts of blacksmiths, sculptors, founders, engravers, masons, carpenters, farmers, or other craftsmen? All these arts, which can only be learned through study, can be practiced both piously and impiously by those who engage in them. Piety or impiety does not reside in the arts themselves but in the people who practice them. These practitioners are often either caught up in the most brazen tumult of vices or adorned by the life-saving assemblies of virtues.
</p>
<p>
If, therefore, the art of painting is called pious because it often depicts the actions and certain pious deeds of devout people, it should also be called impious because it often depicts many impieties, such as the slaughter of men, the atrocities of wars, the cruelties of criminals, the savagery of wild beasts, the assaults of animals, and other similar things. And if it is not believed to be impious because these things are depicted for human eyes with shading or outlines, it will not be pious either just because it depicts the deeds of good men.
</p>
<p>
Just as iron is not called impious because it is used to kill people, nor is it called pious because certain tools are made from it, with which blows from swinging swords are deflected and people are protected.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Just as doctors take care of human health, so too the art of painting is not impious because it depicts cruelty, nor is it pious because it depicts mercy.

<p>We will praise, and we will find out how we can respond to them, because Almighty God often approves or disapproves not the works, but the devotion to the works; not the actions, but the intentions behind the actions; not the things, but the reasons for the things; not what someone does, but with what mindset they do it.</p>

<p>A useless and deceptive statement by John the presbyter and legate of the Easterners, saying: 'Painters do not contradict the Scriptures, but whatever the Scripture says, they demonstrate, as far as they agree with the Scriptures.'</p>

<p>If all the nonsense of John the presbyter and legate of the Easterners, which he uttered in the same synod, in which our pen deals with the criticisms of his offensive reading, had been gathered one by one for us to examine, the forest of such a great debate would require large volumes. But we, partly due to our pursuit of brevity, which we are absolutely committed to, and partly by following the order of the reading itself, where not each item separately but some things here and there in order, as each one spoke or was found in the same book, we place in our discussion to be examined and are compelled to compress everything into the briefest article of the debate and not separately but almost everything scattered, as the order dictated, we carry out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is worth carefully discussing how, as he himself said, painters are by no means believed to 'contradict the Scriptures' or how 'whatever the Scripture says, they demonstrate' or how 'they are in harmony with the Scriptures.' Although it does not clearly shine forth, about which...</p>


  <p>
    If someone says this about these writings, we should believe that they are referring to the Holy Scriptures, which we commonly call 'Scriptures,' as it is written in the Gospel: Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, the art of painting was developed to preserve the memory of real events for those who look at them and to inspire minds to recall the truth from lies. However, sometimes it promotes thinking about lies instead of the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not only those things that are or were or can happen, but also those that neither are nor were nor can happen are presented to our sight. For a lie can be about things that are not but can happen or about things that neither are nor can happen, about which philosophers have discussed very sharply and subtly in their works.
