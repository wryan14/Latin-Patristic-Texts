    In this act, if it is believed to have happened, there is no recommendation for the worship of images. If that woman, due to the frailty of her gender and a certain lightness of mind, perceived the benefit of health and always sought the Lord's presence, knowing that He could be everywhere, and thus erected an image, who could be so foolish to erect an image and worship it, knowing that the Lord is everywhere? And if she, in a world not yet freed from the worship of idols, saw statues of certain dead men erected in cities for the memory or worship of certain things and acted similarly to the best of her ability, who in their right mind would agree with her actions? Believing that the Lord is not in man-made things but in heaven, or rather everywhere, who would act in such a way?

Who will care for the field? Or if by chance she had zeal for God in a superstitious manner, but not according to knowledge, who, being strengthened in the faith as a Catholic from Romans 10:2, will take her actions in this part as examples and do similar things? Or if by chance she, in the rudiments of her conversion, which could not yet partake of solid food, used tender food so that she might gradually grow in strength to receive solid food, as stated in Hebrews 5:12, so that she might approach the worship of the invisible and ineffable God through the visible and tangible, who, having become an imitator of her in this deed, would desire to be reduced again to the food of infancy, having scorned the strength of solid food?

      For the aforementioned deacon Epiphanius, whose opinion we began to discuss, says:
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Many things that are sanctified in us are not received as sanctified.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
So, when it’s said that this has no full sense, we guess he meant to say, 'There are many sacred things in us that are not sanctified through the priest's prayer or laying on of hands.' If this is true, it’s not entirely clear how it could be true, because everything sanctified in the church—whether it’s church orders, dedications of temples, or other such constitutions—is consecrated by priests in the ecclesiastical manner. From the very beginnings of infancy, through the priests' laying on of hands and prayers to God, we come to the nobility of the Christian faith and other levels.
</p>
<p>
If he meant places, vessels, or any utensils devoted to divine worship, his statement could be mistaken. Almost everything we enumerated is consecrated through priests' prayers and consecrations. The church also uses exorcisms and the sprinkling of salt and water. All these consecrations or institutions are known to have been handed down by the church leaders from the early days of the church and are recorded in the priestly books.
</p>
<p>
So, if the deacon introduced this to associate images, whose veneration they strive to support, with other objects devoted to divine worship, trying to introduce this idea because there’s no ecclesiastical institution for the consecration of images, this might not be correct.
</p>


<p>He wanted to teach that those things, although not consecrated with prayers, are still consecrated. His attempt fails because the consecration of these things is written in the priestly books and solemnly celebrated by the priests according to ancient tradition. However, there is no instruction in what the church accepts regarding the consecration or worship of those other things.</p>

<p>When he says, "Nor do we revere and honor them as much as we are revered and honored; for he says that the sign of the life-giving cross, without sacred prayer, should be reverenced by us," I think he meant to say that the sign of the venerable cross, which we respectfully wear, is considered sacred without any specific prayer or consecration by the priests. In this statement, as in others, he shows his considerable foolishness, for the sign of the cross needs no other consecration than that made by the Mediator between God and men.</p>

<p>Regarding what he added, "And we are sanctified by receiving its sign, through which, made by us, it brings some people to worship and sanctification on their foreheads, and we hope that the sign made in the air with a finger drives away demons." This pertains to what was said earlier. The sign of the cross indeed has a great mystery, and it is clear from evident signs and previously shown in the upper parts of this work, as the Lord has deigned to grant.</p>

<p>For while images, as we said before, are not consecrated with any prayer or the laying on of hands,</p>


<p>
The sign of the cross, wherever it is placed, is invoked by the name of God. And while these consecrations neither have nor can have nor should have any sanctity, it is so sanctified by the Redeemer of the world that it not only does not need any additional consecration, but once invoked by the name of God, it sanctifies and blesses other things.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the statement "Similarly, we use the image to signify the highest form of honor and by kissing it and honoring it respectfully, we receive sanctification" is clearly absurd and unreasonable. It claims that the image, by the name of its signification, can be brought to the honor of the saint in whose name it is inscribed. This cannot be proven by any rational evidence. If merely the inscription of a name could lead to the honor of the saints whose names are written, then any object with a saint's name inscribed would ascend to the honor of that saint. So, stones, wood, clothes, or even certain animals with the names of some saints inscribed would transfer to the honor of those saints whose names they bear. And if the inscribed names cannot lead these objects, which we have listed, to the honor of those whose names they bear, then neither can the names themselves.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>Inscriptions in honor of the saints somehow lead to reverence.</s>
    <s>And if this is refused with prudent consideration, and that is rejected with keen indignation.</s>
    <s>Two images of beautiful women without inscriptions are offered to anyone who worships images, for example.</s>
    <s>He, disregarding them, throws them aside and allows them to lie anywhere.</s>
    <s>Someone says to him: "One of these is an image of Saint Mary, which should not be discarded; the other is of Venus, which should be completely discarded."</s>
    <s>He turns to the painter, asking him, since they are very similar in every detail, which one is the image of Saint Mary and which one is of Venus?</s>
    <s>The painter gives one the inscription of Saint Mary, and the other the inscription of Venus.</s>
    <s>The one with the inscription of the Mother of God is elevated, honored, and kissed; the other, because it has the inscription of Venus, mother of a certain Aeneas who fled, is thrown down, reproached, and cursed.</s>
    <s>Both have the same form, the same colors, and are made of the same materials, differing only by the inscription.</s>
    <s>Tell me, please, Deacon Epiphanius, who said that images could be led to honor by the inscription of a name, where was this sanctity of one before it was inscribed?</s>
    <s>Or where was the reproach of the other before it was inscribed?</s>
    <s>The inscription, which is usually given to images according to the custom of letters, has such power that they silently speak and sometimes explain the words of those absent and sometimes of those present without a voice, can bring knowledge.</s>
  </p>


<p>
It cannot give sanctification to us. For sanctification is given to rational creatures by doing good deeds and through the privileges of merits. But to irrational things and those without sense, like vessels dedicated to divine worship and similar things, it comes not through any inscription, but through priestly consecration and the invocation of the divine name. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is clearly shown that no sanctification can adhere to images by any inscription. For this image, which bears the name of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and which was once contemptuously cast aside, is now honorably adorned. As much as it was able to harm its despisers when it was cast aside, it can equally benefit its worshippers when it is raised and venerated. And just as it could help if it were raised, so too can it harm when it is scorned. 
</p>
<p>
Regarding the statement, "And by kissing it and respectfully venerating it, we will receive sanctification," it would be as meaningful as saying, "We kiss it and respectfully venerate it, hoping to receive sanctification from it, which it neither has nor can give to us." 
</p>
<p>
Just as a blind thing cannot give sight, since it does not see; a thing without the sense of smell cannot give a scent, since it lacks that sense; a deaf thing cannot give hearing, since it does not hear; a mute thing cannot give speech, since it does not speak; a weak thing cannot give the sense of touch, since it cannot feel anything; a lame thing cannot give the ability to walk, since it completely lacks it; and a dead thing cannot give life, since it is not alive. 
</p>


<p>
It cannot truly bring us sanctification, which it entirely lacks. Regarding the brief remaining section, we do not need to dwell on it any longer since nearly all of it seems to be connected to the previous parts. For it says: "For we also have different sacred vessels, which we kiss and embrace, and we hope for a certain sanctification." Sanctification does not come to people through the vessels, but to the vessels through the invocation of the divine name and the celebration of the sacred mysteries by people. Nor should images be equated with vessels, since sacrifices to God are offered in vessels, not in images. For if sanctification, as we have said, is not imparted to people from vessels, which are indeed sanctified, much less will it be imparted from images, which can neither sanctify nor be sanctified.
</p>
<p>
The most ridiculous statement of Epiphanius is criticized in this: "He spoke from his own belly."
</p>
<p>
It is written in the same synod because the aforementioned Epiphanius said of someone: "He spoke from his own belly," although it brings no prejudice to matters of faith and neither adds nor detracts anything from the matter at hand. Therefore, it was not omitted by us because it sounds uneducated and foolish, and because no new constitutions of the church, which can be criticized in so many ways, should or can be extended from such a writing. For the holy catholic church accepts only that which is irreproachable; but that which is criticized by many is rejected by the church.

<p>

<s>So, just as other objections on this matter are refuted, this one will also be dismissed by clear reasoning.</s>
</p>

<p>
Catholics were housed in basilicas. Just as the practice of sacrificing slaughtered animals was celebrated by the holy fathers before the law and was handed down by the Lord through Moses in the law, let them say where the use of worshiping images was instituted either before the law by the patriarchs, or in the law by the legislator, or in the New Testament by the Lord and Savior, or by the apostles or apostolic men? And since their celebration has such an authentic tradition, let them say what strength the worship of these images holds? When they cannot say this, let them be ashamed of presenting something useless, and realize that they have vainly tried to associate the worship of images with the offering of holy sacrifices. So how can it be believed that images were created by Catholics for worship when even the images of the pagans were not originally created for worship? The use of images arose from the desire of people to create images or effigies of strong men, kings, founders of cities, or inventors of certain arts, whom they loved, so that the grief of their descendants or admirers might find some solace in the contemplation of the images. But gradually, with demons persuading this error, it crept into the descendants in such a way that those they had considered worth painting only for the sake of memory were regarded by successors as gods.
</p>


<p>They would honor and cultivate them, and among these, they would count demons as their sacrifices, tricking and counting those poor souls.</p>
<p>We see this example so clearly in the use of images that, what was once crafted for the decoration of basilicas and the memory of deeds, has gradually grown into a wicked practice. Now, Catholics of any sort praise them, worship them, and offer lights, incense, first fruits, or even small gifts to them.</p>
<p>What is worse is that, as we read it happened in parts of Greece, the priests, who should have preached that only God is to be worshipped and served, admit to serving these images themselves, worshipping and honoring them. They judge those who worship only God and despise these images as heretics and seek to condemn them.</p>
<p>In one almost identical way, as we mentioned earlier, the wicked practice of worshipping and honoring images or rather demons has grown among the pagans and Catholics. This is something we discuss with a certain sadness. The foolish custom of worshipping images has increased, and things that were created for one purpose seem to be misused for another.</p>
<p>We do not call the images placed in basilicas idols, but to prevent them from being called idols, we refuse to worship them or serve them. This is because it is often not the thing itself but the reason for the thing that is considered a sin. Many things, which can be used well, are turned into crime when used badly. Thus, the same thing is not a cause of sin for those who use it well but is for those who use it badly.</p>


<p>
<s>There is a cause for danger.</s> 
<s>Therefore, we must be careful and work with great effort to ensure that while some of our people strive to elevate certain matters beyond what is necessary, the old and decayed error does not come back to life, and they do not lose the victory they achieved in the field inside the city's walls.</s> 
<s>The civil war's subtle deception must not overpower them, which an open attack by a foreign enemy could not accomplish.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>So, when they accuse the holy fathers—Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and David—we do not wish to accuse them but to praise them, as Ecclesiasticus says:</s>

<p>
<s>Who, then, has such a profane mind that they would dare to accuse Abel, who was called just by the Lord Himself, whose blood is said to have cried out to the Lord from the ground, who is the example and standard of all the just, who was the first to suffer persecution for the saints, and who laid the first foundations of the city of God, which the river's stream makes joyful?</s>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<s>If we were to bring forth the praises and mysteries of each individually, the day would end before the words ceased.</s>
<s>For they did not offer pagan sacrifices to God, but full of mysteries, because pagans were not yet called by the villages of the Athenians when sacrifices were already being offered to God by them.</s>
<s>And, so to speak, the city of Athens was not yet founded, nor had Cecrops handed down to the pagans the institutions of sacrifices, the erection of altars, and the invocations of demons, when Abel, Noah, and Abraham had already offered sacrifices to God.</s>
</p>


<p>
They used to say, I repeat, that the holy sacrifices, whether before the law or under the law, were shadowed by symbolic mysteries. These were fulfilled and handed down in the New Testament through the Mediator of God and men, after the shadows of prefigurations were expelled, and the church will be content with them until the end with His help.
</p>
<p>
So, why did the ancient fathers visibly sacrifice and offer carnal sacrifices to God? Let the reader recognize this through the words of the blessed Augustine. For he says, "These are even spiritual sacred things, the images of which the carnal people had to celebrate, so that the prefiguration of the new people would be made through the servitude of the old." We can also notice the difference between these two peoples within each of us. Everyone must act as the old man from the womb of the mother until they reach youthful age, where it is no longer necessary to think carnally, but they can turn to spiritual matters by will and be regenerated internally. What happens in one properly educated person through the order of nature and discipline, proportionally occurs in the entire human race through divine providence, and this is the most beautiful thing.

    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Just because the disciples of Epiphanius are said to have painted a basilica on the island of Cyprus, it does not mean that the images must be worshipped, since not everything that is painted is immediately worshipped.

      If everything painted had to be worshipped, very few created things would remain unworshipped.

  </p>
  <p>
    Is it because the aforementioned men, namely the disciples of Saint Epiphanius, painted a basilica in Cyprus, that all should be worshipped? Or because they decorated the place with various materials dedicated to divine worship, should one then kneel down to each material we mentioned before as images, bowing their necks, with frequent sighs, and eyes raised reverently and often half-closed by the faithful? It does not follow, therefore, that because they are said to have painted the basilica, the images should be worshipped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reasonable argument can be made against this objection of theirs, just as their assertion could not be supported by other objections, so too this basilica painted by the disciples of Epiphanius cannot be substantiated. Especially since, even if the disciples of the same holy man had thought it right to worship the paintings they placed on the walls, this would have no valid force, because often disciples well-taught by good masters later become perverse by neglecting their masters' teaching. If this is investigated diligently, it will be confirmed by examples from the sacred scriptures.

<s>Such was the rage of greed that seized him, that he did not hesitate to betray the teacher—not the heavenly words, not the flood of the fountain of life, not the display of signs, not the apostolic fellowship, not the dignity of the apostolic name could stop him.</s>

<s>He restrained himself from committing the crime.</s> 
<s>When he realized the evil of his actions, he ended his undeserving life in a way fitting of death.</s>

<s>Also, Nicholas, a disciple of the apostles and one of the seven deacons consecrated along with blessed Stephen, later disregarded the teachings of his good masters and the company of good fellow deacons.</s> 
<s>He became a leader of heresy, and instead of promoting good works through examples and words as a disciple of the apostles should, he himself established the wicked heresy, about which it is written in Revelation:</s> 
<s>But you have this in your favor: you hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>If a good prophet's bad disciple is condemned for greed, and the disciple of our good master and Savior is abhorred for becoming a thief and traitor, and if a bad disciple of the holy apostles is cursed for instituting impious doctrines, is it any wonder that bad disciples are made by the good master Epiphanius through the institution of picture worship?</s> 
<s>And saying this, we do not judge them as reprobates, since we do not know their lives and conversations, but by proposing a conditional clause, if they approved the worship of images, we assert them as erroneous in this respect.</s> 
<s>Let's consider Novatus, a priest of Bishop Cyprian, who established the Novatian heresy and followed his own judgment, disregarding the teachings of his holy master.</s> 
<s>Likewise, Arius, who from the Catholic faith...</s>

<p>
We know that Olico was a learned teacher, but later he sowed the seeds of a dangerous doctrine. What should I say about each one individually? Almost all heresiarchs are known to have been disciples of the Catholics, because no one could name a heresy in their own name unless they had invented it according to their own judgment.
</p>
<p>
From these examples, it is concluded that the sanctity of St. Epiphanius did not benefit his disciples, if it is believed that they deviated from ecclesiastical constitutions despite the good teacher's instruction.

<p>
They flatteringly equate the emperor or his mother with the apostles, saying: "Just as our savior and perfecter Jesus once sent out his own apostles, clothed with the power of the Holy Spirit, so now he sends out his faithful, wise, and capable emperors with the same Spirit, making them perfect."
</p>
<p>
We find by the true voice of the Lord that the apostles will sit with the Lord to judge: "You," he said, "who..."
</p>


<p>
You have followed me, and in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. He chose them out of the world, so they wouldn't be of the world, but to bear much fruit. The Lord himself testifies: "I chose you out of the world so that you would not be of the world" and "I chose you to bear much fruit and that your fruit would remain forever." They are the salt of the earth, seasoning the people and giving flavor to the tasteless. They are the light of the world, who, with the true light, that is, Christ, illuminated the darkness of the world with the brilliance of their preaching, dispelling the gloom of doubt.
</p>
<p>
They were given the Holy Spirit by the Lord both on earth through his breath and from heaven in the form of tongues of fire, to signify love for God and neighbor. They received the power to bind and loose, to forgive and retain sins, to raise the dead, to cast out demons, to heal the sick, and to perform other such works. They were given the authority to teach all nations and to baptize in the name of the Holy Trinity. They were commanded to rejoice because their names are written in the book of eternal life in heaven. They were told: "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see."
</p>


<p>
<s>And ears that hear what you hear, because as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has very truthfully testified, many prophets and kings wished to see what you see and to hear what you hear.</s>
<s>The outstanding assemblies of all the patriarchs and prophets, although they knew through the teaching of the spirit of prophecy that the Redeemer of the world would come for the salvation of the world and somehow saw Him with the inner eye of intuition, they still longed to see Him physically, whom they knew would come physically.</s>
<s>While they shine with so many merits and excel in so much blessedness, it is pointless for those whose errors we discuss to aspire to compare their emperors to them.</s>
<s>For it is clearly evident that the apostles are superior to the prophets.</s>
<s>If, as they dream, their emperors are like the apostles, then they are superior to the prophets who did not see Christ physically, though they knew He would come physically.</s>
<s>If they are superior to the prophets, they saw the Redeemer of the world physically.</s>
<s>However, it is very clear that they did not see the Redeemer of the world physically.</s>
<s>Therefore, their emperors are not superior to the prophets, nor are they similar to the apostles as they claim.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>How then can they be compared to the apostles, when they are not only not equal to them in merits nor endowed with the same radiance of holiness, but also seem to oppose their most sacred teachings in many ways?</s>
<s>Or how can they be similar to those whose teachings they neglect?</s>

<p>Those men pursued heavenly things and those that would last forever, while these men chase after earthly and fleeting things. Those men, having rejected the world, preferred to cling to the Lord, while these men, attached to the pomp and fleeting joys of the world, often disregard the Lord's commandments. Those men suffered persecution for righteousness, while these men often persecute because of righteousness. Those men were handed over in councils and whipped in synagogues, while these men are praised in conquered cities and lauded among the people. Their letters, carrying the exchange of eternal life, were read throughout provinces and regions, while the images and effigies of these men, referencing a certain obsolete error, are carried around to be adored in villages and cities. Those men were called blessed by the Lord when people hated and persecuted them and spoke all kinds of evil against them falsely. These men consider themselves blessed because they see that they are loved and praised by people. To those men it is said: "Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh"; to these men it is said: "Laughter is mixed with pain, and the end of joy is grief." Those men were saddened while the world rejoiced, but when the world is saddened again, they will rejoice. These men rejoice when the world rejoices, but when the world is saddened, they will be saddened.</p>


  <p>
    <s>They mourn their harmful actions, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛks.tɛr.ni">eterni</phoneme>, weeping for seeds that will bear fruit.</s>
    <s>These people, grounded in the world, rejoice in worldly prosperity and embrace the good things of this life.</s>
    <s>But those who come to judgment will arrive with great joy, secure in their eternal reward, bringing with them the sheaves of people converted through their preaching.</s>
    <s>However, these others will come with great trembling, having to account for their deeds.</s>

    <s>But why do we delay any longer?</s>
    <s>Why do we wander endlessly?</s>
    <s>Why do we pick small flowers from immense forests, unable to gather even a thousandth part of them?</s>
    <s>The distance between apostles and emperors is as great as that between saints and sinners.</s>
    <s>And while the apostles stand out among all New Testament saints, they are believed to stand out much more among sinners.</s>
    <s>Oh, flattery, why do you presume so much?</s>
    <s>Oh, rancid oil, exuding stench rather than the shine of gentleness or nectar!</s>
    <s>You are sold by priests, smeared by bishops on the heads of certain readers, and what the prophet recoiled from having applied to him: "Let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head."</s>
    <s>The assembly of bishops places it on the heads of emperors, and what the gospel virgins said should be bought from sellers, alas!</s>
    <s>This is what faithful people and especially the leaders of the people buy from bishops.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, from the same Spirit, that is, from the Holy Spirit, these emperors are made wise and capable by virtue of their perfection.</s>

<p>It is clear that all the faithful, who are truly Christians, have the Holy Spirit, as the Apostle says:</p>
<p>Romans 8:9.</p>
<p>Acts 2:38,</p>
<p>Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ, does not belong to him. The gift of the Holy Spirit is</p>
<p>Acts 8:18.</p>
<p>poured out after baptism through the laying on of hands and the purity of life is distributed to each according to the measure, as the chosen vessel says: To each is given grace</p>
<p>John 1:16,</p>
<p>according to the measure. Although it is written elsewhere: For God does not give the Spirit by measure, it is nevertheless imparted to the faithful by measure. What is meant by 'For God does not give the Spirit by measure' should be understood only about the Son, who is consubstantial with the Father and the Holy Spirit, to whom the Spirit is given without measure, because</p>
<p>Colossians 2:9.</p>
<p>according to Paul's words, it is believed that in him dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:11.</p>
<p>But 'to give the Spirit by measure and to distribute to each individually as he wills' is understood without ambiguity to refer to the faithful. But although it is established that each of the Catholics has the Holy Spirit, as we have mentioned above and illustrated with examples, we do not dare to say or affirm that any man of our time has received the Holy Spirit according to the grace of the apostolic measure.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14.</p>
<p>What they said: 'For the prophecy says: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son; however, the prophecy is seen in the image, namely, the virgin in</p>


<p>
<s>How can we not worship and kiss the one who bears in his arms the child he has fathered?</s>
<s>Who would dare to resist with an undisciplined mind?</s>
<s>Let us make ourselves worthy of such a kiss and adoration, so that we do not suffer the punishment of Uzzah for approaching unworthily.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The prophecy that foretells a virgin conceiving and bearing a son is no longer to be sought in uncertain and ambiguous things, but to be held in the heart.</s>
<s>Its profound mysteries are not to be found in pictures, but in the divine scriptures and their interpreters, the apostles and their successors.</s>
<s>These should be investigated and seen through faith rather than with eyes.</s>
<s>For the noble prophet Isaiah, referring to the gospel rather than prophecy, did not say, 'Unless you paint and worship images, you will not stand firm'; but said, 'If you do not believe, you will not stand firm.'</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>It is clear, therefore, that the one who wishes to remain steadfast in the integrity of faith and come to eternal reward should have the tools to achieve this not on walls, not on tablets, not in pictures, not in any visible things, but in the heart through faith, in the mouth through confession, and in action through the demonstration of good deeds.</s>
<s>We must believe in the virgin who brought forth the Savior of the world, not in the works of worldly artisans.</s>

        But in the work of the eternal and indescribable artist, that is, to be in the heavenly seats. <s> Therefore, it is necessary that whoever desires to worship her, should not fix his mind on the dyes of colors, not on material works, not in any workshops, but fix it there, where it is known she reigns with Christ. </s> <s> For when they say:</s> <s> Revelation 20:4.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Seeing this prophecy in an image, namely, the virgin holding in her arms the one she gave birth to, how will we endure not to worship and kiss her? <s> Who, undisciplined in mind, would dare to resist?</s> <s> And we almost follow the same words in sound, not in sense, saying, seeing this painting on a board or wall, namely the virgin depicted holding the child in her arms, how will we presume to worship an inanimate thing and kiss the work of any artist?</s> <s> Who, undisciplined, would dare to commit such a crime, to bestow worship owed only to the Creator on creatures, and while wanting to favor paintings, resist the holy Scriptures?</s> <s> See, Matthew 10.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Behold, the image of the holy Mother of God is to be worshiped, how can we know what her image is or by what signs it is distinguished from other images, since there is no difference among them except the skill of the artists and the quality of the materials from which they work? <s> Therefore, when we see a certain beautiful woman depicted holding a child in her arms, if the inscription has not yet been made or has by some chance been destroyed, by what means can we discern whether it is Sarah holding Isaac or Rebecca carrying Jacob?</s>
    </p>


<p>Just as Bathsheba carried Solomon, or Elizabeth carried John, or any woman holds her little child? And if we consider the tales of the gentiles, which are often found to be depicted, how can we know whether it is Venus holding Aeneas, Alcmene carrying Hercules, or Andromache bearing Astyanax? For if one is worshipped in place of another, it is madness; but if something that should not be worshipped at all is worshipped, it is insanity. Both of these must be avoided. The same blessed Virgin is also depicted, as she rides on a donkey carrying the child in her arms with Joseph leading the way to Egypt, or as she returns from Egypt to the land of Israel. This story is included in many works, not always in basilicas, but sometimes on vessels for food or drink, sometimes on silk garments, and often on tapestries. Are all these things to be worshipped? When, therefore, in any of these, an image of the holy Virgin holding the child is depicted on the back of a specific animal and is worshipped, is not the image of the animal itself also worshipped along with it? In no way can the worship of both images, that of the Virgin and of the animal, be separated.</p>


  <p>
    <s>On the topic of images.</s>
    <s>The division, especially when they are of the same material and crafted by the same artist's skill, is noteworthy.</s>
    <s>Either both should be venerated, or both should be rejected.</s>
