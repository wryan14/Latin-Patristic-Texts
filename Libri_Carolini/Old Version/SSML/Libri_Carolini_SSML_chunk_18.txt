    <s>But perhaps some picky person might say, 'This assertion of worshiping a living being is misleading, because when we greet any person seated on a chair or leaning on a staff, we do not show that we are worshiping the chair or the staff, but it is believed that those objects remain unacknowledged while the person is greeted.'</s>
    <s>This argument should be addressed in this way:</s>
    <s>The definition of a person is different from that of a staff or a chair.</s>
    <s>A person is defined as a rational, mortal, and capable of laughter being, and other similar qualities.</s>
    <s>However, a chair or a staff is not defined in the same way, but as objects lacking sensation and life, prepared by the skill or will of the craftsman for the necessary functions.</s>
    <s>Thus, it is clear that greeting a rational person is different from leaving an inanimate chair or staff unacknowledged.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>In the definition of an image of either a virgin or a specific living being, since both lack sensation and life, are made from the same material, and formed by the same artist, they are so mutually coherent that they cannot be separated from the material in which they exist without division.</s>
    <s>There is almost no distinction in defining them.</s>
    <s>In such cases where there is so much similarity, so much association, so much material unity, either both should be venerated or both should be rejected.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    The earth cannot be separated without division, and since both, lest perhaps the image of a living being be worshipped, must not be worshipped, it remains that both should be without the honor of worship and should only hold places in basilicas or any locations to provide a memory of events to onlookers. Because the worship of images leads to so many errors through various pathways, no clear reason shows that it should remain within the holy Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, they encourage each other to be worthy, to kiss or adore things without sense, saying: "Let us make ourselves worthy for such a kiss of adoration, lest, approaching unworthy, we suffer the punishment of Uzzah." Let us indeed make ourselves worthy to adore the divine majesty, or rather be made worthy by Him, from whom it is a good will and perfection, and let us be true worshippers, not according to their vanity, but let us worship the Lord in spirit and truth, as the Truth itself says: "True worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth."
  </p>
  <p>
    They remind themselves to make themselves worthy for the kisses and adorations of images, lest perhaps they suffer the punishment of Uzzah. Let them see that by the same presumption which made Uzzah think the ark of the Lord would fall without his support, and they likewise think that the realm of divine worship would fail without the support of images, they might undergo the same deadly punishment; for neither did it need his support to not fall, nor does this need the support of those to stand firmly.
  </p>


<p>
<s>Just as the Ark, without needing any help from Uzzah, was carried without falling because God supported it, so too this one, governed by the Lord, is kept safe without any shipwreck, even without the help of images.</s>
<s>What then does it mean to want to put your hand on the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, which was governed by the Lord to prevent it from falling, if not to want to admit the adoration of images into the Catholic religion, which is ruled by the Lord to keep it from stumbling through this life's journey?</s>
<s>Or to whom can Uzzah be compared, who, without the counsel of priests and Levites, presumptuously wanted to provide support to the Ark of the Lord, if not to those who, without the doctrine of the holy fathers and the consensus of priests established in various parts of the world, with a certain arrogance and haughty intention, strive to insert the adoration of images into Christianity?</s>
<s>So he lost his life, who arrogantly tried to support the Ark of God, because he believed that God, who is everywhere and wonderful everywhere, needed something in which to be worshipped, and adored Him in visible things.</s>
<s>One must be cautious not to lose life in this way, by resisting His vital teachings with a proud mind.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>It is rightly said that Oza, which is interpreted as strong, refers to those who, unless they believed themselves to be strong in daring mind, would by no means engage in synods where the new decree for worshipping images was considered.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>They do not even obey themselves and disrespect their parents, saying, "They have sown weeds instead of true wheat in the ecclesiastical fields, mixed wine with water, and gave their neighbor a troubling drink.</s>
    <s>Like Arab wolves, they put on sheep's clothing and, ignoring the truth, embraced falsehood.</s>
    <s>They have laid asp eggs and woven spider webs, and whoever hopes to eat their eggs will find that breaking one will release a basilisk's venom and deadly breath."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Their intemperate madness is criticized in this delirium, just as in other matters, because they said that their elders "had sown weeds instead of wheat in the ecclesiastical fields and mixed wine with water, giving their neighbors a troubling drink."</s>
    <s>Especially since, in this matter, they are said not only to have failed to correct the mistakes their elders are believed to have made, but also to have committed even greater faults.</s>
    <s>As the poet says:</s>
    <s>"Instead of the soft violet, instead of the purple narcissus, the thistle and the sharp-spined paliurus arose."</s>
    <s>For their elders, weeds sprang up instead of wheat, and for them, even before the weeds were uprooted, the paliurus arose, neglecting the prophetic, evangelical, and apostolic preaching.</s>
  </p>


<p>Oh, in which places devoted to divine worship are adorned, and the worship and adoration of God alone are encouraged. <break time="1s" /> In the removal of decorations from the basilicas or in the worship of these same decorations, the harmful doctrine of crazy weeds and thorny brambles is shown to have taken root. <break time="1s" /> And those who should have nourished the minds of the faithful with the fullness of the divine word's grain, which satisfies without causing disgust, strive to infect them with doctrines that feed immense disgust and madness and implant the thorns of errors.</p>
<p>They also said that their elders 'mixed water with wine and offered this turbulent drink to their neighbors.' <break time="1s" /> To them, it can reasonably be objected that their elders made the wine of sacred teachings, which they should have used, insipid by mixing it with water when they decreed that the decorations of the basilicas should be removed. <break time="1s" /> These people, however, have poisoned the drink of this same wine, already diluted by their predecessors with water, by professing that they would worship the images and serve them, while attempting to condemn with anathemas those who scorn the worship of these images. <break time="1s" /> Then, neither group is ashamed to offer this turbulent drink to their neighbors when they adorn their preaching, which should be enhanced with sacred teachings and examples of good works.</p>


<p>
They should not hesitate to spoil it with empty and extraordinary rules, and they do not fear to show it in their lives or actions and to record it for the memory of future generations. 
</p>
<p>
What they assert about wolves hiding under sheep's skins and embracing lies while rejecting the truth, they will see happening to themselves if they look closely. For while they pretend to have great holiness and, driven by a false zeal, remove images from churches so they would not be worshipped—images that were not placed by the ancients to be worshipped—these people, driven by an excessive love of holiness, declare them to be worshipped. They do not think the gifts of the Catholic faith are enough unless they offer worship to these images. But both are driven by a vain desire for praise. What else are they doing but covering wolves with sheep's skins? Because, while outwardly they pretend to show zeal or devotion to holiness, inwardly they show the wolfish rage with which they seek to surpass others and bite them with the teeth of anathema. Both groups embrace lies because they strive proudly and arrogantly to create new things and do not follow the examples of the humble ancient fathers, thus departing from the Truth that cannot deceive or be deceived and adhering to the lie, about which it is written: <lang xml:lang="la">cf. Ioh. 8, 44.</lang>
</p>


  <p>
    From the beginning, he was a liar and did not stand in the truth. So what does it mean to go against the truth, if not to oppose Christ's teachings, who is the author of humility, with arrogance? What does it mean to follow a lie, if not to imitate the example of the one who is the author of pride, by indulging in new and illicit customs and opposing ancient and beneficial traditions? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Both of these groups act this way when, inflated by the wind of pride, they fall into the error of either breaking or worshiping images. Furthermore, when they claim that their ancestors "produced the eggs of vipers and wove the spider's web," they are not doing themselves any favors. This is because their eggs exist due to their ancestors, either through physical descent or through the teachings they were imbued with, or certainly through the laying on of hands in ecclesiastical orders.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, their webs exist because they were either physically descended from them or spiritually ordained through their teachings. So, they rightly call these the eggs of vipers and the spider's web, because they close their ears to the words of the Scriptures, which establish the worship and adoration of the one true God. They do not fear starting and weaving the web of new and useless regulations to trap or entice souls through their preaching. According to their own profession, anyone who desires these eggs will find a basilisk within, because anyone who seeks to use their preaching will receive the deadly breath of their tradition.
  </p>


  <p>
    He finds that, while he desires to soothe the hunger of words with preaching, he finds a certain remedy, but he is about to lose the life of internal salvation. Therefore, we do not consider it important to spare them in our dispute, because we have found that they did not spare themselves in their own dispute, but having received the material for reproach from them, we hurl our darts at them. We do all this not without love, but we act because we aim for their conversion from error, if perhaps someday they may despise the monstrous errors they follow and seek to hold perpetually to the path that leads to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interpretation of those who, while they wanted to affirm that it is one thing to worship and another to kiss, said it is useless and uneducated. The interpretation of our holy leaders and their successors, the distinguished fathers of ours, was that both are seen as the same thing; indeed, kissing and embracing in ancient Greek language signifies some extension of love, just as "I carry" and "I offer," "I confirm" and "I strengthen," "I share" and "I worship," which demonstrates a kiss and the extension of friendship. For what one loves and worships, and what one worships entirely, one loves.
  </p>


<p>
<s>When it comes to worship and kissing, which those two think are the same, there's no need to worry too much.</s>
<s>This is because these two words are as far apart as the things they refer to.</s>
<s>And necessarily, they have a big difference from each other, since the things themselves often have a big separation, especially when sometimes what is worshipped is not kissed and what is kissed is not worshipped.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For God is worshipped, but not kissed.</s>
<s>Saints, who left this world with the triumphs of their merits, are revered, but they should neither be worshipped with divine worship nor can they be kissed.</s>
<s>On the contrary, spouses, children, and even servants kiss, but they are not worshipped.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>It is clear that a kiss and worship are names of two different things.</s>
<s>So how can there be such unity in the sense of the words when there is such diversity in the understanding of the things?</s>
<s>Or why can't words differ in meaning, when the origins of the words can differ in action?</s>
<s>For things are not created for the sake of words, but words for the sake of things.</s>
<s>And it should not be believed that things are made to fit words, but rather words are made to fit things, since it is read that animals were brought to the first human by the Lord to see what he would call them.</s>
<s>The father of the human race gave names to the things created by God, not things to the names he created, which he saw brought to him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Finally, the philosopher Plato decided that words are natural and tried to prove this by saying that they are, in a way, tools and instruments for understanding each other.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>There are some natural tools: like how eyes are tools for seeing, which is a natural function.</s>
    <s>Therefore, it is necessary that eyes are also natural.</s>
    <s>Similarly, speech is a tool and instrument for expressing thoughts, making it natural as well.</s>
    <s>However, Aristotle says that speech is not natural but rather according to convention, and thus it is not a natural tool.</s>

        <s>He says that through this instrument, thoughts are not expressed, but it is only a matter of speech according to convention, through which we demonstrate our own ideas.</s>
        <s>The same philosopher, who should be most trusted in this part, says in the book "Periermenias" that a name is a significant voice according to agreement without time, that is, a name is a voice.</s>
        <s>But some voices are significant, and some are not significant; however, a name signifies that which it is a name of.</s>
        <s>Therefore, a name is a significant voice.</s>
        <s>Some voices are naturally significant, and some are not naturally significant.</s>
        <s>A naturally significant voice is one that naturally shows pain or joy, such as interjections; but voices that are significantly not naturally are those which we say exist according to convention.</s>
        <s>According to convention, they are those that humans have assigned to themselves, as shown in the previous example we took from Genesis, which would be too lengthy to follow individually.</s>
        <s>Meanwhile, it is clear that 'kiss' and 'worship', or 'to kiss' and 'to worship', are two things that are often very different from each other.</s>
        <s>According to the masters of secular letters, there are three things from which all conversation and discussion are completed: things, understanding, and voices.</s>
        <s>Things are those which we perceive with our mind's reason and discern with understanding, such as to worship or to kiss or anything of this sort; understanding, however, is a certain vigor of the mind by which we learn things themselves and discern what differs between them.</s>
        <s>Voices are what we use to signify what we grasp with understanding.</s>
    </p>


  <p>
    <s>For what we call worship, we say adoration; for what we call kissing, we say kiss.</s> 
    <s>There is something else that signifies sounds: these are letters; for the writing of these is the representation of sounds.</s> 
    <s>So, there are four things: the idea, understanding, voice, and letter.</s> 
    <s>The understanding grasps the thing, the voices express the understanding, and the letters signify the voices.</s> 
    <s>As Aristotle stated in his "Peri Hermeneias": "The things spoken are symbols of the passions in the soul; and the things written are symbols of the things spoken."</s> 
    <s>And just as letters are not the same for everyone, neither are the voices the same.</s> 
    <s>But the first signs of these are the same for all, and the likeness of these things is also the same, that is, the understanding.</s> 
    <s>According to the explanation of the very learned man Boethius, the understanding is a passion of the soul.</s> 
    <s>Because, as Boethius says, unless the mind experiences a likeness of the thing which one understands, there is no understanding.</s> 
    <s>When I see a circle or a square, I conceive its shape in my mind, and its likeness is formed in my soul, and the soul experiences the likeness of the understood thing.</s> 
    <s>Hence, understanding is both the likeness of the thing and a passion of the soul.</s> 
    <s>Of these four, two are natural, and two are according to human convention.</s> 
    <s>Voices and letters are according to convention, but understanding and things are natural.</s> 
    <s>This is proven by the fact that different peoples use different voices and letters;</s> 
    <s>therefore, the voices they use...</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    They created letters to write with. <break time="1s" /> No one placed understanding and things, but they exist naturally. <s>For what is a horse among the Romans is not a deer among the barbarians, but the nature of things is the same among different peoples.</s> <s>Therefore, it's not that what we understand to be a horse, the barbarians think is a dog, but the understanding of substances is the same among very different peoples.</s> <s>Thus, two of these are according to human convention: that is, sounds and letters, and two according to nature: things and understanding.</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>These teachings show that adoration and a kiss are not the same thing, even though in Greek these two words sound similar.</s> <s>Often, two or more names have one meaning according to synonyms, and sometimes one name has two or more meanings according to homonyms, yet the order of things is not confused or somehow disrupted if people give names to them in various ways according to their preference.</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, they add a third thing to these two, so that 'to adore', 'to kiss', and 'to embrace' all mean the same thing. <s>But just as those two are distinguished from each other, so this third is distinguished from those two.</s> 
  </p>


<p>Some things, as we mentioned earlier, are worshipped but not immediately kissed, some are kissed but not immediately worshipped, and many are embraced, which are neither worshipped nor kissed. <s>Someone might embrace a piece of wood or stone or any object without feeling the need to kiss it, yet he does not worship it either.</s> <s>He might also kiss someone he respects deeply, to whom he barely dares to approach due to reverence, yet he does not embrace him.</s> <s>The more these three actions are seen to differ from each other in meaning, the more it becomes clear that the examples set to prove one thing from these actions are far from rational, given that these actions themselves have significant differences and no consistency with reason.</s> <s>They say: “All the holy leaders of our teachings and their successors, the great fathers of our tradition, are to be worshipped and kissed; for to kiss is the same as to worship; the common use of ancient Greek language designates kissing and embracing, and signifies some extent of love, just as ‘I carry’ and ‘I offer,’ ‘I establish’ and ‘I confirm,’ ‘I share’ and ‘I worship,’ which demonstrates a kiss and extension of friendship.”</s> <s>Oh, what a confusing sense that mixes up meanings rather than arranging them, breaking words rather than expressing them!</s> <s>Oh, what an edge, blunter than any pestle!</s> <s>Oh, leaden knife, dulling its blade before cutting the thing it is meant to cut!</s> <s>Oh, sword, more like a hammer that strikes rather than a blade that slices, breaking materials rather than cutting them!</s> <s>Oh, argumentation that affirms nothing other than proving its authors to be senseless!</s></p>


  <p>
    <s>

    </s>
    <s>
      From the fact that 'I carry' and 'I offer', 'to adore', 'to kiss', and 'to embrace' strive to assert as one and ignore the powers of prepositions, which often corrupt other parts, are often corrupted by other parts, and sometimes both corrupt and are corrupted, sometimes neither corrupt nor are corrupted, and sometimes increase, decrease, or change meanings.
    </s>
    <s>
      While he seeks to build up certain vain things, he tries to prove them with some vain assertions!
    </s>
    <s>
      Who, therefore, does not know that 'I offer', 'I bring', 'I carry out', 'I bring in', 'I bring together', 'I take away', 'I bring down', 'I bring back', 'I endure', 'I postpone', 'I bring forth', 'I prefer', 'I endure to the end' and so on, if there are any similar, although they come from the verb 'I carry', when prepositions are applied and partly corrupted, have very different meanings among themselves?
    </s>
    <s>
      Or who does not know that 'I participate' and 'I adore' have hardly any agreement in sense?
    </s>
    <s>
      For 'I strengthen' and 'I confirm', although they are common in sense, seem completely foreign to the thing to which they are applied.
    </s>
    <s>
      Of all these, if we were to discuss them individually, as is taught in grammar schools, this matter alone would hardly be contained in the text of one book.
    </s>
    <s>
      But we should not overlook the fact that they try to complete their most vain argument with some frivolous and empty conclusion, almost like a certain reversible syllogism, saying: 'For what one loves, one adores, and what one adores...'
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>In general, people love many things without realizing that these two feelings cannot be completely interchangeable.</s> 
    <s>For example, loving and adoring are not the same, and loving is broader than adoring.</s> 
    <s>A person may love their spouse or child but does not necessarily adore them.</s> 
    <s>They may love a servant, maid, horse, dog, or hawk, but do not adore them.</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So, while it is true when someone says 'they adore and love,' it is not equally true to say 'they love and adore.'</s> 
    <s>The reason is that loving is broader, as we mentioned, and these terms cannot be mutually reversed because there is no such property in them.</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Just as it can be said in reverse order that 'a neighing creature is a horse and a horse is a neighing creature,' it cannot be correctly said that 'someone loves and adores' and 'adores and loves.'</s> 
    <s>Because in these logical topics from which these arguments proceed, in the same reasoning called from the consequent, where something inevitably follows the proposed thing, as we said about the neighing creature and horse, many can be reversed, but some cannot be reversed at all.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s> If it is laughable, it inevitably follows that it is human, and if it is human, it necessarily is laughable, and so on with similar things. </s>
<s> However, these cannot be reversed in any way, such as if someone says: 'If it is day, it is light.' </s>
<s> It certainly follows that if it is day, it is light; if he is full, it follows that he is believed to have eaten; if he is drunk, it is certain that he has drunk; if he is learned, it follows that he is said to have studied; if he worships, it follows that he loves what he worships. </s>
<s> It cannot be said in reverse order: 'if it is light, it is necessarily day'; 'if he eats, it follows that he is full', since many things shine without it being day and often eating does not lead to fullness; nor this: 'if he drinks, he is drunk', 'if he learns, he is learned', 'if he loves, he worships', since sometimes drinking does not lead to drunkenness, nor does learning lead to mastery, nor does love lead to worship. </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Therefore, let each be placed according to the experience of logicians, so that it may more easily appear how much these two differ from each other or how this inversion cannot stand. </s>
<s> There are four propositions in a certain way related to each other, which philosophers have been accustomed to write in a square formula for examination, namely, so that the first two are: </s>
<s> 'Everything that someone loves, he worships', and 'Nothing that someone loves, he worships'; the other two: </s>
<s> 'Something that someone loves, he worships'; 'something that someone loves, he does not worship' - and the first two are called universal affirmation and universal negation, the other two particular affirmation. </s>
</p>


<p>
<s>Aris and a particular negation; the two above are entirely opposed to each other, while the two below are mutually subcontrary.</s> 
<s>The universal affirmation and particular subalternation, and the universal and particular negation subalternation are nevertheless stated.</s> 
<s>Then, meaning investigations are drawn almost like two angular lines, one from this universal affirmation: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɔmnɛ">‘All that one loves, one worships’</phoneme> to this particular negation: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈkwɪdːam">‘Some of what one loves, one does not worship’</phoneme>;</s> 
<s>the other from this particular affirmation: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈkwɪdːam">‘Some of what one loves, one worships’</phoneme> to this universal negation: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈnɪhɪl">‘Nothing that one loves, one worships’.</phoneme></s>
<s>And they are contrary or opposite among themselves.</s> 
<s>And with these thus conflicting, since both the universal affirmation and the particular negation, or the particular affirmation and the universal negation, cannot truly be, one will be false, the other true, and thus the true will eliminate the false.</s> 
<s>And if that one is true, the other will immediately depart from the truth.</s> 
<s>This is stated by Apuleius, the Platonic philosopher of Madaurus, who in his book titled <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɛ ˌpɛriˈɛrmɛniːs">‘De Periermeniis’</phoneme> argued very subtly about syllogistic reasoning of this kind:</s> 
<s>‘The universal, he says, confirms its particular when proven, but does not inform when defeated; the particular, on the other hand, secures the universal when reversed, invalidating it when defeated, but confirming it when proven.’</s>
</p>


<p>
In this argument, there are two general statements: 'Everyone who loves something, worships it' and 'No one who loves something, worships it'. Both are false because, as mentioned earlier, a person loves many things that they do not worship, and there are some things they love and do worship.
</p>
<p>
There are also two specific statements: 'There are some things a person loves and worships' and 'There are some things a person loves and does not worship'. Both are true because one loves God according to the command: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and worship Him', from Deuteronomy 6:5, from whose holy love all virtues are nourished. One loves their neighbor and shows respect to them, proving the statement: 'There are some things a person loves and worships' to be true. It also proves true that 'There are some things a person loves and does not worship', as shown by examples of a spouse, children, a horse, a dog, a hawk, and other things previously mentioned, which are each loved but not worshipped.
</p>
<p>
General and specific statements are opposed alternately; if the universal statement 'Everyone who loves something, worships it' is false, then the specific negation 'There are some things a person loves and does not worship' is true. And if this specific negation is false, then the affirmation of one...
</p>


<p>
<s>Universal statements are true.</s> 
<s>And again, if this universal negation: 'No one worships what they love' is false, then this particular affirmation: 'Someone worships something they love' is true, and if this is not true, then neither is that false.</s> 
<s>However, there are two lower statements that are entirely true, so the two higher ones must be considered completely false.</s> 
<s>Regarding the conversion of such propositions, which we have somewhat discussed earlier, the aforementioned philosopher says this:</s> 
<s>Convertible propositions are said to be universal negative and one of its counterparts, that is, particular affirmative, because their parts, subjective and declarative, can always exchange places while maintaining the condition of truth or falsity.</s> 
<s>For just as this proposition is true: 'No wise person is wicked', so if you switch the parts, it will still be true: 'No wicked person is wise'.</s> 
<s>Likewise, just as 'No human is an animal' is false, if you switch it, 'No animal is human' will also be false.</s> 
<s>By the same reasoning, a particular affirmative can be converted: 'Some grammarian is a human' and vice versa: 'Some human is a grammarian'; the other two propositions cannot always do this, although they can sometimes be converted; however, they are not therefore called convertible.</s>
<s>Therefore, each proposition must be examined in all its meanings to see if it also fits when converted; and there are not just one or two true ones, but five in total, because a property, a genus, a difference, an end, or an accident is declared.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>And to support our assertion, many arguments of this kind could be used, and the one that has been used could be further discussed.</s>
    <s>But for the sake of brevity, these and similar points are omitted.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, by the Lord's help, we have prepared to refute their assertion with arguments crafted from the dialectic art, because we have discovered that they, by some sort of reasoning, have tried to strengthen their nonsense with what appears to be a syllogistic argument.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Concerning what they arrogantly and ignorantly said: 'Similarly, we who came from the East joined together in the same city of Nicea and made Christ the head of all of us who were presiding there.'</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Their statement, which boasts that they made Christ their head, is extremely arrogant and rather absurd.</s>
    <s>For the same Lord, who is the head of the church, has chosen the church to be his body, not the other way around.</s>
    <s>The Apostle himself testifies, saying: 'You did not choose me, but I chose you.'</s>
    <s>According to their foolishness, if Christ was made head by them, then he was chosen by them.</s>
    <s>And if he was chosen by them...</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>So, the aforementioned judgment of the Lord is invalidated.</s> 
<s>However, the aforementioned judgment of the Lord is not invalidated.</s> 
<s>Therefore, according to their vanity, Christ was not made their head by them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Hence, it must be avoided that these might be immune from His election, who boast of making Him the head,</s> 
<s>because indeed, as we conjecture, if they were chosen by Him, they would seek His glory, not their own.</s> 
<s>They would preach not the adoration of senseless things, but of the one God.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For by their fruits the tree is known according to the judgment of Truth,</s> 
<s>and often in the nature of things, causes are known by their effects.</s> 
<s>When someone sees smoke, they do not doubt that there is fire beneath;</s> 
<s>or when they see the footprint of some animal, they know that the same animal has passed by;</s> 
<s>and when someone sees a good deed, they do not doubt that it is from God,</s> 
<s>who is the author of all good things;</s> 
<s>and when someone sees something wicked, they believe it is done by the schemes of the ancient enemy.</s>

<p>

If they were willing to be content with the teachings and examples of the ancient fathers, they would neither disrupt domestic peace with erroneous constitutions nor turn the weapons of their allies, who are to fight against enemies with them, against themselves.

<s>
For this useless saying, by which they dream that they have made Christ their head, although it does not detract from faith, is not without criticism.

<s>
For we do not believe them to be so monstrously insane as to think that the same Lord has been made by them, something that no faithful ears can tolerate hearing.

But because they intended to signify one thing and signified another, we felt it right to discuss both what they have said and not to leave unexamined what they are thought to have meant to say.

For they wanted, if we are not mistaken, to say: 'With us presiding, who are members of Christ, we have placed all the firmness of our work and hope in Him who is our head, and we have decided to follow Him.'
</s>
<s>
Or something of this sort, which can be inferred, and by what they wanted to say, taken away by the powers of their ignorance, they said 'they made Christ their head,' and of whom the evangelist John says: All things were made through Him, they say was made by themselves.

As much as God is, everything was made through Him.

But as a human, He Himself was made, as Solomon says: Wisdom has built her house, that is, the wisdom of God the Father, without which the Father never was.

This wisdom was not made by Him but born, the Son, who is of one substance with the Father.

He built for Himself a body in the womb of the virgin, which He called a temple, saying: Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.

Just as they are of one majesty, one substance, one will, so they are also of one operation.

The entire Trinity worked in the incarnation of the Lord, but only the person of the Son took on flesh.

For if the body, which can also be called a house, was made by the effect of the Holy Spirit, why is it referred to the person of Christ?

The work of the Son is the work of the Father, because they share one power.

Similarly, the work of the Holy Spirit is the work of the Son of God because of the unity of their nature and will.

Whether it is the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit who acts, it is the Trinity that operates.

    <p>
        The people sent to us by them, twisting and turning their words, will not hesitate to say: <s>'If Epiphanius had known those who despise the worship of images to be heretics, he would undoubtedly have counted them among the heretics in his general discussion on heresies; but he did not count them among the heretics, so he must be believed not to have considered them heretics.'</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is clear from these indications that Epiphanius not only despised the worship of images but also did not want them to be in churches. In a letter sent by him to Bishop John and translated from Greek into Latin by Jerome, it is stated: <s>'I heard some people murmuring against me when we were going together to the holy place called Bethel, to hold a church gathering as usual. When I came to the village called Anablata and saw a burning lamp there, I asked what place it was. I learned it was a church, and I went in to pray. I found a curtain hanging in the doorway of the church, dyed and painted, having an image like that of Christ or some saint. However, I was not happy with it.'</s>
    </p>


<p>
<s>When I saw this in the church of Christ, against the authority of the Scriptures, a person's image hanging, I tore it down and advised the caretakers of that place to wrap a poor dead man in it and carry him out.</s>
<s>They murmured in response, saying, 'If he wanted to tear it down, it was just that he should give another veil and replace it.'</s>
<s>When I heard this, I promised I would give one and send it immediately.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>There was a slight delay as I was looking for the best veil to send, thinking it had to be sent to me from Cyprus.</s>
<s>Now I have sent what I could find and I pray that you order the priest of that place to receive the veil from the bearer, which was sent by us, and from now on to command that such veils, which go against our religion, not be hung in the church of Christ.</s>
<s>It is fitting for your honor to have this concern and diligence, which is worthy of the church of Christ and the people entrusted to you.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>We have found this opinion about the matter from Epiphanius, which, whether it should be praised or criticized, is left to the reader's judgment.</s>
<s>Furthermore, let us turn to the blessed Augustine, let the wisest man be questioned, let the distinguished teacher be consulted, and let him say whether any heresy uses the worship of images.</s>
<s>This venerable man indeed wrote a book on eighty-nine heresies.</s>
</p>


<p>
Among these, two sects arose that worship images: namely, the Simonians and the Carpocratians. To make this clearer, let's discuss the teachings of the aforementioned doctor as they are laid out in the same book.
</p>
<p>
Simon, the founder of the Simonians, who was baptized by Philip the deacon, as read in the Acts of the Apostles, tried to buy the power of the Holy Spirit from the apostles with money by the laying on of hands. He had deceived many with his magical tricks. He taught the detestable practice of using women indiscriminately and claimed that God did not create the world. He also denied the resurrection of the flesh and asserted that he himself was Christ.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, he wanted to be believed as Jupiter and claimed that a certain prostitute named Selene, whom he had made his partner in crimes, was Minerva. He provided his followers with images of himself and this prostitute to be worshipped, which he had established in Rome as public idols, like statues of gods. In that city, the blessed apostle Peter, with the true power of the Almighty God, extinguished this practice.
</p>
<p>
Simon claimed that he had given the law to Moses on Mount Sinai in the person of the Father, had appeared during the time of Tiberius in the person of the Son, and later had come upon the apostles as the Holy Spirit in tongues of fire. However, he taught that Christ neither came nor suffered anything at the hands of the Jews. Just as the heresy of Simon, which is called Simoniac, is utterly rejected by the faithful, so too should the practice of worshipping images be completely rejected.
</p>
<p>
Another heresy that includes this error is the Carpocratian sect.
</p>


<p>
Carpocrates' followers, called Carpocratites, began with Carpocrates, who taught that every shameful act and every invention of sin must be practiced in order to escape and transcend the rulers and powers that approve of these things, to reach the higher heaven. He is also said to have believed that Jesus was merely a man, born of both sexes, but possessed a soul that knew the things above and could proclaim them. He rejected bodily resurrection along with the law. He denied that the world was made by God, but rather by certain powers. A woman named Marcellina is said to have been a member of his sect, who worshipped images of Jesus, Paul, Homer, and Pythagoras by burning incense.
</p>
<p>
For if someone who asserts this error happens to say, "Blessed Augustine counted the worship of images among heresies because some pagans, namely Simon and Selene, or even Homer and Pythagoras, worshipped images," let them note that images of Jesus and Paul are also said to have been worshipped, and this too was counted among heresies by the aforementioned man. For if the distinguished person knew that images of the Lord or apostles or any saints should be worshipped, he would never count the worship of images of Jesus and Paul among heresies.
</p>
<p>
Against those who say that holy and sacred images should be placed in the streets or anywhere...
</p>


<p>
They join together, in this discussion, two things that contradict each other. They frequently call these 'holy and venerable images' and insist that they should be placed in streets or public squares, which are often dirty. Just as light does not mix with darkness, or heat with cold, holiness does not mix with contamination, purity does not mix with impurity. Therefore, they are largely mistaken when they claim these images are holy and decide to place them in contaminated places.
</p>
<p>
It is clear that those who insist on placing these images in streets or public squares believe that they lack holiness, as they indeed do. If they were considered holy, they would be placed in holy places. Everything holy is clean, nothing clean is impure, and therefore nothing holy is impure.
</p>
<p>
If they seek to place these images in impure places, they do not reject impurity, which is contrary to holiness; and if they do not reject impurity, they cannot be considered holy. If they seek places of impurity, they cannot be called holy.
</p>
<p>
To avoid other examples, which could show that everything should be applied appropriately, let us bring in the teachings of the masters of eloquence, who insisted that in eloquence, the matter, place, time, and person should be considered.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>Heavy things do not mix with light things, nor modest with immodest, nor playful with serious, nor shameless with modest, nor impure with pure, nor wicked with chaste, nor ridiculous with sad, nor profane with religious.</s>
    <s>But everything in the art of eloquence should be fitting, so that nothing is out of place, nothing contradicts, but each thing remains moderate according to the style of the times and places.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If this is commanded to be observed by orators in the art of eloquence, it should be observed even more by us in the practices of our religion, so that everything related to religion is observed and held as reason and order demand.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Those who venerate images can be deceived by poorly painted ones, or it should be asked of those who place almost all the prerogatives of Christian faith in the adoration or veneration of images, what should be done by the poor who completely lack the artisans by whom images are made?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The practice of all arts involves various activities, and painting is an art that involves various practices.</s>
    <s>Those who practice this, called painters, understand it to different extents; some perform more beautiful works, others less beautiful ones; some create beautiful images, others ugly ones.</s>
    <s>Thus, it is clear that those who place almost all the firmness of their faith in images and do not blush to count their adoration among the instruments of good works can be easily deceived, whether the images are beautiful or not.</s>
  </p>


<p>
Now, they worship ugly images in one way, and they are deceived in another. For if any image is considered to be more holy and virtuous the more beautiful it is, then it logically follows that if an image is uglier, it has less holiness and virtue. And if the uglier one has less, it must be that the ugliest has either nothing or very little. And if the more beautiful one is worshipped more attentively because it is thought to have more virtue due to its beauty, then its sanctity is no longer derived from some religious significance but from the craft of the artist. And if the less beautiful or those without any beauty are worshipped, their worshippers are greatly mistaken, as they are perceived to worship things devoid of beauty.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if it follows that all images, whether beautiful, less beautiful, or devoid of beauty, are worshipped equally, the justice that gives each thing its due must necessarily be removed from these matters. For when they worship beautiful images, they are accidentally deceived into thinking they are worshipping something holy; but when they worship deformed pictures, they are deliberately deceived, especially since they are worshipping deformed things as if they were holy. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, whether they worship beautiful or deformed images, they are mistaken in both cases.
</p>


<p>They are mistaken, whether they worship by chance or by design. <s> They are truly mistaken, and rightly so, since God, the creator of all, decreed that He alone should be worshipped. </s> <s> And yet, they strive to worship certain things that lack sense. </s> <s> And while they believe they are showing some form of respect to the saints by worshipping images, they are actually extending a kind of communion to divine worship alone. </s> <s> Because only God should be worshipped, and martyrs or any saints should be venerated rather than worshipped, as we have already said in this work and as affirmed by the excellent teachings of Jerome. </s> <s> When he wrote against a certain heretic named Vigilantius, who claimed that the relics of martyrs should not be venerated, he said among other things, "Whoever, oh insane head, has ever worshipped the martyrs?" </s> <s> So, according to his judgment, martyrs are not worshipped, and much less should their images be worshipped by the faithful. </s> </p>
<p>As for what is read in the book of Kings about Saul worshipping Samuel, who was raised by a witch, it can be understood that it was not Samuel's soul that was raised, but rather some deceptive image of diabolic trickery that appeared to King Saul. <s> Whether in that he allowed himself to be worshipped, which a holy man would not permit, or because he told the wicked king, "Tomorrow you will be with me," meaning that the king, dying in his extreme wickedness, was not to be with the prophet, but with the devil. </s> <s> The devil, who entices people to commit evil deeds in this world, drags them with him to eternal punishment in the future. </s> <s> Thus, the king, hearing of his immense guilt...</s> </p></speak>
