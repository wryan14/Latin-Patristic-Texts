From the tribe of Judah. This is the one about whom the Israelites have foretold with the voice of Genesis 49:9: "Judah is a lion's cub. You have gone up to the prey, my son," meaning he went to the cross to plunder hell; resting, he lay down like a lion, meaning in the tomb; and like a lioness, who will rouse him? Because by the power of the Father, he rose from the dead on the third day.

By the power of the Father, he was raised, as the Apostle says, "God raised him on the third day and made him manifest, not to all the people." I ask, Saint John, who rested on the chest of the Mediator between God and humans, drawing from the source of eternal light, where you offer daily cups of ambrosial nectar to the minds of Christians, if you know where the lineage of this Bezalel, whose type the ancient legal Bezalel once bore, comes from.

        <s>Therefore, paintings or images created by the work of anyone are not to be likened to his works.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Since this new Bezalel, who is indeed the Redeemer of the human race, possessed the spirit of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, who is certainly of one substance with the Father and the Son and proceeds from the Father and the Son, as testified by the prophet Isaiah.</s>

        <s>The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might.</s>
    </p>


  <p>
    <s>The spirit of knowledge and devotion will fill him, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord will fill him.</s>
    <s>The same Lord said through the prophet: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for He has anointed me.</s>
    <s>This is what He does with gold and silver, making ornaments for the tabernacle, that is, holy men shining with gold, meaning inner understanding, and shining with silver, meaning adorned with divine words.</s>

  <p>
    <s>And, so to speak, having gold in their hearts as it is said, "With the heart, one believes unto righteousness," and silver in the confession of the mouth as it is said, "With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation," in the tabernacle of God, which is the holy church, set to transition to the eternal homeland.</s>
    <s>These two things, gold and silver, meaning faith and confession, were sought by the Apostle when he said, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart."</s>

    <s>Concerning this wisdom, it is also said through Solomon: "Blessed is the man who finds wisdom."</s>
  </p>


<p>Wisdom flows abundantly, its acquisition is better than trading in silver and gold from the start. Its fruits are more precious than all riches, and everything that is desired cannot compare to this.</p>
<break time="500ms" />
<p>Therefore, since the brilliance of the divine words is understood in silver, it must be approved by the testimony of the psalmist who says: "The words of the Lord are pure words, silver tested in a furnace of earth, purified seven times" (Psalm 12:6). To perform the work, Beseleel is given Aehisama as an assistant. Who does this Aehisama, who helps Christ, signify but the holy apostles and apostolic men? Indeed, through their dedication to preaching and exemplifying good works, they make people shine in the embrace of the church and lead them to the eternal homeland, thus becoming helpers of Christ. Of whom it was said: "We are God's helpers, you are God's field, God's building" (1 Corinthians 3:9).</p>
<break time="500ms" />
<p>All these things, being full of allegorical meanings and figures presented by the lawgiver, are not only foolish but also utterly insane to compare them to images crafted by any artisan according to the limits of their own understanding and abilities.</p>

<p>XVII. It is incorrect to think that those who say: "According to Moses' legitimate tradition, the people are commanded to put purple and blue threads on the fringes, on the edges of the garments as a reminder" (Numbers 15:38). A correct reading of this is found in Exodus 28:33.</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      The command to keep the precepts, for us, is greatly enhanced by seeing the lives of holy men depicted in pictures and by imitating their faith according to apostolic tradition.
    </s>
    <s>
      This entire chapter should be considered in parts, and each part should be addressed individually, because, although it aims at a single error, it is composed of many individual errors.
    </s>
    <s>
      First, we must discuss why they mentioned the color hyacinth in the same chapter, when clearly purple is one color and hyacinth is another.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as it cannot be rightly said that red is white or that white is red, or if someone were to say silver gold or golden silver, so too it cannot be rightly said that purple is hyacinth, just as it cannot be said that the hyacinth is purple, because such a reciprocal derivation cannot remain valid and unshaken.
    </s>
    <s>
      Indeed, as we have said before, hyacinth is one color and purple is another, as evidenced by the law given by the Lord through Moses, which distinctly designates these four: hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, for making the garments of the priest and other items to be offered for the sanctuary.
    </s>
    <s>
      Our ancestors said that these four materials represent the four elements from which the world and the human body are made, and they taught that each symbolically suggests virtues.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, they refer hyacinth to the air.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
The color itself indicates, just as scarlet adapts to fire, purple is suited to water, because it takes its dye from the water, and linen to the earth, because it comes from the earth.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we must also discuss the matter that they try to justify the use of images by the example of blue fringes, especially since the old law commands these fringes to be placed on the edges of garments as a symbol, but does not command anywhere in the sacred texts of either the Old or New Testament that these images be placed in shrines to be worshipped. This error cannot be supported by this example, since it was commanded by the legislator to symbolize certain hidden meanings, and a well-ordered and well-executed practice cannot be so mistakenly appropriated.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the Lord, through Moses, added to the commandments of the law: Deuteronomy 6:8: <sub alias="tie">Tie</sub> them on your hand, and they shall be a sign before your eyes. We spiritually fulfill this by holding them immovably in our hands and meditating on them day and night, as Psalm 1:2 says, carrying them before our eyes. He also commanded that there be blue fringes at the four corners of garments, either to distinguish the people of Israel, so that they might be a sign in clothing as circumcision is a sign in the body, or so that we, who are the spiritual Israel, as Isaiah 61:10 and 2 Peter 1:10 say, may have righteousness and holy conduct as our garment, with the ends adorned with blue fringes, so that our life may be instructed by the testimonies of the Holy Scriptures.
</p>
<p>
This, then, is the good use of fringes and well ordered by the legislator.
</p>


<p>
Whether it was for the Israelites on a physical level or for us on a spiritual level, it was granted well but misused by them rather than properly maintained.
</p>
<p>
In the Gospel, the Truth says about them: "For they widen their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels." Whose example are they following, if not the Pharisees, who love to be called Rabbi by people and seek the first greetings in the marketplace and the best seats in the synagogues?
</p>
<p>
While they desire the praise of vanity, they want their words and actions to be called red that is white and white that is red.
</p>
<p>
They twist good traditions by magnifying them wrongly, and they exalt well-made images by worshipping them inappropriately. They think they follow Moses' commandments by enlarging their tassels, and these think they please all the saints by worshipping images.
</p>
<p>
Although they go on different paths and follow different practices in different ways, they end up in the same error.
</p>


<p>
They are known to aim for determined madness, and rightly so, since the causes or efficacy of these effects are nothing but the glory of empty praise or arrogance.
</p>
<p>
So, to discuss more clearly the error of this most vain chapter, which we proposed to examine, it is necessary to repeat the text in order: <break time="0.5s"/> "They chatter, 'If according to Moses' lawful tradition, the people are commanded to put a purple fringe on the edges of their garments as a reminder and observance of the precepts, much more should we see the outcome of holy men's conduct through a similar painting.'"
</p>
<p>
This phrase, 'much more,' related to 'commanded,' should be understood as: 'if the people are commanded, much more should we.' This can have no sense at all, since not only is it much more not commanded, but it is not even equally commanded, nor does this error seem to be commanded anywhere.
</p>
<p>
As for what they say: 'through a similar painting to see the outcome of holy men's conduct,' the absurdity and madness of this are almost infinite to pursue, since in the images the virtue of holy conduct cannot be seen, but only the material from which these images are formed. Can the virtues and the marks of merit, which were certainly in the subject, that is, in the soul, be seen in these as if in some subject, when in these there is no soul that can be a subject for virtues, but in these subjects, that is, in the material body?
</p>


<p>
<s>As long as there are colors, virtues, however, cannot be in the subject or in the object?</s> 
<s>Can we then see wisdom and eloquence in these, which many of them possessed?</s>
<s>Can we perceive prudence in these, through which the recognition of true faith and the knowledge of divine things was in them, through which that threefold kind of understanding in divine books is understood by the wise?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The first is, by which certain things are taken historically with the enigmatic or allegorical figures set aside, as is the Decalogue of the law.</s>
<s>The second, by which certain things in the Scriptures are taken mystically both according to the faith of events and also according to the figure of allegorical senses, like the rock, cf. Ex. 17, 6.</s>
<s>from which the lawgiver drew out streams, and historically it was a rock and gushed out waters, and allegorically it represented Christ, who, being a stone laid in the foundation of Zion, cf. Is. 28, 16.</s>
<s>satisfies the minds of believers with the honeyed cup of spiritual life.</s>
<s>1 Cor. 10, 4.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The third kind is that which is understood only spiritually, as in the Song of Songs, cf. Cant. 1:1, in which nothing is taken historically, but only spiritually.</s>

  <p>
    Can justice be seen in these things, through which the saints feared God, revered religion, sought to help everyone, and harm no one, embraced the bonds of brotherly love, took on the dangers of others, or even helped the needy, repaid the goodness received, or preserved fairness in judgments? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Can their strength be observed in the colors of the painters, through which they bore great adversities with equanimity, patiently yielded to these, and bravely resisted temptations, through which they fled from biting riches and the desire for glory, and were neither broken by adversities nor elevated by successes, being armored with fortitude for labor, prepared for dangers against the wicked, yielding to no troubles?
  </p>
  <p>
    Can their temperance be discerned in these images, through which they moderated the desires of the flesh and restrained their appetite? Since none of these things we mentioned can be seen in these images, it is a great boldness to say: 'in the depicted picture, see the end of the conversation of the saints'.
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows in the same very vain chapter 'and imitate their faith according to apostolic tradition'. Is their faith, which according to the Apostle works through love, depicted in images?
  </p>


<p>It can be imitated? Just as the "outcome of the way of life of the saints" cannot be seen in these, neither can faith be imitated, because what they lack cannot be seen in these nor imitated through these. Everything that lacks life lacks sense. Everything that lacks sense lacks faith. Therefore, everything that lacks life lacks faith. For since hope, faith, and charity are of an invisible and incorporeal quality according to the nature of their substance, in a true person who has them, they cannot be seen, unless perhaps they are shown in deeds; for their seat, like that of other virtues, is in the soul, which is evidently invisible. And if in a true person who indeed has them, they cannot be seen, much less can they be seen in a painted one, who not only lacks these, as we have said, but also lacks life. And if they cannot be seen in these, much less can they be imitated. Hence it is understood that the faith of those who say they will imitate the faith through images of the saints is in vain.</p>
<p>Now truly, because they say: "according to apostolic tradition," let them show where it was handed down either by examples or words from the apostles to "see the outcome of the way of life of the saints and imitate their faith" through images. Thus, the Apostle demonstrates the outcome of the way of life of the saints when he says: "All the saints died according to faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar, greeted them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth," or when he says: "The saints through faith conquered kingdoms."</p>


<p>
They worked for justice, received promises, extinguished the force of fire, recovered from illness, became strong in battle, and so on. So, what should we imitate? The Apostle <phoneme ph="ˈɛf">Eph</phoneme> shows it very clearly when he says: "Be imitators of God, like beloved children;" and in another place, he says: "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ."
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is clear that this is an apostolic tradition: not to see the 'end of the holy way of life and their faith' in paintings, but in virtues, and to imitate them not in the colors of images, but in good deeds.
</p>
<p>
XVIII. How vain is the hope of those who place their salvation in images, saying: "Just as the Israelite people were saved by looking at the bronze serpent, so we will be saved by looking at the likenesses of the saints."
</p>
<p>
The hope of those who place their salvation in images is rejected by the Apostle, who argued that hope should be placed not in things that are seen, but in things that are unseen. For he says: "Hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience."
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      When the Lord instructed Moses to make the bronze serpent and set it up high, it was not placed there to be worshipped but to temporarily counteract the venomous bites of fiery serpents.
    </s>
    <s>
      Those who believe they can be healed by looking at man-made images are deceived by false hope, just like the Israelites were healed by looking at the bronze serpent from the deadly bites of those pests.
    </s>
    <s>
      Especially since the Lord commanded Moses to make the serpent, while the creation of these images is not instructed by any Scripture text.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      So, what did that serpent represent, which healed those bitten by serpents when they looked at it?
    </s>
    <s>
      We know from our Redeemer’s own teaching, who said: "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up."
    </s>
    <s>
      When we diligently look at Him with the eyes of our hearts, we overcome the deadly temptations of evil spirits and avoid the dangers of eternal death.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Furthermore, just as the words of divine law spoken by the Holy Spirit in the law, prophets, gospels, or apostles are often misunderstood by heretics with perverse intentions, many things established or done by the fathers for our benefit over long periods have been misinterpreted and perverted by their descendants.
    </s>
    <s>
      This is similar to what has been said about phylacteries and fringes, or even the bronze serpent we now discuss, which, as we mentioned earlier, was temporarily made to heal those bitten by serpents.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>It was beneficial for the people, and it was necessary,</s>
    <s>through whom later arose the most insolent practice of the high places.</s>
    <s>When King Hezekiah, the righteous king, saw that incense was being burned and certain rituals were being performed, and that the people were largely endangered by such a great error, he did not hesitate to break it apart, knowing that it had been established by the lawgiver for progress and seeing that the people celebrated it with vain worship and superstitious religion.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, the praise of the same Hezekiah, the most holy king, for removing vain superstitions and breaking apart the bronze serpent, is recorded in the holy writings as follows:</s>
    <s>“Hezekiah did what was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.</s>
    <s>He destroyed the high places, broke the statues, and cut down the groves.</s>
    <s>He also broke apart the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for up to that time the children of Israel burned incense to it, and he called it Nehushtan.</s>
    <s>He trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among those who were before him.</s>
    <s>He clung to the Lord and did not depart from following Him but kept His commandments, which the Lord had commanded Moses.</s>
    <s>The Lord was with him; wherever he went, he prospered.”</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Furthermore, these and similar superstitions, which some believe they are doing out of love for God, such as those who light lamps and adore images out of love for the saints, are addressed in this way by the blessed Jerome, when discussing the fringes and phylacteries of the Pharisees.</s>

<s>cf. Matthew</s>
<s>they have indeed a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge - still do these things today, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel.</s> 
<s>Now those who believe that they will be saved by viewing images, just as the Israelite people were healed from serpent bites by looking at the serpent,</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>if some physical ailment happens to come upon them, they should turn to the images and look at them, so that,</s> 
<s>when they are not healed by viewing them, they may return to the Lord and believe that they will receive healing through the intercessions of the saints, who</s>

</p>
<p>
<s>XIX. It is a great audacity to say: 'As the tables and two cherubim were given to the Jews, so the cross and images of saints have been given to us Christians for writing and adoration.'</s>
<s>We are often compelled to say in this work that neither the tables nor the two cherubim nor other such things were made for adoration in the Old Testament.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    They are believed to have existed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Those people, indeed, leave the path of moderation and righteousness and go beyond what order demands. They raise these things up, claiming they were meant for worship, but they go beyond what the matter requires by wanting to equate images with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    When they say: <s> "Just as the tablets of the covenant and the two cherubim were given to the Jews, so we Christians have been given the cross and the images of the saints for worship and teaching," </s> what else are they doing but exalting images and diminishing the things of Christians? Especially when they say that those under the law had two cherubim made by Moses, from between whom God spoke, but we who are under grace have crosses made by any craftsman; that those who followed the shadow of the law had tablets of the covenant containing the Decalogue, but we who follow the truth, which is Christ, have works made by various artisans; that those who received the spirit of servitude in fear had things made by Moses under God's instruction, but we who have received the spirit of adoption, in which we cry out: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈæbə">Abba</phoneme>, Father, have images made by any painter, taught only by worldly skill.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we, who do not follow the letter that kills but the spirit that gives life, who are not the carnal but spiritual Israel, who, despising the visible, contemplate the invisible, do not only have images but greater mysteries.
  </p>


<p>We rejoice that we have received from the Lord symbols of mysteries greater and more prominent than the tablets themselves or the two cherubim. While the tablets and two cherubim were examples of things to come, and while the Jews had physical things which were prefigurations of future events, we have them spiritually in truth, those things which were prefigured by the physical examples.</p>
<p>Just as the body surpasses the shadow, truth surpasses the image, and the accomplished event surpasses the figure, so does the New Testament surpass the old. For the old Testament was dedicated by Moses, after reading all the commands of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the book itself and all the people saying, "This is the blood of the Testament which God has commanded to you." But the new Testament was dedicated by the Redeemer of the world, our Lord Jesus Christ, who, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me." Likewise, after dinner, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new Testament in my blood, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins."</p>
<p>In the old, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer were sprinkled.</p>


<p>
<s>When the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean,</s> 
<s>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In that time, a lamb was sacrificed for each family, and its meat was used to celebrate Passover.</s> 
<s>But now, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, who is the true unblemished lamb, is sacrificed for us.</s> 
<s>The Apostle says: "Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In the past, God promised the kingdom of the Canaanites and the abundance of physical things.</s> 
<s>But now, He grants eternal life and the kingdom of heaven.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Back then, the promise was a land flowing with milk and honey.</s> 
<s>Now, He promises a heavenly homeland, where no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has conceived.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Back then, new moons and their beginnings were celebrated.</s> 
<s>Now, we receive a new creation in Christ, as testified by Paul, the chosen vessel, who said: "If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In the past, the Sabbath rest was observed.</s> 
<s>Now, true rest is found in Christ, who said: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>In this holy sacrifice, the flesh and blood of Christ are offered, which were symbolized by those animals.</s>
    <s>In that time, the heavy yoke of the law imposed on the necks made them servants.</s>
    <s>In this time, the light yoke of Christ and the easy burden through the spirit of adoption make them children.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Given these circumstances, it is perverse and beyond perverse that, in an alternating and reversed order, the superior is given to the inferior and vice versa, and the use of images is so magnified that the matters of Christians are somewhat diminished.</s>

He made the size of the two cherubim larger and grander. This action signifies that after the Lord's incarnation, the church would be expanded by the gathering of different nations and united with the heavenly citizens. These citizens praise the creator for the gift of blessedness given to them, rejoicing somewhat in our salvation and our introduction to the same blessedness.

Tarasius' name here is incorrectly derived from "to disturb."
</p>
<p>
For cherubim, as the prophet Ezekiel very clearly demonstrates, is a term of angelic dignity. In singular, it is cherub, and in plural, it is cherubim. Hence, it is not inappropriate in the figure.

  <p> 
    The cherubim, which were made in the sanctuary, are understood to be the ministries of the gospel. They stand by their Creator in heaven, rejoicing in their everlasting blessedness. 
    <s> They extend their wings over the ark, giving praise to the Lord Savior for every good thing they have received. </s> 
    <s> They extend their other wings to the walls of the sanctuary, rejoicing when they see holy people among them, touching them with the tips of their wings. </s> 
    <s> They celebrate these people as companions and followers of their purity in this life. </s> 
    <s> They touch both walls with their wings, embracing the faithful from both the Jewish and Gentile peoples in the heavenly hall. </s> 
  </p> 
  <p> 
    This does not mean that there is a physical distinction between the two peoples in that homeland, but that the joy of internal blessedness is greater from the fellowship of gathered brotherhood. 
    <s> Thus, the cherubim extend their wings to both walls of the sanctuary, rejoicing in the vision of the righteous from both peoples, also magnifying their own glory to praise the Creator. </s> 
  </p> 
  <p> 
    The heavenly hosts not only rejoice in the happiness of the righteous people they have with them, but they also care for us, who still cry out to the Lord from the depths. 
    <s> As the cherubim are well described in the book of Chronicles: "They stood on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the outer house." </s> 
    <s> The cherubim stood on their feet because they never... </s> 
  </p> 


<p>On the path of truth, where soon after they were created, they were thought to have strayed in some way. Their faces were turned towards the outer house because they want to reach their desired companionship after rescuing us from the trials of this pilgrimage.</p>
<p>So, they stood with their feet upright, wings extended to the walls of the oracle adorned with gold, and their faces turned towards the outer house. This is because angels constantly maintain their innocence. They rejoice in the happiness of the holy souls in heaven and do not cease to help the chosen ones they see still wandering on earth until they too are brought to the heavenly homeland.</p>
<p>It is also possible, as we have already discussed in the previous chapter, that the two cherubim represent the two Testaments. Therefore, they were made in the oracle because in the divine plan, which is inaccessible and incomprehensible to us, it was decided before the ages when and how and by which authors the Holy Scriptures would be composed.</p>
<p>They were made from olive wood, either because the divine books were written by men illuminated by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, or because they grant the light of knowledge with the help of the flame of God's love, which is spread in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. They are ten cubits high, because by observing the Ten Commandments of the law, they preach the service to God, showing that those who faithfully serve God will be rewarded with the heavenly kingdom.</p>


<p>
<s>
They bent their wings, because the Testaments declare that through both hardships and prosperity, they always aimed tirelessly towards the heavenly and reached it, and they demonstrate that their authors should do the same.
</s>
<s>
One cherub's wing was five cubits, and the other cherub's wing was also five cubits, because in all the variety of passing things, the saints extend all their bodily senses in obedience to their Creator, always keeping their eyes on Him.
</s>
<s>
Desiring to hear His voice of praise and to recount all His wonders, having His words in their mouths sweeter than honey and honeycomb, running in the scent of His ointments, and as long as they have breath in them and the spirit of God in their nostrils, not speaking iniquity with their lips nor uttering foolishness with their tongues, thus walking with the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left to receive the heavenly reward.
</s>
<s>
The supreme father of the family promised this reward to the laborers of His vineyard.

Because the work was one in the two cherubim, it indicated that the writers of both instruments served God with the same purity of work and devotion of love, with one and harmonious voice.

    With faith, they preach what the New Testament tells about the Lord's incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension, the calling of the nations, the expulsion of the Jews, and the multifaceted tribulations of the church. The same things are foretold by the Old Testament, if properly understood. It boldly predicts the coming of the Antichrist, the end of the world, the judgment day, and the eternal glory of the good and the punishment of the wicked, in agreement with both Testaments' truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inner wings of the cherubim touched each other over the ark, because the Testaments agree with equal testimony about the Lord. Similarly, one of their outer wings touched one wall and the other wing touched the opposite wall. The Old Testament was written specifically for the ancient people of God, while the New Testament is for us who came to faith after the Lord's incarnation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are rightly compared to the second wall, that is, the northern wall, because it was given to us to recognize the truth after the darkness and shadows of idolatry. For although the early church blossomed mainly from the Jews, and it is believed that all Israel will be saved at the end of the world, most of the faithful of our time are gathered from the nations to receive the sacraments of the gospel.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was divinely granted to them to clearly understand with the eyes of their hearts that the letter of the Old Testament is full of the mysteries of evangelical grace. The cherubim have their faces turned towards the outer house, because we, who are still standing outside, do not yet...

            XXII. That the worship given to the prophet Nathan towards King David is not equal to the worship given to images.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is not necessary to prove with many documents that the worship which the prophet Nathan exhibited towards David, the equally prophetic and most holy king, is not equal to the worship which some exhibit towards images, because it is clearly proven by the most evident indications.
        </s>
    </p>


<p>
This matter is so clear and evident that it doesn’t need our discussion. But so that it doesn’t seem like we’re ignoring it in silence, let’s briefly go over it.
</p>
<p>
Nathan worshipped, as I said, not the image crafted with the colors of paint, but the power elevated by God to the height of kingship. Just as he was satisfied with the divine gift from heaven, so would he be who was to say: Be subject to all higher authorities. For there is no authority except from God.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, whoever resists authority resists God’s ordinance. Those who resist will bring judgment upon themselves because rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from it. For it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God’s servant to carry out wrath on the wrongdoer. So, be subject not only because of wrath but also because of conscience. This is why you also pay taxes, for they are God’s servants.
</p>


<p>So, pay everyone what you owe them: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. Don't owe anything to anyone except to love one another.</p>
<p>In this matter, the chosen vessel instructed his disciple Titus through the Holy Spirit in the same way: Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, to speak ill of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.</p>
<p>The prophet, filled with the Holy Spirit, thus worshipped the king, also filled with the Holy Spirit, relying on the gift of prophecy, adorned with the insignia of merit. He did not worship him with some senseless act of superstitious vanity, but as a man found according to the Lord's heart, a man anointed with sacred oil, a man highly exercised in the praises of God, a man who surpassed all in prophesying about Christ's incarnation, passion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven; a man who not only prophesied the coming of God's Son but also prefigured Him; a man who not only prefigured Him but also served according to the form of a servant, with the affection of love, humility of service, due respect of preeminence, and dutiful worship. If he did not honor him by submitting to him and obeying his instructions...</p>


<p>
<s>It would seem contrary to the Spirit who, through Peter, the shepherd of the church, was to say: Submit yourselves to every human authority for the Lord's sake, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.</s> 
<s>For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.</s> 
<s>Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's slaves.</s> 
<s>Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.</s>
