<s>Chapter 31: Those who go against the command of the Lord's voice are those who curse their parents, and if their ancestors were heretics according to their opinion, they were born from, taught by, and consecrated by heretics.</s>
<s>Or: About not judging those who have departed from this world; or: How much their error differs from their parents' error, since those broke images while these deem it right to worship them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Finally, those who dare to compare these things with the body and blood of the Lord are so driven by their love for them that they do not hesitate to curse their parents, who are known to have despised them, linking error to error, since that is also inappropriate for them.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    Let them show proper worship and not bring unnecessary condemnation to those from whom they have descended through the flesh, or to those through whom they have received consecration, baptism, and other spiritual gifts. For if, according to their madness, all who lack the worship of images are heretics, it is clear that their ancestors, who did not worship them, were heretics. If they were heretics, they had no power to perform consecrations or to lay hands. If they did not have this power, then those who think they received it from them do not have consecration or the laying on of hands. Likewise, if their predecessors, as they say, were worthy of the bond of anathema, they did not have the power to bind and loose. If they did not have this power, all things done by them in the church must be nullified. If everything must be rejected, then ranks and ordinations must be rejected. Therefore, if their predecessors were worthy of the bond of anathema, their ranks and ordinations must be nullified. For we read that the power to bind and loose was given by the Lord to suitable and Catholic persons, not to those bound by schism and anathema.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, honoring parents is taught not only by legal, prophetic, and apostolic admonition but also by evangelical admonition, as the Lord says: "Honor your father and your mother." For He taught this both through the writings of the Old Testament and through His bodily presence.
  </p>


<p>He gave the same commandment that Moses proclaimed, saying: <lang xml:lang="la">Benedictus, qui honorat patrem suum et matrem suam</lang>; and conversely: <lang xml:lang="la">Maledictus, qui non honorat patrem suum et matrem suam</lang>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it must be considered and greatly noted how arrogant and reckless, and, so to speak, criminal it is to curse one's parents, if the one who is proven not to honor them is subject to a curse. For when the law says: <lang xml:lang="la">Non reveles turpitudinem patris tui</lang> and the Apostle says: <lang xml:lang="la">Filii, obedite parentibus vestris</lang>, they seem to resist both commandments, neither attempting to conceal disgrace nor to bestow honor.</p>
<p>Thus, the sacred canons, excluding all exceptions, appear to have issued this sentence: Whoever departs from their parents under the pretext of divine worship and does not show them due reverence, let them be anathema. If those who do not show due reverence to them are anathematized, how much more, do you think, are those who curse their parents bound by the chains of damnation?</p>
<p>For it is a most wholesome practice handed down by the holy fathers of the church to pray for the spirits of the departed.</p>


  <p>
    <s>We pray to the Lord, embracing Him with all the saints and the entire universal Church.</s> 
    <s>We ask for the Lord's most merciful kindness not only for our parents but also for our faithful friends who have preceded us in the peace of the Lord.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>To this venerable and ecclesiastical tradition, those who seem to oppose it do not support the spirits of their deceased parents with prayers but try to bind them with curses.</s> 
    <s>Even those who are instructed by apostolic teachings to pray for their enemies hesitate to do this for their parents.</s> 
    <s>Following the ecclesiastical practice, we ask for forgiveness for our parents through prayers and acts of charity, while they wish punishment upon theirs through futile assemblies.</s> 
    <s>We seek peace for our parents through the solemnity of the Mass, while they heap insults upon theirs through disordered councils.</s> 
    <s>We remember our parents in prayer while they cast anathema upon theirs with a certain renunciation.</s> 
    <s>We pray for our parents to find rest in the bosom of Abraham, while they wish condemnation upon theirs with Arius, Sabellius, Dioscorus, Nestorius, and Eutyches.</s> 
    <s>We ask for our parents to be placed among the ranks of the blessed, while they place theirs among the obstinate crowds of heretics.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Given these circumstances, it is clear they commit a dual offense in this matter.</s> 
    <s>They both dishonor their parents against the command of the Lord and, against the Apostle's teaching, act recklessly towards those who have departed from this world.</s>
  </p>


<p>
No one among us lives for themselves, and no one dies for themselves. 
<s> For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. </s> 
<s> So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. </s> 
<s> This is why Christ died and came to life again: to be the Lord of both the living and the dead. </s> 
<s> But you, why do you judge your brother, or why do you despise your brother? </s> 
<s> For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat. </s> 
<s> It is written: "As surely as I live," says the Lord, "every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God." </s> 
<s> So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God. </s> 
<s> Therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another. </s> 
<s> Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> The holy leaders of the Roman church also affirm this: </s> 
<s> Do not cause any offense in the church by trying to judge those who have already passed away, as we cannot do this. </s> 
<s> Let your tranquility recognize this necessity. </s> 
<s> Therefore, neither should children dishonor their parents, nor should the living judge the dead rashly. </s>
</p>


<p>
These are the pages of the divine Scriptures.
</p>
<p>
Now, with the eye of the mind, it must be carefully considered how much the error of the children differs from the error of the parents in the abolition or veneration of the above-mentioned images. Errors from both sides continue to contradict each other. For the former believed that these images should be torn down and despised with perpetual rejection by the church, while the latter not only kept them but also sought to venerate them with humble adoration.
</p>
<p>
The former handed them over to crackling fires, while the latter honored them with fragrant incense. The former avoided even seeing them, while the latter did not cease to embrace them. The former dug out those placed on the walls of the church by the ancients for decoration, while the latter examined those newly established with offered lights. The former strove to utterly abhor them, while the latter decreed to wholly kiss them. The former anathematized those who kept them, while the latter, on the contrary, anathematized those who did not adore them. 
</p>
<p>
Since these two evils are contrary to each other and far from the right path, it remains for us to walk the royal way according to the Apostle, not turning to the right or the left. Let us judge that they should neither be utterly abolished like the former nor adored like the latter, but only adore God and venerate His saints according to the ancient tradition of the fathers and the church.
</p>
<p>
Let us keep these images in the church as decoration and memory of past events, if desired, and with justice, reject severity on one side and flattery on the other, with prudence, avoiding cunning on one side and dullness on the other.

The ones preceding it take away its flight, and those following deprive it of walking, so that, by the sword of spiritual understanding and the divine word, the wings, by which it was thought to be carried excessively, are cut off. And its own senses, which were forced to wander violently in others, are restored, and with the strong and unassailable force of the Catholic faith's fist, the empty and irrational assertions are shattered. And lacking suitable senses and the testimonies of divine scriptures, it appears weakened to everyone.

Not everyone believes this to be well-arranged, because, while it intends to elevate its authors' praise to a high mark, it does not fear to disrupt the prosperity of domestic matters with civil strife.

    Everything divine in the flesh became human, and likewise, everything human became divine. This means that both the divine and human substances seemed to be emptied and changed from their original state. This confusion made it look like both substances were imperfect, both God and human, in the Son, and neither truly held to their own nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we say that the Son of God took on our suffering nature while the divine nature remained unaffected. The Son experienced everything the Scriptures say: hunger, thirst, weariness, pain, death, and similar things. He suffered in the way that was possible for him, not according to his divine nature, but according to the human nature he took on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Son of God is impassible like the Father, incomprehensible like the Father, invisible like the Father, and unchangeable like the Father. Even though the Son, the Word of God, took on a suffering human, his divine nature did not suffer. The entire Trinity remains impassible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the Son of God died according to the Scriptures in the way that was possible for him to die. He rose on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father, maintaining the nature of the flesh in which he was born, suffered, and rose again. The human substance was not emptied but glorified and remains forever with God.

We condemn those who reject salvation or those who denounce first marriages with a Manichean or second marriages with a Cataphrygian.

<p>
We also condemn those who say that the Son of God lied out of necessity due to the flesh and that he could not do everything he wanted because he took on human form.

We also condemn the heresy of the Jovinians, who say there will be no distinction of merits in the future, and that we will possess there the virtues which we neglected to have here.
</p>
<p>
We confess that free will exists, but we say that we always need God's help, and we condemn both those who say with the Manicheans that humans cannot avoid sinning and those who, like the Jovinians, claim that humans cannot sin. Both take away the liberty of free will.
</p>
<p>
We assert that humans can always both sin and avoid sinning, so we always confess the freedom of will.

This is the true integrity of the faith of Catholic tradition, which we sincerely believe and confess. In this work, we have outlined this in the words of the blessed Jerome. This is the true faith, this is the confession we keep and hold. Whoever keeps this confession unwavering and undefiled will have eternal salvation.

Tarasius attempted to correct one error with another, and having fallen from one sickness to another, he tried to remedy his sudden promotion from layman to bishop by advocating the adoration of images, which he admitted in his hasty acceptance of consecration.

<s>And if illegal things could be strengthened by other illegal things, then impure things could very easily be cleansed by other impure things.</s> 
<s>However, impure things cannot be cleansed by other impure things.</s>

</p>


    <p>And since, clearly, it is both useless to worship images and to take up the bishop's throne without proper order.</p> 
    <p>But why talk about these things?</p>
    <p>Let's go to the Apostle, let's come to the chosen vessel, and ask the excellent preacher!</p>
    <p>Let him thunder to us what he thinks about the ordination of a bishop!</p>
    <p>Without a doubt, he will respond: <sub alias="Do not be quick to lay hands on anyone">Don't be quick to lay hands on anyone</sub>. And again: <sub alias="Not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil">Not a new convert, lest they fall into the same condemnation as the devil due to pride</sub>. So that, while they think they have taken up not so much the ministry of humility but the administration of secular power, they are cast down by the same pride as the devil through arrogance.</p>
    <p>Hence, such an ordination is very dangerous, in which the judgment of the devil is suspected. And it is most fearful for its doctrine, which considers the worship of images, where such a terrible example of ruin is feared.</p>
    <p>For it is forbidden for a layperson to fulfill the teaching office of the priesthood, whom it is believed neither held the office nor understood the discipline, and to teach those things which it is clear they have not learned before.</p>
    <p>About such an ordination, this is the opinion of blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome: Some, inflated by the desire for honor, are tonsured after the death of bishops and suddenly become priests from laypeople and rashly take up the leadership of a religious purpose, who have not yet learned to be soldiers. What do we think they will offer to their subjects, who, before they reach the threshold of discipleship, do not fear to hold the place of a teacher?</p>


<p>
<s>It is necessary, therefore, even if each person is blameless in merit, that they first be exercised in distinct ecclesiastical duties.</s>
<s>This is so that they learn what to teach, be informed about what to hold, and not make mistakes later when chosen to show the way to those who err.</s>
<s>Therefore, let them be fortified by religious meditation, so they may please God.</s>
<s>And thus, like a lamp placed on a stand, let their light shine, so that the opposing winds do not extinguish the flame of their learning but increase it.</s>
<s>For it is written, 'Let them first be tested, and then let them serve.'</s>
<s>Much more should they be tested beforehand, who are taken as intercessors for the people, so that the priests do not become a cause of the people's downfall.</s>
<s>Therefore, there can be no excuse or defense against this, because it is clearly known to all what diligence and holy concern the excellent teacher has in allowing a novice to enter sacred orders.</s>
<s>Just as back then a novice was called one who was newly planted in the practice of holy faith, now a novice is one who suddenly creeps into the habit of religion to seek sacred honors.</s>
<s>Therefore, one must approach order by order.</s>
<s>One does not rightly aspire to a sacred rank if they seek to reach the highest positions bypassing the steps.</s>
<s>And the same Apostle teaches among other instructions of the sacred order, 'Do not lay hands on anyone hastily.'</s>
</p>


<p>
Is there anything faster or more hasty than appointing someone to a position before they are prepared, like making someone a bishop before they are even a teacher? Against the norms of ecclesiastical institution, this is what happened when the previously mentioned Tarasius was elevated to the priestly rank. Instead of governing the people, he disturbed them. It's no wonder that someone who didn't reach the office of preaching correctly doesn't preach correctly.
</p>
<p>
Many testimonies from the holy fathers could be provided about his improper consecration, but they are omitted here for brevity. This much should suffice on this matter.
</p>
<p>
Does Tarasius think correctly, who professes in his belief that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, rather than from the Father and the Son according to the true rule of the holy faith?
</p>
<p>
We did not forget our promise at the beginning of this work, to leave nothing undiscussed and nothing passed over in silence that is found worthy of reproach in the same synod that was held for the worship of images, except perhaps what the difficulty of disordered speech denies to our understanding or what respect prevents us from addressing childish statements.
</p>


    <p>
        Our discussion should not be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, it does not follow that our discussion should be suspended because Tarasius did not believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds solely from the Father, as some do. Although they have remained silent on whether the Spirit proceeds from the Son as well, they have believed that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, just as the church universally confesses and believes. However, Tarasius professed in his faith that the Spirit proceeds 'from the Father through the Son'. If there is no purity and sincerity of heart in this profession, which would believe that the Spirit is not a creature, but the Creator, not lesser than the Father and the Son, but equal and consubstantial, and proceeding from both, a harmful error could arise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the definition of all things should be such that it eliminates all obscurities and ambiguities, aiming to provide a clear indication of the matter at hand. If the definition of other things should be so clear and lucid that it evidently demonstrates what needs to be demonstrated, then the definition of faith should be even more clear and lucid, free from all ambiguity or convolutions. If there is anything convoluted, ambiguous, or obscured by a cloud of words, it causes great loss to both the speaker and the listener.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is rightly believed and commonly confessed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, not from the Father through the Son, because it does not proceed through the Son as a creature, which was made through Him, nor as if it were later in time or lesser in power or another's.
    </p>


<p>
<s>He is believed to proceed from the Father and the Son as coeternal, consubstantial, and coequal, sharing the same glory, power, and divinity with them.</s>
<s>The preposition 'from' has one meaning, while 'through' has another.</s>
<s>Thus, the Son of God is believed to be born from a human, not through a human, meaning not through sexual intercourse or human action, but by taking flesh from a virgin.</s>
<s>And therefore, it can be questioned whether it is correct to say that the Holy Spirit proceeds 'from the Father through the Son,' lest, by incautiously using this preposition 'through' in the profession of such a great mystery, it might serve as a poisonous drink of error to anyone, like the Arian heresy, which blasphemes that the Holy Spirit is a creature created through the Son, just like other things that were created.</s>
<s>Moreover, they do not baptize according to the evangelical faith in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit but instead in the name of the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit, imparting this to those unfortunate ones who convert to them.</s>
<s>For the Holy Spirit is proven to be not a creature but the Creator by these testimonies.</s>
<s>For David says: By the word of the Lord, the heavens were made firm.</s>
</p>

    They exist, and by the breath of His mouth, all their strength is.

    And Solomon says: He created them by the Holy Spirit. Likewise David: Send forth your Spirit, and they shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth. And in the book of Job, it is written: The divine Spirit, he said, created me. And in the book of Judith: All your creatures serve you, for you spoke, and they were made; you sent your Spirit, and it built them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Such is the power and strength of the Holy Spirit that, by cooperating, he formed the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is our redemption, in the womb of the virgin, as the evangelist says: Do not be afraid, Joseph, to take Mary as your wife; for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. Also: She was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit; not that the Holy Spirit is to be called the father of our Savior, as if there were two fathers, but that the same Holy Spirit is the co-operator of the Father and the Son and is believed to be of one power with them, as the Lord affirms: Go, he said to the disciples, baptize all nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    For just as the Lord sent the apostles to preach, the Holy Spirit is declared to do likewise. For it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, that while Peter was pondering the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him: Behold, men are seeking you; rise and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them to you.

    <s>Thus, it is clearer that all the prophets announce or speak only through the Holy Spirit, as the Lord testifies, who says: When the Holy Spirit comes, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you and remind you of all things. John 14:26.</s>

While these testimonies confirm that the Creator and God is approved and proceeds from both the Father and the Son by the entire Catholic Church, it is to be questioned whether it is necessary to profess that he proceeds from the Father through the Son, rather than from the Father and the Son, as such a profession is not found either in the Nicene or Chalcedonian Creed made by the holy fathers. For through the Son, he appeared to the apostles in fire, and through the Son, he was given to humanity, since the Holy Spirit could not be received by humans except through the Son. However, professing that he proceeds from the Father through the Son is unusual in synodal confession, because the Holy Spirit, in order to proceed from the Father, does not need the help of another, as through someone.
</lang>
</p>


    <p>
        Even though the Holy Spirit is the third person in the Holy Trinity, He shares the same power and essence as the Father and the Son. While God is supreme, the Holy Spirit is also a gift to us, distributing the gifts of grace to each individual as He wills. For instance, He gives prophecies to whom He chooses and forgives sins according to His will, which cannot be done without Him. The Holy Spirit is often called love because He naturally connects with those from whom He proceeds and shows that He is one with them. He also works in us so that we remain in God and He in us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, among God's gifts, there is nothing greater than love, and the greatest gift of God is the Holy Spirit. He is grace, which is given freely according to divine will and not based on our merits. Just as the unique Word of God is properly called wisdom, universally encompassing both the Holy Spirit and the Father, the Holy Spirit is properly called love, while universally, both the Father and the Son are also love. The Spirit is indeed the Spirit of the Father, as the Lord testifies in Matthew 10:20, saying, "For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spirit is also the Spirit of the Son, as Paul testifies in Romans 8:9, saying, "Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Him." Thus, the Spirit is called the Spirit of both the Father and the Son because He proceeds from both and is proven to be of the same substance and nature. If He were said to be unbegotten, there would be two Fathers; if begotten, two Sons.
    </p>


<p>
O children, it would be said ineptly. 
But because neither the Father nor the Son, therefore neither unbegotten nor begotten, but said to proceed from both.
