<s>Therefore, when the synod was gathered, if they had acted in accordance with ecclesiastical custom, discussing necessary matters that would benefit the faithful, they would avoid all foolishness and disorderly talk.</s>
<s>They would stick to the path of moderation, neither deviating from apostolic teachings nor the institutions of ancient synods.</s>
<s>But adorning themselves with the virtues of patience and gentleness, they would not call evil good and good evil, nor call bitter sweet and sweet bitter, contrary to the prophetic word.</s>
<s>They would wisely establish necessary rules and carefully say what needs to be said. They would disregard useless and extraordinary condemnations, teaching useful things instead.</s>
<s>They would silence ambiguous or clearly useless matters, and the churches of our part or other parts of the world would follow their decrees.</s>
<s>But since it is impossible to both agree with their decrees and follow the ancient institutions of the fathers, as they are as different as light and darkness, life and death, sight and blindness, virtue and vice, purity and impurity, health and illness, their decrees differ as much from the institutions of the holy fathers.</s>
<s>Therefore, we reject the worse and content ourselves with the better, avoiding deceptive detours and desiring to follow a clear and royal path.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Where, I ask, is the most excellent...</s>
</p>


  <p>
    Where is your virtue, your gentleness? Or you, most resistant to fury and to all incitements, patience, where have you gone? Where have you disappeared, when you would see such harmful and twisted rules being created by so many priests, and see so many curses being brought upon the Church? Why did you not find refuge in at least two or three places? Why did you reject everyone? Why did you present your absence to everyone? Why did you not restrain them with the reins of your moderation from so much nonsense? Why did you not curb them with the reins of your diligence from so many delusions?
  </p>
  <p>
    Driven by boasting and the desire for hollow praise, they instigate their own lack of restraint in speech against us. All these things, like the other sources of evil, are rightly rejected by our legions, so we withdrew from them and could not stay among those we found to be overwhelmed by such errors. Indeed, there is no fellowship between light and darkness, nor any agreement between Christ and Belial, for as a wise man once said, the spirit of God, who is the commander of our army, will not inhabit a body subjected to sins. For he did not dwell among us, nor we in him, who fosters pride, because, as the words of Jesus, son of Sirach, say, pride is hateful to God and humans; the plant of the proud will not be healthy, and the root of evil sin.
  </p>


<p>So it will be rooted in them.</p> 
<p>For as much as the disciple of pride, namely the uncontrollable mouth, flourished in their council, modesty and prudence should have flourished, but not even the slightest hint of these virtues was present in such an act.</p> 
<s>By your prompting, O uncontrollable mouth, which prevents the steps of men from being directed on the land of the living, as the prophet says:</s> 
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈvɪr lɪŋˈɡwoʊsəs noʊ ˈdɪrɪɡɛrt suːˈpɛr ˈtɛrəm">Vir linguosus non dirigetur super terram</phoneme>, and whose effort does not lack sin, as it is said:
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛː ˌmʊltɪˈloːkwɪoː noʊn ɛfˈfjuːdʒɪɛs pɛkˈkaːtuːm">In multiloquio non effugies peccatum</phoneme>, but by controlling your lips you will be wise, and by which the soul is harmed according to the voice of the wise saying:
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈkwiː ˈmʊltɪs ˈuːtɪtuːr ˈwɛrbɪs ˈlɛdɪt ˈaːnɪmɑːm suːɑːm">Qui multis utitur verbis, ledit animam suam</phoneme>, and who not only answers before hearing, but also harms the holy church.


<p>Before you start condemning, you should consider this: Proverbs 18:13 says, "He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him." You are urging your followers to reject us so completely that our community cannot even leave a small impression on their minds. Following us is a mark of a good life, and rejecting us is a sign of folly.</p>
<p>According to our teacher, wisdom, the end of our journey is the beginning of life. If the one who gives laws followed our advice and kept his mind connected to our guidance, as the Scripture says, "Moses was very meek, more than all people on the face of the earth," he would not have enjoyed so many divine communications or been taught so many mysteries by the Lord.</p>
<p>It is said of him by the Lord of all things, "With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord." Therefore, patience and meekness are virtues completely cast aside by those who, in their extreme folly, gather synods to condemn the Catholic Church. They try to curse what is blessed forever with insane audacity, not considering what is written: "Nor revilers will inherit the kingdom of God."</p>
<p>We must approach them with the arm of faith, the hand of love, and the embrace of the heart in every possible way.</p>


<p>
<s>It must always be kept in mind.</s> 
<s>The psalmist says:</s> 
<s>The Lord is kind and gentle; therefore, he teaches his law to those who sin in ignorance.</s> 
<s>He guides the humble in justice and instructs the meek in his ways.</s>
<s>From this, it can be understood that those who want to be followers of the gentle Lord should not ignore gentleness.</s> 
<s>Instead, they should embrace it to be taught the ways of the Lord.</s>
<s>In Proverbs, it is also written: A gentle heart is a healer, but a wise heart is the decay of the bones.</s>
<s>It also says: Better to be humble with the meek than to share spoils with the proud.</s>
<s>In Ecclesiasticus, it is written: My son, perform your tasks with gentleness, and you will be loved by everyone.</s>
<s>Also, it says: Be gentle when listening to a word, so you may understand; and speak with wisdom, giving a true answer.</s>
<s>Moreover, Jesus, the son of Sirach, emphasizes: My son, conduct your soul with gentleness and give it the honor it deserves.</s>
<s>The teacher of the nations, in his letter to the Ephesians, writes:</s> 
<s>I urge you, as a prisoner in the Lord, to live a life worthy of the calling you have received, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love.</s>
<s>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.</s>
<s>And James the Apostle says:</s>
<s>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.</s>
<s>All these teachings keep us far from pride.</s>

<s>But now, having shown in part what they did or ought to have done, and having discussed in part their trifles, let us proceed to other things necessary for this work, with the Lord's help.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Since a woman should not teach in a synod, as it is read that Irene did in their synod.</s>
<s>Since almost in all things that synod, which was gathered for the veneration of images, opposes the most wholesome teachings of the Holy Scriptures, it seems to oppose them greatly in this part as well, that it is reported to have had a woman as an instructor or teacher, which is forbidden not only by the documents of divine law but also by the law of nature itself.</s>
<s>For she is not by sex</s>
</p>


<p>
The fragility or fickleness of the mind allows women to hold positions of teaching or leadership over men, but only as something temporary and not permanent. Therefore, it is compelled to be easily subdued and restrained by male authority. Hence, it is established by divine laws that certain vows of women can be annulled by male deliberation.
</p>
<p>
We also know that human laws dictate that unmarried women, even if they are of mature age, should remain under guardianship due to their mental lightness. For we know that a woman is usually given to a man for the sake of offspring, assistance, and to curb incontinence, but we never read that she is given for the sake of teaching.
</p>
<p>
As it is written in Genesis: And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply. This is marriage, which should be considered neither a sin according to Pelagius nor according to Jovinian.
</p>


<p>Virginity should be considered equal to birth, but it should be preferred because of the purity and integrity of the body, as the Apostle says:</p>
<p><sub alias="First Corinthians">1. Cor.</sub> 7:34, A married woman thinks about the things of the world, how to please her husband. But a virgin thinks about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit.</p>
<p>Although one might be preferred, the other should not be rejected or completely set aside, but should be sought with grace by those to whom it is appropriate. It is not extraordinary in itself and is fruitful in relation to virginity. For marriage is the seedbed of virginity, because just as grapes are known to come from the vine, so too virginity comes only from marriage.</p>
<p>And although virginity is the hundredfold fruit, it nevertheless includes the thirtyfold, which is marriage, and the sixtyfold, which is often taken to mean widows.</p>
<p>The reason for the woman's help given to the man is stated by the Lord: It is not good for man to be alone; let us make a helper suitable for him. And for the reason of incontinence, as the Apostle says: Those who cannot control themselves should marry, and again: It is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us question the Apostle! Let the excellent preacher, the chosen vessel, say whether he permits women to teach or to have authority over men. For he says to Timothy:</p>
<p><sub alias="First Timothy">1. Tim.</sub> 2:11-12, Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.</p>
<p>As if he were being asked, why?</p>


  <p>
    <s>He has prohibited her from teaching and having authority over a man.</s>
    <s>As a wise teacher, he wisely gives the reason.</s>
    <s>He says that Adam was formed first, then Eve.</s>
    <s>Adam was not deceived but the woman, being deceived, fell into transgression.</s>
    <s>Thus, so that we may know why the Apostle denied her the dignity of teaching and ruling over a man.</s>
    <s>It is because she was not created to teach, but to help man.</s>
    <s>She was not made to rule over him, but to be subject to him.</s>
    <s>She is considered to be weaker in mind and more easily tempted.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The Apostle says that man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</s>
    <s>If anyone dares to defend such an error by misinterpreting what the Apostle said about teaching and self-control, let them consider this.</s>
    <s>He allowed older women to teach prudence and good living, not some madness or tradition opposing the sacred institutions of the fathers, nor the worship of some senseless thing.</s>
    <s>He permitted this not in the church, not in public gatherings, nor in synods, but privately among domestic circles due to their age and maturity.</s>
    <s>He allowed this not for all, but for those who have a good testimony through good works, who receive guests, wash the feet of the saints, assist the afflicted, and follow every good work.</s>

      It is one thing for a mother to educate her household with words and examples,

    <s>
      When she exhorts her household, she desires the common good for them and herself.

      But in a public assembly, she seeks only empty praise and arrogance.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as the head of a man is Christ,

  </p>


<p>
<s>So, it is indeed true that the head of a woman is her husband, and therefore, according to 1 Corinthians 11, if a woman should rule over men, she would be their head.</s> 
<s>And if she is their head, then they would necessarily be the head of Christ.</s> 
<s>However, according to the Apostle, no one can be the head of Christ except the Father, who said: "The head of Christ is God," and of whom it is said in the Song of Songs: "His head is the finest gold."</s> 
<s>Therefore, a woman should not place herself above men and be their head, lest, while the inferior sex elevates itself beyond what is required by order and prefers itself to the superior sex, the head, which should surpass the other members, seeks the lowest place.</s> 
<s>And the feet, which occupy the lowest position among the prominent members, are lifted above the others, thus disturbing the natural order and perverting the laws.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For if perhaps someone tries to oppose these sacred apostolic institutions by attempting to assert that women should teach men, rule over men, and hold synods, because according to the proclamation of the gospel, women often ministered to the Mediator between God and men, sitting at his feet and listening to his word, attending to frequent ministries, wetting his feet with their tears, wiping them with their hair, anointing his body with precious ointments, and following him to his passion, and after his resurrection, returning to his tomb, then they are mistaken.</s>

      The woman, therefore, is considered to be the messenger of our Lord and Savior's resurrection because, just as a woman had made the way for him coming from heaven to earth, she also became the messenger for him returning from earth to heaven.

<s>This error, where they arrogantly boast of being 'co-workers of God', can also be corrected because asserting 'God reigns with them' and being 'co-workers of God' is not done humbly.</s>

<s>But since, as we have stated before, in the above...</s>
</p>


  <p>
    Some of the dew has been dispelled. Now let's turn to the point of our discussion: why those who are known to have been at that same synod say they were gathered. They claim, "God gathered you to establish His plan," as if Ecolus did not exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    For it is written: The one who lives forever created everything at once, and as if God had some new will that hadn't been there before, which the prophet writes about: "He established them forever and ever, gave a command, and it will not pass away," as if He needed anyone's help and therefore gathered others to decide by the deliberation of many what He should do.
  </p>
  <p>
    A plan, after all, is called a plan because it involves constant consideration of whether to do or not do something. There is a type of cause that speakers call deliberative, where they discuss what should or shouldn't be done for any benefits in life. In this type, there is persuasion and dissuasion, that is, about seeking and avoiding, doing and not doing. In persuasion, there are two stronger elements: hope and fear. Because God is almighty, He needs nothing from anyone. Therefore, He is not moved by anyone's persuasion to do what He does not want, nor is He deterred by anyone's dissuasion from what He wants to do, nor is He restrained by any fear from doing what He wants, nor encouraged by any hope to do what He does not want, nor does He establish His deliberation with another.
  </p>


<p>
<s> If God needed anything, He would experience neediness. </s>
<s> If He experienced neediness, He wouldn't be all-powerful. </s>
<s> However, He is all-powerful, so He lacks nothing. </s>
<s> Thus, it is reckless to say, "God gathered you because He wanted to establish His own counsel." </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> For the Son of God is God's counsel, and He was not established by the Father through some deliberation. </s>
<s> Instead, He was begotten before all ages by an ineffable birth, and the faithful believe that the Father begot Him and that He has always existed with the Father. </s>
<s> He is the wisdom of God the Father, which is eternal with Him, and He says, "Before the hills, I was born." </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Before He made the earth, when He prepared the heavens, I was there. </s>
<s> When He set the boundary for the sea and gave a law to the waters, I was there. </s>
</p>


<p>
<s> I was with him. </s>
<s> She also shows her exalted position with these words, saying: </s>
<s> I lived in the highest places, and my throne was in a pillar of cloud; </s>
<s> and again: </s>
<s> I alone circled the vault of heaven and walked in the waves of the sea, </s>
<s> I held sway over every nation and every people; </s>
<s> and again: </s>
<s> I spread out my branches like a terebinth tree. </s>
<s> I made the morning star rise in the sky. </s>
<s> I love all who love me. </s>
<s> For my ways lead to life. </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> About this plan, the psalmist said: </s>
<s> The Lord's plan stands forever, the thoughts of his heart through all generations. </s>
<s> It is called a plan because the mystery of his incarnation was granted to benefit humanity, a plan that is never undone but lasts forever, because the triumphant death of the Lord eternally destroyed the devil's ruin. </s>
<s> The thoughts of his heart signify the predestination of his inner judgment, in which all things are contained, both past and those to come in future generations. </s>
<s> For human plans often fail, but the Lord's plan lasts forever. </s>
<s> Mortal man thinks of fleeting things, but the eternal Lord never sets down anything that can be criticized. </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Thus, the plan they say the Lord had established through them is not believed to be from the Lord, because it is known to contradict the Lord's commandments, as shown both in the Old and New Testament pages where God declares himself alone. </s>
</p>


<p>Matthew 0.</p>
<p>They deliberate absurdly that some senseless things should be worshipped or adored. For God is not changeable, so that what He had previously forbidden, He now permits to be done. But what He established before the ages in His counsel, that is, in the Son, He always allows to be stable, as Isaiah testifies, who, speaking from the person of God the Father, says: "All my counsel shall stand, and I will do all that I have planned." Indeed, this counsel, which is the Son, is also called the testament. Therefore, Jeremiah says: "If my covenant were not with day and night, I would not have established the laws of heaven and earth." About this testament, it is said: "And the covenant of peace shall be in Jerusalem."</p>
<p>How then would God gather them to establish His counsel through them, as they dream, in which there is such knowledge that neither some past nor future things are unknown to Him, but all are present, whose substance, as it is, no opinion can reach, no definition can encompass, because it is more than anything that can be said or thought. </p>
<p>For He is a spirit, a simple nature, an inaccessible light, invisible, immeasurable, infinite, perfect, needing nothing, eternal, immortal - and truly immortal, to whom all live, from whom all things have taken their beginning, venerable, to be loved, to be feared, outside of whom nothing exists, rather in whom are all things that are above and below, the highest and the lowest, omnipotent, all.</p>


<p>Holding, truly rich in all things, because there is nothing where he is not, nor is any place absent from him, except in the hearts of the wicked, where, although he is present by power, he is not present by grace. This is proven by the testimonies of the divine law. For the psalmist says: <sub alias="Where">Quo</sub> can I go from your spirit, and where can I flee from your presence? 
</p>
<p>
If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in hell, you are there. If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. In Isaiah, it is also written: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of your glory. Through Jeremiah as well:
</p>


<p>
<s>God says, "I am a God who is near," says the Lord, "and not a God who is far away.</s> 
<s>If a person hides in secret places, I will see him.</s> 
<s>Do I not fill heaven and earth?" says the Lord.</s> 
<s>The Book of Wisdom also says, "For the spirit of wisdom is holy and does not free the one who speaks curses from his lips, because God is a witness to his inner thoughts and a true observer of his heart and a listener to his tongue, because the spirit of the Lord fills the world."</s> 
<s>In Ecclesiasticus it is also written: "For the wisdom of God is great, mighty in power, seeing all without interruption."</s> 
<s>In his kindness, he created the one who was not, in his justice, he condemned the one who sinned, in his mercy, indeed in his great mercy, he restored the one who was lost."</s> 
<s>It is said about him through the prophet: "Great are the works of the Lord, exquisite in all his desires, confession and magnificence are his work, and his justice endures forever."</s> 
<s>And again: "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth."</s> 
<s>And to whom it is said through the same prophet: "And you, Lord God, are merciful and compassionate, patient, and of great mercy and truth."</s> 
<s>Isn't he the one whom the dominions adore, the powers tremble before, and the joyful army of angels praise with heavenly hymns, whom the cherubim and seraphim, filled with his virtues and burning with his love, cannot comprehend at all, whom no one knows except the Son, who is indeed one with him?"</s>

O substance, it is proper to believe

Likewise, the same prophet says:

<p>
Armed with this example, he examines the act of worshipping images in basilicas and finds himself significantly opposed to the holy man's command. He cannot join David in saying: <break time="0.5s"/> "I did not sit with deceitful people, nor will I go in with hypocrites. I hate the assembly of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked. I will wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, Lord."
</p>
<p>
But if perhaps the defender of this error says, "Worshipping the emperor's images is not a sin," let him consider the great glory given to the three boys who refused to do so. An angel was sent from heaven into the blazing furnace, extinguishing the consuming flames and providing life-saving dew. This was for their glory and to refute his own stubbornness. The Babylonian prince himself testified that he saw someone like the Son of God among them.
</p>
<p>
Let them also listen to the blessed Jerome in his commentary on the Book of Daniel, where he says: "Behold, our God, whom we worship, can deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and from your hands, O king." What he thought would terrify the boys actually became a source of strength for them. They do not delay but promise themselves immediate help, saying: "Behold, our God, whom we worship, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and from your hands, O king." "But if He does not," beautifully adds to what was previously said: "He can deliver us."
</p>


<p>
If it’s rare: if he could not, but: ‘if he would not,’ let it be known that it is not God’s inability, but His will, if they perished. ‘Know this, O king, that we do not worship your gods and we do not bow down to the golden statue that you have set up.’ Whether we read ‘statue,’ as Symmachus, or ‘golden image,’ as others have translated, the worshipers of God should not bow to it.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, judges and leaders of the world, who adore the statues and images of emperors, should understand that they are doing what the three young men refused to do, and it pleased God. And note the distinction; they say gods are worshipped, and images are adored, which is not suitable for the servants of God.
</p>
<p>
Here we are taught by the examples of holy men that we should not adore the images of emperors. And who is so perverse that they would not only decide to adore them but also take examples of perversity from their adoration to worship other images similarly?
</p>
<p>
And if mortal men, inflated with the arrogance of vanity, lifted by secular pomp, desirous of honors out of ambition, full of boasting, limited by location, content with their position, because they cannot be everywhere...
</p>


  <p>
    They commanded that they should be adored because they couldn't be adored everywhere by themselves. Why is it necessary to worship God in an image, who is inscribed nowhere, who is everywhere whole, everywhere wonderful, who is not contained by place, not circumscribed by location, whom, as Solomon said, the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain, whom the world cannot contain, but who contains the world? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Since His power is so great, His glory so immense, His strength so vast, He should not be sought in images but in pure and holy hearts; He should not be worshiped in a painted picture but in His holy hall, as the prophet says, "Worship the Lord in His holy hall"; who is not found by painting in fixed places, but by deeds from devout minds; whom Elijah did not seek in a place, painting, or tablets, but knew Him to be present everywhere and showed himself to be present to Him by the urgency of good works, when he said, "The Lord lives, in whose sight I stand."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, wanting to worship God in tablets, who is non-local and omnipotent, as the pagans worshiped their local or mortal kings, is profane and close to unbelief. We read that no nation committed this crime, except the Babylonians and Romans or those nations that were either subdued or neighbors of them or took examples from them, just as these two kingdoms are known to have excelled over the other kingdoms of the world in ferocity or strength, so they are also believed to have been more prone to worship and adore idols.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, there was great concord, great unity between these two most powerful kingdoms.

      For as they say in history, the Roman Empire took over the entire heritage and peak of the Babylonian kingdom, and between these two kingdoms, like between an old father who has ceased to be able and a young son who has not yet received the strength to rule, two kingdoms are said to have acted as guardians, namely the Persians or the Macedonians.

      But when the heir, that is, the Roman Empire, matured, the one that held the place of the guardian withdrew, and the young son took over the inheritance that the old father had lost.

      It would be lengthy to pursue the harmony or concord of these two kingdoms.
    </s>
    <s>
      For, to remain silent about other matters, in this part there is not a small harmony between these kingdoms, that both decided to worship their kings in statues or images through fields or squares and imposed various punishments on those unwilling to do this.
    </s>
    <s>
      For this evil, along with other evils that were thwarted by the advent of Christ, must be entirely frustrated, and not only should examples be taken from it for other things to be done, but it should be eradicated at its root by Christians, so that, according to the Apostle, no root of bitterness may spring up again and defile many.

    <s>
      For as we are instructed by apostolic teachings, we should give no opportunity to the evil one.

  <p>
    Worshiping the images of mortal kings and taking examples from them, they might say to us, "We worship the statues or images of those whom we believe to be gods by true religion or whom we know not to be gods through the teachings of ancient traditions. But you, for whom this is an abomination, why do you venerate the images of men, painted on canvas or cast in metal, under the pretense of honoring kings, and, as you preach, give to men the honor due only to God? If this is unlawful and against the law, why do you do this, Christians, or why do your priests not prohibit you from doing what you accuse us of doing as sacrilege, excusing it as part of your duty?"
  </p>
  <p>
    When such arguments and similar ones were brought against our faith by the philosophers of the nations in the early days of faith, our people are said to have responded in this manner: "What you say, we neither should nor can approve, because by the clear words of God, we are not permitted to worship the elements, not angels, nor any rulers of heaven, earth, or air."

    Against those who say that the honor of an image passes to the original form
  </p>
  <p>
    It is very common and quite familiar to those who are fervent in worshiping images to believe and assert that the honor of an image can pass to the form it represents. However, how and whether this can happen is not understood by any reasoning nor approved by the testimonies of divine scriptures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Did the saints, who ascended to the heavenly realms due to their merits, for whose images those people show improper reverence, seek out superstitious or empty honors? Did they allow themselves to be worshiped? Some of them wished to be humble to earn the Lord's grace; one of them said: "I have chosen to be an outcast in the house of God rather than dwell in the tents of sinners." Others preferred to be flogged rather than venerated; witness the one who said: "I am ready not only to be bound but also to die for Christ."
  </p>
  <p>
    For they were not seekers of honors, but burning with spiritual vigor and fortified against adversities, refined by the fire of tribulation, and made stronger than worldly adversities.
