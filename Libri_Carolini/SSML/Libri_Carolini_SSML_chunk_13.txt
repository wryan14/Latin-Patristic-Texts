    It would be too lengthy to include that discussion here. For while saying 'painters do not contradict the Scriptures,' and many things are painted by artists that the divine Scriptures do not mention and are proven by people, not only by scholars but also by ordinary people, to be very false, who would not admit that such a statement is ridiculous or rather false? Wouldn't they?
  </p>


  <p>
    Don't they go against the holy Scriptures when they imagine an abyss having the shape of a man and pouring out a flood of waters? Isn't it undoubtedly contrary to the holy Scriptures when they depict the earth in human form, sometimes dry and barren, sometimes overflowing with fruits? Isn't it clear that they go against the holy Scriptures when they depict rivers in the forms of people or pouring water from buckets, or flowing into each other? Don't they contradict the holy Scriptures in every way when they imagine the sun, moon, and other heavenly ornaments in human forms and with heads surrounded by rays?
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't they contradict the holy Scriptures when they attribute different forms to the twelve winds according to the strength of their power or give each month a specific form according to the quality of the times, some naked, some half-naked, and some clothed in various garments? Or when they depict the four seasons of the year each with different forms, such as blooming with flowers like spring, scorched by heat or laden with crops like summer, laden with wine vats or grapes like autumn, or sometimes cold with frost, sometimes warming itself with fire, sometimes providing food for animals, or sometimes capturing withered birds with extreme cold like winter? Aren't these contrary to the holy Scriptures, in which these things are not contained at all?
  </p>
  <p>
    So how can it be said that painters, who often follow the most vain stories of poets, do not contradict the holy Scriptures? For they sometimes imagine things as if they were truly happening.

<p>
Everything is possible for Him, nothing is impossible. It is very important to note that, although many amazing and astonishing things have been done by God's command through some creatures or even in all creatures, not everything in or through which these things have been done should be considered worthy of worship. The Almighty God showed many signs to mortals, which He did through certain visible and tangible things, so as to soften the hardness of visible and mortal humans with visible things. However, He did not do this to establish the worship of certain things, for He commanded that only He should be worshipped and honored.
</p>
<p>
Just because the Lord spoke to Moses from the burning bush, does that mean the bush should be worshipped? Certainly not. He did not appear in the bush so that the material of the bush would be worshipped, but to show through its thorns the sins for which the law was given. Since the bush has no root armed with thorns but is thickly covered with thorns at the top, it clearly shows that sins do not originate from nature. The bush was not burned by the fire to indicate that sins are not to be eliminated by the law but only revealed.
</p>
<p>
The law indeed reveals sins, but the grace given through Christ heals the sins that the law had pointed out. Therefore, because the Lord appeared in the fire, He did not decree that the fire should be worshipped, but rather chose to appear in a nature that always strives to ascend to higher things. Because He chose to appear on the mountain, it does not mean that mountains are to be worshipped.

<p>Charlemagne's Capitularies on Images.</p> 

<p>Baptism in Christ cleanses from the contamination of idols, and thus rivers are to be revered. Consider this: because the coming of the Holy Spirit was delayed for the holy man Elisha until the harpist was brought, and when the harpist played, the Holy Spirit poured out upon him, signifying the Jewish people, who now do not receive the coming of the Holy Spirit because they do not believe in the incarnation of the Redeemer. But when they finally understand this at the end of the world, they will be adorned with the gifts of the Holy Spirit and all his graces. Therefore, should the harpist be worshipped?</p>

<p>Likewise, because the hem of the Lord's garment, which healed the woman when she touched it, signifies belief in the Lord's incarnation, through which the Gentiles were healed, should the hem be worshipped? Or because the shadow of Peter healed the sick, should Peter's shadow be revered?</p>

Therefore, to support a doubtful matter and one that comes into question, the deceptive vanity of dreams, the extreme insolence of apocryphal texts, and the falsity of trivial and useless words are not to be sought but rather the authentic <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɔːˈθɔrɪtɪ">authority</phoneme> of divine books or the Catholic Fathers. For just as beneficial matters and mysteries adorned with secrets are hinted at through dreams and revealed by angels, so on the contrary, harmful matters and those lacking all usefulness are shown through dreams.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if a dream, which someone reported in the synod, is believed to be demonstrated by demons to establish the adoration of images, it should be questioned.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      It has been shown that worshipping images is beneficial;
      <break time="1s" />
      and if worshipping images is beneficial, then worshipping other senseless things is also beneficial.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, worshipping senseless things is harmful.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, the archdeacon's dream, which he reported to affirm the worship of images, was not shown to him by an angel.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      It is clear that since it was not shown by an angel, it must have been suggested by an instigating spirit, who always insists on vanities and harmful things.
    </s>
    <s>
      To make this clearer, it should be confirmed with a rational argument.
    </s>
    <s>
      Since the instigating spirit did not suggest it to him, it must undoubtedly be believed that an angel suggested it;
      <break time="1s" />
      and if it must be believed that an angel suggested it, then angels agree with prohibited things.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, angels do not agree with prohibited or harmful things or divine warnings.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, it must be believed that the instigating spirit suggested it to him.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Since it has been proven that it was not shown to him by a holy angel,
      <break time="1s" />
      because the spirits who continuously remain in the praise of their creator and are entirely free from sin fully reject impure and sinful things,
      <break time="1s" />
      it remains that either he admits it was shown to him by the deception of a wicked spirit or he confesses that he lied, which does not befit the servants of God.
    </s>
    <s>
      For every Catholic must resist unclean spirits, as the apostle says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you";
      <break time="1s" />
      and lying must be avoided, as Scripture says, "Do not lie, for every lie is a habit."

      We thought it necessary to criticize in every way the aforementioned bishop, who should have fought against dreamers and other nonsense with the weapons of divine law, but instead brought up the dreams of his archdeacon to support something insignificant in the synod.
    </s>
    <s>
      This should not be taken lightly, as it is found not only in the oracles of the divine law but also in the writings of the pagans.

    <s>

    <s>
      When you are awake, you hope; in your sleep, you see the same.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>If anyone happens to criticize us for including phrases from non-Christian sources in our work, let them first read the books of the most blessed and learned men, Jerome and Augustine.</s> 
<s>Then, when they find that these men have also included words from not only philosophers but even from non-Christian poets in their writings, they will realize that we follow the footsteps of our teachers and authors.</s> 
<s>We do not deny this, nor are we ashamed of it.</s> 
</p>

<p>
<s>To go back further, even the chosen vessel included some non-Christian words in his works, as when he said: "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."</s> 
</p>

<p>
<s>Furthermore, when we discuss the observations or rather the vanities of dreams, we do not entirely dismiss their use.</s> 
<s>This is because some of the most sacred mysteries were shown to the patriarchs and prophets in dreams or rather visions.</s> 
<s>The Magi were warned in a dream not to return to the cruel tyrant and took a different path back to their homes.</s> 
<s>An angel appeared in a dream to the holy man Joseph and revealed to him the mysteries foretold by the prophets many ages ago.</s> 
</p>

<p>
<s>Therefore, lest anyone presumptuously seek to use these and similar examples of dreams to follow, believe, or recite them in gatherings or to affirm contentious matters as Theodore did, we must be cautious.</s> 
</p>


<p>
We sent it, as the holy Scriptures forbid. We also read that certain secrets were shown in dreams to unbelievers and profane kings, which were not revealed to them due to their own merits, but so that holy men, who showed these things to them by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, might be elevated in honor and able to benefit their captives.
</p>
<p>
Although visions and dreams are often spoken of interchangeably, some say that there is a difference between visions and dreams. Dreams are often deceptive—they sometimes come from revelation, but many times they come from thinking, temptation, or similar causes. Visions, on the other hand, are considered truthful revelations, and there are three kinds: physical, spiritual, and intellectual. A physical vision is one that happens through the body; a spiritual vision is when the images we see are stored in our memory. An intellectual vision is when we understand what we see physically and retain in our memory.
</p>
<p>
But so that we do not seem to be stealing his meaning, as much as possible, what we know by the Lord's consent and have learned from others, let us also convey his words as he expressed them. As he says...
</p>


    <p>
        We understand with our intellect that one thing is the body and another is the likeness of the body. Animals, livestock, and birds do not possess this understanding at all. They see through their bodies, and their spirits are informed by the images of what they see. This is why livestock recognize their troughs, and birds return to their nests. But they do not understand themselves or what they see with their eyes. Ultimately, this physical vision cannot exist without the spiritual. When we turn our eyes away from what we have seen, we retain the images of what we do not see in our memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spiritual vision cannot exist without the physical. This is why we remember absent people and see things in the dark that we do not see with our eyes. Intellectual vision, however, does not need the physical or the spiritual. With the intellect, we do not see the body or the image of the body. Through it, we see justice, charity, God Himself, and the human mind, which has no body or physical solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, since there are so many different kinds of dreams and visions coming from various places, we must carefully observe so that when someone claims to have seen something in a dream, they do not immediately hold onto it firmly and bring it forward as a kind of authentic authority to a council for deliberating uncertain matters, lest they support vanity with vanities.
    </p>


  <p>
    <s>It would be absurd for anyone to think that God is within images, which are mere creations of man.</s>
    <s>Some people, however, mistakenly say: 'We must honor and worship images as if they were the place of God.'</s>
    <s>They also say that images should be venerated and worshiped as the place of God.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>If they mean to say that images are the temple of God, which is often improperly called the place of God, they are greatly mistaken.</s>
    <s>In the Lord's temple, sacrifices are offered, not in images.</s>
    <s>In the temple, not in pictures, the solemn rites of the Mass are celebrated.</s>
    <s>In the temple, the congregation stands and offers their prayers to God, not in painted panels.</s>
    <s>David said, 'The Lord is in His holy temple,' not 'in His holy image.'</s>
    <s>His throne is in heaven, not in pictures.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>He did not say, 'His eyes look upon the arrogant or seekers of vain praise,' but rather, 'They look upon the humble.'</s>
    <s>Of the humble, the Truth itself says, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit.'</s>
    <s>And again, the same most holy prophet said, 'In His temple, not in images, everyone speaks of His glory.'</s>
    <s>And again, 'Worship the Lord,' not 'in pictures,' but 'in His holy court.'</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>For the difference between the temple, which can hold many people, and an image, which, apart from a fleeting vision, serves no practical purpose, is vast.</s>
    <s>Hence, the veneration or worship of images is vastly different from the veneration given to the temple of God, as is evident from many indications.</s>
    <s>If, however, they call the soul of a righteous person the place of God, which can more fittingly be called the place of God, for the Lord sanctifies it by dwelling in it and sanctifies it by inhabiting it, then they are correct.</s>
  </p>


    <p>
        In this too, they were extremely wrong. God gave the law for the salvation of souls, not for the salvation of images. The Redeemer of the world came down to earth to free souls, not images. It was for humans, who are often referred to by the term "souls," not for images, that He came.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the sake of the souls that were given to me, I want them to be where I am, so they can see the glory you have given me because you loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
        When God first gave humans the natural law, which was later corrupted by humans, He then gave the written law. When even that was violated, He revealed Himself in bodily form. Both before the law, under the law, and under grace, He always cared for human salvation.
    </p>


  <p>
    <s>It is believed that no one ever consulted images for something like this.</s>
    <s>And because of this, the veneration that is due to humans for their merit should not be equated with the veneration of images at all.</s>
    <s>This should suffice to say briefly about the place of God or the temple, which is improperly called that, or about the soul of a just person, which is more fittingly called the place of God, to which images should in no way be equated according to their madness.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>However, discussing the place of God, who is not local, who is not contained by any place, who contains everything and is not a place, to whom nothing from the six parts of place applies, to whom nothing is anterior or posterior, right or left, above or below, is for those of more subtle intelligence.</s>
    <s>Although the order of those ten categories, which are discussed by philosophers, seems to be ascribed to Him, it should be said according to His essence, which is ineffable:</s>
    <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdoʊmɪnəs ˈdeɪəs">Dominus Deus</phoneme>, God is one, God is strong, God is powerful, according to His quantity, which is immense: great Lord and highly praiseworthy.</s>
    <s>According to His quality, which is indescribable, it should be said: the good Creator of all;</s>
    <s>according to His relation, it should be said: the Lord, the Father of all who believe;</s>
    <s>according to His situation: who sits above the cherubim;</s>
    <s>according to time: and your years do not fail;</s>
    <s>according to place: the Lord has prepared His throne in heaven;</s>
    <s>according to His state: the abyss like a garment is His robe;</s>
    <s>according to His action: He raises the poor from the earth and lifts up the needy from the ashes.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>He lifts up the poor; <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="proʊ">pro</phoneme> suffering: you made me work in your sins - yet all these things and similar ones are said about God in a human manner, of whom nothing worthy can be said by mortals.</s>
    <s>For his substance is not easy to investigate, and therefore ineffable, because it is not investigable by anyone.</s>
    <s>He is great without quantity, good without quality, Lord of all without relation, and so on with similar things, which require more thorough discussion.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>To speak of the place of God, the words of Saint Augustine must be cited, who proved God's non-locality with the complexity of a five-part syllogism.</s>
    <s>He said: God is not somewhere.</s>
    <s>For what is somewhere is contained in a place; what is contained in a place is a body.</s>
    <s>But God is not a body. Therefore, He is not somewhere.</s>
    <s>Later, he proved in another syllogism that God is neither in a place nor everything in Him.</s>
    <s>He said: And yet, because He exists and is not in a place, everything is in Him rather than He being somewhere, yet not in Him in such a way that He is a place.</s>
    <s>For a place is in space, which is occupied by the length, breadth, and height of a body.</s>
    <s>Nor is God such a thing, and therefore everything is in Him, and He is not a place.</s>
    <s>Later, in a very fitting short clause, he asserted that the place of God is called the temple of God abusively, but the soul of a man can be better called this.</s>
    <s>He said: The place of God is abusively called the temple of God, not because He is contained there, but because He is present there; but nothing is better understood than a pure soul.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in this way</s>

    They say images are for the place of God, or for the temple of God.

  <p>
    With the help of the Lord, the parts of this work have been shown. And as we discussed the words of Constantine, the bishop of Cyprus, and Euthymius, the bishop of Sardis, we explained how the worship and reverence due to God alone differ from the worship and reverence they claim should be given to images, as the Lord has granted us assistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, with the Lord's help, let us briefly discuss how the fear of the Lord differs from the worship of images.
  </p>
  <p>
    They say, "Whoever fears God worships images just as they worship the Son of God." But do all the patriarchs and prophets, because they rejected the worship of images, not fear God? Or the Apostles, because they are never recorded as celebrating the worship of images, do they not have the fear of God? Or the multitude of saints, martyrs, hermits, and generally all churchmen, who are known to have served God most devoutly, are they to be considered lacking in the fear of the Lord because they are never recorded or proven to have celebrated the worship of images?
  </p>
  <p>
    The most holy prophet David did not say he would teach the worship of images, but the fear of the Lord, when he called all believers to come to him in the person of Christ, with gentle exhortations, saying, "Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord." Nor does he testify anywhere to the worship of images, but to the holy fear of the Lord, saying, "The fear of the Lord is holy and endures forever."
