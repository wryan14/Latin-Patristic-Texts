        <s>In their second council, which was gathered to worship images, as soon as Leontius saw them in secret, he thought he had found great proof of his error and judged those who had removed two pages from the same book, where the images were, due to the mention of images, to be extremely foolish.</s>
        <s>Thus, the same book over time was judged differently by various events and in dissimilar ways.</s>
        <s>It was cut by those due to the mention of images and commanded to be worshiped by others because of the images on the tablets.</s>
        <s>It unjustly suffered the loss of its pages by some, and was falsely elevated by worship by others.</s>
        <s>It was improperly deprived of what it had and should have had by the former, and inconsistently gained what it neither had nor should have had by the latter.</s>
        <s>It lost its pages not due to any present faults, nor did it find worship for any notable merits.</s>

<s>Unfortunate is the sense that longs to reject things that can be possessed without offense but cannot be worshipped without offense!</s> 
<s>Unfortunate is the custom that, having spurned the straight path of moderation, does not know how to hold a fixed rule and is always wavering, sometimes unjustly rejecting what should not be rejected, and sometimes foolishly worshipping what should not be worshipped!</s>

    <s>But because it is not entirely to be worshipped, sometimes it diminishes something beyond what order demands, and sometimes it lifts up something beyond what order requires.</s>
    <s>And, omitting necessary things, it insists on unnecessary things, either because of the abolition of images or because of their worship, which neither is fitting.</s>
    <s>It gathers synods, as if they could bring some prejudice to the Christian religion either in having or not worshipping something.</s>
    <s>Obviously, images take nothing away if they are not held, and they add nothing if they are held, although, when rejected, they bring a certain reckless lightness, and when worshipped, they incur blame!</s>

    <s>No reading of the Gospel tells that Jesus sent an image to Abgar, as they say.</s>
    <s>The Gospel is good news, and indeed good news, because those who receive it are called children of God.</s>
    <s>It is a river with four streams flowing from one ineffable source of paradise, and it is healthily sent forth to irrigate burning hearts.</s>
    <s>It is the way that leads to life, a light leading out of the darkness of vices, and it guides the steps of mortals without stumbling to the heavens.</s>
    <s>It is the fortification of a most flourishing city, in which to stand firmly is the greatest benefit of life, and from which to depart is the most dangerous harm.</s>
    <s>They are the streams of truth, which neither deceive nor are deceived.</s>
    <s>In their vast rivers, while many notable deeds of the Lord are contained, the same Lord received a letter from a certain King Abgar and sent a reply to him.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    The two letters that are entirely foreign to the reading of the Holy Gospel and were relegated among apocryphal scriptures by Blessed Gelasius, the bishop of the city of Rome, and other equally Catholic and orthodox men, are not to be presented as evidence in any way. This is because they are less suitable for approving or disproving the matters in question, just like other apocryphal scriptures. Therefore, since their texts are not listed by the evangelists in the canonical gospels and are rightly classified as apocryphal by Catholics, and since they were brought to the council by those who supported the error of venerating images, they do not even slightly support their followers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Particularly, since it is not read anywhere in those letters that Abgar asked the Lord for an image to venerate, nor is it reported that the Lord sent any image to Abgar to be venerated. If those who attempt to support their error with these readings want to assert that one letter was received from the Lord and another was sent, they must be willing to...

<s>As for the letters themselves being removed from the gospel reading and classified among the apocrypha by the Catholics, and since they have no documents supporting the veneration of images in their reading, it is clear.</s>

<s>Those books of the Acts of the Fathers, whose authors are unknown, are not entirely suitable for giving testimony and confirming these matters that come into contention.</s>
<s>The apostolic preaching advises us to test everything and keep what is good. This can be understood especially about the diversities of teachings.</s>
<s>For it did not allow us to taste all acts or even things, as if we were tasting everything in advance, retaining only the good and discarding all that is bad, which cannot be done without a certain commission of unlawful acts.</s>
<s>But it ordered us to test and spiritually taste all teachings, and to retain only those that restore minds with internal satisfaction as taught by the most approved men, while discarding all others along with their authors.</s>
<s>Therefore, since in almost all such writings this rule is entirely...</s>
</p>


<p>
The writing, even in books that contain the deeds of certain holy fathers, must be carefully preserved; because their number is large, their accounts vary, and their preaching is diverse. Often, believers doubt their words because the authors are unknown. Thus, not all should be used as evidence for uncertain matters because not all authors are well known or written by strong and eloquent men.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we are instructed by the venerable Pope Gelasius and other fathers to honor the lives of Fathers Paul, Anthony, Hilarion, and others, which were either written by the blessed Jerome or translated from Greek into Latin or written by other learned men whose other works are accepted by the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. We should receive all such writings with respect, but those whose authors are unknown should be classified among apocryphal scriptures.
</p>
<p>
So, when some try to support the adoration of images with misapplied divine scriptures, the words of unknown doctors, or apocryphal tales, they ought to realize they are attempting something impossible.

    <s>Therefore, it is sought in each scripture's coin whether the gold is most tested, so that the Lord's chest may be adorned or even the work of the whole sanctuary may shine, so that the brilliance of spiritual understanding may be evident in it, by which the divine law is understood and the beauty of the whole church may sparkle.</s> <s>It is sought whether it is pure and not tainted with any false mixture inside, lest the perverse doctrine of some heresy covered with the brilliance of eloquence and seemingly mixed with spiritual senses may lie hidden inside, and while one thinks they are receiving the coin of the divine word, they may receive the deadly harm of poisonous doctrine.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It is sought whether it bears the inscription of the king or the tyrant, because in such writings, the most learned men scrutinize with the greatest diligence whether they pertain to the salvation of the soul and contain the salutary teachings of our king, who is called savior or savior, lest, having set these aside, they contain certain harmful schemes of the ancient enemy, and while one should follow him, who</s>

      XII. It is said that Dionysius, a priest of the church of Ascalon, reported in the same synod that a certain monk lit a lamp before the image of Saint Mary, ever virgin, and found it extinguished after the third, fifth, or even sixth month upon returning.

      It is read, finally, in the reading of the same synod that Dionysius, a priest of the church of Ascalon, reported in the often mentioned synod that a certain monk lit a lamp before the image of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and found it still burning after the fourth, fifth, or even sixth month.
    </s>
    <s>
      This was reported, just like the other things mentioned there, not for any other reason than to establish the worship of images.
    </s>
    <s>
      And concerning this, as with the other things, such worship of images cannot obtain any strength, since there is doubt about the faith of the one who reported it, the event itself, the time when it happened, the place where it happened, and the manner in which it happened.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For while it is completely unknown whether what the same priest reported actually happened, even if it were proven to have actually occurred, it would need to be investigated more carefully as to how it was said to have happened, since miracles sometimes occur through unworthy individuals.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
Sometimes, through the power of the air, but usually through the holy ones or angelic ministries, miracles occur.
</p>
<p>
If it happens through the twisted schemes of the ancient enemy, not only can the worship of images not be justified, but it must be rejected along with its author and all its illusions. If it occurs through angelic arrangements, as many signs are made, even then, the worship of an irrational thing cannot take root because it is more credible that the miracle occurred due to the reverence of the holy place rather than the presence of an image, if it happened at all.
</p>
<p>
Basilicas are more venerable than images, and places dedicated to divine worship are more revered than any pictures, as the Lord testifies, saying that the altar is greater than the gift offered on it, and the temple is greater than the gold in it because the temple and altar consecrate the gold or gifts.
</p>
<p>
We read that the blessed Gregory said that in a certain basilica, an unusual flood of waters reached up to the windows and, by the power of the Lord, could not enter. The lamps, which had long been extinguished by the basilica's guardians, were later found to be lit by the same guardians. This miracle is said to have been done not by the presence of any image but by the reverence of the holy place.

    To determine if it happened is difficult to say; see page 190, line 26; see Migne, Patrologia Latina, volume seventy-three, page seventeen.

    If it were proven that the miracle reported by the priest of the Ascalon church regarding the image appeared because of the same image, images would not be venerated for this reason, because not everything through which miracles appear is believed to be venerated.
  </p>
  <p>
    If everything through which or in which some miracles appear must be venerated, almost nothing will remain that is not venerated; since divine miracles are shown in so many ways and in almost all creatures, dwelling on this in our discussion is pointless, because in the earlier parts of this work, this matter has been discussed somewhat with the Lord's blessing.

    This synod cannot in any way be compared to the Nicene synod, although it was held in the same place, as John the priest is reported to have flatteringly said, since it is known to differ from it not only in other matters but also in the creed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, although this synod was held in the city of Nicaea in Bithynia, it cannot in any way be compared to the holy Nicene synod according to their boasting and the flattery of John the priest, because it differs from it in many things and does not at all agree with it in the creed.

    <s>It also has, after the confession of the Holy Trinity, a confession of the worship of images added, which we have not found inserted anywhere in the prophecies of the prophets, in the thunderings of the Gospels, in the teachings of the apostles, or in the accounts of previous holy synods or the teachings of any orthodox fathers.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Indeed, it is far and beyond what can be said, far removed from it, especially since the former leads the Catholic Church away from error, while the latter leads it into error.</s>
    <s>The former drives it away from the perilous shipwreck of Arius, while the latter forces it into the shipwreck of worshipping images.</s>
    <s>The former teaches that the Son is consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, while the latter counts worshipping senseless things.</s>
    <s>The former affirms that the Son is equal to the Father in divinity, while the latter equates any pictures to the sacred Ark of the Covenant, the Lord's Cross, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, or other most sacred things.</s>
    <s>The former wisely believes that the one substance of divine majesty is to be worshipped in three equal, coessential, and coeternal persons, while the latter shamelessly says that images are to be worshipped in the manner of the Holy Trinity.</s>
    <s>In the former, the errors of Arian teachings are condemned, while in the latter the greater errors of these people are likewise renounced.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, their blasphemy, those who stubbornly neither believe nor confess that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, is abhorred in this purity of theirs, who, rejecting the worship of images, profess with a resolute mind and a devoted heart that they will serve God alone.
    </s>
    <s>
      In that, after the confession of the holy Trinity, there is the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come.

      In this one, anathemas are imposed by children or successors for their deceased predecessors or parents.

    </s>
    <s>
      Hence, not without reason, this one differs from that by the number twelve, either because...
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>The number twelve contains two perfect numbers within itself.</s>
    <s>This is because, in the ternary that it has four times and in the quaternary that it has three times, it demonstrates the mystery of the Holy Trinity in the four Gospels and shows that the source of the four Gospels is the same Holy Trinity.</s>
    <s>Additionally, the same number twelve demonstrates all discipline, distinguishing and discerning the creature and the creator, and leading to higher things, which is completely lacking in that council.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>However, the creator is God, from whom everything comes, through whom everything exists, and in whom everything exists, as the Apostle says in Romans 11:36.</s>
    <s>"For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things."</s>
    <s>Therefore, the Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</s>
    <s>Creation, on the other hand, is partly invisible, like the soul, and partly visible, like the body.</s>
    <s>The number three is attributed to the invisible because we are commanded to love God in three ways in Matthew 22: with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind.</s>
    <s>The number four is attributed to the body because of its very evident nature: hot, cold, wet, and dry.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, the number seven pertains to the entire creation.</s>
    <s>When the knowledge of the Holy Trinity is added, the number ten is completed, in which lies all the discipline of wisdom that pertains to educating humans: to recognize the creator and the creature, to worship the dominating creator, and to acknowledge the subordinate creature.</s>
    <s>By adding to this discipline the two most eminent commandments of the love of God and neighbor, the number twelve is completed.</s>
    <s>For even if, in the aforementioned number seven, in which human nature is shown to be partly visible and partly invisible...</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>We have mentioned the five books of the law, through which one comes to know and love God and neighbor, adding to them, the number twelve is completed.</s>
<s>If the four books of the Gospels are added to this, the order extends to the number sixteen, because the same twelve, when multiplied, reaches the number sixteen.</s>
<s>For example, six, which it has twice, and two, which it has six times, and three, which it has four times, and four, which it has three times, and one, which it has twelve times, make the number sixteen.</s>
<s>Thus, through these five parts, in which the figure of the five books is held, and seven, in which visible and invisible creation is demonstrated, and four, in which the holy Gospels are designated, we reach the number sixteen.</s>
<s>Here, the ten commandments of the Decalogue, and the sum of six, which in the New Testament is given through the Mediator of God and humans, are shown.</s>
<s>So that through the twelve apostles, and the four Gospels, and the sixteen most noble prophets who have books, the minds are raised to the worship and adoration of the one and only God, rejecting all vanities of mortals.</s>
<s>Therefore, there are twelve patriarchs, twelve minor prophets, and twelve apostles, as well as many other similar things that can be found in divine writings by diligent readers.</s>
<s>There are also many things in the same number that pertain to natural phenomena.</s>
<s>For in the zodiac circle, there are twelve signs, which adorn it like a series of gems.</s>
</p>


<p>
There are twelve winds blowing around the world, three for each of the four parts of the sky. 
</p>
<p>
There are twelve months that complete the year. There are twelve hours that complete the day, and many other such things that are investigated by learned men according to secular knowledge and understood spiritually according to church doctrine.
</p>
<p>
For if perhaps some critic of our work tries to attack us because we have used examples from physical things, specifically those found in mathematics, let them read the blessed Jerome and either attack us with him or recognize us as following his and other fathers' teachings, who were not ignorant of letters. For that same teacher, while discussing the priestly garment, said, "The breastplate placed in the middle explains the earth, which, although it contains everything, is surrounded by all the elements." The twelve stones either interpret the zodiac circle or the twelve months, and they assign each verse to specific times, and they assign three months to each. Let no one consider this explanation to be pagan. For not because heavenly things and God's arrangements are explained...
</p>


<p>
<s>They defamed the idea of idols with names,</s> 
<s>therefore, the providence of God, which runs, moves, and governs everything according to a certain law, must not be denied.</s> 
<s>And in Job, we read of Arcturus, Orion, and Mazuroth, which is the zodiac circle, and other star names.</s> 
<s>Not because these are the same words in Hebrew, but because we cannot understand what is said except with familiar words.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>This number is also dedicated to many mysteries,</s> 
<s>which we cannot fully explain due to brevity,</s> 
<s>and to understand why there were fewer than twelve bishops at this council compared to the holy Nicene council,</s> 
<s>because it is fortified by the most sacred preaching or authority of the twelve apostles,</s> 
<s>which is known to be completely fortified by them,</s> 
<s>while the other is known to be largely foreign.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>And while that one rises to higher things adorned with these almost impregnable towers,</s> 
<s>this one, lacking them, descends to worse things.</s> 
<s>That one is adorned with these twelve gems, on which the names of the twelve tribes,</s> 
<s>namely the knowledge or examples of virtues of the ancient fathers,</s> 
<s>are written, which this one is completely known to lack.</s> 
<s>Through these twelve gates of that most beautiful city,</s> 
<s>namely the most sacred constitutions,</s> 
<s>the mysteries are penetrated, which are not found in this one at all.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Therefore, we could not find any concordance of merits between that one and this one,</s> 
<s>except only the similarity of the name,</s> 
<s>since that one, being held in the metropolis of Bithynia, in the city of Nicaea,</s> 
<s>was conducted for the progress of the church.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>And this, because it was done there, although with a different vow and merit, it is nevertheless called Nicene.</s>
<s>For the similarity of names is not always believed to have the same force, since many of the names of saints and illustrious men are found to have been given to any obscure people.</s>
<s>Indeed, neither does a name's merit bestow equality, but the merit's equality bestows the name's dignity.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, when they attempt to exalt it with the great signs of merit, because it was debated in the same place where the holy council had once been, they should realize that neither the merit of any name nor the merit of any place is always the same.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For places are made for people, not people for places, just as with other earthly creatures.</s>
<s>The benefits of the location do not confer merits, but the eminence of the merits does.</s>
<s>The holiness of any place does not hold much value if there is impurity in the actions and merits of people.</s>
<s>For both right acts can be performed by the righteous and wrong acts by the wicked in the same places.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In the city, which was the metropolis of Egypt, said to have been founded by the Titans, that is, by giants, and called Tanis by them, many and astounding things were done by Moses through the invocation of the divine name.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>After performing miracles and many tricks through the most insolent exercises of Pharaoh's magicians, </s>
<s>in the suburbs of the same city, memorable deeds were performed by holy men, namely Moses and Aaron, </s>
<s>and many evil deeds were carried out by demon worshipers through various consecrations or invocations. </s>
<s>Thus, the communion of the place provided no prejudice to either the pious acts of the holy men or the disgraceful acts of the others, </s>
<s>offering common hospitality to both. </s>

<s>This is the place where the holy man said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it,' </s>
<s>and, in great awe, declared it to be none other than the house of God and the gate of heaven. </s>
<s>However, it later became a house of idols and a cause of danger for the Israelite nation. </s>
</p>
<p>

<p>
The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
</p>
<p>
If we come to the times of the New Testament, we will find that the same desecrations of holy places by wicked people occurred. For example, it is said that idols were placed by pagans on the rock of the cross, at the site of the resurrection, and even in the cave of Bethlehem, where the infant Lord cried as mentioned in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luːk">Luke</phoneme> 2:4 and following.
</p>
<p>
Blessed Jerome says that from the time of Hadrian until the reign of Constantine, for about 180 years, a statue of Jupiter was worshipped by the pagans where the resurrection took place, and a marble statue of Venus was placed on the rock of the cross. The persecutors thought they could destroy our faith in the resurrection and the cross by defiling these holy places with idols.
</p>
<p>
Bethlehem, now our most revered city, about which the psalmist sings, "Truth has sprung out of the earth," was overshadowed by the grove of Tammuz, that is, Adonis, and in the cave where Christ once cried as a child, the lover of Venus was mourned. If the grove of Adonis could defile the place of Christ's birth, is it any wonder that a perverse crowd could usurp the place of the holy synod to establish unlawful things?
</p>
<p>
And if the place of Calvary, where Christ walked the glorious path to the trophy of the cross, was defiled by the statue of Venus placed by the pagans, is it any wonder that the place once occupied by a distinguished group of holy fathers to strengthen the Catholic faith was later sought by a foolish multitude of priests to establish new and contrary constitutions to the church?
</p>


<p>
<s>If the place of resurrection, which Christ consecrated by rising and showing to mortal beings the angelic hosts, was desecrated by the image of Jupiter, what wonder is it if the worship of images by insane people is established in the same city of Bithynia, where Christ was once proclaimed by venerable bishops to be of one substance with the Father?</s>

<s>Therefore, with these documents, it can be proven that, contrary to their boasting, no certain power can always have the same constancy in places, since humans, being changeable, are not always bound by the strictness of one unchanging firmness.</s>

<s>And places, which were once dedicated to divine worship, were later profaned by the nations, and often, with these profanations cast out, places that were considered impure were later dedicated to divine worship.</s>
<s>Moreover, with insolent desire, both these people and their predecessors seek to convene a council and associate it with the six venerable councils, which were convened at different times for certain benefits of the church, but not with different faith, by holy men, and to be considered as the seventh council.</s>

      They cited the example of a person who, wanting to add a seventh gold coin to six already in hand, accidentally inserted a bronze coin instead of a gold one. 
    </s>
    <s>
      When this was discovered, the bronze coin was removed, and they boasted of having added a gold coin to the gold coins they already had. 
    </s>
    <s>
      If they had been careful, they would have realized that while attempting to insert a gold coin in place of a bronze one, they were actually inserting a tin coin. 
    </s>
    <s>
      They tried to complete the number of seven for the council, which their predecessors intended to complete with a genuine council, but they ended up adding a tin council. 
    </s>
    <s>
      However, after the bronze coin was removed from the mystery of the seventh number, and the tin coin was also taken away, only six coins remained. 
    </s>
    <s>
      This number of six is illuminated by the perfection of the number and the brilliance of Catholic teaching, in which the purest gold shines in the purity of faith, and the glory of perfection reigns. 
    </s>
    <s>
      For in the number six, which is indeed perfect, they seem to possess the perfection of ecclesiastical preaching. 
    </s>
    <s>
      In three, which is its half, the confession of the Holy Trinity is declared; in two, which is its third part, the understanding and operation of the two Testaments or the two talents granted by the Holy Trinity is signified.

      Furthermore, in one, which is its sixth part, either the condition of the old man, who was created on the sixth day, or the assumption of the new man, who was adopted for the salvation of the world in the sixth age.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>The little bags of the Son</s>
<s>clearly show the person taken on, and so in these six most sacred synods, the mystery of the Holy Trinity is preached.</s>
<s>The harmony or understanding and role of the two Testaments are held, and the faith in the Lord's incarnation for the salvation of humanity is thoroughly taught.</s>
<s>And because none of these things are lacking in them, they are fortified by the perfection of the number six.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Now, since they desire so fervently to associate their synod with the old synods, this one can be associated with a certain ancient synod of the Ariminians and can be counted among them.</s>
<s>For just as in that synod, the confession of the homoousion was rejected, in this one, the worshippers of God alone and true adorers are cursed.</s>
<s>And just as in that one, the most pernicious doctrine of different substances in the Trinity was established, in this one, the worship and adoration of different things owed to God alone are enumerated.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, let the first synod in this number be the synod of the Ariminians, the second one which was held by their predecessors to abolish the decorations of the basilicas, and the third one, which was held by these people in the city of Nicaea over the worship and adoration of images.</s>
<s>But only in such a way that the first is a bronze coin, the second a tin coin, and the third a lead coin, for although they have a great distance of time between them, they have the consonance of certain errors.</s>
<s>But if the second is rejected by their pride and ostentation, let us also offer them support to reject it from this number: and let the first be, as we have said, the synod of the Ariminians, and the second, this one which was held by these people.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    We have declared that the bronze coin, because it is despised, should be counted as the second of these, taking the place of the lead coin. After dismissing these, let us be satisfied with only the six holy universal synods and local councils that do not differ from them in faith or preaching. Let us prepare ourselves for the awe-inspiring return of Christ on the final day of judgment with unwavering faith and the growth of good works, which will be celebrated with His glorious return. As the angels said to the apostles: <break time="500ms" /> "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? <break time="500ms" /> This Jesus, who has been taken up from you, will come back in the same way as you saw Him go into heaven."
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning what Gregory, the bishop of Neocaesarea, said: <break time="500ms" /> "Let those who make and love the true image of Christ rejoice and exult, offering it with reverence for the salvation of the soul and body, as He Himself, the perfect sacrifice, received our whole mass from us and, according to the time of voluntary passion, gave it to His disciples as a clear sign and memory." <break time="500ms" /> Gregory's statement, clouded by useless talk and covered in ineptitude, is also reproached for saying: <break time="500ms" /> "Let those who create and honor the true image of Christ rejoice and exult."
  </p>


<p>
Gigantic and venerable people offer for the health of their soul and body, and so on. 
It is easy to understand what is meant by 'to rejoice and exult'; 
but what it means by adding 'and are assumed' gives no indication of any sense to the reader, 
because it is both foreign to the rules of senses and completely alien to the integrity of Latin expression, 
since, if he wanted to speak about presumption, this third thing cannot coherently connect to the sense of the two preceding ones, 
unless perhaps he meant 'to rejoice and exult,' those who presume to adore a forbidden thing and prohibited by the holy fathers, 
and who are so driven by the goads of such presumption that in the adoration of senseless objects, they seem to contradict all authentic scriptures.
</p>
<p>
Oh, the foolish speech of the bishop, worthy of laughter, who, when he said 'true image of Christ,' did not show it clearly! 
If he called 'true' the one made by artists from various materials, he spoke most absurdly and incompetently, 
especially since it is clearly evident that no mortal can form a 'true image of Christ.' 
For when 'true' is said, it is very far from this, which is fashioned by artists; 
because as much as truth differs from falsehood, so much does the true image of Christ differ from that which the skilled or unskilled hand of an artist forms according to the capacity of their talent.
</p>
<p>
But if he wanted to talk about the mystery of the body and blood of the Lord, which is taken daily in the sacrament by the faithful, 
which indeed is almost revealed among the conglomeration of his own trifles...
</p>


  <p>
    He said to him, "As the perfecter of the sacrifice and God, taking from us our whole humanity, according to the time of voluntary suffering, he gave it as a sign and clear memory to his disciples." He also made a significant error in this respect. For he did not offer an image or any prefiguration, but he himself offered to God the Father as a sacrifice for us. And he, who was once prefigured under the shadow of the law in the immolation of the lamb, truly fulfilled those things which were prophesied about him by the oracles of the prophets. He was offered to God the Father as a saving victim.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He gave us not an imaginary sign as we transition from the shadows of the law, but the sacrament of his blood and body. The mystery of the blood and body of the Lord is not an image, but the truth; not a shadow, but the body; not a representation of future things, but that which was prefigured by representations. According to the Song of Songs, the day has dawned, and the shadows have been removed. Christ has come as the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. He has fulfilled the law. Those who sat in the region of the shadow of death have seen a great light. The veil on Moses' face has fallen, and the temple veil has been torn, revealing to us the hidden and unknown.

  <p>
    <s>In what the same bishop said about Christ: 'He himself, the perfecter of the sacrifice and God,</s>
    <s>taking our whole mass from us,'</s>
    <s>he is justly criticized, because, as the human race is called the mass of perdition due to original sin,</s>
    <s>the same bishop recklessly said that Christ took 'our whole mass' from us.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>It is clear that although Christ assumed the entire human nature, namely the flesh with its senses and the soul with its reason, he did not transform divinity into humanity or humanity into divinity, but maintained the properties of both natures.</s>
<s>God the Word took on humanity in the unity of the person, but he did not take on the original sin of man.</s>
<s>Therefore, it is absurd to say that he took on our entire human nature from us.</s>
<s>Thus, he did not take on our entire human nature because he is not believed to have taken on the guilt of original sin, which binds all of humanity before baptism.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The weight of that ancient sin with which we are born is so great that if it is divided with careful consideration, all criminal sins can be found in it.</s>
<s>For there is pride in it because man loved to be in his own power rather than in God's power.</s>
<s>And there is sacrilege because he did not believe God.</s>
<s>And there is murder because he plunged himself into death.</s>
<s>And there is spiritual fornication because the integrity of the human mind was corrupted by the serpent's persuasion.</s>
<s>And there is theft because forbidden food was taken.</s>

<p>
<s>Humanity is so entangled by all these things that even one conceived in lawful marriage can say, “I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins my mother bore me.”</s>
<s>Therefore, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God, took on the nature of man, not the mass of sin.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>But, to return to the point,</s>
</p>


<p>From where we left off, there is some doubt among us about the profession of the same bishop, who is said to have claimed that “Christ took on our entire human nature from us.” Either great ignorance forced him to make this profession or a massive error drove him to say this. For while we want to consider him both learned and orthodox, following the Lord’s example of not wanting anyone to perish, if he lacks either of these qualities, and he truly does lack them, we would rather attribute what he said to ignorance rather than schism.</p>
<p>As for what Deacon Epiphanius said, attempting to justify the worship of images: “Since by raising this inscription of the Lord and by touching the fringes of the inscription, just as one comes to the holy Gospel, because she received healing between this and the Lord's image, a certain herb sprouted, which, when brought near the inscription, cures all ailments.”</p>
<p>We have often said in this work, and it is clearly apparent, that almost all the opinions they expressed in their synod in favor of the worship of images are so clouded by great ignorance that their meaning is hard for readers to grasp. Since the very structure of their most foolish texts does not clearly express what they want to say, it nonetheless has a certain...</p>


  <p>
    There are some clear signs in the midst of obscure words, such as mentions of very well-known names or things. Just like how small flames of torches shine through thick darkness, the reader's mind can sense what they want to express through the words of things and famous objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, if I am not mistaken, Deacon Epiphanius tried to convey in his statement that the woman who was healed from the flow of blood by touching the fringe of the Lord's garment, as mentioned in Matthew 9:20, raised a monument or image in honor of the same Lord. Then she touched the fringes of this image again, under which a certain herb grew. If this herb gradually grew and touched the top of the erected image, it would heal all illnesses.
