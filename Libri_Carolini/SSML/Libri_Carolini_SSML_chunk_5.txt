<p>Nothing should be understood about the face of a man-made image, as they say.</p>
<p>Nothing about the faces of man-made images pertains to what the psalmist says: <w role="amazon:NN">'The</w> <w role="amazon:NN">light</w> <w role="amazon:NN">of</w> <w role="amazon:NN">your</w> <w role="amazon:NN">face,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">Lord,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">is</w> <w role="amazon:NN">signed</w> <w role="amazon:NN">upon</w> <w role="amazon:NN">us'.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">Neither</w> <w role="amazon:NN">does</w> <w role="amazon:NN">this:</w> <w role="amazon:NN">'Your</w> <w role="amazon:NN">face,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">Lord,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">I</w> <w role="amazon:NN">will</w> <w role="amazon:NN">seek',</w> <w role="amazon:NN">cf.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">ib.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">26,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">8.</w></p>
<p>As is held in the reading of that most vain synod, which was made for the worship of images, whose text is nothing but material where folly exercised its greatness.</p>
<p>For if this face, whose light is signed upon us, as the prophet sings, and whom he declares he will seek, is to be understood in the faces of man-made images, it must be greatly questioned what kind of light they have, or how that light is signed upon us, or where the same prophet sought such a face.</p>
<p>For the same holy man sought God in his heart, not in man-made faces, when he said: <w role="amazon:NN">'With</w> <w role="amazon:NN">my</w> <w role="amazon:NN">whole</w> <w role="amazon:NN">heart</w> <w role="amazon:NN">I</w> <w role="amazon:NN">have</w> <w role="amazon:NN">sought</w> <w role="amazon:NN">you,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">God,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">do</w> <w role="amazon:NN">not</w> <w role="amazon:NN">let</w> <w role="amazon:NN">me</w> <w role="amazon:NN">stray</w> <w role="amazon:NN">from</w> <w role="amazon:NN">your</w> <w role="amazon:NN">commands'.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">cf.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">ib.</w> <w role="amazon:NN">118,</w> <w role="amazon:NN">10.</w></p>

    <s>So, He is called radiance because, while the Father is light, the Son proceeds from Him inseparably, like radiance from light.</s>
    <s>He is called the exact representation because, taking on the form of a servant, He demonstrated the image and likeness of the Father in Himself through His works and virtues.</s>

  <p>
    Because they say, "The light of your face, Lord, is signed upon us," to hold to an imaginary face, let them say what it pertains to, which is written in the same period: Many say, "Who will show us good things?" since these two phrases connect with each other in both sense and words, so that one can hardly be understood without the other.
  </p>
  <p>
    For it is a figure of speech called <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpɛnsɪs">pensis</phoneme> by rhetoricians, that is, questioning, to which a response is immediately added without the introduction of characters. This is also called a soliloquy by some, when questions asked by oneself are answered by oneself, as if questioning interrogatively: "Who will show us good things?" is answered by themselves: "The light of your face, Lord, is signed upon us," so that the sense is: Many still thinking carnally say what not a few should have said: "Who will show us good things?" namely, those things that the church always preaches: that the resurrection is coming, in which all the just will receive eternal rewards.
  </p>
  <p>
    For we are promised what we do not see at all; we desire what we do not fully attain here. In responding to them, the benefit is indicated, which is also possessed in the present age: "It is signed," he says, "upon us, the light of your face, Lord," because through the sign of the cross and the light of the Holy Spirit, we are fortified, so that the fraudulent machinations and portentous cunning of the ancient enemy do not prevail.

<p>
Because the king has desired your beauty, for he is your Lord, and the daughters of Tyre will worship him with gifts. And continuing in this same energy, he added to the one whose beauty he said the king desired, saying:
</p>
<p>
All the wealthy people will seek your favor.
</p>
<p>
The face of the church is the teaching of spiritual doctrine. It is said to be sought by the wealthy because many have renounced all the pomp and riches of the world for it, so that they may reach it and through it, soar to the eternal homeland. These are the daughters of Tyre worshiping with gifts, the wealthy people who seek its favor. For there is one church, whose face is sought and by whom it is sought, namely the mother with her children, one bride, one queen, all belonging to Christ their head, who is the eternal and immortal bridegroom. His friend was the one who addressed these wealthy people in this way:
</p>
<p>
Command the wealthy not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth.
</p>


  <p>
    Rarely does uncertainty bring wealth, but trust in God, who provides us with everything in abundance to enjoy. These people are always encouraged by holy teachings to store up a good foundation for the future, so that they may grasp true life by worshiping with their gifts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the rich of the people seek the face of this queen, they gather around her and make offerings in her presence, so they are not excluded from her fellowship. They sought the face of this queen, not her images, those who came to her with gifts and laid what they brought at the apostles' feet. They longed for the face of this queen, not for any painting, and they made offerings to her, not to some senseless image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of them, it is written: The multitude of believers were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed any of their possessions as their own, but everything was held in common. The bride sought to adorn the face of this queen, not with the colors of any painting, but with the wealth of the rich. She said: Sell what you possess, and give alms. Make for yourselves purses that do not wear out, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. However, give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the rich should not come to this queen in hypocrisy with false gifts, as if to seek her face, the Truth itself forbids it.
  </p>


<p>
<s>He says: Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them.</s>
<s>For he truly desires that his face always be clearer and more splendid in the open, as he clearly shows when he says: Let your good deeds shine before men so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>In all these things, there is no worship of images, nor supplication, nor their glory, but either the bridegroom, who is the head, or the bride, who is the body, is undoubtedly shown.</s>
<s>From these senses and the insignia of their adornments, how lacking they are who will beg for your worship, all the rich people of the populace refer to the faces of handmade images.</s>

<s>The inappropriate and delirious statement of Leo the Bishop of Focis, who, in his conversion to the worship of images, applies to himself the verse of the psalmist, saying: You have turned my mourning into dancing; You have removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy.</s>

<p>
I, actio IV; Mansi 1. CAROLI MAGNI CAPITULARE DE IMAGINIBUS.
</p>
<p>
It is known that it was brought forward. He, who indeed, if he presented something seasoned with salt or pertinent to the matter, would appear different from the others and be opposed to the opinions of all. But while he confessed that he had wept in vain, behold, because he did not worship images, and rejoiced, because he had turned away from their worship in vain, more than he had been destroyed and linked with the company of others, it became most evident. For he had, as the same has been said, sadness without harm, joy without profit, the flow of tears without loss, laughable laughter without acquisition, anger without slander, reconciliations without honors, like a child eager to perform some play, if restrained by the nurse, wailing with words interrupted by sobs, to which if he was given the permission by the nurse to perform, he would rejoice with half-formed words shouting, and thus restrained he had empty weepings and permitted to perform, empty laughter nonetheless, because neither in the prohibition was there a cause for weeping nor in the given permission a cause for laughing.
</p>
<p>
For this verse, which he applied to himself in this part in vain, that is: "You have turned my mourning into joy for me and have torn my sackcloth and girded me with gladness," was said by the prophet in the person of the whole church through ethopoeia, which, while it is involved in the mortality and troubles of this world, is said to mourn.
</p>


  <p>
    When someone reaches eternal reward, they will be wrapped in joy. That's why the holiest of the prophets said a little earlier in the same psalm:
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.</s> 
    <s>'Night' means this age of ours, when the end of the world has come, or the day of final judgment.</s> 
    <s>'Morning' actually refers to the time of the resurrection and the rewards of the saints.</s> 
    <s>This is also promised through the prophet Isaiah: The saints in their land will inherit a double portion, meaning after the resurrection, in the eternal homeland, they will enjoy the happiness of both soul and body.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So it is added: Everlasting joy will be for my chosen ones, when I give them their works in truth.</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Then our sackcloth will be torn and we will be wrapped in joy, when, according to the Apostle, this perishable body puts on the imperishable, and this mortal body puts on immortality, and the saying that is written comes true: Death has been swallowed up in victory; or when, in these members that we now put to death on earth, we appear with Christ in glory when He appears, who is our life.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>What does not belong to the worship of images, as the psalmist sang: 'They speak vanity everyone with his neighbor; with flattering lips.'</s>
    <s>Everything that is without benefit is useless; and everything that is useless is vanity.</s>
    <s>Therefore, everything that is without benefit is vanity.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>It is idle and does not lead to progress.</s> 
<s>And everything that does not lead to progress is not without vanity.</s> 
<s>Therefore, everything that is useless is not without vanity.</s> 
<s>For where there is no usefulness, there is no benefit.</s> 
<s>Where there is no benefit, there is utmost vanity.</s> 
<s>Thus, where there is no usefulness, there is utmost vanity.</s> 
<s>In the worship of images, where there is no progress, no benefit, and no usefulness, there is utmost vanity to be believed.</s> 
<s>For this reason, any assembly that makes and gathers councils to establish and defend this, and indeed to worship them thoroughly, is in vain.</s> 
<s>They speak vainly to their neighbors without a doubt.</s> 
<s>For they are not separated from vanity in that they forcefully twist the testimonies of sacred writings to their own senses, just as they interpret this verse of the psalmist, which he sang inspired by the divine spirit in one sense, but they understand it inflated with the pride of vanity in another.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>If, therefore, we ask about whom the prophet has spoken: "They speak vainly to their neighbors", "deceitful lips, they speak evil in their hearts and from their hearts", let us reread the text of the holy gospels, and we will find the Pharisees.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      The groups of Jews always tried to test the Lord and plotted futile plans against Him.
    </s>
    <s>
      When they stubbornly refused to believe in Christ, they didn’t stop speaking vainly.
    </s>
    <s>
      This is also read in another psalm: "They sharpened their tongues like a sword, bent their bows to shoot bitter words, to shoot in secret at the innocent; suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear."
    </s>
    <s>
      To 'sharpen tongues' and 'have deceitful lips' is the same, because it is said in one way, where often what contains is demonstrated by what is contained, or what is contained is shown by what contains it.
    </s>
    <s>
      Similarly, in another psalm, it is written about them: "Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues, the venom of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of curses and bitterness."
    </s>
    <s>
      'Open grave' thus speaks of their lying mouths, who, speaking fatal evil against the Lord, desired to inflict death on Him, and it is called 'open' because of their manifest wickedness, which spread stench rather than fragrance.
    </s>
    <s>
      A comparison of dissimilar things is made through a figure of speech called a parable by grammarians.
    </s>
    <s>
      "They speak vainly, each one to his neighbor."
    </s>
    <s>
      This is therefore the greatest of all vanities, the most stubborn deceit of all deceits, when the Redeemer of the world is not believed in and the same is crucified by wicked men, although for the salvation of others, yet for the damnation of those same men.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    This verse can also be understood in reference to heretics or schismatics, who, while being filled with worldly cunning and inclined towards useless investigations and pointless arguments rather than believing, speak like frogs to each other. Since they think poorly of Christ or the Church, they never stop inviting their neighbors, that is, other heretics, to the same error, so they can more effectively attack the Church, which is the vineyard of Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    About them, it is said in <w role="italics">Song of Songs</w> and in <w role="italics">Matthew</w>: "Catch for us the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, for our vineyard is in bloom." Because when heresies or their followers, the disciples of heretics, are captured in their errors by holy and Catholic men, the vineyard of the Lord, that is, the Church, always flourishes more and more with sacred gifts, so it can continually offer cups of nectar to its farmer, who shed his blood for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This does not concern their parents, as they say: "May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and boastful tongues."
  </p>
  <p>
    The verse, which the psalmist spoke about the deceitful lips and boastful tongues of the unfaithful Jews, who conspired to cunningly capture and kill the Savior of the world, they attribute to their own parents in their synod. Even though they were reckless in their imaginations and detached from the ornaments of the Church.
  </p>


<p>
Although they were incomparably greater, I would not say their recklessness, but indeed their cruelty was also greater. 
<break time="1s" />

<break time="1s" />

<break time="1s" />
They indiscriminately destroyed the ornaments of the churches; they maliciously broke themselves, despising the Lord.
</p>
<p>
The deceitful lips and the boastful tongue of the most treacherous cohort of Jews were evident when they said, 
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="skɪmʊs">"We know</phoneme>
<sub alias="that">, that</sub> God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he is from."

<sub alias="a law">, a law</sub>, and according to that law, he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God?" 
<break time="1s" />

Did they not have a boastful tongue when they said, 
<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="noʊli">"Do not write</phoneme>?"
</p>


<p>
<s>We have no king but Caesar?</s>
<s>From this, it is clear that they are driven by a disgraceful love of images, who, because of their abolition, do not blush to link what was said by the prophet about the treacherous Jews to their own parents and to attack their fellow citizens with the same weapons with which the prophet is known to have pierced the enemies of the church, indeed the enemies of Christ.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>XXVIII. They say that it was fulfilled in their parents, but not in them, what is written: 'The enemies have come to an end with the sword, and you have destroyed their cities.'</s>
<s>But neither was the prophecy of this verse, as they say, fulfilled in their predecessors or parents because they renounced images.</s>
<s>Although they carelessly stripped ornaments dedicated to divine worship, they were far from the wickedness of the ancient enemy to whom this prophecy refers; for the wickedness that happened to the human race through his persuasion is less than the wickedness of the same one who is the author of both his own and human wickedness and the deceitful craftsman, who, being naturally more subtle, is also more cunning in wisdom, and whom the fragility of the body does not burden, sharpening the wickedness of perverse deceit.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, 'the enemies' sword has come to an end,' because the most wicked temptations, as soon as they have been compared to Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes, who is the end without end, to whom when we have come, we have nothing further to seek, completely fail.</s>
<s>And so the prophet says blessed is he who takes the little ones, that is...</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>Thoughts cf. Ephesians 2:20, unreasonable, are dashed against the stone, against Christ, who is indeed the cornerstone.</s>
    <s>Or, as some prefer, the enemies are defeated 'by the sword,' when the sword with which the ancient enemy rages at the end of the age is met by the sword of the almighty God, as mentioned in another psalm: Unless you turn back, He will sharpen His sword.</s>
    <s>And as the prophet Ezekiel says: As I live, says the Lord, I will sharpen my flashing sword and render vengeance to my enemies.</s>
    <s>'Framea' is a Hebrew word used in this context to refer to the sword of the ancient enemy.</s>
    <s>Thus, 'enemies' in this passage is not a nominative plural, as many think, but a genitive singular, meaning: the sword of the enemy, the devil, is defeated.</s>
    <s>This is a rhetorical device called prolepsis, which means anticipation or presumption, where things that should follow are put first.</s>
    <s>This is also found at the beginning of the prophecy of Ezekiel, when it says: And it came to pass in the thirtieth year.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Oh, and in the psalm, it is mentioned when it says: "Its foundation is in the holy mountains."
    Therefore, the psalmist is not talking about the destroyed cities in this place, as those think, the predecessors or parents of them who were overthrown for the abolition of images, but about the unfaithful people or heaps of evil deeds, which the devil inhabits as the walls of his city. He says that they were destroyed by the manifestation of Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, a futile and vain love of images invaded their hearts, who, in order to establish the worship of them, think that what was prophesied about the ancient enemy or the unbelieving Jews was said about their parents or predecessors.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>How should we understand what is written: "Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house"; what beauty do these images understand?</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    The house of God is either the church according to allegory, the heavenly homeland according to anagogy, or the soul of man according to tropology. And therefore, in many places of the Holy Scriptures, when the house of God is read, not walls or some material building, but the spiritual and inestimable dwelling of God is to be understood. Their minds are completely fasting from these hidden meanings, who do not consider the virtues of the church as the 'beauty of the Lord's house', but material images. Did the same eminent prophet see any images or certainly the beauties of walls or the most precious ornaments of the ministries when he said, "Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the place of the dwelling of your glory"?
  </p>


<p>
The glory of the Lord is believed to be in the works of his hands. <break time="1s" /> So, what should be believed?
</p>
<p>
The holy church has 'adornment,' which the prophet loved, meaning spiritual virtues.
</p>
<p>
It has 'gold,' meaning faith or inner understanding.
</p>
<p>
It has 'silver,' meaning confession or the beauty of speech.
</p>
<p>
It has 'silver-plated columns,' meaning holy men adorned with reasonable patience and the beauty of their eloquence. These columns have 'silver bases,' as they are founded upon the stability of the word of God, which is handed down to us by the prophets and apostles.
</p>
<p>
These also have 'golden heads,' because the golden head is the faith of Christ, as the Apostle testifies, saying: For the head of every man is Christ.
</p>
<p>
It also has knowledge from 'incorruptible wood,' which comes through the wood, or the incorruption of chastity, which knows no decay.
</p>
<p>
It has 'fine linen' for virginity, 'scarlet' for the glory of confession, 'purple' for the brilliance of charity, and 'blue' for the hope of the kingdom of heaven. In these materials, its priests are clothed according to David's words, who said: Your priests shall be clothed with justice. Paul also encourages them with these words, saying: Clothe yourselves with compassion. The priests also have other noble garments, as the chosen vessel indicates, saying: Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.

<p>
They said that they were not only going to see images but also to worship them. And they rightfully said, "Just as we heard, so we saw!" 
</p>
<p>
But we, who with God's help try to understand the prophecy of the Psalms spiritually, do not think this refers to handmade images. Instead, we believe it was prophesied about more significant and eminent mysteries. Just as we heard about Christ's coming in the law, we see it in the Gospel. Just as we learned about his incarnation in the prophets, we now see it clearly in the New Testament. Just as we saw it prefigured in the writings and all the holy scriptures—his birth, passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven—we now see it fulfilled in the holy Gospels.
</p>
<p>
And with the Lord's support, we will reach the eternal homeland and see there what we heard about his happiness amidst the troubles of this mortal life. We will say, "Just as we heard, so we saw," meaning: Just as we heard as mortals, we now see as immortals; just as we heard as corruptible beings, we now see as incorruptible; just as we heard in our painful journey, we now see in the happiest land of the living. What we heard when we endured the most turbulent storms of this world, we now see as we enjoy the most delightful peace of paradise. And what we heard when we feared the most perilous shipwreck, we now see as we have reached the safest and most long-desired harbor.

<p>It is said that in the temple he made oxen and lions, and the worship of images might be supported, as those who dream of it and eagerly long for its worship say.</p>
<p>How should we understand what is written in the Song of Songs: "Show me your face and let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely"? They shamelessly brought forth this passage to support the vision of images.</p>
<p>How should we understand what is written by the prophet Isaiah: "There will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt"? They foolishly and ignorantly try to refer this passage to the worship of images.</p>
<p>Most absurdly and recklessly, against those who despise worshipping images, there is a testimony from the holy gospel brought forward by those who do worship them: "No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket."</p>
<p>Regarding what they say to confirm their error, that blessed Silvester, bishop of the city of Rome, brought images of the apostles to Emperor Constantine, although it is not read that he ordered them to be worshipped.</p>
<p>That the sentence of blessed Athanasius, bishop of the city of Alexandria, should not be understood as they think it should, who try to fit it to the worship of images.</p>
<p>That they falsely cite the sentence of blessed Ambrose, bishop of the city of Milan, from the third book, chapter nine, to support their error.</p>

        First, those who wish to uphold the veneration of images through it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The blessed Augustine did not say this about physical images, as they claimed.</s>
        <s>What is the image of God, if not the face of God, in which the people of God are marked?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        Concerning Gregory of Nyssa, whose testimonies they exploit to support their error, his life and preaching are unknown to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        The testimony they brought from the sixth council does not pertain to the veneration of images.
    </p>
    <p>
        The opinion of John, the Bishop of Constantinople, which they use to justify the veneration of images, is not recognized as relevant to what they think.
    </p>
    <p>
        The statement of the blessed Cyril, in his exposition of the Gospel according to Matthew, does not pertain to the veneration of images, as they claim.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not against the Christian religion, as they say, to refrain from honoring and worshiping images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those who erect images so as not to forget the saints or the Lord himself do not have a good memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is against the teachings of the blessed Gregory, Bishop of Rome, to worship or break images.
    </p>
    <p>
        When nothing should be worshipped except God alone, it is one thing to honor a man with acts of charity and greeting, and another to worship manufactured images.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowhere is it established by the examples or words of the apostles, as they chatter, that images should be worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is no small error to attempt to equate manufactured images with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, as they try to do in their council.
