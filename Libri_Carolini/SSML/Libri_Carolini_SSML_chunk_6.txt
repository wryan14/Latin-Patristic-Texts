<s>Those who destroyed the city of Jerusalem and burned the temple of the Lord are understood to be those who despise worshipping images, especially since it is one thing to remove the great bronze sea and the two cherubim and other vessels and ornaments from the temple, and quite another to refuse to worship man-made images.</s>
<s>It is one thing to consign the beauty of the temple to the flames of the city's destruction, and quite another to avoid the adoration of images.</s>
<s>It is one thing to cruelly demolish the Holy of Holies, and quite another to wisely prevent the bending of the necks to pictures in worship.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>Finally, anyone who wishes to know about whom the psalmist spoke when he said, "How the enemy has acted maliciously in your holy place," is not only taught by the histories of the Books of Kings and the deeds of the Romans, which recount the past destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the temple, but also instructed by the prophecy of the distinguished prophet David.</s>
<s>He foretold the future calamities of the aforementioned city and the destruction of that most sacred temple in a figure of speech known as prolepsis, speaking of future events as if they were past, saying, "God, the nations have invaded your inheritance, they have defiled your holy temple, they have made Jerusalem a heap of ruins," and so on.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>And in the psalm from which this verse comes, which we are now discussing, it says, "How the enemy has acted maliciously in your holy place!</s> 
<s>All who hate you have boasted in the midst of your sanctuary.</s>
<s>They have set up their standards, standards that were not recognized, as if on the top of a path, as if in a forest of trees.</s>
<s>They have cut down its doors with axes and hammers.</s>
<s>They have set your sanctuary on fire."</s>
</p>


  <p>
    They have defiled your sanctuary on earth. This is also expressed more clearly in another psalm: The wild boar from the forest destroys it, and the singular beast feeds on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    But let no one be troubled that it does not say, "How much the enemies have done evil," but rather, "How much it has done evil." Notice that this is said through a figure of speech, which is called <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɪˈlɛp.sɪs">silemsis</phoneme>. Through this, many are represented by one, as in the gospel: And the thieves who were crucified with him insulted him; or: Those who sought the child's life have died; and one is represented by many, as it is written in Exodus: Pray to the Lord, that He may take away the serpents from us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <w role="ivona:V">Psalms</w> 77, 45: He sent among them the biting fly, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. And if anyone examines it more subtly according to mystical understanding, it is not incongruent to refer to the holy church.

<p>They understand the heresies and the malicious ones within it, who always try to infest it with corrupt teachings. <s>However, it will be understood by none of those who have sound and sober understanding, and who despise the worship of images.</s> <s>Therefore, the more those who think this verse was spoken about them are lacking in sound sense, the more surely they remain in their senses, who do not worship images.</s></p>
<p>II. As for what does not pertain to this matter, as they say, what is written: "There is no longer a prophet, and we no longer recognize," this verse is also inappropriately placed in the reading of the same synod, because it is neither our voice, who worship the Father in spirit and truth, nor the voice of those who try to worship God and His saints in images.</p>
<p>Because we have a great prophet, Jesus Christ, our Lord, of whom it is said through Moses: "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet, you shall listen to him," whom we also have as an advocate before the Father according to the apostle, whom we daily behold with spiritual eyes, and whose prophecies we are diligently taught.</p>
<p>But the Jews lament their destruction, dispersions, calamities, and deaths of their people, as well as the destruction of the temple, the abolition of ceremonies, the departure from prophecy, and the recession from the knowledge of God, and they say: "There is no longer a prophet, and we no longer recognize," which was also foretold by the prophet Hosea, who said.</p>


<p>
<s>For many days, the children of Israel will sit without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an altar and without an ephod and without teraphim.</s> 
<s>He also added about their conversion to faith, which we believe will happen towards the end of the world:</s>
<s>And after this, the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king and will fear the Lord and His goodness in the last days.</s>
</p> 
<p>
<s>How should we understand this: 'Lord, in your city, you will reduce their image to nothing'; which indeed they understand differently than it was said?</s>
<s>The city of God is sometimes figuratively understood in the holy scriptures as the soul of a man, which is inhabited by God, as the scripture says: I will dwell in them; and again: The soul of the just is the seat of wisdom.</s>
<s>Sometimes it is understood as the church of the present time, which the river of God makes joyful, and to which the prophet says: If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten;</s>
<s>often it is understood as the heavenly Jerusalem, constructed with the ranks of patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, and other faithful.</s>
<s>Of which the Apostle says: But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</s>
<s>To which also the Lord promises through the prophet Isaiah: Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not wane forever.</s>
<s>Which also John says he saw in the Apocalypse.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>Coming down from heaven, adorned with jewelry,</s> 
<s>of which almost innumerable things could be said about its happiness,</s> 
<s>which cannot be covered in the brief style of this writing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In this city, the images of the wicked will be reduced to nothing,</s> 
<s>because their appearance cannot be seen by the divine eyes;</s> 
<s>but just as they defiled the image of the Lord in the course of this present life,</s> 
<s>so in the heavenly Jerusalem their image will not appear,</s> 
<s>and they will be handed over to eternal fire.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>About them, it is said elsewhere by the psalmist:</s>
<s>And man, when he was in honor, did not understand;</s> 
<s>he was compared to the senseless animals and became like them,</s> 
<s>because, although he was in such honor,</s> 
<s>created in the image and likeness of God,</s> 
<s>he did not understand and fell into such a pit of vices,</s> 
<s>that he deservedly was compared to the irrational animals.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, the images of the wicked are reduced to nothing,</s> 
<s>when the Truth itself withdraws from them,</s> 
<s>they are alienated from its light,</s> 
<s>and cannot retain the likeness,</s> 
<s>remaining without happiness everywhere.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Because of their deceitfulness,</s>
<s>they are deprived of this happiness.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>
You said that they have been placed in high places, but God, the just judge, gives to each according to their works.
</s>
<s>
You also said that they were cast down when they were lifted up, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
</s>
<s>
You said they suddenly failed and perished because of their iniquity, like a dream upon waking.
</s>
<s>
For just as the hearts of mortals are deceived by certain illusions in dreams, and they are suddenly joyful thinking they have obtained all that they desired—whether it be someone gaining a coveted kingdom, another elevated to a desired office, someone suddenly becoming wealthy after escaping poverty, another enjoying a desired marriage, someone weak celebrating the recovery of lost limbs, a disreputable person rejoicing in newfound honor, an unknown person becoming noble, or a foolish person thinking themselves wise—they suddenly lose all these things upon waking and regret not being able to see with open eyes what they rejoiced to see while closed, the happiness of the wicked is seen as a kind of dream.
</s>
<s>
Because after a short time, it will not be seen; and just as those awake lose what they suddenly gained in a dream, so too do the dying lose what they seemed to have.
</s>
<s>
For the deceptive joy they gained is lost in a moment, and the vain, if I may say, smoky joys of the world cannot be held for long.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Because of their impieties, the prophet, as if kindled with a certain severity, added:
</s>
<s>
Lord, in your city, their image will not be seen.
</s>
</p>


    <p>
        <s>When you reduce something to nothing, it means: those who have stained the honor of your character with bad deeds will not be seen in your city, where there is eternal happiness, utmost blessedness, and everlasting joy.</s>
        <s>In its palaces reigns the king, whose kingdom will have no end, whose seats shine with the senate of patriarchs, whose courts glow with the prophets, whose walls are adorned with the numerous army of martyrs, whose gates are decorated with the gatherings of apostles, whose streets overflow with the choirs of virgins, whose homes are full of confessors' legions.</s>
        <s>It does not need the sun, because the Lord is its light, and in all its ways, 'Alleluia' is sung.</s>

        <s>Revelation 19:1</s>
        <s>IV. How should we understand what the psalmist sang: 'Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kissed.'?</s>
        <s>This was rashly and flatteringly interpreted by John the Presbyter and the delegate of the Easterners in their participation.</s>
    </p>

    </p>


<p>
<s>It is said that the mercy and truth met each other, and that justice and peace embraced each other, as David the most excellent of prophets elegantly sang.</s> 
<s>This is confirmed to have been fulfilled when, after the incarnation of the Lord, the two Testaments were brought together in a single union.</s>  
<s>Although they seem diverse from each other in some way, they are known to converge into one path in Christ, who is our peace and who has made the two one.</s> 
<s>Mercy is known in the new, through which humanity is freed by grace, and truth in the old, where the proclamation of the law and the prophets is contained.</s> 
<s>These two are said to have met not to create opposition, but to fulfill the promised grace of perfection.</s> 
<s>It is indeed confirmed that one was made, which is proven to be divided by times, so that David, the singer of the covenant, might clearly express this, repeating it with various names.</s> 
<s>Embracing each other in a certain affection, justice and peace immediately entered into mutual harmony.</s> 
<s>This verse is known to have been spoken both according to somatopoeia, that is, the attribution of bodily forms to things, and through metaphor, that is, the transfer of meanings from words and things, often from animals to inanimate objects and from inanimate objects to animals.</s> 
<s>These two figures of speech differ in that one attributes bodies to corporeal things.</s> 
</p>


<p>
<s>
It gives bodies to the incorporeal, both limbs and movements to physical things, and to the incorporeal, both limbs and movements and forms.
</s>
<s>
Finally, John the priest rashly and flatteringly uttered this verse in the presence of the venerable Pope Adrian and Bishop Tarasius of Constantinople.
</s>
<s>
Although this priest was lower in honor than the bishops present in the same synod, he is not read to have been lesser in error.
</s>
<s>
Although they preceded him in the height of their rank, they were surpassed by him in much talkative forwardness and could not be surpassed by the prelates in reckless verbosity, who, although subject to the prelates, surpassed them in pontifical dignities.
</s>
<s>
Especially, he is believed to have committed a double offense in this matter, either by attempting to turn the words full of the mysteries revealed by the Holy Spirit to human matters with a superstitious intention of worshiping images, or by having fallen into the miserable vice of flatteries blinded by the same perverse intention.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
This vice of adulation was feared by that most noble prophet who said: "Let the righteous strike me, it shall be a kindness; and let him rebuke me, it shall be as excellent oil which shall not break my head."
</s>
<s>
Hence, another scripture also says: "It is better to be rebuked by the righteous than to be praised by the sinner," and again: "Those who call them happy lead them into error; because flatterers praise to entice, not to provoke to eternal happiness, which indeed needs no good."
</s>
</p>


  <p>
    The passage pertains to images, as they say, because it is written: "Exalt the Lord our God and worship at his footstool, for he is holy." This verse from the psalmist is a source of error for those who worship images so much that they hold synods to establish and defend it, using testimonies from the holy scriptures to support their stance. They believe they can protect themselves by hearing that the footstool of the Lord is to be worshipped. They think they have a helmet that protects their head so they won't feel the impact of a flashing sword. They believe they have armor that protects the rest of their body, so they won't lose their stability from the blows of arrows. They think they have found protection with this shield, which defends them from the attacks of spears.
  </p>


<p>
He should not fear the harmful flight. <s> But either he will perish by dying or escape by hiding, stripped of these defenses. </s> <s> Just as he has misused these things in vain and uselessly, he will feel the sharpness of the spiritual sword brought by holy men, to the point where he believes he has no strength left. </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Is it because the prophet commands the footstool of the Lord to be worshipped that the worship of images should be established? </s> <s> What similarity is there between the footstool of the Lord's feet and material images? </s> <s> Or what connection is there between the indescribable works of God and images created by any artisans? </s> <s> Or what association is there between such an excellent and glorious mystery and lifeless figures crafted by human ingenuity? </s> <s> Or where was it established that images should be worshipped, just as it was established that the footstool of the Lord's feet should be worshipped? </s> <s> For David did not say: 'Worship the images of certain saints,' as he said: 'Worship the footstool of the Lord's feet.' </s> <s> Nor did the Lord say: 'The works of human hands are my seat, and images are the footstool of my feet.' </s> <s> But He said: 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet.' </s>
</p>
<p>
<s> Listen then, most foolish, or rather most insane error, listen, incomparable madness, listen, ridiculous sluggishness, listen to blessed Ambrose teaching what the footstool of the Lord's feet is or how it should be worshipped: </s> <s> The apostles worshipped the Lord because they bore witness to the faith and received the teaching of the faith. </s> <s> The angels also worshipped, of whom it is written: 'And let all his angels worship him.' </s>
</p>


<p>They worship not only His divinity but also the footstool of His feet because it is holy. And shortly after:</p>
<p>But lest anyone might seem to avoid the example set forth, let us consider how it pertains to the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, as the prophet says, 'And worship the footstool of His feet.' We should not evaluate the footstool from a human perspective. For God is not physical nor limited, so we should not think of the footstool as a literal support for His feet. Nor do we read that anything should be worshipped apart from God, for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.'</p>
<p>How then does the prophet, who was raised and educated under the law, command something against the law? This is no small question, so let us consider carefully what the footstool is. Elsewhere, we read: 'Heaven is my throne, but the earth is the footstool of my feet.' Yet we are not to worship the earth because it is a creation of God. However, let us see if the prophet speaks of worshipping that earth which the Lord Jesus took on in the assumption of flesh. Therefore, the footstool is understood to be the earth, and by earth, the flesh of Christ, which we worship in the mysteries today and which the apostles worshipped in the Lord Jesus, as we mentioned above. For Christ is not divided, but one; nor was He denied to be born of a virgin when worshipped as the Son of God. Therefore, since the mystery of the incarnation is to be worshipped, and the incarnation is the work of the Holy Spirit, as it is written: 'The Spirit...</p>


  <p>
    <s> The holy one will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. </s>
    <s> And the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. </s>
    <s> This is also the footstool of the Lord. </s>
    <s> Saint Augustine, the most diligent researcher, said that the body of the Lord should be venerated. </s>
    <s> Without a doubt, the Holy Spirit should also be worshipped. </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s> What was taken from the Virgin Mary, the footstool of His divinity, should be felt due to the nature of humanity which He deigned to assume. </s>
    <s> It is so subject and united to that power that it is evident to all creatures as being superior, as the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 1:25, 'What is weak in God is stronger than men.' </s>
    <s> And elsewhere about the same mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, the Apostle says: 'For this reason, God exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.' </s>
  </p>


<p>
The beginnings, which always persist in the omnipotent glory of their nature like the tireless stability of feet, are understood.
</p>
<p>
It can also be interpreted metaphorically that the feet of the Lord signify the end times when the Lord deigned to become incarnate. Hence, the evangelist John says: "Little children, it is the last hour." The apostle Paul also says: "When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law."
</p>
<p>
It should be noted, indeed, that it does not say: "because it is holy," but: "because He is holy," namely, the body of the Lord is not separated from divinity, keeping the property of both natures intact, but it is referred to one person. Hence, the gospel says: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us."
</p>
<p>
These brief proclamations about the footstool of the Lord should suffice. Now, let's move on to other matters.
</p>
<p>
VI. The worship of images cannot be established from this, as they think, because it is written: "Worship at His holy mountain."
</p>
<p>
Nor can the worship of images be established from this, as they admit, because the same holy prophet sings: "Worship at His holy mountain," not the mountain itself, but "worship the Lord on the holy mountain," as the same holy man sings in harmonious modulation. Even if he commanded the mountain to be worshipped, it would not mean the worship of images, but the worship of the Lord Jesus Christ from sound minds, who is the mountain higher than all mountains, whose height and power surpass all the heights of the saints.
</p>


<p>
<s>And he stands out for his virtues.</s> 
<s>About him, it is said through the prophet Isaiah: And in the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will be prepared on the top of the mountains and will be lifted above the hills, and all nations will flow to it, and many people will go.</s>
<s>Therefore, let it be said: Worship on his holy mountain because it is not this mountain, but the 'holy mountain' that the prophet commands us to worship the Lord on, which can undoubtedly be referred to as Mount Zion, which is the church.</s>
<s>It is the mountain of mountains and the holy of holies, whose inhabitant is Christ himself.</s>
<s>Therefore, the Lord rightly commands us to worship him on the holy mountain, for just as his praise is fitting for the upright, so too the place of his worship cannot be unworthy.</s>
<s>We therefore worship on his 'holy mountain,' not images or certain superstitious things, but the same Lord who is the head of that mountain, and in order to acquire that mountain, he not only deemed it worthy to be born but also to die.</s>
<s>About whom it is said through the prophet: He brought them to the mountain of his sanctification, this mountain which his right hand acquired, and about which it is said through the lawgiver: You brought them in and planted them on the mountain of your inheritance, the place you prepared, Lord; your sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have prepared.</s>
<s>Lord, you reign forever and ever.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      This is not, as they boast, said because of those who worship images:
    </s>
    <s>
      "For the Lord will not leave the rod of the wicked on the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity."
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      It is not surprising if they are mistaken in small matters, who are mistaken in great ones.
    </s>
    <s>
      Their error is all the more astonishing, in that they boast of being righteous because they worship images, while we, who scorn to worship them, are called sinners by them.
    </s>
    <s>
      For out of love for these images, they attempt to violate the purity of the divine Scriptures, and they consider this to be the benefit of their faith.
    </s>
    <s>
      They strive with obstinate minds to anathematize those who, rejecting these and other such vanities, serve only God and worship Him.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      How, therefore, the text of this verse does not pertain to the same matter for which it was brought up by them, or how it is believed to contradict their sense, or how much it differs from their opinion, is clear not only to simple readers, but even to the unlearned.
    </s>
    <s>
      For it clearly shows, setting aside enigmatic or allegorical coverings, that the Lord will not allow the righteous to be scourged by the wicked for long, lest they fall into the pit of despair, being long subjected to scourges.
    </s>
    <s>
      But if, for a time, they are tested by some adversities...

  <p>
    He soothes them, and after a long time, he helps them again so that their innocence remains unshaken.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It is not because of those who despise the worship of images, that through the prophet it is said: "The Lord will bring those who turn to obligation to those doing iniquity."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, we chose to include this verse individually in our work because, although it is part of the text of a single psalm, it differs in meaning.</s> 
    <s>And although it is cited by them to support one error, it is placed in a different part of the often-mentioned synod reading.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So, those turning to obligation are not those who despise the superstitious worship of images, but those who, ensnared by the bonds of the ancient enemy, are prone to iniquity and the more they sin, the tighter they are bound by diabolic chains.</s>
    <s>As a wise man once said: "Each one is bound by the ropes of their sins."</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>About this obligation, the holy prophet Isaiah also says: "Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as if with a cart rope!"</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, those who turn to this obligation will be brought by the Lord to those who do iniquity because, with whom they sin in this world, with them they will be condemned in the future and will go to the fire prepared for the author of crimes and his angels.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    They neglected to break away from it. <s> May He, who redeemed us into freedom, free us from this obligation. </s> <s> To us who were sitting in darkness, He showed a great light of His brightness, or to those living in the shadow of death, He Himself rose as the true light. </s> <s> And may the same one keep us free from the harshest condemnation, who made us followers of His very clear faith, hope, and love. </s>

    <s> What cannot be established by what is said about Solomon in the temple, </s> <s> as those dream who yearn for their adoration of images. </s> <s> Solomon is read to have set up oxen and lions in the temple, whose establishment teaches us, who know the law to be spiritual according to the Apostle, certain deep mysteries. </s> <s> But those who love the adoration of images try to establish the vanity of their folly. </s> <s> We are taught through mystical meanings, they are strengthened in the magnitude of their error. </s> <s> We, warned by the shadow, seek the truth; they, deceived by a well-done deed, take authority for a deed not to be done. </s>

      If he should be blamed for this, because from what he did well, the wicked take a bad example, then a lawgiver should be blamed just as much, who raised up a thing necessary for many in the wilderness, which the wicked will of men later used wrongly.

  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, we should not reject the images created for the memory of past deeds and the beauty of the basilicas, as we know from Moses and Solomon that they were made, even in symbolic figures, but we should restrain their most insolent or rather most superstitious worship, which we have not found established by the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, or apostolic men.

  <p>
    <s>
      But to return to the point, Solomon made oxen and lions in the temple because Christ established apostles and their successors in the church, who, according to the blessed Gregory’s opinion, are companions to those doing well through humility and are raised against the vices of wrongdoers through the zeal of justice, so that the meekness of the ox sustains these and the fierceness of the lion stimulates those.
    </s>
    <s>
      Both of these can be gathered from the example of the church pastor, who, using the humility of Cornelius, soothed with gentle words.

    <s>The face of the church, which Christ addresses with tender names, sometimes calling it a dove, sometimes beautiful, sometimes a friend, commanding it to rise, that is, to believe, to hurry, to grow in good works, to return, to approach eternal reward, is not physical but spiritual.</s>

<s>What is written in the Song of Songs should be understood not in a carnal, but in a spiritual way.</s> 
<s>If this verse can be applied to some physical thing, as those who dream and attribute it to a vision of images, then everything written about the bride of Christ, the Church, and its members would have to be believed to be physical.</s> 
<s>And if all these things are fitting not for visible members, but for invisible virtues, then the face of the Church should be understood as an invisible virtue rather than a vision of some image.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, the face of the Church is the recognition of its virtues, whose beauty is loved by the bridegroom.</s> 
<s>Through the prophet, it is said to her: "For the king has desired your beauty."</s> 
<s>Christ thus encourages the Church to "show him her face," which means to always contemplate him in faith and works, so she can say with Elijah: "The Lord lives, in whose presence I stand";</s> 
<s>not to be among those whom the prophet marks by saying: "They turned their backs to me, and not their faces."</s> 
<s>He also encourages her to let her "voice sound in his ears," because he is ready to hear his saints, as the psalmist testifies, saying: "The righteous cried out, and the Lord heard them and delivered them from all their troubles."</s> 
<s>He says her voice is sweet and her face is beautiful because the prayers of the saints are always accepted by God, and their presence is pleasing to Him.</s>

  <p>
    And they accepted, so that they might remain in the beauty of justice. Let it be, it is fitting that this verse can be adapted to the vision of images: "Show me your face" or "Your face is beautiful," what can be said about the voice, which the prophet both sweetly sings and urges to be heard? Indeed, if souls are not nourished, much less do they enjoy the voice. And if they do not enjoy the voice, much less do they attain the sweetness of the voice. Therefore, if souls are not nourished, they do not attain the sweetness of the voice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, it is clearly evident that just as in other assertions of theirs in this matter, statements not pertinent to the matter are frustrated, so also in this part they are frustrated, especially since it cannot be rightly said about the vision of their face: "Show me your face," nor about their voice, which they utterly lack: "Let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful."

      XI. "How is it to be understood that it is written by the prophet Isaiah: 'There will be an altar of the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt,' which they foolishly and unlearnedly try to refer to the worship of images?"

      Josephus narrates that this prophecy was fulfilled in Onias the priest, who, fleeing to Egypt, descended with many groups of Jews and built an altar and a temple there.

        Near its boundary, it will be a sign and a testimony to the Lord of Hosts in the land of Egypt; as if it openly declared: "There will be faith in the world and the preaching of the gospel, through which the manifestation of the Lord's passion and our redemption will be proclaimed."

        Most absurdly and recklessly, against those who despise the worship of images, the testimony of the holy gospel was brought forward by those who adore them:

    <p>
        "No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket." <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="mæθ">Matthew</phoneme> 5:15.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is an inconsistent and laughable thing that certain things, I don't know in what sense, are written in the reading of the same vanity about us, who despise the worship of images, from those things which the Lord, sending out his disciples to preach, instructed them to have great confidence in preaching and, so that they would not hide in terror of their persecutors and be like a lamp under a basket, but, putting aside all fear, they should present themselves with all the insignia of freedom and proclaim on the rooftops what they had heard in the chambers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, let them place their lamp, that is, the worship of images, by adoring it at the height of their faith; but we, if we have any splendor of knowledge, let us place it in Christ, who is the source of light, so that we may be able to exhibit the splendor of the word and example to those who remain with us in the house of the holy church.

    <s>Images were brought to Emperor Constantine, although it is not read that he was ordered to worship them!</s>
    <s>Often in this specific work of ours about images, we are compelled to admit that they are not to be kept but to be worshiped, nor should the sight of them in the decorations of basilicas and the memory of established deeds be avoided, but the most insolent or rather the most superstitious adoration should be condemned.</s>
    <s>Thus, just as in other cases, so in this example the assertion will be frustrated, which tries to support its error in the worship of images, claiming that Silvester, bishop of the Roman church, is read to have brought images of the apostles to Emperor Constantine.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, he brought them to him to see, not to worship.</s>
    <s>He brought them not to compel him to worship, whom he urged to turn away from the cult of idols and to fly to the worship of God alone, but so that the same emperor, whom he had seen in dreams, might recognize their faces in the paintings.</s>
    <s>He brought them not to instruct someone fleeing the worship of idols to yield to the worship of images and to be killed by the rigor of an internal sword after being freed from the enemy's blade, but to lift his mind through known things to unknown things, so that he might see with the eye of the mind those whom he could not see with the physical eye, not yet freed from the stains of paganism by spiritual miracles.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    One of them had images made with physical tools. Even though he was told to worship these, he did not. Perhaps he might have commanded it so that, being a worshiper of visible things, he could be guided to the invisible through the visible, not to bring us back from the invisible to the visible. And for us, who have the strength to grasp solid food, it would not be necessary to return to milk like infants. If those who could not yet handle solid food through the tenderness of faith were given milk without deceit, they would grow with it. Hence, the Apostle gave the newly formed church, coming from circumcision and gentility, spiritual milk and simple food, meaning teachings easier to understand and lighter commands to follow. These would nurture carnal minds in a sort of infancy to make them capable of receiving the food of spiritual mysteries.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Book of Acts of the Blessed Silvester, where it is written about images brought to Emperor Constantine, it can be resisted because, although many Catholics read it, it is not fully reliable for confirming the matters in question. This is more clearly demonstrated in the book of the Blessed Gelasius, Bishop of the Roman city, titled 'Decretal on Accepting or Not Accepting Books'.

    XIV. The sentence of the Blessed Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, should not be understood in the way they think it should be.
  </p>


<p>
<s>They try to fit this to the worship of images.</s>
<s>The opinion of Blessed Athanasius, the bishop of the city of Alexandria, which they have inconsistently brought forward to support their greatest error, is revealed to be entirely unrelated to this matter, just as the rest of the testimonies of the divine Scriptures they have cited.</s>
<s>Since it does not mention even slightly any worship of images, but he said that images made from the same material and element could be restored in comparison to the thing being discussed, saying:</s>
<s>"Just as what is written on wood, once the shape is erased by external filth, must be restored and united again to what the shape belongs."</s>
</p>


<p>So that an image can be renewed in the same material and element. For through its form and the material itself, <break time="0.5s" /> where it is written, it is not erased, but it is shaped in that same material.</p>
<p>Let them say, therefore, that this statement supports their argument; let them say where they are inclined to worship images. And when they cannot assert this, it remains to be understood by sound minds as it was expressed by the venerable man.</p>
<p>They wrongly use the statement of the blessed Ambrose, bishop of Milan, from the third book, chapter nine, to support their grave error, those who wish to affirm the worship of images through his words. For those who dare to distort the words of the holy preachers will easily dare to distort the divine law and the oracles of the prophets. Nor will they fear to introduce some violence into the teachings of the younger ones to support their error, who do not fear to bring injury to the doctrines of the elders, indeed to the elders themselves. Therefore, they are said to have confused the order, sense, and words of the statement of the blessed Ambrose, priest of the church of Milan, to favor their error.</p>
<p>In order, because it is not found in the third book, chapter nine, as they dream, but in the ninth book. In sense, because, when he said, "Do we divide Christ when we worship both his divinity and his flesh?" they said, "Do we not divide Christ when we worship both his divinity and his flesh?" This small addition of the subjunctive conjunction 'ne' brings such a great loss of meaning to the sentence that it changes it completely.</p>

Let us discuss those things individually that have been falsified. For he, affirming the one person of the true God and true man in the properties of the two natures, said: Do we separate Christ when we worship both His divinity and His flesh? Do we separate Him when we venerate in Him the image of God and the cross? But they, striving to assert from this statement the worship of images, said: 'Do we separate Christ when we worship both His divinity and His flesh? Or, when we venerate in Him both the image of God and the cross, do we separate Him?' by the image of God, which is Christ, and by the cross, which in this place is set for the mortality of His flesh, wishing to introduce the worship of images with a stubborn mind.

XVI. What blessed Augustine said was not for material images, as they say: 'What is the image of God, if not the face of God, imprinted on the people of God?'
</p>
<p>
No one has ever seen God, says the apostle John, except the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father. And the same supreme majesty said to Moses: For no man shall see me and live. If He is invisible, or rather because...
</p>


<p>
He is invisible, so he must be incorporeal; and if he is incorporeal, he cannot be depicted physically. Therefore, if he is invisible and incorporeal, he cannot be depicted with physical materials at all. Hence, we must more diligently ask what is the 'image of God' or his 'face' in which the people of God are marked.
</p>
<p>
Let us then ask the distinguished preacher. Perhaps we can learn from him what is the 'image of God'. Tell us, chosen vessel, tell us, teacher of the nations, what is the image of God. 
</p>
<p>
'We give thanks to God the Father, who has made us worthy to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light, who has delivered us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, who is the image of the invisible God. I have spoken of the image, I will also speak of the figure: In these last days, God has spoken to us through his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom he made the ages, who is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.' 
</p>
<p>
Behold, we have learned from the teaching of the Apostle Paul that Christ is the image of God, and they urge that material images should be understood in this way. He says that the same Son, who is one in substance with the Father, is the image of God and the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being, and they say that the figures prepared by the skill of craftsmen are the image of God. Oh, abominable error! Oh, shameless madness!
</p>


<p>
<s>
Oh, reckless madness, burning with such love for images, that you are not ashamed to compare those things said about the only begotten Son of God to material figures!
</s>
<s>
Let the most holy Augustine also say what 'the image of God' is, which he is accused by them of saying exists in a material form.
</s>
<s>
For he says, "In God, the condition of time does not exist; for it cannot be rightly seen that God generated the Son in time, through whom He created time; consequently, the image is not only His because it is from Him, and the likeness because it is an image, but also such equality that no interval of time can be an impediment."
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
So you too, most holy Ambrose, say what you are known to believe about this image.
</s>
<s>
Defend blessed Augustine, who was converted to the rudiments of faith by you with God's favor, whom you now see being infamously accused by the worshipers of images.
</s>
<s>
Provide him support so that he may be freed from the weight of such a great crime, he who was once freed through you.
