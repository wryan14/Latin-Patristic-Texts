    I wanted to release the Capitulary of Charlemagne about images earlier, but the edition of the text faced various difficulties, including the calamities of war and resource shortages, which significantly delayed the process. The index, which I have prepared and completed, is currently stored away and cannot be published at this time. Given these circumstances, although reluctantly, I have decided to make the text itself public now, leaving the publication of the index for more fortunate times.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding its origin, structure, content, church-political authority, manuscripts and editions, the scholarly debate about the authenticity of this capitulary, the capitulary itself and the so-called Hadrianic capitulary, the author and his theological teachings, especially what it indicated about venerable images—that they should be kept merely 'in memory of past events and for the decoration of churches' without any veneration—I have discussed these matters in Neues Archiv für Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde volumes 36, pages 631-666, and volume 37, pages 455-533. I believe these discussions do not require further supplements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I trust that all this is not unknown to readers, it still seems not entirely unnecessary to remind them that the praised chapter is preserved in the Vatican manuscript codex Latin 7207 and its copy in the Arsenal Library codex number 663. Additionally, the renowned John Mercati reported another manuscript in the Vatican Library in Bessarion volume 37, page 112. Even if this manuscript happens to finally come to light, it will not affect the authority of the text from codex Vat. lat. 7207, which I have transcribed.
  </p>


<p>
The neatly and clearly written material, even if it initially appears that the writer intended to provide an amended copy, I have shown that it cannot be overturned in any way. Was that lost book the one sent by Emperor Charles to Pope Hadrian? Or another copy like codex 663? I will discuss my thoughts on this matter elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I cannot publish the book without expressing my deepest gratitude to those distinguished men who supported this edition: His Eminence Francis Ehrle, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, who was formerly the head of the Vatican Library, and the Most Reverend John Mercati, who currently holds this office. To Albert Ehrhardt, now a professor at the University of Bonn, and especially to Richard Salomon, a professor at the University of Hamburg, who helped me in proofreading the pages and assisted me in every way with their work and advice.

    <p>
        Since we have taken up the reins of governance in the kingdom by the Lord's granting, <break time="500ms" /> it is necessary that, with Christ's help, we strive with all our might for its defense and exaltation.
    </p>


<p>
So that we may be considered good and faithful servants by him. This is not only for us, who have been entrusted with ruling in the turbulent battles of this age, but also for all who have been nurtured by his abundance, to observe diligently. However, it is necessary that:
</p>
<p>
We, according to the divine mercy, defend the holy church of Christ from the attacks of pagans and the devastation by infidels with arms externally, and internally strengthen it with the recognition of the Catholic faith. You, most holy father, with your hands raised to God like Moses, should support our army.
</p>
<p>
Alcuin to Charles: Happy is the people that rejoices in such a ruler, in whose prosperity the safety of all consists. For what the apostolic fathers once accomplished in their writings for the confirmation of the Catholic faith in various parts of the world, your most holy diligence does not cease to fulfill. We proclaim this wonderful and special gift of Christ's devotion in you, that you strive with such dedication to cleanse and protect the churches of Christ from the doctrines of the faithless internally, as you attempt to defend or expand them from the devastation of pagans externally. With these two swords, the divine power has armed your venerable excellence on the right and left: in which you are a praiseworthy victor and glorious conqueror.
</p>
<p>
Alcuin to Charles: Behold, in you alone rests the entire salvation of the churches of Christ. Alcuin to Charles: O defender of the churches of God, through your prosperity.
</p>


  <p>
    May the Christian empire be protected, and the Catholic faith be defended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alcuin to Charles: From this, it can be clearly recognized that not only is the imperial power of your wisdom given by God for the governance of the world, but especially for the protection of the church and the enhancement of wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    One should never separate from His union, who is known to be a member of it, for whoever is not with it is against it, and whoever does not gather with it, scatters. Therefore, we are compelled to speak on this matter, which we do not pursue without a certain sorrow of the soul, as we are taught by the apostolic example to be weak with the weak and to burn with those who are scandalized.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inflamed ambition of vain arrogance and the most insolent desire for empty praise has incited certain people of the eastern regions, not only kings but also priests, to the extent that they disregarded sound and sober doctrine, and belittled that apostolic saying: If anyone preaches to you a gospel other than what has been preached, even if it is an angel, let him be accursed. And they, transgressing the prophetic instruction and the boundaries of the elders, attempt to impose upon the church through infamous and most inept synods what neither the Savior nor the apostles are known to have imposed. And while they strive to elevate the height of their own praise, they accumulate great guilt upon their souls, and while they wish to consign the order of their deeds to the memory of posterity.
  </p>


<p>
<s>Yes, they tear apart the bond of church unity.</s>
<s>Years ago, in parts of Bithynia, a certain council was held with such reckless and indiscreet boldness that they carelessly abolished images placed in church decorations and commemorations of historical events from ancient times.</s>
<s>They did this without caution, and with a rejection that went against what the Lord commanded about idols in Leviticus 26.</s>
<s>They committed the same action towards all images, not understanding that an image is a type, while an idol is a specific kind, and that a specific kind cannot be referred to as a type, or vice versa.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For although almost every idol is an image, not every image is an idol.</s>
<s>An idol and an image have very different definitions.</s>
<s>An image is made to adorn or to show achievements, while an idol is made only to entice the souls of the misguided with sacrilegious rites and empty superstitions.</s>
<s>An image is said to refer to something else, whereas an idol refers to itself.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>These people, blinded by the darkness of such folly, included among their errors this idea: that their king, Constantine, had freed them from idols.</s>
<s>To him who rejoices like a giant to run his course, about whom it is said "Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has triumphed," they wished to deny the title of victory by attributing it to their king.</s>
<s>The prophet had predicted not about their king, but about the true conqueror, Christ: "Behold, the Lord will ascend upon a light cloud and will enter."</s>
</p>


  <p>
    Egypt will tremble before him, and the idols of Egypt will be destroyed in his presence. The light cloud represents a human body, which he took from a virgin without the stain of human corruption. Egypt is meant to symbolize the world, which he promised to reshape through Jeremiah with almost the same words, saying: "I will destroy the idols and make the false gods of Memphis cease."
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, nearly three years ago, another council was held in those parts by the successors of those who had conducted the previous one. Many who were present at the first council were also said to be present at this one. Although this council differed in intent from the first, it did not differ in error; and though the matter is different, the disgrace is the same. And while it came later in time, it did not come later in wrongdoing. Not surprisingly, they seem to flow into the same pit of hell, although they drift through different paths, as they are believed to stem from the same source of pride and vain glory.
  </p>


<p>
<s>He compels the previous administrators to worship images, which the previous one had not even allowed to be seen.</s> 
<s>And wherever they found any mention of images, whether in the places of the Divine Scripture or in the commentaries of the holy fathers, they twist it to suit their own will for adoration.</s> 
<s>These people are no less absurdly connected in 'having' and 'adoring' than those were in image and idol, as those thought image and idol to be the same, and these think 'having' and 'adoring' to be one and the same, which are different both in nature and in the way they are discussed.</s> 
<s>For although those differ greatly in kind, they are at least connected in that one is a species and the other a genus, but these are connected neither by genus nor by species nor by any such association, as things can be adored which are not possessed, and things can be possessed which are not adored.</s> 
</p>
<p>
<s>Thus, casting away the reins of moderation and disregarding what was not incongruously said by the ancients in the proverb: "Nothing in excess," they proceed through the byways, as if someone, caring to impose temperance on a person given to much talking, the latter, on the contrary, studies silence so much that he becomes mute.</s> 
<s>And to whom unrestrained talkativeness brought shame, equally brings shame through idle silence.</s> 
<s>Or if a doctor reproves a patient for drunkenness, the latter, thinking to obey the doctor's orders, forbids himself not only wine but also any liquid, so that he who was previously languishing from too much wine might become weak from lack of moisture.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Your soul, deprived of all refreshing drink, languishes from thirst, parched and dry, even though the cause of your suffering might be different, the effect remains the same: the error of laziness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Meanwhile, neither side, neither these nor those, are bound by the reins of temperance, but both rush headlong down precipitous paths and diverge in their courses, yet they converge at one point: the bride of Christ, the church, to whom He says in the Song of Songs: "You are altogether beautiful, my love, and there is no flaw in you."
    </s>
    <s>
      They try to impose blemishes on her, while some seek to strip her of her virtues and others misuse them, either by removing her adornments or by promoting the worship of those adornments.
    </s>
    <s>
      Both of these evils, as we have said, spring from the fountain of vanity.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      While they seek human approval and wish to be called Rabbi by men, and they set their praises at the top of their agendas, not considering what a wise man once said: "Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips."
    </s>
    <s>
      Abandoning the traditions of the ancient fathers, who decreed not to worship images but allowed them as church ornaments, they strive to impose new and unusual regulations on the church, which add blemish rather than beauty.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if it is vanity to impose new regulations on the church, it is a schism, which should not occur in the church.
    </s>
    <s>
      And if it is a schism, it is a blemish, which is denied to be in the bride.
    </s>
    <s>
      So if it is vanity to impose new regulations on the church, it is a blemish.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>There is no doubt about it, it is denied that she can be a bride.</s>
    <s>Therefore, as stated in John 3:29, it is understood that one cannot be a friend of the bridegroom who seeks to accumulate glory for himself, by not fearing to obscure the wisdom of the church with errors.</s>
    <s>Thus, if the bride should not be stained, no one should attempt to stain her.</s>
    <s>If no one should attempt to stain her, then whoever does so wrongs the bridegroom.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If therefore the bride should not be stained — and truly she should not be — whoever attempts to stain her wrongs the bridegroom.</s>
    <s>We, content with the prophetic, evangelical, and apostolic writings and the teachings of the holy orthodox fathers, who in no way deviated in their doctrines from Him who is the way, the truth, and the life, and imbued with the teachings of the six holy and universal councils, which were convened by the holy and venerable fathers to address various heresies, reject all new ideas and foolish inventions.</s>
    <s>We not only do not accept them, but we also despise them as filth, just as we despise the council held in Bithynia for its impudent tradition of image worship.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The text of its writings, lacking eloquence and sense, has reached us.</s>
    <s>We were compelled to write against its errors, so that if by chance it tries to pollute the hands of those holding it or the ears of those listening to it, it may be repelled by the authority of our pen, armed with the divine scriptures.</s>
    <s>And thus, it may be rendered inactive or rather unarmed.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>
The enemy coming from the east will be struck down in the west by the judgment of the holy fathers, brought to us by God.
</s>
<s>
We have undertaken this work with the agreement of the priests in the kingdom granted to us by God, for the Catholic flocks of prelates, not with arrogance and pride, but with zeal for God and the pursuit of truth.
</s>
<s>
For just as it is holy to adhere to just and honest things, it is certainly a sin to accommodate oneself to the worst and most disordered things.
</s>
<s>
Thus, David offered to God as a pure sacrifice that he fled from the company of evildoers, when he said, "I hated the congregation of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked."
</s>
<s>
And Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, was rebuked by the Lord through a prophet for being allied with the worst king of the Israelite nation.
</s>
<s>
So, the founders of the aforementioned two synods are neither lacking in the skill of speech, as the Apostle claims to be unskilled in speech but not in knowledge, nor in the eloquence combined with spiritual sense, of which it is said in the Song of Songs of the Church from the perspective of the holy preachers: "We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver."
</s>
<s>
We find it strange that they are so inflated by the wind of such vanity that they not only dared to disturb these things but also tried to count them among the six venerable synods.
</s>
<s>
Neither of them should be counted as the seventh after Nicaea, but rather either the third, preserved after Ariminum, or the second, destroyed earlier.
</s>
<s>
In the following, when the matter demands, we will explain this more carefully with the Lord's guidance.
</s>

<p>We will not dispute. <break time="500ms" /> 
These things, of course, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="haʊd sɛkʊs">are not</phoneme> to be compared with the six synods, just as the altar of the Reubenites, Gadites, and half-tribe of Manasseh cannot be compared to the altar established by the Lord's command through the legislator. <s>Its authors would have faced the fury of the Israelite swords if humble confession mixed with prayers had not preempted brotherly anger.</s> <s>We, indeed, have been taught by the prophecy of Isaiah, who says: "This is the way, walk in it, you will not turn to the right or to the left,"</s> and warned by the teaching of the Apostle to the Gentiles, who directs us to the way.</p>
<p>Anastasius the librarian of Rome considered it improper and inconvenient that the seventh synod (i.e., the Second Council of Nicaea) <sub alias="should not have a Latin version">should not be available in Latin</sub>; <s>not because it had never been translated before, but because the translator followed the word-for-word idiom of both languages so closely that it was either barely or never understood, and thus it became tedious to read, leading almost everyone to despise it for this reason.</s> <s>Therefore, Anastasius made another translation, which he dedicated to Pope John VIII.</s> Anastasius and the author of this Capitular had the same translation in mind.</p>

The Capitulary of Charlemagne concerning Images.
</p>
<p>
He established the royal policy of keeping images in the decorations of churches and as a memory of past events, and worshipping only God and offering appropriate veneration to His saints. We neither break them nor worship them, but we reject the writing of that most foolish synod, which not only lacks the eloquence to express small things humbly, moderate things temperately, and great things grandly, but also neglects the style of simple speech. We strive to be followers of our teacher, namely the Lord's Word, in every way. Since, therefore, the confused discussions of the aforementioned synod contain fathers anathematizing their sons and sons anathematizing their fathers, our style, with the Lord's favor, will arrange a mixed criticism of both, leaving nothing undiscussed, nothing untouched, nothing hidden in the caves of silence, except perhaps what difficulty may conceal.

It is known to arise from one kind. This third way, no less than the previous two, refuses to rule with us simultaneously, as our nature is not at all known to be joined with its certain substance and distinguished by a certain form. Although it is present everywhere through the power of divinity, it cannot rightly be said to co-rule with anyone. For to be everywhere is one thing, to be with someone at the same time is another; to rule ineffably is one thing, to co-rule with anyone is another.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, 'to co-rule' and 'to sit together' and many such phrases, if expressed absolutely without indicating anyone to whom one might co-rule or sit together, designate two or more ruling or sitting together at the same time. But if someone is said to co-rule or sit together with someone, it signifies that the one who co-rules or sits together with is preceded, and the other participates.

We share in Christ's suffering when, out of love for Him who endured the pain of the cross for us, we crucify our flesh—that is, the world with its sins and desires (Galatians 5:24). We die to the world and rise with Christ, and in doing so, we crucify the flesh, meaning the body (Galatians 6:14, Colossians 2:20), so that we may trample its desires. For we are buried with Him through baptism into death (Romans 6:4), so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the power of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. And thus, being baptized, we are buried with Him, so that from then on we may follow this life in which Christ rose. Baptism is the pledge and image of the resurrection, so that, remaining in Christ's teachings, we do not return to past sins. We are made alive and rise with Him if we are united in the likeness of His death (Romans 6:5), that is, if in baptism we renounce all sins and are transferred to a new life, no longer sinning (Romans 6:6). The likeness of His death has granted us a similar resurrection. We are co-heirs and co-participants with Him, not because any possession is divided among us, but because He Himself is our inheritance and possession. For the Lord has said, "The Lord is your inheritance" (Deuteronomy 18:2); and elsewhere, "The Lord is my portion and my inheritance" (Psalm 16:5). We are united in body, even though we have different graces (Ecclesiasticus 45:27).

  <p>
    Therefore, they sin greatly, and in no way should they be believed to cooperate or reign together. So, if that which the Apostle says, "If we endure, we will also reign with him," is considered by anyone to offer some help in this matter, they should understand that this is different based on three reasons: person, time, and merit.
  </p>
  <p>
    By person, because it is not said that he will reign with the saints, but that the saints will reign with him; by time, because it is not said that they have reigned or are reigning, but that they will reign; by merit, because not just anyone, but only the saints will reign with him. For he says, "If we endure, we will also reign with him," meaning if we endure in this age, we will reign in the future or certainly after the judgment, when we will no longer see him through a mirror and in riddles, but face to face. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For if we are still in this world, we still endure; if we still endure, we do not yet reign. So, if we are still in this world, we do not yet reign. Moreover, if we reign with him, what is perfect has already come; if what is perfect has already come, then what is partial has been done away with. But what is partial has not been done away with, so we do not yet reign with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, if the saints, as long as they are in this world, do not reign with him, much less does he reign with them, whose is the kingdom and the power, and whose is the reign.
  </p>


<p>
<s>If there will be no end, and if he does not reign with the saints, he certainly cannot be said to reign with sinners.</s>
<s>But we have learned from the Apostle John that the saints will reign with him.</s>
<s>For he says, "Beloved, it has not yet appeared what we shall be; but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."</s>
<s>So, 'when he appears, what we shall be' means immortal and glorious, in which 'we shall be like him'.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>He said 'like', not 'equal'.</s>
<s>Like, of course, not in bodily resemblance, but in the inner person, as the blessed Augustine says in his letter to the virgin Italica:</s>
<s>"Who would be so foolish as to say that we are or will be similar to God in body?</s>
<s>So, this likeness is in the inner person."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>"Therefore, we shall see him as he is," when according to his promise, he reveals himself to those who love him, existing without end.</s>
<s>In this, we will see God, celebrating the eternal Sabbath's solemnity infinitely, as the Lord says to us:</s>
<s>"Be still and know that I am God."</s>
<s>All these things will not be fulfilled in the saints until, according to the Apostle, "this mortal puts on immortality and this corruptible puts on incorruption."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For if we reign with him, what we shall be has already appeared;</s>
<s>if what we shall be has already appeared, we are already like him;</s>
<s>if we are already like him, we already see him as he is.</s>
<s>But we do not yet see him as he is, so we do not yet reign with him.</s>
<s>Therefore, he reigns in us, not 'reigns with' us, he reigns, indeed, according to...</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>According to the blessed Augustine's opinion, in believers, because he was weakened even to the cross and death.</s> 
<s>In this way, the Son properly reigns in the faith of believers.</s> 
<s>For the Father cannot be said or believed to be incarnate, judged, or crucified.</s> 
<s>Through the form in which he is equal to the Father, he reigns in those who contemplate the truth, but does not reign with us, because he does not share in our kingdom.</s> 
<s>For his kingdom is properly his own, as we discussed earlier.</s> 
<s>We do not yet reign with him as long as we are clothed in this mortal body.</s> 
<s>We hope to do so through his mercy, when, according to the contemplation of the higher truth, to attain blessedness without any movement of the soul or resistance from any part of the body, no one will love personal power.</s> 
<s>God will be all in all.</s>
