For the Father alone is not from another, therefore he alone is called unbegotten, not indeed in the Scriptures, but in the custom of those disputing and bringing forth a discourse on such a great matter, as they could, for the benefit of the present or future. The Son alone is born from the Father, therefore he alone is called begotten. The Holy Spirit alone proceeds from the Father and the Son, therefore he alone is called the Spirit of both. For he proceeds from both, not being born, so that he cannot be called the son of anyone. But he would be called the son of the Father and the Son, if, which repels the senses of all, both had begotten him; therefore he is not begotten by both, but proceeds from both as the Spirit of both. However, our Lord Jesus Christ taught the disciples that he proceeds from the Father, saying: "When the Paraclete comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me." And again, the Mediator of God and men, the Lord.

    <s>the Father is unbegotten, the Son is begotten, and the Holy Spirit is neither created nor begotten, but proceeds from the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>Thus, in the confession of faith, all opinions and new expressions should be avoided, and the confession of the faithful should be reinforced by the words and meanings set forth by the holy and universal synods in the creed.</s>

    <s>It is reported that Tarasius said, but as we mentioned, from the Father and the Son, because the Holy Spirit does not need the assistance of the Son to be God or to be of the Father.</s>
    <s>Just as he is consubstantial with the Father and the Son, he does not need the Son's assistance to proceed from the Father.</s>
    <s>As it is natural for God's omnipotence to be God, it is also natural for the Holy Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>The preposition 'through' should be avoided in the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father to prevent any discomfort for strong minds or any perceived danger for weaker ones.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>All these dangers can be easily avoided if we use the same words and meanings that the holy fathers Hilary, Athanasius, Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, and others, well-known to almost all Latin readers, used to confess the Catholic faith.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Even if we find in the works of some writers, whose lives and preaching are unknown to us, a confession that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, we suspend both praise and criticism, not knowing whether it was due to their simplicity or a translation from another language.</s>

    If a new necessity arises demanding unusual words in the confession of the holy faith, we want those who might pass over such words simply to follow the teachings of those foremost teachers and revered doctors whom the holy church keeps and venerates.

  <p>
    In the Capitulare of Charlemagne on Images, we have said in the previous chapter that a clear and transparent definition must be made in the confession of the holy faith. We reiterate this now because, unless the discourse proceeds straightforwardly, avoiding all ambiguities to demonstrate the truth, listeners may doubt the integrity of the faith of the speaker, and it may seem to approach heretical depravity, even if not in intention, but in tone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, care must be taken that in the profession of faith by Bishop Theodore, when he says the Father is 'without beginning' and acknowledges the Son as 'not having any other beginning than the Father and having his subsistence from the Father', the Father and the Son are not seen as different in time, but co-eternal.
  </p>


  <p>
    It is either substance, which is of the same substance as itself, or honor, which is equal to itself, that it is suspected to precede. Although this is rightly and catholically believed by the aforementioned man, it is nevertheless put so ambiguously that a suspicion of his faith might arise for the reader, which often is caused not by weak belief, but by the difficulty of the language. Since it is not clearly evident in this profession whether his faith should be approved or disapproved, and since our intention is more to approve than to disapprove, it remains that we briefly explain what we have learned, believe, and hold from the holy fathers on this matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    For in such a profession, it is to be feared that while the Father is said to be 'without beginning' and the Son is said to 'recognize no other beginning but the Father', the Father might be suspected to be older than the Son because He begot Him, and the Son to be younger than the Father because He was begotten, since evidently nothing in the Holy Trinity is earlier or later, where nothing begins with time to be completed in time. As the three persons are of the same substance, so too are they co-eternal. And the generation of the Son from the Father is understood to be without time, as is also the procession of the Holy Spirit from both. For the Father is the beginning of the Son, not by creating, but by begetting; not by preceding in time, but by ineffably begetting an ineffable Son, co-eternal with Himself, without whom He never was. And the Son is the beginning, not of the Father, but of the things created by Him. And the Holy Spirit is the beginning of all things.

<s>They are connected by the creator because they cannot be separated from the name of the creator.</s> 
<s>The Father and the Son are the source of the Holy Spirit, not by creating, because he is not a creature, but by giving, because he proceeds from both.</s> 
<s>Likewise, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one source for all things created by the one and only creator.</s> 
<s>And while the Father is the source, the Son is the source, and the Holy Spirit is the source, they are not three sources but one source, one divinity, one substance, one omnipotence.</s> 
<s>These things, which we have briefly touched upon, must be approved by the words of the distinguished preacher Augustine.</s> 
<s>For he says: Therefore, the Father is said to be relative, and likewise, the source is said to be relative, and if anything else, the Father is so called in relation to the Son.</s> 
<s>But the source is in relation to all things that come from him.</s> 
<s>Likewise, the Son is said to be relative, and he is called the Word and the image; and in all these terms, he refers to the Father, but none of these terms are used for the Father.</s> 
<s>The Son is called the source; for when he was asked, 'Who are you?' he replied, 'The source, because I speak to you.'</s> 
<s>But is he the source of the Father? Certainly not, because he is a creature.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>He wanted to show that he was the beginning, just as the Father is the beginning of creation, from whom all things come.</s> 
<s>For the creator is also called relative to the creature, just as a master to a servant.</s> 
<s>Therefore, when we say both the Father and the Son are the beginning, we do not mean two beginnings of creation, because the Father and the Son together are one beginning of creation, just as there is one creator, just as there is one God.</s> 
<s>If something remains in itself and "generates" or performs any work, it is the beginning of the thing it generates or the thing it works on.</s> 
<s>We cannot deny that the Holy Spirit is rightly called the beginning, because we do not separate him from the title of creator; and it is written of him that he works and, of course, remains in himself as he works.</s> 
<s>He does not change or turn into what he works on.</s> 
<s>And, as the Apostle says, "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good; to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit," and so on.</s> 
<s>Likewise, shortly after, he says: Even if we are individually asked about the Holy Spirit, we rarely respond that he is God; and with the Father and the Son, he is likewise called God.</s> 
<s>Therefore, God is called one beginning relative to creation, not two or three beginnings.</s> 
<s>But within the Trinity, if the generator is to what it generates, the Father is the beginning to the Son, because he begot him.</s>

    <s>
      The Father is considered the source of the Spirit since it is said, "The Spirit proceeds from the Father."
    </s>
    <s>
      This raises a question.
    </s>
    <s>
      Because if this is true, it doesn't only mean that He creates or makes, but also that He gives.
    </s>
    <s>
      This also clarifies why the Son is not also the Holy Spirit, as it is read in the gospel.
    </s>
    <s>
      The Spirit proceeds from the Father not in the way the Son is born, but in the way He is given; therefore, He is not called the Son because He is neither born as the only begotten nor made, as one could be born through grace into adoption.
    </s>
    <s>
      What is from the Father by nature refers only to the Father when He is called the Son, and thus the Son is of the Father, not ours.
    </s>
    <s>
      But what is given refers both to the giver and to those who receive it.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, the Holy Spirit is not only of the Father and the Son, who gave Him, but also ours, who received Him.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as salvation is called "the Lord's salvation" because He gives it, and it is also our salvation because we receive it.
    </s>
    <s>
      Likewise, shortly after, it says:
    </s>
    <s>
      If what is given has its source in the giver, since it did not receive it from elsewhere, then it must be admitted that the Father and the Son together are the source of the Holy Spirit.
    </s>
    <s>
      Not two sources, but just as the Father and the Son are one God and one Creator and one Lord relative to creation, so too they are one source relative to the Holy Spirit.
    </s>
    <s>
      To creation, however, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one source.

        <s>In the same way, there is one creator and one Lord.</s>
        <s>Tarasius did not correctly call the Holy Spirit "a fellow tribe member of the Father and the Son" when it would have been sufficient to say "co-eternal, consubstantial, and of the same essence and nature."</s>
        <s>Tarasius is also reported to have stated in his profession of faith that the Holy Spirit is "a fellow tribe member of the Father and the Son."</s>
        <s>This statement is completely absurd and must be utterly rejected from the confession of the Catholic faith, not only by those who are skilled in literary discipline but also by those who use only common letters.</s>
        <s>It is completely refuted and dismissed in every way.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>It is easy to understand that just as "blood relatives" are called those who are of one blood, "partners" are those who share one lot, and "contemporaries" are those of one age, who are also called "coevals," and "conformers" are those of one form, so "fellow tribe members" are called those who are of one tribe.</s>
        <s>This spoken preposition holds the force such that, wherever it is placed in the composition of words, it demonstrates that different things are cohered together.</s>
        <s>Just as in this composition, when we call two or more people "fellow tribe members," we clearly refer to those who are from one tribe.</s>
    </p>


<p>
<s>We have shown the tribe's nature.</s> 
<s>'Tribe' means a group of people either descending from one ancestor, like the twelve tribes known to come from Jacob, or serving a single purpose, like the Roman people divided into three classes by the founder of Rome at the city's beginning: namely senators, soldiers, and commoners.</s> 
<s>Thus, the etymology of this name is preserved to this day, and those who lead them are called 'tribunes.'</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>However, in God, who is the supreme good, a singular peak of all things, one in substance, three in persons, the term 'contribulus' cannot be found.</s> 
<s>This is because 'contribulus' can only be found where a tribe is found.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The Holy Spirit is not a 'contribulus' with the Father and the Son, but consubstantial with them.</s> 
<s>If He were a 'contribulus,' He would only be joined by a societal relationship, which is profane to say.</s> 
<s>If He were joined solely by a societal relationship, which is not only absurd to believe but also impious, He would not be consubstantial.</s> 
<s>But He is consubstantial with the Father and the Son; therefore, He should not be believed or called a 'contribulus' to them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>In the confession of such a great mystery, it suffices to say the Holy Spirit is coessential, coeternal, and coequal with the Father and the Son, of one power and glory, so that in three persons the unity of substance, power, and glory of the supreme God is believed and confessed by Catholics.</s>
<s>He is the blessed God over all things forever.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>So, whoever thinks this name should be rightly used for the Holy Trinity and supports it with arguments, should read the thirteen books of the blessed Hilary and the fifteen books of the most holy Augustine, which discuss the same holy and ineffable Trinity very subtly and forcefully.</s>
<s>In these books, if they do not find the name of the Holy Trinity used, they should not presume to apply it, because if it were at all suitable for the confession of holy faith, it would not escape the dense forests of so many discussions, nor would it be foreign to such eloquent and learned men skilled in Latin, if it were not alien to error.</s>
<s>They should also read the works of other Catholic fathers on faith, and when they do not find mention of this name in such a high and distinguished matter, they should recognize that it was found elsewhere in vain.</s>
<s>Because if it is found anywhere outside of these discussions in the confession of holy faith, it should be attributed either to a lack of eloquence, which proceeds from inexperience, or to the peculiarity of another language, which often loses its force when translated into another language.</s>

<p>
<s>VI. Concerning what Basil, the bishop of Ancyra, mentioned in his reading of faith after the confession of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the kissing and reverence of images and relics.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    Saying that he has faith, he partakes in their sanctification, but he remains silent about the remission of sins or the resurrection of the flesh or the life to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remission of sins, which was omitted by Basil, bishop of Ancyra, in his confession of faith, must be considered among the greatest gifts of ecclesiastical dignity. The prophet praises it with great commendation, saying that those are blessed whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The voice of the word, the voice of wisdom, the friend of the bridegroom among the first thunders of the evangelical trumpet, proclaimed as it is written, "And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
  </p>
  <p>
    This was dedicated by the Mediator between God and humans, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, with the compassion with which he came to redeem the world. He both forgave certain people’s sins before his passion and offered himself as a sacrifice to God the Father to cleanse the sins of the whole world. So that the Church might continually achieve this, he granted the ineffable gift of the Spirit and the indelible sign of his character, and the life-giving sacrament of the most holy baptism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The apostles, in the sharing of faith, as they were about to depart from one another, like a certain...
  </p>


<p>
They established the rule of sweetness and preaching, and it is said that after the confession of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, they placed it in the brevity of such a word, about which it was spoken through the prophet: "The Lord will make a short word upon the earth." They did not delay placing this because they saw that without this, the sincerity of faith could not be complete. Neither did the brevity of this symbol hinder them from its profession, which the integrity of sacred faith and the venerable sublimity of such a great gift demanded. For it is done through the Holy Spirit, 
<break time="1s" />
through whom sins are forgiven, or through the blood of Christ, which we receive in the sacrament and which was shed for us for the forgiveness of sins. It is also done through the water of baptism, in which the ancient and obsolete wound of original sin is washed away. Therefore, the apostle says that three bear witness: the spirit, the blood, and the water, and these three are one, because through the Holy Spirit, the blood of Christ, and the water of baptism, we reach one end, which is the remission of sins. 
<break time="1s" />
One of the doctors, who clearly explained what the new song is, listed among the other novelties that were completed in the incarnation of Christ, saying: It is new for the Son of God to become a man, it is new for him to be handed over to death by men, it is new to rise on the third day, it is new to ascend to heaven in the body, and it is new for the forgiveness of sins to be given to men. Therefore, he said that the remission of sins is new.

    <p>
        The writings of the holy fathers in the profession of faith have been read; for even a soldier, who once fought or is going to fight someday, is not criticized for not fighting temporarily, but if he flees and disgraces his nobility and weakens the strength of his comrades by setting a bad example. The aforementioned bishop said, after professing the adoration and kissing of images among the foremost defenses of his faith, that he had faith in participating in their sanctification. And rightly so, because things that are not only devoid of sanctification but also of life are not worthy of such participation.
    </p>
    <p>
        He, who after the holy and unique confession of the Trinity, said he had faith in such trifles and neglected those things that should be counted among the foremost graces of the Christian religion, namely, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come, acted negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let it be granted, for argument's sake, that it is useful to adore images! What is taken away from the Christian religion if the profession of this matter is not given among the first professions of faith, since there are many things which, although they are part of the ecclesiastical traditions handed down to the faithful, if their profession is silent in the confession of faith, nothing is taken away from the holy religion because of it? Or in what way does it prejudice...

<s>For the omission of the worship of images does not harm the purity of the holy faith, which was forbidden rather than instituted, in the same way that the omission of the remission of sins, the resurrection of the flesh, and the life of the world to come in confession does not harm it, since these are preached throughout all the holy Scriptures and, as we have said before, are held in the symbol of faith with praiseworthy brevity by the apostles.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s>We have rightly shown that Basil, Bishop of Ancyra, was to be blamed in the previous chapter, because he neglected to build upon the foundation of his faith and the structure of such an excellent mystery, choosing instead to build things that must be entirely rejected from the fabric of any religion.</s> 
<s>In the present case, however, we decide that Theodosius, Bishop of Amorium, is more appropriately and competently to be blamed, for he, without setting any foundation for his faith in the aforementioned synod, began to build things that are utterly vain and unreasonable.</s>

    If a building, which was pointlessly erected, <w role="amazon:NN">falls</w> down, at least that which was well-built will remain; but in this case, if everything that is empty and frivolous is removed, there will be nothing left. So, if someone is rightly criticized for adding the adoration of images to the confession of the Holy and Unique Trinity, much more rightly will this person be criticized, who, having set aside the confession of that highest and ineffable mystery, has dreamed only of some frivolous adoration of those images.
  </p>
  <p>
    For he thus began: 'I confess and promise and accept and kiss and adore the images.' O what a miraculous confession of the bishop! O what beautiful words of the priest! O what praiseworthy devotion of the prelate! He is silent about the confession of the most excellent majesty and loudly proclaims the confession of the most insolent vanity. He withdraws from the confession of Him who said: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɔmnɪs ˈkwɪ me">Omnis qui me</phoneme> <sub alias="confessed">confessus</sub> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfwerɪt kɔram ˈhɔmɪnɪbus">fuerit coram hominibus</phoneme>, I will also confess him before my Father in heaven; and he advances entirely into the confession of images. He is silent about what he should have confessed and encouraged others to confess, and confessed what he should neither have confessed nor encouraged others to confess; and he, who should have stood in the breach for the house of Israel, and stood firm.

    <phoneme ph="kay">K</phoneme>ing Charlemagne's Decree on Images.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      In the battle on the day of the Lord, he disgracefully surrenders, alas! voluntarily; because, indeed, he who ought to have restrained the minds of others from wrong confession and ridiculous error through diligent preaching, himself becomes the first example of wrong confession, leading them astray.
    </s>
    <s>
      Regarding his condemnation of all who do not teach the entire beloved people of Christ to worship and venerate the images of all saints, who have pleased God from the beginning, how absurdly and recklessly he acts! A wise reader will consider this, especially since he imposes an anathema on others with reckless presumption, turning it irreverently upon himself and his followers.
    </s>
    <s>
      The weapon with which he tries to pierce the error of others, he turns upon his own and his citizens' destruction. Nor does the worship of images free his followers from the binding of the anathema, which he tried to impose solely on outsiders.
    </s>
    <s>
      For he condemns those who do not teach the entire beloved people of Christ to worship images. Can it be that, to keep silent about others, among the people entrusted to him, all teach the entire beloved people of Christ to worship images, those who neither have the duty of teaching nor the rank of preaching?
    </s>
    <s>
      Does he himself teach the entire beloved people of Christ? For, indeed, almost the whole world is filled with the people of Christ, since God is no longer known only in Judea, but the sound of the apostles has gone out into all the earth, and the whole world is filled.

    <s>And the glory of the Lord shall be seen by all.</s>
    <s>Isaiah 6:3.</s>
    <s>There, 2:2.</s>
    <s>The nations will come together and worship in the presence of the Lord, just as Malachi prophesied in the word of the Lord.</s>
    <s>Psalm 21:28.</s>
    <s>Malachi 1:11.</s>
    <s>The Lord says: From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place pure offerings are brought to me.</s>
    <s>The shepherd of the church, who is shown the entire world full of different peoples in the form of different kinds of creatures, says: In truth, I have come to understand that God does not show favoritism, but in every nation, the one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.</s>
    <s>Acts 10:34-35.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For if according to his decree, anyone who does not instruct the whole people beloved by Christ is worthy of anathema, then neither he nor the bishops who were said to be present at the same synod, nor the people subject to them, can escape the bond of anathema, because even if they instruct the peoples of two or three or certainly several provinces, they do not instruct the whole people beloved by Christ.</s>
    <s>Since the Catholic Church, which is indeed the people beloved by Christ, is spread throughout such vast and extensive parts of the world, and is expanded by the generosity of the Lord among inaccessible and unknown nations.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, either he will thoroughly instruct the entire church of Christ from east to west, from north to south, in the worship of images, or according to the judgment of his own vanity, he and his associates or subjects will be subject to anathema.</s>
    <s>Judith 8:23.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>Since, even if they could "instruct all the people," they could not have the images of all the saints who have pleased God from the beginning of time, in whose veneration they would instruct the entirety of the people.</s>
<s>The number of these saints is so great that, as it is said through the prophet in Psalm 138:17-18, in the voice of the Son to the Father: "Your friends are greatly honored, God, their dominion is greatly strengthened."</s>
<s>"I will count them, and they will multiply more than the sand."</s>
<s>Although this is said hyperbolically, such are the multitudes of those who have pleased God from the beginning, as referenced in Judith 8:23 and 9:16, that they cannot be painted or counted by anyone except by Him, in whose book their names are written, as referenced in Revelation 7:9 and 13:8.</s>
<s>For if the bishop who proclaimed this wishes to avoid the loss of anathema, it is necessary for him to have and venerate the images of all the saints who have pleased God from the beginning in various parts of the world.</s>
<s>And if he cannot have them due to their multitude, because he cannot have them, he should submit to the anathema he proclaimed himself.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>VIII. It is almost a matter of doubt for everyone, with some confessing that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father, while others confess that He proceeds neither from the Father nor the Son.</s>
<s>Concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, as far as the brevity of this style to which we aspire allows, it was shown with the Lord's help in the preceding parts.</s>

<p>
Nain, almost everyone at the mentioned synod either remained completely silent on this matter or spoke about it ambiguously. As people with human weaknesses and limited knowledge, we neither testify to the faith of those who remained silent nor to those who spoke ambiguously. We don't deny their belief simply because they were silent or ambiguous about it since we don't know how they truly hold their beliefs. However, to avoid seeming to agree by remaining silent, and because it's not clearly explained what is meant, we leave this matter to the judgment of the one who knows all secrets. 
</p>
<p>
We know that they are not far from error, who, if they stray from it because they think rightly about this matter, still come close to it because they fail to confess correctly what they believe rightly. What is believed rightly in the heart must be confessed rightly with the mouth for salvation.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the possibility that an error in the statements of the aforementioned bishops about faith might remain unexamined due to the difficulty and complexity of their words, it will remain with him who often is so covered in laziness that it's not clear what he means or what sense is to be understood from it.
</p>
<p>
Since there are many forms of expression taught extensively and variously by grammarians and rhetoricians, all series of words or expressions are divided into four types. Every speech is either wise and clear or wise and...
</p>

```

<p>
<s>He is not eloquent, or eloquent but not wise, or neither wise nor eloquent.</s> 
<s>Therefore, he is both wise and eloquent, like many books of the divine Scriptures and, to mention others, like the book of the prophet Isaiah, whose speech is both wise, as it was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and eloquent, because it was delivered by a distinguished and urbane man.</s> 
<s>However, some are wise but not eloquent, as is found in certain divine Scriptures:</s> 
<s>that is, they are wise in the heights of their divinely inspired teachings but not eloquent due to the simplicity of the holy men from whom they originated, who preferred the depth of meaning over the beauty of words, or due to the native speech patterns of the people among whom these holy men were born or lived, as it is said of the blessed Jeremiah by Jerome, who noted that the simplicity of his speech came from his birthplace in Anathoth.</s>
<s>On the other hand, some are eloquent but not wise, like the writers of the pagans.</s>
</p>


<p>
Even though he is knowledgeable in human arts, he is still foolish because he lacks true knowledge of God and the saving exhortation. There is also a speech of some heretics that is articulate yet not wise, which, although polished by human ingenuity, is completely devoid of true wisdom and the teachings of virtues. About the articulate yet not wise, it is said through the prophet Isaiah: "You will not see the insolent people, the people of an obscure speech that you cannot comprehend, stammering in a language that you cannot understand, in whom there is no wisdom." Neither articulate nor wise are many who rashly approach any teaching before they are refreshed by the banquet of the most sacred senses and imbued with the ornaments of eloquence. Or as the writing of this synod, whose errors we strive to discuss, in whose sentences neither the ornament of sense is found nor is any stream drawn from the river of eloquence.
</p>
<p>
And since all writing is either cultivated and clear, cultivated and not clear, uncultivated and clear, or neither cultivated nor clear, this writing is foreign to the first two types and completely tied to the latter two, because it is neither elevated by the cultivation of words or the high style of eloquence nor by the purity of clarity.
</p>


<p>
<s>
The text is woven such that, on one hand, it soothes the reader's mind with its clarity, and on the other hand, it aids understanding through its purity.
</s>
<s>
It is not sophisticated and unclear, because it is not wrapped in long sentences, nor adorned with various intricate topics, nor linked with the slippery conclusions of dialectical art.
</s>
<s>
All these things are sophisticated, as they are polished with a sophist's cylinder, and not clear, as they are far removed from the understanding of simple readers and only appeal to the minds of the most learned.
</s>
<s>
But it is either clear, lacking sophistication and accessible to all readers or listeners, or it is disorganized, poorly arranged, full of solecisms, corrupted by barbarisms, shrouded in clouds of other vices, devoid of clear speech and proper arrangement of ideas, and thus neither sophisticated nor clear.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Therefore, if by chance any error in statements about faith remains undiscussed, it will defend itself with these arms against us, because it has hidden itself in such coverings of disordered words and thus could not be detected by us, as it came to us shrouded in the difficulty of speech like a certain cloak.
</s>
<s>
It is ridiculous and childish to say in the statement of faith of Bishop Theodore, "God is wonderful in His saints," and immediately: "In the saints who are on His earth, He has shown all my desires among them," as if this verse follows the previous one.
</s>
<s>
Indeed, it is because Bishop Theodore so interjected these two verses of the psalmist.
</s>
</p>


<p>
He brought together the part of the adverb "continuously" as if one verse followed the other without any interruption, namely this verse, which he said followed "continuously," not only does not follow immediately, but almost precedes.
</p>
<p>
Various letters were erased: 2 or 3 letters were erased in V, "cu" followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, "aper" followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, "e" and "It" followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, "non ap" followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, "aut inculta" followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, and these letters were in A, "quod" in A, in the other, followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, "ob" was missing in the other in A, followed by "is" in r. V, then 2 or 3 letters were erased in V, "armis" in A, three words were erased in V, followed by "i" and "l" in r. V, then three words were erased in V, corrected from "exarchiepiscopi" in V. See above P. 113, l. 47; P. 114, l. 45; p. 119, l. 44. Corrected from "ex archiepiscopus" in I. See above n. p.
</p>
<p>
From the Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea, in session III; Mansi XII, 1144. - Response of Hadrian MG. I. C. p. 16, C. VI. Actually, Theodore connected these verses with the inserted particle "zai acrisis" (= "and again," as correctly interpreted later by the librarian Anastasius) (Mansi LIB. III. CAP. IX. X. XL).
</p>
<p>
We did not wish to criticize the fifty psalms, which are known to precede the one that follows, not because it brings any prejudice to faith, but because it would be subject to ridiculous criticism and would provide material for mockery to the critics. It is clear that such a scripture is not suitable to teach great things without error if it stumbles in small matters without strength, nor does it have the power to affirm doubtful things and teach unknown things, which lack the talent to discern.

<s>Expressing doubts and bringing forth known concepts.</s>
<s>How then can the teachings of that synod be accepted, when its writings are criticized in so many places?</s>
<s>Or how can it achieve the respect of other synodal writings, organized or accepted by the holy fathers, when it evades the sense and words of those writings?</s>
<s>They are not criticized in any way and are therefore accepted in all things.</s>
<s>This one, however, because it is criticized in many ways, is rightly rejected in almost everything.</s>

<s>XI. How the Greeks tried to ineffectively and recklessly anathematize the Catholic Church in their synod, because it does not worship images, when they should have first thoroughly investigated what each part of the Church would think about this issue.</s>
<s>The ecclesiastical trumpet of preaching sounds to correct a sinning brother privately first.</s>
<s>If he refuses to listen, he should be admonished with the involvement of other brothers either for the purpose of correction or as witnesses.</s>
<s>If he still refuses to listen to them, then the matter should be made known to many so that he may be shunned.</s>
<s>If he could not be saved by shame, he might at least be saved by public disgrace.</s>
<s>If he does not heed the advice of many, he should be regarded like a heathen or a publican.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Their church seems to contradict this preaching significantly, as it tries to presumptuously or recklessly anathematize the churches of the whole world without consulting or investigating through epistolary discourse, as is the ecclesiastical custom.</s>
</p>


<p>
The provincial churches were asked to consider whether images should be worshipped or not, so that according to a wise person's advice, by following what should be followed and avoiding what should be avoided, the church could avoid regret in the future. It was clear that whatever more people, according to apostolic tradition, wanted the churches to hold on to, the church itself would also hold, and those who tried to oppose the majority with ancient traditions and stubbornly sought to separate themselves from the entire ecclesiastical body, would face condemnation.
</p>
<p>
For what madness or folly is it that a church of one part, trying to establish a practice that was neither decreed by the apostles nor their successors, would attempt to anathematize the churches of the whole world and force them to either contradict the apostolic institutions or be subject to the most baseless anathema issued by them? But since their most insane anathema causes more harm to themselves than to us, as the Apostle says: "Neither the greedy will inherit the kingdom of God," even if it could somehow harm us, it would be more tolerable for us to endure it than to oppose the advice of the apostles or other holy fathers. For we say with Susanna: "It is better to fall into the hands of men than to forsake the law of our God," and we are taught by the words of the shepherd of the church that we must obey God rather than men.
</p>


<p>
<s>
It is more tolerable for any citizen or member of the community to endure insults from seditious individuals, who act against the ruler and citizens, than to conspire with them in rebellion.
</s>
<s>
In the same way, it is more tolerable for us to be cursed by those who do not hesitate to curse even their own parents, than to worship senseless things against the teachings of the Holy Scriptures with them.
</s>
<s>
For cursing without reason, anger without power, and condemnation without authority harm those against whom they are aimed very little, but afflict their perpetrators with greater troubles and reveal them to be more lazy and impatient.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Unless the old destruction and ancient plague, leader of death, root of evils, which expelled angels from the company of heavenly citizens and humans from the dignity of the flourishing seat, inflamed them with the goads of its wickedness, they would not dare to call a synod for the worship of images without the consent of many Catholic and God-fearing churches, nor dare to so insolently anathematize so many churches, which are indeed the body of Christ, nor attempt to establish the worship and adoration of senseless things against the teachings of the Holy Scriptures.
</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>The Apostle says, speaking in the spirit of God, "anathema to Jesus."</s>
<s>Therefore, it is to be avoided that, while they rashly and carelessly try to anathematize the church, which is the body of Christ, they seem to insult Him, who is its head.</s>
<s>Christ has so loved the church that He has taken it to Himself inseparably, as the head to the body, so that it always adheres to Him as the body to the head, and thus any harm or honor shown to the body is referred to the head.</s>
<s>For Christ referred to the persecution of the church by the Jews as His own, when He said to the rapacious Saul, not yet Paul, who was eagerly ravaging the church to seize spoils:</s>
<s>"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"</s>
<s>Not because Saul was persecuting Christ reigning in the heavenly places, but because he was persecuting the church already flourishing and surviving in the turbulent waters of this world.</s>
<s>Therefore Christ, in His body, which is the church, still endures persecution, not physically as He did once for the world's salvation, but with a certain compassionate mercy, by which He always pities His members, that is, the faithful remaining in the unity of the holy church.</s>
<s>Of these, He was the one who said, "I rejoice in my sufferings, because I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions, in my flesh, for the sake of His body, which is the church."</s>
</p>


  <p>
    David, who was a foreshadowing of his holy ones, said: "I will play before the Lord and will appear even more humble." Because while humbling himself to the point of death, he reached the mystery of the cross and was spurned by the synagogue, which has remained barren since then. In the bloody sweat of his body, he showed that passions were to come and testified that his honor was shown against the church's honor. As he says: "Whoever receives you, receives me," and "Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, if those being discussed embraced the guardian of virtues, the teacher of good deeds, and humility, they would not so shamelessly curse the body of Christ, which is the church. 
  </p>


<p>
<s>And they gathered an unproductive synod.</s>
<s>12.</s>
<s>Because for the most part, they have abandoned humility and patience by not controlling their mouths and speaking disorderly.</s>
