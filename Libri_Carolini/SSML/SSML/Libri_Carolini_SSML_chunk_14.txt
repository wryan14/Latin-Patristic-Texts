    <s>He does not worship images, but he who fears God calls the man blessed, saying: Blessed is the man who fears the Lord and greatly delights in his commandments.</s>
    <s>And again: Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways.</s>
    <s>For it does not say, as those absurdly claim: 'He who fears the Lord worships images,' but it says: He who fears the Lord greatly delights in his commandments.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Hence, it is very clear that the fear of the Lord is not in the worship of images, but in the will and diligence of God's commandments.</s>
    <s>For the holy man does not testify that the eyes of the Lord are on those who worship images, but on those who fear him, when he says: Behold, the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those who hope in his mercy.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Neither does it say: 'Worship images, for nothing is lacking for those who worship them,' but it says: Fear the Lord, all his saints, for nothing is lacking for those who fear him.</s>
    <s>Nor does it say that the beginning of wisdom is the worship of images, but the fear of the Lord, saying: The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</s>
    <s>This command of fearing the Lord is read as instituted through Moses: Follow the Lord your God and fear him.</s>
  </p>


    <p>
        Do not be afraid and keep His commandments, listen to His voice and obey Him. Among these healthy commandments, nowhere is the worship of images instituted. Since the worship of images is found to be forbidden in the divine scriptures, it is in no way equivalent to the fear of the Lord, which is commended by so many oracles of the divine law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the flowers by which the fear of the Lord is commanded to be held, which we have diligently plucked from the vast fields of divine law, are set in order so that, in brevity, we may explain them, to soothe the reader's mind and, if anyone tries to equate them with the worship of things devoid of sense, to compel them to be filled with shame and reverence. For it is said in Proverbs:

    <s>Also in Ecclesiasticus: If you do not hold the fear of the Lord firmly, your house will soon be overthrown.</s>
    <s>Also in Ecclesiastes: The end of all words is to fear the Lord.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>Listener of God, fear God and keep His commandments, because this is the duty of every person.</s>
    <s>For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>In Proverbs: The fear of the Lord hates evil, as well as arrogance and pride and the ways of the wicked.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>This fear, therefore, which the testimonies show is not an indication of image worship, but rather an increase in good works, must be held by the faithful.</s>
    <s>There is also another fear, about which it is said in 1 John 4:18: Perfect love drives out fear, because fear impels a person to all exercises of good works.</s>
    <s>However, the fear that love drives out does not allow one to endure vigils or fasts or other such things, nor to suffer for the name of Christ.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Just as there are two kinds of temptations, one by which a person is deceived, as it is said: God does not tempt anyone; He Himself is not tempted by evil.</s>
    <s>And another by which a person is tested by divine examination, as it is said: The Lord your God is testing you, or: God tested Abraham.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>
After thoroughly examining the Holy Scriptures, it is found that there are two types of fear: one that love drives out, and another that is the beginning of good works, which love nurtures.
</s>
<s>
For if the beginning of the fear of the Lord is to worship images, as they babble, then it is clear that all the saints, who are believed to have truly feared God, worshiped images.
</s>
<s>
And if all the saints, who are believed to have truly feared God, worshiped images, it is clear they acted against the creator's commands, who prohibited the worship of creatures and ordained that He alone be worshiped.
</s>
<s>
However, they are not believed to have acted against the creator's commands by worshiping creatures.
</s>
<s>
Therefore, the beginning of the fear of the Lord is not, as they babble, to worship images.
</s>
<s>
By this proof, it is shown that the beginning of the fear of the Lord is not in the adoration of senseless objects, but in the observance of the Lord's commandments.
</s>
<s>
For he truly fears God who, spurning all vanities, shows by faith and deeds that he will serve Him alone.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The most foolish statement of John the Presbyter of the East, which he said, that "an image is not dishonored if the emperor is not present when it is honored," is without reason.
</s>
<s>
For even now, we do not see the ruler of all, Jesus Christ, visibly—He is invisible to our carnal eyes, as God is everywhere—yet we honor His image just as we would honor the emperor.
</s>
<s>
Concerning what they generally all are said to have either spoken or agreed with...
</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Following the example of imperial images, which are sent to cities and met by crowds of people with candles and incense, the image of the Savior or any of the saints should also be venerated.
    </s>
    <s>
      This was already discussed previously, and it was approved by the words of the blessed Jerome that the images of judges and emperors, which they attempt to use as models, should not be venerated.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Now, however, the words of John need to be examined specifically, as he is found to have spoken more frequently on this matter than others and to have been no less delusional.
    </s>
    <s>
      Although he follows the general error of everyone, he tries to add something special to that error and, as I believe, he has taken care to associate his own more and more with general nonsense because he thought the vanities of everyone would not suffice to add to such a great error.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Thus, as if God were local like an emperor and, while in one place, could not be in another, he tries to assert that His image should be venerated like an emperor's image, which reason completely forbids.
    </s>
    <s>

</p>


<p>They should bring it, but we only go through their meanings or opinions by criticizing them. It remains for us to discuss not what they say—especially, as mentioned, since it almost has no sense—but what they mean to say.</p>
<p>What he said: 'His image should be honored, just as the Emperor,' the Father felt, has this meaning: The Father commanded Christ's image to be adored just like the Emperor.</p>
<p>Indeed, where, when, why, and how this happened is completely unknown to every Catholic. For the Father did not command his image to be honored, but to honor and listen to him himself. When at the streams of the Jordan, the Holy Trinity in the unity of substance, the Father, indeed, in the voice, which thundered: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, listen to him, the Son in the body, and the Holy Spirit clearly appeared in the form of a dove.</p>
<p>Even if the Father ordered Christ's image to be honored like the Emperor, wouldn't it be more appropriate to decree that the Emperor be honored like the image of Christ, so that the image of Christ would hold a more eminent place in such a regard? Therefore, nowhere is it read that the Father commanded Christ's image to be painted, adored, or honored, especially since He instituted that He alone should be worshipped and served.</p>
<p>Because emperors and kings are to be honored by their subjects, this can be approved by some examples from divine Scripture. For if they were not to be honored, David, a holy man, would not have called Saul, after God had departed from him, 'the Lord's anointed.'</p>


<p>
That man said it was God's will for the office to be part of the royal order. Therefore, he honored Saul, who was still in that position, so he wouldn't seem to disrespect God, who decreed that these orders should be honored. As long as he is in that position, he should be honored, if not for himself, then at least for the order.
</p>
<p>
As the Apostle said, "Be subject to all higher authorities. There is no authority except from God." And in another place, "Fear God, honor the king."
</p>
<p>
A more detailed discussion could arise from this, but since some of it has already been discussed in earlier parts of this work, we will now move on and leave these matters behind.
</p>
<p>
If someone builds a wooden house and wants to decorate the walls with marble tiles or change them with colorful glass pieces, but sees that these materials naturally don't stick to wood, he abandons those metals that naturally don't stick to wood and tries to complete it with wood again. Or if someone wants to make a tin vessel and needs more of the same material to complete it.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>They do not use materials made from other precious metals that cannot adhere to tin, but rather the same tin to complete the intended work.</s>
    <s>Just like them in their synod, when they realized that the tool of their error—namely, the writing composed for the worship of images—could not be expanded or made to adhere to the divine scriptures, they turned to some apocryphal and laughable fables to dictate their position.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>And when they saw that the testimonies of divine law, incompetently applied to the same work, could not adhere, they adapted such sentences to it that in sense and words could not differ from it.</s>
    <s>Just as a precious emerald set in an iron ring or a golden garment sewn with a haircloth band does not fit at all, so too the testimonies of divine eloquence do not fit at all when applied to their work.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, a matter coming into doubt and contention does not deserve to be strengthened with apocryphal fables, but either with the oracles of divine law or the salutary admonitions and most clear documents of those doctors who are received by the Catholic and Apostolic Church.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But perhaps a very scrupulous supporter of this error might say, ‘They did not insert the sentences of apocryphal books into their work to confirm the matter at hand, but to mock the madness of certain heretics.’</s>
    <s>To this, our style can provide a very easy response.</s>
    <s>When they say that someone restrained a crime with an image of Polemon, which no authentic reading narrates, are they mocking anyone?</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>
      So in the same reading, there are some things that they placed to support the intended point.
    </s>
    <s>
      There are also many things, which, although they placed them mockingly, are so convoluted, so disorderly, so excessively stated, so mixed together, that it is almost impossible to understand.
    </s>
    <s>
      It barely touches the reader's mind whether the things being said are words of mockery or of those showing faith.
    </s>
    <s>
      Although this matter is understood as it is said by learned people, it is reported to cause offense to some unlearned people.
    </s>
    <s>
      Not without reason, for it is covered with such ignorance that it is scarcely understood.
    </s>
  </p>

    <s>
      A delusion full of error about something hidden they said, <sub alias="quoddam">that a certain person</sub> swore, and that the oath itself was invalid.
    </s>
    <s>
      Because none of the readings received in the canon mentions anyone mocking or scoffing, or when they read the letters from King Abgar to Jesus and again Jesus to Abgar, which are known to be apocryphal, anyone is insulted.
    </s>
    <s>
      They have performed these and similar things not mocking, not scoffing, not ridiculing anyone, but wishing to affirm the adoration of images.

  <p>
    The Capitularies of Charlemagne on Images.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is said that someone did this, whose abbot is known to have been not a little distressed, saying to him that it is more convenient to enter all the brothels in the city than to deny the adoration of the image of the Lord or of His holy mother.
  </p>
  <p>
    Often in this work we are compelled to say that we should not take examples from harmful things. We repeat this so frequently because we have found that they often do this to affirm their own error. Just as an appropriate order of good deeds provides support for good actions, so do they seek support for their erroneous actions from mistaken deeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the purpose of establishing the proposed error, they bring forth the example of someone who, if he acted as they assert, is known to have committed a threefold fault in that matter: either because he willingly obeyed the demonic conversation, or because he bound himself with an oath at the demon's urging, or even because he made that oath void. These three things are not only not to be drawn into example, but also to be utterly rejected by every Catholic, for they are forbidden by many testimonies of divine law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, associations and seductions of not only demons but also wicked men are prohibited by many precepts of divine teachings. For it is written in Exodus: You shall not listen to...
  </p>


<p>
It is useless; and in Proverbs: Son, do not let wicked men deceive you. If therefore the seductions of evil men are to be avoided, much more must the words and assent of evil spirits be avoided, because, as they are enemies of humanity and always hostile to us, we must always be suspicious of their deception and be on guard against their wickedness, as we know they are of a subtler nature and intellect.
</p>
<p>
In that also, swearing by a demon is contrary to the divine words, which prohibit oaths. In Ecclesiasticus it is written: Do not let your mouth become accustomed to swearing, for many calamities come from it. Just as a servant constantly questioned will not be without bruises, so anyone who swears and calls on the name of God will not be entirely free from sin. A man who swears much will be filled with iniquity, and the plague will not depart from his house. 
</p>
<p>
Truth itself says in the Gospel: But I tell you, do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Do not swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black; let your speech be 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything more than this comes from evil. Furthermore, in swearing falsely to the demon, it is also revealed that he acted absurdly. The Lord says through Moses: Do not swear falsely by my name and do not profane my holy name; I am the Lord your God. 
</p>
<p>
And in the prophet Zechariah it is written:
</p>


<p>
<s>And do not love false oaths, for I hate all these things, says the Almighty Lord.</s>
<s>When this same person, having been secluded, committed these three acts contrary to divine words, his abbot offered no correction but instead showed him a worse path saying:</s>
<s>'It is better for you to enter all the brothels in the city than to deny the worship of the Lord's image or that of His holy mother.'</s>
<s>Oh incomparable absurdity! Oh ruinous evil! Oh madness to be preferred to many insanities!</s>
<s>He says it is better to commit an act forbidden by both law and gospel than to abstain from an act that is neither instituted by law nor by the gospel.</s>
<s>He says it is better to commit a crime than to abstain from it.</s>
<s>He says it is better to willingly plunge into deep mud than to walk the straight path with an unoffending foot.</s>
<s>He says it is better to violate the temple of God than to disdain the worship of senseless things.</s>
<s>He says it is better to take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute than to disdain the worship of any craftsman's work.</s>
<s>Let him say, if he can find it anywhere, that the Lord said: 'Do not deny the worship of an image,' as it is most evident He said: 'You shall not commit adultery.'</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>And, the Lord said, 'If you see an image and do not worship it, you have sinned'.</s> 
<s>Just as He clearly said: If you see a woman with lustful intent, you have already committed adultery with her in your heart.</s> 
<s>When this is not found, anyone who permits such a shameful act to avoid a fruitless matter will feel greatly mistaken.</s> 
<s>For while the Lord commands through the law to gird your loins over your chest, cutting off lusts in the heart, and through the gospel to gird your loins and keep your lamps burning, associating good deeds with chastity, it is noted that the books of divine speech give the precepts of chastity, but nowhere is it found that the worship of images is commanded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, while his abbot, who should undoubtedly have given him guidance for salvation, relaxed the reins of sin and should have pulled him back from the snare of error to which he had sworn by the devil, he also fell with him into the abyss of error, saying that it was more convenient to commit the most serious crime with him.</s> 
<s>Without a doubt, this fulfilled the gospel saying: 'If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.'</s> 
<s>Therefore, anyone who wants to support their assertion with such an example demonstrates not only their own madness but also shows it to be stronger than others.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Because the absurd persistence and continuous nonsense or even the heap of delusions do not rest at all in the intervals of their volume, which we are discussing the errors of, at least in the books of those</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>During the pause between the end of one discussion and the beginning of another, let there be a rest period.</s> 
<s>Just as continuous debate exposes their errors, the interval of books should, in some way, interrupt the continuity of those same errors.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>With God's help, we've completed the three books of this debate.</s> 
<s>In these books, some testimonies of divine law, though briefly, have been restored to their proper meanings according to the teachings of the holy fathers.</s> 
<s>Our confession of faith, though in plain language, has been sincerely written with the firmness of apostolic tradition.</s> 
<s>The madness of those who seek to introduce new practices into the church and worship senseless things has been somewhat discussed.</s> 
<s>Now, reason compels us to move on to the fourth book, where, with the Lord's help, any remaining chapters about their vanities will be discussed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Since we want to avoid a tumultuous and disorganized style of speaking, we've organized the number of books and, aiming for brevity, extended our discourse to no more than four books.</s> 
<s>We avoided the prolixity of a few and the brevity of many, establishing our debate in this number.</s> 
<s>We have found it to be sanctified by the testimonies of divine words.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>Therefore, the number is approved not only by physicists in the investigation of the elements and the entirety of the world's structure or even by the laborious investigation of the human body, which is too lengthy to discuss now, but it is also shown to be most sacred by divine writings, which testify that many sacred and mysterious matters are confined to the same number.</s>
<s>For instance, four rivers flow from one source in paradise, as mentioned in Genesis 2:10 and following.</s>
<s>Similarly, four Gospels proceed from the source of light and goodness, and four virtues—namely prudence, courage, justice, and temperance—are described as guiding human life with the most honorable rules.</s>
<s>The ark, which preserved the life of mankind and all living creatures from the waters that destroyed everything, was made of squared timbers, as referenced in Genesis 6:14.</s>
<s>Likewise, the ark of the holy church, which floats on the stormy waters of this world's temptations and holds both the elect and the reprobate, is built and strengthened by squared timbers, that is, holy men adorned with the virtue of patience.</s>
<s>Their lives remain steadfast wherever they turn, for they are neither cast down in adversity nor raised up in prosperity.</s>
<s>We follow in their footsteps.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>And avoiding the novelties of words,</s>
<s>and rejecting the worship of things without meaning,</s>
<s>offering worship and servitude solely to God,</s>
<s>and giving appropriate honor to His saints,</s>
<s>we hope that through our patience we will gain our souls.</s>

<p>
<s>Here begins the chapters of the fourth book.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The most false and laughable statement of John the Presbyter,</s>
<s>who is known to have been no less insane in the worship of images than others.</s>
<s>He said: 'He who worships an image and says: This is Christ, the Son of God, does not sin.'</s>

<s>'Through the image, which appears in colors, His strength is worshipped and He is glorified,</s>
<s>and through it we are reminded of His presence on earth.'</s>

<s>III. Regarding those who say that no one should be scandalized</s>
<s>because lights and incense are offered before the images of saints.</s>

<s>IV. Regarding those who say:</s>
<s>'It is the same crime to despise images as it was for Nebuchadnezzar,</s>
<s>who brought the bones of the kings of Judah out of their graves,</s>
<s>blinded the king of Judah after killing his sons, and took the cherubim from the temple.'</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>V. That the letter which they say was sent by Saint Symeon the Stylite to Emperor Justinian</s>
<s>differs greatly from the divine Scriptures and the teachings of the holy fathers,</s>
<s>both in what it says to the aforementioned emperor:</s>
<s>'For whom we remember and report to your divine ears,'</s>

<p>
<s>According to their opinion, their parents were worse than all heretics because they destroyed images.</s>

We hope to drive away demons with the sign made in the air with a finger:
Similarly, we bring an image to the first form of honor by the naming of the sign,
and by kissing and honoring it respectfully, we receive sanctification.
For we also kiss and embrace different sacred vessels and hope for some kind of sanctification.

XX. Those who flatter their emperor or his mother by comparing them to the apostles are wrong in saying: 'Just as our savior and perfecter Jesus once sent out his apostles clothed in the power of the Holy Spirit, so now he has raised up our emperors, wise and faithful, similar to the apostles, from the same Spirit'.

    About what they said: 'There is in prophecy: Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son; seeing this prophecy in an image, namely a virgin holding in her arms whom she bore, how can we not worship and kiss?

    About how they do not spare even themselves when they harm their parents, saying: 'For true wheat, they have sown weeds in the church fields, mixed wine with water, and given their neighbors turbulent subversion to drink, and being as Arabic wolves, they have mocked putting on sheep's clothing and, passing by the truth, have embraced lies. They have laid asps' eggs and woven spiders' webs according to the prophet, and whoever hopes to eat their eggs will find a broken tail and in it the basilisk's venom and deadly breath.'

    Useless and crude is their interpretation, who, while wishing to affirm that to worship and to kiss are one, said: 'All the holy leaders of our doctrine and their successors, excellent fathers of ours, and these, namely to worship and to kiss; for both are indeed the same; the common phrase of ancient Greek means to kiss and embrace; and by some extension of will signifies love, just as I bear and offer, I affirm and confirm, I participate and adore, which demonstrates the kiss.'

<s>He gave to the Easterners one who, among other absurdities of his profession, neither avoided being mistaken in this matter, which is the subject of discussion, nor feared to deceive, nor was ashamed to lie or encourage others to lie.</s>
<s>Indeed, he did not avoid being mistaken, as he strayed from the path of the holy Scriptures, which advocate the worship and adoration of one and only God, turning his steps to worship senseless things.</s>
<s>He did not fear to deceive, as he persuaded others to stray from the path of righteousness he himself had abandoned, leading them through many assertions and rather vanities to wander with him through the wilderness.</s>
<s>He was not ashamed to lie and to encourage others to lie, asserting that committing an unlawful act and telling a lie was not a sin.</s>

    He allowed himself to be scourged everywhere and nailed to the cross for us. <break time="1s" /> It wasn't just any image of death, with the authority of the ruler overthrown and the depths of the underworld plundered, that rose from the grave. <break time="1s" /> And it wasn't the work of any earthly artist that, after giving the apostles his saving teachings and sending them to preach throughout the world, ascended to heaven with his body and sat at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. <break time="1s" /> All these things were not done by any image, but by Christ, who is the only Son of God the Father, begotten ineffably by the Father before all ages, and sent to earth at the end of the ages for the sake of human salvation. <break time="1s" /> He is the anointed one by the Father with the oil of joy, surpassing his companions, who, according to the Apostle, made peace through the blood of his cross, whether things in heaven or on earth. <break time="1s" /> To him, every knee bends in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. <break time="1s" /> Therefore, if anyone, while worshipping an image, says, 'This is Christ, the Son of God,' they not only sin but also act insanely and wickedly, as they are attributing the most excellent and sublime name, if it can even be called a thing and not rather the origin or cause of all things, to such a vile and abject thing that lacks both mysteries and life. <break time="1s" /> Just as no image can be equated with Christ in nature, it cannot be equated with him in name. <break time="1s" /> If anyone thinks that the reasoning of equivocal names can apply in this case, let them know that the opinion we are now discussing is far removed from the reasoning of equivocal names. <break time="1s" />

      Although there is only a similarity in name, here is a clear full statement of profession; because the nature of equivocal terms only shares a common name, but as soon as we reach the definition, what was covered by the mere sound of the name, the definition reveals most skillfully.
    </s>
    <s>
      For it is, as we said before, a very different thing to call an image by the name of the thing it represents, according to the nature of equivocal terms, and quite another thing to adore an insensible thing and to profess and say with full conviction: 'This is Christ the Son of God.'

      For if to tell such a lie, as he confessed, is not a sin, then to commit any unlawful acts is not a sin, and the force of the Holy Scriptures, which certainly insist on abstaining from unlawful things, would be considered to weaken; but the force of the Holy Scriptures, which insist on abstaining from any unlawful acts, is not to be considered weakening; therefore, to tell such a lie is indeed a sin.
    </s>
  </p>


<p>Sin. For almost every lie, which is told with the intent to deceive, is a sin. This lie is even more sinful when it tries to give such a cheap thing a name of great importance.</p>
<p>See Matthew 16:16.</p>
<p>The confession, which the church's pastor makes to the same Redeemer, and which every holy Catholic and universal church makes every day to Him, by which they are saved and obtain an example of their salvation, how can anyone try to make such a confession about something senseless? Just like other vices, the vice of lying is prohibited by the teachings of the divine Scriptures.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who obeys the same John's warnings, to worship images and call them 'Christ, the Son of God,' practices vain and wicked things and shows themselves to be undisciplined. If this crime, as he confessed, is committed, it will fulfill what is said in Jeremiah by the voice of the Lord: Lies and not faith have prevailed over the land because evils have come from evil people, and they have not known me. Paul, the excellent preacher, also persuades people to put aside lying and speak the truth. He says in his letter to the Ephesians: Put aside lying and speak the truth, each one with their neighbor, because we are members of one another. Likewise, he says to the Colossians: Do not lie to each other, stripping off the old self with its practices. The Apostle John also says: Every lie is not of the truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clear that if a painting, as he encourages to admit, is Christ the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="deɪ">Dei</phoneme> Filius.</p>


  <p>
    The Son is not, that is a lie, what is said; and if what is said is a lie, according to John 2:21.
    John 14:6.
    The apostle's voice is not of truth, which says: I am the way and the truth and the life. For the worship of adoration and the confession of the Son of God should be given to God alone, who is truly His coessential Son, not adopted.

    As for what John incorrectly said: the image, which appears through colors, is worshipped, his strength and glory are honored, and we will remember his presence on earth.
  </p>
  <p>
    This often-mentioned John the presbyter did not hesitate to add his follies, saying 'through the image, which appears through colors, the Lord's strength is worshipped', as if the Lord needed anything and through some object His strength, which has no need, is made to be worshipped.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the heavens or earth were created, the first of all angelic creatures were believed to have worshipped and praised God's strength from the beginning of creation, because there were no humans yet, who could create images from any materials, nor were there any materials to paint images on, so they are believed neither to have worshipped nor praised the Lord's strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the Scripture says: When all things were created.

<p> 
<s>All the stars and all my angels praised me together.</s> 
<s>Here it is clearly shown that it is not 'through an image, which appears through colors,' but through God's ineffable power that His strength has always been praised and worshiped.</s> 
<s>Surely, after the creation of humans, when the art of painting had not yet developed in the world, the strength of the Lord was still worshiped by all the saints, wasn't it?</s> 
<s>Neither Abel the just, nor Enoch, nor Noah, nor any of the saints who are said to have lived in that age are believed to have worshiped the strength of the Lord 'through an image' or 'through colors,' since in the still primitive world, the experience of certain worldly arts had not yet been acquired.</s> 
<s>Therefore, since there are many parts of the world where people are ignorant of the art of painting, is the strength of the Lord believed to be any less worshiped there?</s> 
<s>The strength of the Lord is worshiped not 'through an image, which appears through colors,' as he dreams, but through His ineffable power, by which the whole framework of the world is known to have been established.</s> 
<s>His strength is also worshiped not through certain materials, but through His Word, His Son.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>For instance, the one whom he ineffably begot before the ages and through whom and</s>
<s>by whom he created all things, who is the right hand and strength of the Father, through whose strength</s>
<s>just as the universal creation of creatures is known to be accomplished, so also the perpetual and</s>
<s>unceasing worship by angels and by humans is celebrated, who indeed, just as he is the cause of all</s>
<s>creation, so also is he the just and most fitting cause of worship.</s>
<s>The Holy and universal church does not worship God through an image made of colors, as often</s>
<s>the remembered John is known to have felt nauseated, nor can mortal men</s>
<s>or heavenly powers, but through Christ the Lord, confessing, while celebrating the mysteries of his redemption,</s>
<s>saying it is right and just, fair and salutary, that we should always and everywhere give thanks to him,</s>
<s>through whom the ineffable majesty of the Father is praised by angels, adored by dominions, feared by powers,</s>
<s>the heavens and the heavenly hosts sing a hymn of glory to him in sweet-sounding melody.</s>
<s>Therefore, his strength is worshiped not through a colorful image of him, but through his most sacred and life-giving incarnation.</s>
<s>His power is worshiped not through painting, but through his works, such as taking the form of a servant, being born of a virgin,</s>
<s>giving hearing to the deaf, speech to the mute, movement to the lame, healing to lepers and other afflicted sicknesses,</s>
<s>life to the dead, and sight to the blind.</s>

<p>
<s>He chose to strip away the power of death, to rise from the grave, and to ascend to the heavens.</s>
<s>These are the means by which Catholics worship the strength of the Lord.</s>
<s>These are the defenses by which the faith of the Church is upheld.</s>
<s>This is the confession, from which if anyone dissents, they are in danger.</s>
<s>But if anyone holds it in their heart, they gain eternal salvation.</s>
<s>This is the perpetual memorial through which the faithful always see Christ with their inner eyes.</s>
<s>The full understanding of these things does not come through pictures, but through faith, hope, and love.</s>

<s>Therefore, since John, clouded by his own ignorance, as I believe, said one thing while intending to say another, let this suffice as a response to what he said.</s>
<s>However, to address what he meant to say, we must turn the focus of this discussion, so that both what he inadvertently asserted and what he intentionally aimed to express are examined with rational arguments.</s>
<s>This way, the reader may recognize that we have both understood the matters obscured by improper words and clarified what is easy to comprehend through discussion.</s>
<s>For when he says, ‘The strength of the Lord is worshipped through the image that appears in colors,’ we assume he meant to say, ‘The strength of the Lord is worshipped when the image seen is composed of colors.'</s>
<s>Indeed, this is also evident in the following passages.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    He almost revealed it when he said, <phoneme ph="Et ad memoriam veniemus de eius in terra praesentia">"And we will come to the memory of his presence on earth."</phoneme> To this proposition, we can easily object that neither from the reading of the holy Scriptures nor from the examples of the fathers is it established that God should be sought in images made by some. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In my heart, said David, I have hidden your words; I have sought you, God, with all my heart, so that you do not reject me from your commandments. And Moses says, <phoneme ph="Ponite verba Domini in cordibus vestris">"Place the words of the Lord in your hearts;"</phoneme> and the Lord through the prophet: <phoneme ph="Convertimini ad me ex toto corde vestro">"Turn to me with all your heart;"</phoneme> and conversely, about the reprobate, he says: <phoneme ph="Populus hic labiis me honorat, cor autem eorum longe est a me">"This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."</phoneme>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is understood that God is to be sought not in visible things, not in man-made things, but in the heart; and he is to be seen not with the eyes of the flesh, but only with the eye of the mind. For what madness it is to say, <phoneme ph="Per imaginem, quae per colores apparet, adoratur fortitudo eius, et ad memoriam veniemus de eius in terra praesentia">"Through the image, which appears in colors, his strength is worshipped, and we will come to the memory of his presence on earth!"</phoneme> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Unhappy memory, which to remember Christ, who should never leave the heart of a just man, is unworthy of imaginary vision; nor can it otherwise have the presence of Christ in itself unless it sees his painted image on a wall or some material; because such memory, which is fostered by images, does not come from the love of the heart, but from the necessity of vision; because clearly, it is not this internal love that ignites the memory of Christ, but the necessity by which even hateful things, as soon as we see them painted, 
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>However, we bring back to mind by vision, guided by a leader.</s>
    <s>Regarding those who are burdened by such great necessity that, unless they see pictures, they find it difficult to remember Christ, it is to be feared that if they should lose this common light due to some bodily ailment or be deprived of pictures by some accident—which indeed cannot always be available—they might completely forget Christ, who should always be kept in mind.</s>

    <s>III. Concerning what they say about not causing offense because lights are placed before images of the saints and incense is burned.</s>
    <s>Finally, while the same synod, whose reading we have urged, suggests many things to which no one of sound mind would give assent, and discourages many things— from which no sane person would turn away their steps— it condemns many things that are entirely commendable and, conversely, praises many things that are entirely condemnable.</s>
    <s>It also advises that no one should be scandalized because 'lights are placed before images and incense is burned,' as if those who lack light are not scandalized by lighting lamps and those who lack smell are not scandalized by offering fragrant incense.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For those who offer things worthy of God to senseless objects and encourage others to do the same are indeed scandalized.</s>
    <s>They think we should be scandalized, as they fear their madness will be rationally mocked by us.</s>
    <s>While they believe they are being reproached by us, they boast of their zeal for our salvation.</s>
    <s>Therefore, we suffer scandal in this part.</s>
