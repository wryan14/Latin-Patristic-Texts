<p>
They fear and think they are doing good works, but this scandal will harm us as much as their insolent obedience will benefit them, because order requires that they be forced to give back the same respect for the images as they have received, since they are completely devoid of sense.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps those who wish to refute our assertion will say: ‘Why do you mock them for offering lights and incense to images that lack sense, when we also offer lights and incense in churches, which equally lack sense?’ To which an easy objection can arise, since it is one thing to illuminate places dedicated to divine worship and in those same places to offer prayers and incense to God, and another to offer light to an image that has eyes but sees nothing,
</p>
<p>
and to offer incense to an image that has a nose but smells nothing. It is one thing to venerate places dedicated to divine worship, and another to offer lights and incense to paintings adorned with various colors; it is one thing to solemnly dedicate a house built by the faithful and consecrated by a bishop to the majesty of the Lord,
</p>
<p>
and another to adorn any kind of picture with lights and incense.
</p>


<p>
<s>It's one thing to admire paintings created by artists, and quite another to irrationally kiss images presented with offerings.</s>
<s>The Lord says, "My house will be called a house of prayer"; and elsewhere: "Offerings will be accepted on my altar, and my house of prayer will be honored."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>That place should be elevated with many honors where faithful people gather from all directions, where their prayers are mercifully heard by God, and where the mysteries of our salvation are celebrated, and where a sacrifice of praise is offered to God.</s>
<s>In that place, the angelic hosts gather to receive the sacrifices brought by the faithful through the hands of priests.</s>
<s>There, the sweet sound of those singing psalms frequently resonates, and the hearts thirsty for divine readings are nourished.</s>
<s>Lastly, in many places, those who boast of offering lights and incense to images, and from whom we, who refuse to do such things, suffer scandal, these places dedicated to divine worship are so neglected that, as we have learned from reports by our envoys—whether those sent by my illustrious father of revered memory, or those sent by us—many basilicas in their lands lack not only lights and incense but even proper coverings.</s>
<s>However, in the kingdom granted to us by God, the basilicas, with His help, are abundantly adorned with gold, silver, gems, pearls, and other beautiful decorations, and lit with lights for images.</s>
</p>


<p>We reject the idea of honoring images with incense and lights, but we do decorate things dedicated to divine worship with the most precious items.</p>
<p>They say it is the same crime to despise images as it is to despise Nabuchodonosor, who desecrated the tombs of the kings of Judah, gouged out the eyes of the king of Judah, and took the cherubim from the temple.</p>
<p>Breaking images out of contempt, offering incense and lights to them, is not supported by any authentic text or example from any saint. In fact, some holy fathers have forbidden both breaking and worshipping images. It is entirely reasonable to avoid both practices since those who hold synods either destroy images unnecessarily or worship them inappropriately.</p>
<p>They claim that those who despise images are guilty of the same crime as Nabuchodonosor, who, driven by the wrath of divine judgment upon the increasing sins of the Israelites, destroyed the kingdom of Judah, overturned the walls of the holy city, and demolished the beauty of the entire temple, even casting down the cherubim. If this were true, this crime could not fall upon us, as we...</p>


  <p>
    Allowing these ornaments in the church in any way at all, we completely reject and despise the idea of worshipping them, but we do criticize their predecessors or parents who broke these ancient ornaments used in the basilicas and decreed their complete abolition. Thus, the decision in this matter seems to hang in such a way that whatever they bring forth more troublesome and detestable, they inevitably seem to condemn either themselves or their predecessors.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, while they despise their ancestors for abolishing these ornaments and boast of having great merit for worshipping them, these people cannot be compared in praise to the builders of that venerable temple, nor can their ancestors be equated in crime to the destroyers of the same. For just as there is a great distance between the temple of the Most High God, built in the time of the prophets by illustrious men, and certain images made by any craftsmen, so undoubtedly there is a great distance between the destroyers of that same temple and the despisers of images. But while we rightly reprimand both those who decide to worship these images inappropriately and their ancestors who rashly rejected them altogether, it remains for us to show that the destroyers of the Lord's temple were bound by far greater and much more severe crimes than the despisers of these images.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the prophet did not lament the abolition of such images, which they boast of worshipping, but the temple, which had not yet been founded, and the destruction of the city, which stood out among other cities, foreseeing it far in the future with the spirit of prophecy.

<p>Crying out in song, he lamented, saying: <s>"Why have you rejected us, God, forever? <break time="0.5s"/> Has your anger burned against the sheep of your pasture?"</s> <s>Remember your congregation, which you created from the beginning.</s></p>
<p>He did not call him a despiser of images, but an enemy and destroyer of the most sacred temple, when he added: <s>"How the enemy has acted wickedly in your sanctuary, and all who hate you have gloried."</s></p>
<p>He lamented not about paintings, but about the courtyard of the Lord, marked with hostile signs of the Chaldean or Roman army, saying: <s>"They set up their signs in the midst of your courtyard, and they did not recognize the signs as on the road to the summit."</s></p>
<p>He did not speak of doors of painters or materials of some craftsmen or even painted panels being cut down with axes and chisels, but he mourned the doors of the Lord's temple, in which were the holy of holies, cut down by hostile wedges, saying: <s>"As in a forest of trees, they cut down its doors with axes and hatchets."</s></p>
<p>He did not lament the burning or defiling of some images, but with anguish of heart, he spoke of the sanctuary of the Lord, saying: <s>"They set your sanctuary on fire; they desecrated the dwelling place of your name on earth."</s></p>
<p>Nor did he sing in another psalm with a sorrowful melody against despisers of images, but he prayed against the destroyers of the city or temple, or even the devastators of the entire people of Israel, saying: <s>"How long, Lord, will you be angry forever? <break time="0.5s"/> Will your jealousy burn like fire?"</s></p>

    <s>And the thoughts and exercises of certain good works strive to lay low, as it were, a certain people.</s> 
    <s>However, it is historically understood that it was said about the destruction of the aforementioned temple.</s>
    <s>Therefore, it is clear that their ancestors, although they were somewhat careless in removing images from the decorations of basilicas, are by no means to be equated with the destroyers of that most sacred and revered temple.</s>

    <s>V. That the letter, which they say is from Saint Simeon the Stylite, sent to Emperor Justinian, differs greatly from the divine Scriptures or the teachings of the holy fathers in that it says to the aforementioned emperor: 'For which we, commemorating, report to your divine ears,' or in that it forbade the same emperor with mercy.</s>
    <s>It is often the practice of heretics' cunning to note certain shameful and misleading things in writings and to preface them with the names of certain holy and reputable men.</s>

    <s>Therefore, it is to be feared that the letter, which they say is from a certain...</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    They say that the words of Saint Symeon, from which they draw testimonies to support their error, are not the words of a holy man, but rather the work of some cunning deceiver. Indeed, the reason why we and other orthodox believers doubt it is that its speech contradicts the teachings in some places of the holy Scriptures, and we do not presume to take its reading as testimony to confirm doubtful matters, as we know it goes against the divine law's teachings. We do not recall ever reading more of it than what we found marked in their manuscript. Although it lacks the charm and grace of expression and seems somewhat crude and rustic, we are still willing to present it as we found it in their manuscript.
  </p>
  <p>
    They say that the aforementioned Saint Symeon, whose life and preaching remain unknown to us, wrote in such a manner to Emperor Justinian against certain Samaritans who were disrespecting images: 'Therefore, remembering this, we report it to your divine ears'; and again: 'I have nothing to say to those who presume such things, lest one act of humanity be enough, as we pray for your victorious strength not to show mercy to those who have presumed this, nor to spare them.'
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>They neither take any torch nor offer any response for them.</s>
    <s>And after a short while: 'But I implore you, Lord, by Emmanuel, the Most High God, not to delay nor make revenge fitting even for a moment.'</s>
    <s>And again: 'May darkness take their relatives into condemnation, who awaits them to be consumed by unquenchable and dark fire, and may the holy and almighty spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, who proceeds from the Father, cast them into the depths of the abyss for eternal destruction.'</s>
    <s>And after a short while: 'In Him, who reigns with your piety.'</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>In these most foolish words, not only the beauty of eloquence but also the sense of speaking is entirely condemned by barbarisms and solecisms, resonating with something unknown.</s>
    <s>This is utterly reprehensible because it referred to the 'divine ears' of Emperor Justinian, a mortal man subject to all human changes, and forbade him to use mercy, making him easy to return evil for evil, neglecting to act patiently and gently in the same cause.</s>
    <s>He who should have worked for the salvation of the condemned, restraining the king's wrath, instead ignited his anger more and more, pushing him to rage fiercely.</s>
    <s>Nor did he follow the example of Him who wishes no one to perish, and who should have been vigilant for saving souls, but instead cast curses and anathemas, and said that God 'co-reigned' with the emperor.</s>

<p>
They find worshipping images less suitable because it is difficult to run through steep places when one is seen stumbling on flat ground. <s>And it is hard for someone to be a guide through uncertain paths if they cannot stay on the open road of the main route.</s>
</p>
<p>
As the Greek text says: “For this reason, to those desiring to view divine things, let them see an image of the Son, who by being seen in a human form indicates the ineffable Father, who is without shape or form. <s>And through this, He brings us to the understanding of the unspeakable and unsearchable nature of the Father.</s> For the honor given to the image passes to the prototype, and the one who worships the image worships in it the being of the one who is represented.”
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is right to honor and revere the images, for they lead us to the prototypes they represent. <s>And those who reject this are in the darkness of ignorance and are separated from the light.</s> 
</p>


<p>
<s>He is disqualified by the most precise teachings of other disciplines, who is found to have the most common knowledge of letters the least.</s>
<s>For while he spoke of what the emperor called the 'divine ears' and said that God 'reigns with him,'</s>
<s>against the nonsense of those who still use such trifles, it has been fully argued in the previous parts of this work by us.</s>
<s>Now the order requires that we discuss the rest of the matters, about which speech is now, supporting our words with the testimonies of divine discourses, as the Lord will grant.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For when he is found to have prohibited mercy, what else does he do except to be seen to contradict all the holy Scriptures, which recount that mercy should be had?</s>
<s>Hence it is very dangerous to follow the teachings of such letters, which seem to oppose the divine Scriptures.</s>
<s>For the Lord says in the gospel, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛstoʊteɪ">Estote</phoneme> <w role="amazon:NN">misericordes</w>, just as your Father is merciful;</s>
<s>and again: Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy;</s>
<s>and the teacher of the nations says: Be kind to one another, merciful, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you;</s>
<s>and the psalmist says the Lord loves mercy, and the mercy of the Lord fills the whole earth;</s>
<s>and the same Lord says through the prophet: For I desire mercy and not sacrifice.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>It's not the sacrifice that matters.</s>
    <s>For while mercy is considered to be held with the most authentic commandments, and the prophet bears witness, saying, "Lord, I will sing of your mercies forever" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="saɪ">Ps.</phoneme> 88,2, and it is said by the Lord to be loved, anyone who prohibits its use and scorns to have it is convinced of not loving God and completely opposing His most excellent teachings.</s>
    <s>Thus, when the Truth itself replied to the lawyer saying that he is the neighbor who showed mercy, "Go and do likewise," <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luːk">Luke</phoneme> 10,37, it is demonstrated that not only should we love humans, who share our nature, but also angels, who, although of a different nature, are considered our neighbors because they exercise mercy towards us.</s>
    <s>And they are entirely commanded to be loved by anyone who loves God and their neighbor.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Because he was so quick to return evil for evil, he completely contradicted divine commands.</s>
    <s>For he should not have been so severe in seeking revenge nor should he have compelled the emperor to seek it, as his duty was not to execute or order revenge but to love works of mercy and to preach them to others.</s>
    <s>The Lord says in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="eksoʊdəs">Exodus</phoneme>, "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to take it back to him" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="eksoʊdəs">Ex.</phoneme> 23,4.</s>
    <s>He did not at all comply with this command because he did not bring back the aforementioned Samaritans from their wandering, if they are believed to have wandered, but instead, he let them perish in the same error, influencing the emperor's mind.</s>

<p>
We really shouldn’t defend something with no justification. 
<break time="0.5s"/> 
What madness or foolishness is it to strive to defend the insults of senseless things, according to the recommendation of the same letters that were sent to Justinian, and to lose the good deeds of kindness, which we shouldn’t lose even for our own slanders, for the sake of the insults of pictures, which don't feel anything at all? 
<break time="0.5s"/> 
So, the writer of that letter did not follow the example of Saint Stephen, the first martyr, when he, while being brutally struck by a shower of stones from all sides, knelt down and prayed for his persecutors.
<break time="0.5s"/> 
However, this writer, unable to bear the insults to the images, which those images do not feel, eagerly and without mercy asked that the perpetrators of the same insults be killed quickly and without mercy, and made sure to bind their souls with the chains of anathema to eternal punishments.
<break time="0.5s"/> 
Meanwhile, the writer of those letters neglected to act patiently or gently in this matter and scorned to fulfill the teaching of the one who wrote to the Thessalonians: "Be patient with everyone; see to it that no one repays evil for evil, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone."
<break time="0.5s"/> 
He also ignored the advice of Proverbs: "Better to be patient and humble than to share spoils with the proud," and while he should have restrained the king's wrath when rescuing the wretched, as Solomon says: "Rescue those being led away to death, and hold back those staggering toward slaughter."
</p>


  <p>
    <s>Spare him; but if you say, "I don't know this man," know that the Lord knows the hearts of men and the one who created the spirit of all, he knows everything and will repay everyone according to their deeds.</s>
    <s>In turn, he stirred the emperor's mind to cruelty with his letters.</s>
    <s>Therefore, those who suffer injustice must be freed.</s>
    <s>Ecclesiasticus shows this; for it says: "Rescue the one who suffers injustice from the hand of the oppressor, and bear it with your soul."</s>
    <s>In judging, be merciful to the orphans like a father and stand for the widow as you would for their husband, and you will be like a son of the Most High, obedient, and he will have more mercy on you than a mother.</s>
    <s>Through the prophet Isaiah, it is also said about this matter: "Seek justice, rescue the oppressed, judge the orphan, and defend the widow."</s>
    <s>"Come, let us reason together," says the Lord, "and if your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; if they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool."</s>
    <s>Rescue the plundered from the hand of the oppressor.</s>
    <s>Therefore, if anyone wants to be like a son of the Most High God, they should persist in good works and desire the mercy of God, to be cleansed from the filth of sins.</s>
    <s>They should follow these most wholesome precepts rather than the perverse cruelty of that letter.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Moreover, the one who incited the emperor's anger acted in a most unlearned manner and completely contradicted the sacred scriptures in this matter as in others.</s>
    <s>For it is said by a certain wise man: "A soul..."</s>
  </p>


    <p>
        All commands are simple: a brave man or an angry man does not act honorably. Likewise, through the same, do not befriend an angry man; and do not stay with a quick-tempered friend, lest you learn his ways and set a trap for your own soul. These ways are forbidden to be learned from a wise man, and even more so, to teach and encourage under oath.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book of Ecclesiasticus also says about this matter: A quick-tempered man stirs up strife, and a sinner will disturb friends and bring slander among those who have peace. And Ecclesiastes gives these precepts: Do not be quick to anger in your spirit, because anger rests in the heart of fools. Therefore, the teacher of the nations writes to the Ephesians: Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your wrath. He also says: Let all bitterness, anger, wrath, shouting, and slander be removed from you, along with all malice. Similarly: Now, put off all anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. These things can almost all be found in the text of the aforementioned letter if examined more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let the most just man and beloved of God, the apostle James, tell us whether anyone should be quick to anger according to the exhortation of this letter! Let him declare whether we should agree with this letter which decrees that the emperor is prone to anger! For he says: Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
    </p>


<p>
Be slow to anger because a man's anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
</p>
<p>
Let the Truth itself tell us what its members should follow in this matter! 
</p>
<p>
Tell us, Saint Matthew, what you have poured out from the eternal source of paradise through the life-giving streams of your river!
</p>
<p>
For the eternal source, the source of life, the source of light, says: Everyone who is angry with their brother will be subject to judgment. 
</p>
<p>
When so many examples of divine law and so many oracles of divine words call anger, which is counted among the principal vices, detestable, it is easy to understand that these letters are not suitable for strengthening matters in question.
</p>
<p>
In these letters, the emperor is commanded under great attestation and humble adjuration to take and carry out certain actions. The author of the same letter should have encouraged those he saw in peril to repent. If they had perhaps scorned repentance, he could have approached the emperor with humble prayers, so that he might compel them to convert. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps they would have followed the good of their own progress that they had scorned voluntarily because Almighty God does not want anyone to perish, as Paul testifies, saying: This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
</p>
<p>
If he had been dedicated to saving souls, he should have urged those he saw erring to repentance more than inciting the prince's mind to shed blood, because the virtue of repentance should not be placed after other virtues.
</p>


<p>We should compare it to the best remedies, as it strengthens what is weak, heals what is sick, restores what is lost, and often brings sinners back to their former state after they have fallen. The psalmist recommends this when he says, <lang xml:lang="la">Delictum meum cognitum tibi feci et injustitias meas non operui</lang>—I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. <break time="0.5s"/> I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin.</p>
<p>Isaiah also commands us to remember these things and grieve, to repent, those of you who have gone astray, and turn back with all your heart. Jeremiah says, Turn back, you rebellious children, and I will heal your brokenness. In another place, he says, Let each of you turn from your evil ways, and improve your ways and deeds. Joel also speaks with the voice of the Lord, saying, Turn back to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Tear your hearts and not your garments, and return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in loving-kindness.</p>
<p>The Book of Ecclesiasticus also says, If we do not repent, we will fall into the hands of the Lord.</p>


<p>
<s>These lovers, compassionate, humble, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but on the contrary, blessing, because to this you were called, that you might inherit a blessing.</s>

</p>

<p>
<s>But let no one think that we judge or slander anyone, whose merits we are completely ignorant of.</s>
<s>Let them know that we do not discuss the life or merit of any just person, but only carefully examine the words of divine scripture that have been improperly brought forward to support error, as they are thoroughly entwined with the roots of errors.</s>
<s>For we do not discuss other words of the same Symeon, which, as we have said before, we do not remember reading, but only those which we understand by their context.</s>
<s>And since we do not know whether these words attributed to Symeon are truly his or someone else's, we know that they are, without any doubt, contrary to the sense of the Holy Scriptures and should rightly be rejected by all ecclesiastical doctrine.</s>

<s>VI. I say that all heretics are worse than Samaritans and that those who destroy images are worse than Samaritans.</s>
<s>For their parents, according to their opinion, were worse than all heretics, as they indeed destroyed images!</s>
<break time="0.5s"/>
<s>It was not enough for them to reject their predecessors or parents with fearful anathemas.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    To create, unless they said that they were 'worse than all heretics,' those who strive to curse them with more atrocious injuries contradict divine warnings all the more. For they say that 'the Samaritans are worse than all heretics' and they prefer those who destroy images to them. It is known that their ancestors destroyed images: and according to their opinion, those who destroy images are worse than the Samaritans; and the Samaritans, as they say, are 'worse than all heretics.' Therefore, as they admit, their ancestors, who are known to have destroyed images, were worse than all heretics.
  </p>
  <p>
    For while they claim that they have been either propagated through the material of the flesh <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="au̯t">or</phoneme> educated in the doctrines of the Scriptures <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="au̯t">or</phoneme> consecrated through the laying on of hands to perform the mysteries of the Christian religion, it is amazing that they consider themselves superior to other Catholics in presenting decrees and establishing the traditions of the church and boast of having such a prerogative of authority, when neither the exercise of their own actions or documents nor the examples of their ancestors prove that they have this.

    For if these people are to be preferred to all Catholics because of the adoration of images, then it will not be the followers of virtues in the church, but the adorers of images who will hold a higher place; and if the adorers of images hold a higher place within the holy church, then it is not virtues but errors that are to be used. <break time="500ms"/> However, it is virtues, not errors, that are to be used.

  <p>Adoration is to be preferred by all Catholics.</p>
  <p>The Samaritans, whom they call 'worse than all heretics', are not heretics of Christians, but of Jews. They do not acknowledge the New Testament, but only the Old Testament. While the Jews believe in the resurrection of the body and accept the prophets and writings, the Samaritans both scorn the resurrection and reject all Scriptures except the five books of the Law. They are remnants of the nations that Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, sent to guard the land of Israel after moving the ten tribes of Israel to the Medes.</p>
  <p>When they were ravaged by lions and other wild beasts or certain unfavorable circumstances in the land of Israel, they sent a message to the king saying they could not remain in that region unless they observed the laws of the God of the land. It is said that some Levites were sent to them to teach them the ceremonies of the law. They accepted some parts but adopted many heretical practices, and their barbaric nature became so inflated with pride that, dismissing the Jews who are believed to have descended from Jacob, they alone claimed to be the children of Jacob and thus, with arrogant pride, they rejected communion with the Jews and other nations.</p>
  <p>This is the origin of the Samaritan woman who communicated with the Lord at the well. She boastfully claimed that Jacob, who had given her the well, was her father and that he was greater than the Redeemer of the world.</p>

    <s>He came with a great stubbornness, claiming that his ancestors worshipped not in Jerusalem but on the mountain.</s>
    <s>He set aside this stubbornness along with his disbelief and accepted the healthy teachings.</s>
    <s>If we briefly explore what these actions symbolically suggest, it is not inconsistent.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, he represented the entire human race, which, as the world was aging, came to the Lord.</s>
    <s>The Lord, at the sixth age of the world, sat by the well, which signifies the earthly toil and error of this world in its dark depth.</s>
    <s>He sat, I say, indicating the humility of the flesh He took on for us, 'tired', signifying the weakness of that same flesh.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Although, in another sense, His sitting demonstrates the dignity of His teaching and doctrine.</s>
    <s>He thirsted not only for water but also wished to draw the faith of the nations.</s>
    <s>Therefore, when His disciples urged Him to eat, He said He had food they did not know about.</s>
    <s>He thirsted for the faith of the Gentiles to carry out the will of the Father and complete His work.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>He promised to give her the living water, meaning the Spirit, which those who believed in Him would receive.</s>
    <s>He said she had five husbands, that is...</s>
  </p>


<p>She had used her five physical senses and the sense which she would finally have, by which she would come to believe in Christ, with whom she could have a legitimate union, was no longer hers. For after the five physical responses, with the sixth response, she names Christ.</p>
<p>Her first response is: <s> "You, being a Jew, how do you ask me for a drink?" </s> The second: <s> "Lord, you have no bucket, and the well is deep." </s> The third: <s> "Lord, give me this water, so I will neither thirst nor come here to draw." </s> The fourth: <s> "I have no husband." </s> The fifth: <s> "I see that you are a prophet; our fathers worshiped on this mountain."</s> For that response is physical; for a physical place had been given to them where they might pray, not to worship a place or a thing set in place, but to worship the Lord in that place. But the spiritual ones will worship in spirit and truth, not in images, not in pictures, not in things lacking in sense, as the Lord said.</p>
<p>After He spoke, the woman's sixth response acknowledges Christ as the teacher of all these things. She says: <s> "I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things." </s> But she is still mistaken, for she does not see that He whom she hopes will come, has already come, which error the Lord's mercy dispels by saying: <s> "I am He, who speaks to you."</s> On hearing this, she said nothing, but left her water jar—symbolizing her desire and love for this world, by which people draw themselves from the dark depths and earthly life.</p>

    <s>They seek pleasure, and once it is perceived, they burn with desire for it again.</s>

  <p>
    <s>As it is written: "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again" - he went into the city, because he believed.</s>
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Since we have strayed a bit from the proposed topic, let's return to it.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The Samaritans, who are indeed Gentiles and seem to hold Judaism falsely, are not known to rage against the church more than other unbelievers.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>They consider these people heretics of the Christians and think they are worse than all other heretics.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>They show them a certain clemency, teaching that their ancestors should be preferred in wickedness.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For it is not the worst of all when someone else can be found to be preferred in guilt.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>VII. Regarding the fact that the more examples of heretics and those who despise or reject images they take, the more they dishonor their parents with greater insults and injuries, whom they undoubtedly profess to be their followers in this part.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The most ancient custom, not only of philosophers but also of orators, is to take arguments either from the matter itself being discussed or from other things or certainly from outside sources when they want to prove something.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>While they despise following others in most things due to ignorance, they strive to follow them entirely in this part, taking arguments either from the matter of image abolition or from other things or external sources.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    They decide to condemn and insult with abuse, curse with anathemas, and dishonor with the most insane words without fear. The more examples of certain heretics they bring forward as testimony, claiming those heretics as their followers, the more they denounce them with graver excommunications and show themselves to be contrary to divine commands, which enjoin honor to parents. The Lord says, "Honor your father and your mother so that it may go well with you." This command carries such authority that it is written by the finger of the Lord on tablets and is named by the Apostle as the first commandment. For he says, "Honor your father and mother," which is the first commandment with a promise, namely, "so that you may live long on the earth and it may go well with you."
  </p>
  <p>
    It should indeed be noted how great the condemnation is for those who insult or curse their parents, given the merit and promise for those who honor them according to the command of the Lord. Because just as those who follow this command are rewarded with a great promise, so too should those who resist the Lord's command be deterred by a dreadful condemnation. It is also written in Leviticus: "Everyone must respect their father...
  </p>


  <p>
    Respect and fear your mother. In Ecclesiasticus, it is also written about honoring parents: "Whoever honors their father will live a long life; and whoever obeys their father will bring comfort to their mother and will serve those who gave them life, in work, speech, and all patience, and their blessing will remain in the end."
  </p>
  <p>
    Also in Ecclesiasticus: "Child, endure the old age of your father and do not sadden him during his life; and if his understanding fails, forgive him and do not despise him in your strength. It is not your glory, but your disgrace."
  </p>
  <p>
    The teacher of the nations also says: "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." For if it pleases God to honor or obey parents, it greatly displeases him to insult or curse them in any way; and if it does not displease him, neither does it please him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it is serious and fearful not to honor parents; but it is most serious and most fearful to despise or curse them. The Lord says: "Whoever curses their father or mother shall be put to death." And again: "Cursed is anyone who does not honor their father or mother," and all the people will say, "Amen, amen."
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also written in Proverbs: "Whoever curses their father or mother will have their lamp extinguished in deep darkness." And again: "Whoever drives away their father or mother and thinks they are not sinning is a companion to a wicked person."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it must be known that those who act this way are not of a moderate madness.
  </p>


<p>
Those who lack sense are not afraid to heap insults on their ancestors. And while they want to honor images, they do not hesitate to dishonor their parents or go against divine prophecies. We do not favor their ancestors, whom we know acted absurdly in this matter, but we demonstrate the audacity of these people with the evidence of divine law.
</p>
<p>
According to the deacon Demetrius, their parents acted recklessly and disorderly by burning two silver-bound books just because they contained some mention of images. They also cut out two pages from another book.
</p>
<p>
Neither side has shown restraint. These people are not controlled by reason, nor do we believe their predecessors were restrained. Both are driven wildly and follow forbidden and unproductive things. As we have often said, these people think images should be worshipped, while the others, as Demetrius the deacon says, impatiently believe they should be destroyed. They recklessly burned two silver-bound books because they contained some mention of images and cut out two pages from another book, as if images could only be mentioned if they were to be worshipped.
</p>


<p>
<s>
Some people might lightly revere images from books,
</s>
<s>
but in many instances, these images are mentioned in a certain way.
</s>
<s>
If all books mentioning these images were to be burned, many important texts would be lost.
</s>
<s>
First of all, each thing must be examined and then judged.
</s>
<s>
This can be proven with many examples from both divine and worldly laws,
</s>
<s>
and it can also be supported by the teachings of rhetoricians.
</s>
<s>
They have established three types of oratory: deliberative, demonstrative, and judicial.
</s>
<s>
Whatever deliberation finds to be either rejected or followed,
</s>
<s>
demonstration shows it to be either praiseworthy or blameworthy,
</s>
<s>
and the judicial gives a verdict of either punishment or reward.
</s>
<s>
If the judicial does not precede the other two types,
</s>
<s>
the causes might be reversed, and the examination of deliberation might be misplaced,
</s>
<s>
the order of demonstration neglected,
</s>
<s>
and any matter judged differently than what is just.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Therefore, moderation or mediocrity must be maintained in all things,
</s>
<s>
and we must remember the philosophical saying, "Nothing in excess."
</s>
<s>
This moderation must always be accompanied by evidence.
</s>
<s>
For the Apostle does not say, "Burn everything without moderation and without examination,"
</s>
<s>
but rather, "Examine everything; keep what is good."
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Leontius, in the same book, seeing images on silver tablets,
</s>
<s>
boasted of having found the sharpest and most honorable correction of his error.
</s>
<s>
In that book, there were two pages mentioning images.
