In that appearance, he realized and said, "This is Samuel." He explained what he understood and, because he did not understand well, he worshipped someone other than the Lord according to Scripture. Thinking he was worshipping Samuel, he actually worshipped the devil, so that Satan could gain the benefit of his deceit. Satan strives to be worshipped as if he were God. If Samuel had appeared to him, surely a just man would not have allowed himself to be worshipped, as he had preached that only the Lord should be worshipped.

<p>
And how could a man of God, who was with Abraham in rest, say to a man deserving the fiery punishment of hell, "Tomorrow you will be with me"? With these two details, the unsuspecting Satan revealed the subtlety of his deceit, because he allowed himself to be worshipped under the appearance and name of Samuel, which I believe Samuel would not have permitted, and lied that a man burdened with sins would be with the most just Samuel, despite the great distance between sinners and the just. It could be seen as true if Samuel's name were omitted, because Saul was destined to be with the devil. For he migrated to the one he worshipped, although he would be with the saints.

However, in the book it is noted that different opinions on this matter are held by the blessed Augustine and other teachers. The book of Ecclesiasticus praises Samuel for prophesying after his death.

    Those who think that almost all of the Christian faith's importance lies in the worship or veneration of images should be asked whether any poor person would lose their faith simply because they lack the means to acquire a picture. If a poor person is deprived of good merits because they don't have the resources to obtain images, then a wealthy person would have an unfair advantage just because they can afford to buy pictures. If people receive rewards or punishments based on their possessions rather than their merits, and if judgments are made based on need rather than actions, then the veneration of images would take a significant place in the Christian religion, and justice, which evaluates the merits of individuals, not their possessions, would largely lose its power. Since none of these outcomes can be logically approved, it follows that the veneration of images should not be considered a principal part of the Christian religion.

    They falsely call their council universal, even though it clearly was not assembled by the universal church. Among the various errors said to be done or written in that council, this one is no less significant: they call that council universal, although it neither maintains the unshaken purity of universal faith nor holds authority through the actions of all churches. Just as the universal church is called catholic in Greek, so anything that does not depart from its unity is called catholic.

    <s>It is indeed possible.</s> 
    <s>All Christian teaching or any regulation or tradition should be such that it agrees with the universal church.</s> 
    <s>However, heretics have never observed this, as they have set up small assemblies in various parts of the world, confined to some regions, thereby separating themselves and many others from the fellowship of church unity.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>When therefore the bishops of two or three provinces come together and, armed with the institution of ancient canons, establish something of preaching or doctrine that does not differ from the teachings of the ancient Fathers, it is catholic and can perhaps be called universal, because although it is not enacted by the bishops of the whole world, it does not differ from the faith and tradition of all.</s>
    <s>We know that this has often been done in many parts of the world due to certain pressing needs.</s>
    <s>Indeed, many councils have been held, whose institutions fortify and strengthen the holy church.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But if the bishops of two or three provinces come together and, wishing to establish some new things, form small assemblies, because they do not agree with the church of the whole world but dissent from it in some way, what they do is not catholic and therefore cannot be called universal.</s>

<s>Everything that is ecclesiastical is Catholic, and everything that is Catholic is universal.</s> 
<s>However, everything that is universal is free from the innovations of profane words.</s> 
<s>Therefore, everything that is ecclesiastical is free from the innovations of profane words.</s> 
<s>For if this synod were free from the innovations of words and content with the doctrines of the ancient fathers, it could be called universal.</s> 
<s>However, it is not content with the doctrines of the ancient fathers, so it cannot be called universal.</s> 
<s>For universality is named from one thing, which is propagated by being turned into many things; indeed, a multitude of units collected into one becomes universality.</s>
<s>We would not hesitate to declare this synod truly universal, if we did not feel that it opposed the doctrines of the universal church.</s>

    <p>It is often said that actions speak louder than words. Some priests of such kinds are put forward. He answered that he would serve. It appears, at times, that many things are lost, but with effort, they can be found. Therefore, one must seek the truth and follow the teachings of orthodox men. It is essential to question and understand the reasons behind decisions to avoid making mistakes and to strengthen our resolve.</p>
    <p>We should always strive to correct errors and improve our understanding through the guidance and documents provided by wise individuals. Let us not mock those who have put forth great effort to enlighten us. Instead, we should add to their knowledge and continue to grow. Let us remember to be diligent in our pursuit of wisdom and to hold firm in our beliefs.</p>
