<s>Therefore, they do not seek the grace of God in that truth, about which the Holy Truth and true Piety said: "If you remain in my word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."

<s>It must be asked of those who are so mistaken that they call images holy and true according to their own will, and not rather according to the tradition of the venerable fathers of the saints.</s>
<s>These images are believed to be the holiest or truest of all, which, while reason does not allow them to be called equal due to differences in materials, sizes, or craftsmanship, compel us to admit that some are holier and some the holiest.</s>
<s>According to the investigative reason of truth, it follows that they ought not to be called holy or true, for they are unequal in value, preferring some over others through comparative grades.</s>
<s>In merit of holiness and truth, they are equal, which they entirely lack.</s>
<s>Just as a precious image admits one more precious and most precious, so a holy and true one could admit one holier and truer, holiest and truest, if indeed there were a positive degree from which the comparative and superlative could emerge.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Consider, holiness is present in a painted image.</s>
<s>Before it was made, where was it?</s>
<s>Was it in the wood taken from the forest for use, whose remnants are consigned to the fire?</s>
<s>Was it in the colors, often made from impure substances?</s>
<s>Or in the wax, which absorbs both colors and dirt?</s>

<p>
<s>Is it? <break time="0.5s"/> If it’s in wood, why is it that when something is chopped with a blunt axe, cut with a chisel, or shaved with a plane, and then burned, reduced to ashes, or melted by intense heat, it perishes, while holiness never perishes? <break time="0.5s"/> Or if holiness is not in these things, as we have indeed discussed, then where does it come from after being composed of many materials? <break time="0.5s"/> Since it is neither found to come by the laying on of hands nor by any canonical consecration, it is not to be believed that it is present. <break time="0.5s"/> And if it were present, it might be asked whether it would age and decay with the material or pass to another object created from the remnants. <break time="0.5s"/> For if it were present, it would come from somewhere else; if it came from somewhere else, it would pass to another. <break time="0.5s"/> But it does not pass to another

<s>These people, even within the church, boldly attempt to establish new and foolish rules and do not fear to call themselves 'divine' and their deeds 'divine' in a pagan manner.</s>
<s>Thus, just as the first humans, enticed by the promise of the serpent in the flowering seat of paradise, committed wrongs, so these people, deceived by the wiles of the ancient enemy, perpetrate similar deeds within the church.</s>
<s>They do not refuse to call themselves 'divine' due to their vanity and strive through greedy ambition to introduce something new into the church.</s>
<s>Therefore, whoever desires more than the order requires and wishes to be more extraordinary than they are, is cast down by Him who regards the humble and knows the high from afar, becoming less than they are.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s>It can be approved that while one was planning to place his seat in the north, he was deprived of angelic honor and companionship and was assigned to the darkness of this gloom.</s>

<s>If their falls are to be avoided, their actions must be fled; if their actions are to be fled, the practice of humility must be embraced.</s>
<s>Therefore, if their falls are to be avoided, the practice of humility must be embraced, through which, along with the other instruments of good works, we can become like the one to whom it was said: "Behold, I have made you a god to Pharaoh," and sons of God, according to what is written: "But to all who received him, he gave the power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name."</s>
<s>For God is essentially called the creator of all, according to "For the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods," but there is another way in which powers and men are abusively called gods.</s>
<s>The Apostle says, "Even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth, for us there is one God, the Father," and the psalmist says, "I said, 'You are gods.'" In the third way, according to sacrilegious superstition, aerial powers are called gods, according to "For all the gods of the nations are demons."</s>
</p>

<p><s>In the first way, no one can be essentially called God, except the one who is ineffable, unchangeable, eternal, and omnipotent.</s></p>

<p>There is the highest good, a singular peak, <break/> three in persons, one in nature, who is above all things <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdeɪəs">God</phoneme> blessed forever.</p>
<p>Secondly, angels and humans can also be called by that name of dignity, which is reached only by obeying God, embracing humility, despising arrogance, and clinging to Him through good works.</p>
<p>The third mode has several types. For instance, demons were considered gods by the pagans, and stars or many other creatures of the world were thought and called gods. Inventors of certain worldly arts, founders of cities, or those holding imperial scepters were believed to be transferred into gods after death and were called divine, and their images were termed gods. These names, having spurned the true God and disregarding humility, were arrogantly usurped by demonic or human pride. Christians should hate these as they hate the author of lies. For whoever despises the author of lies should also despise the lie itself; and whoever despises the lie should also despise the name 'liar'. Therefore, whoever despises the author of lies should also despise the name 'liar'. The author of lies is the one of whom it was said: He was a liar from the beginning and did not stand in truth.</p>

<p>The name 'divine' is not undeservedly false, which sinners, seized for their eternal punishments, strive to claim as divine merit. Therefore, if lovers of this name confess that it does not pertain to divinity, let them hear the Gentiles themselves, who used this name more familiarly in their writings, and 'divine' for gods.</p>

<p><s>Evos used to place almost indifferently for the gods. 'Divos' for gods, as in: "You allow the gods to recline at the feast." And again: "What are those divine powers asking?" That is, of the gods.
'Deos' however for divos, as in: "Or do you come as a god of the vast sea, and your sailors worship only your divine power?" For it was said to Octavian, whom they thought would be transferred among the gods after his death.
Let it cease, therefore, let the ambition of the false name cease, let the trace of ancient error be abandoned, let the term of blind superstition fade, let the arrogance of the insolent name be renounced, let the pagan lie of transferring men among the gods be removed by the faithful. Now truth has risen from the earth, now the sun of justice has risen for the faithful, now those who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, now light has risen for those dwelling in the region of the shadow of death. All false things have been abolished with the coming of truth. For if the pagan opinion of false gods is false, the fable of transferring men among the gods after death is false. But if the fable of transferring men among the gods after death is false, the naming of the 'divine' name is vain. Therefore, if the pagan opinion of false gods is false, the naming of the 'divine' name is also vain. It clearly shows that a false thing has a false name and that those who are disciples of the truth should not be called by a false name.
For even if some Catholics have perhaps called certain deceased 'of divine memory' somewhere...</s></p>

<p>It's clear that they followed the practices of pagans, as the names of the days and months are often named after pagan vanities. But these and similar things were admitted more by Roman ambition than by apostolic tradition.</p>
<p>We, who are followers of the Truth and have been redeemed by the Truth itself, should reject pagan names as we have rejected the lies of pagan gods. As the Apostle teaches in <sub alias="Second Corinthians">2 Corinthians</sub> 6:14-15, "What fellowship has light with darkness? What agreement has Christ with Belial?" By His grace, may we be freed from this association, as He has delivered us from the darkness and shadow of death and transferred us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption and the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>IV. Regarding what Constantine and Irene wrote in their letter to the venerable Pope Adrian of the city of Rome: "We ask your fatherhood, and God asks most of all, who wants no man to perish."</p>
<p>He who audaciously says that God 'reigns with him' and proudly and paganishly calls his deeds 'divine' will undoubtedly dare to say that God, whose kingdom and power it is, asks someone for something. While he arrogantly extends his own majesty, he attempts to diminish the authority of divine majesty. It's no wonder that he presumes to elevate his own words when he tries to undermine the divine with unschooled words. For God is known to have commanded the creation of light and to have separated the waters from the waters, and to have set a boundary for them so that they would not be confused again.</p>

<p><s>They say he adorned the sky with the shining brilliance of stars, and filled the waters with swimming creatures and the air with flying ones.</s>
<s>They request your paternal blessing, indeed it is God who asks, who desires all to be saved.</s>
<s>Regarding Moses, it is written that he acted according to what the Lord commanded, and the same is written: ‘At the Lord’s command the camps of the children of Israel would move, and

 at the Lord’s command they would set up camp.’</s>
<s>And he says, 'Indeed, God asks,' as he who is unchanging, ineffable, eternal, and who created and governs all visible and invisible nature by his power, begins to ask.</s>
<s>This word is not one of power, but of supplication, not of authority, but of necessity, not of commanding, but of pleading.</s>
<s>For since there is no need in God and 'to ask' is to plead and 'to plead' is to be in need, whoever says that God asks undoubtedly attributes need to him.</s>
<s>If there is need in him, there is necessity.</s>
<s>If there is necessity, there is no omnipotence.</s>
<s>He indeed is omnipotent, thus there is no need in him.</s></p>

<p>It is written: The Lord is exalted above all nations, and his glory is above the heavens.</p>
<p>If they happen to say that it is fitting to 'ask' because of the Son's person, who, according to the Apostle, humbled himself, taking the form of a servant and becoming like men and being found in human form, let them listen to him saying: Lazarus, come out; and again: Take up your mat and go; and again: Little girl, I say to you, arise; and again: Young man, I say to you, get up; and other such things, which are not words of someone asking, but of someone commanding, not requesting, but ordering. We read that the apostles also had this authority in his name. For the pastor of the church, when he had healed Aeneas, said: In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, rise and walk. See, Peter commands in the name of Jesus, and they say he should 'ask' Jesus. A servant grants health to the sick by the authority of the Lord's name, and they say he should 'ask' the priest. This should be considered not prudence, but utmost foolishness.</p>
<p>If they happen to want to use as support for their error, what the Truth itself says: I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, and this: Father, glorify your name, let them consider that he did not say this according to his divinity, in which he remains of one substance with the Father and equal to the Father, of which he says: I and the Father are one, but according to his humanity, in which the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and of which he says.</p>

<p>Pater maior me est. Qui dum in forma servi minor sit Patre, in forma Dei aequalis ei procul dubio creditur. Unde et Apostolus ait: Non rapinam arbitratus est esse se <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛː.kʷa.lɛm">equalem</phoneme> Deo, id est: non ei fuit tamquam rapina, quasi alienum appeteret, qui sicut coaeternus, ita coaequalis est Patri. Quem idem Apostolus verum hominem et verum Deum confitetur, cum dicit: Quorum patres et ex quibus Christus, qui est super omnia Deus benedictus in saecula. Cui si secundum illorum socordiam quempiam 'rogare' necesse est, alicui subest; et si alicui subest, non est super omnia. Super omnia autem est; non igitur ei quempiam 'rogare' necesse est. Audiant ergo, audiant huiusce dicti auctores, quid beatus Ambrosius contra quosdam fidei hostes de hoc verbo dixerit: Sed lectum est, quia rogavit. Disce distantiam: rogat quasi Filius hominis, imperat quasi Dei Filius. An non defertis hoc Dei Filio, quod etiam diabolus detulit, et eos maiore sacrilegio derogatis? Ille dicit: 'Si Filius Dei es, dic lapidi huic, ut fiat panis'. Ille dicit: 'impera'; vos dicitis: 'obsecra'. Ille credit, quod iubente Dei Filio elementorum rerumque in adversum natura certatur; vos creditis, quod, nisi roget Dei Filius, nec voluntas ipsius impleatur.</p>

<p>Armed with the armor of faith, the church's warrior fought against the enemies of faith. Among whom, anyone who fears to be counted should avoid such madness. Meanwhile, let the holy evangelist say what the Lord did when the disciples were afraid, and the boat was already being covered by the waves. Then, rising up, he commanded the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. Let him also say what the centurion said to the Lord when he was planning to go to his house and heal his servant: "Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."</p>
<p>O unfortunate speech! O detestable error! O pride that brings swelling rather than strength, that increases inflation rather than power! The centurion believes that with just a word, he can heal the servant who is to be mocked, scourged, to suffer, to taste death, and to descend into the underworld. And you say that he, who sits at the right hand of the Father in the heavens above all principalities and powers and virtues and dominions and every name that is named not only in this age but also in the future, should 'ask' anyone! Therefore, it is not necessary for him to 'ask', who is believed to have power over the heavenly, earthly, and infernal realms.</p>
<p>It is not a small sin to understand the Holy Scriptures differently than they are meant to be understood, and to adapt them to senses that they do not contain, just as in the erroneous synod, which was in Bithynia, during the reign of Constantine, with his mother Helena intervening, and Tharasius presiding.</p>

<p>We learned from the sacred law's teaching that when the rock was struck, water flowed for the thirsty people. We are also taught by apostolic instruction that this rock should be understood as Christ. He is the rock whose streams water the dry hearts, the river whose flow brings joy to the city of God, the fountain of life from which everlasting life flows to believers, and the heavenly bread that eradicates eternal hunger from the hearts of the faithful. Whoever receives his spiritual drink and food differently than how he gives them, interprets the divine Scriptures in a way other than how they were delivered by the Holy Spirit, and is found to be alien to his pastures. For the prophet says, "The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace." Without a doubt, he seeks to corrupt their purity with false taint when he attempts to mix them with foreign meanings. For whoever, out of arrogance and a desire for vain praise, uses the divine Scriptures to support his own error, does nothing else but disgracefully captivate the purity of the divine word into adultery and drags the silver refined by the fire of the Holy Spirit into the contamination of other metals, that is, foreign meanings. About such people, the Lord complains through the prophet: "I gave them silver and gold, and they made Baal," meaning they turned the dignity of spiritual understanding and the purity of the word into something else.</p>

<p>Their beauty turned into horror by corrupt senses and empty glory. For when the lawgiver says, in Deuteronomy 33:2, "In the right hand of the Lord is a fiery law," it is amazing how great their dullness is, who are neither soothed by its clarity nor frightened by its heat. Just as it illuminates those who approach it with pure sense and devout mind with the brilliance of its clarity, so in contrast, it burns those who presumptuously come near it with its flames. Thus, those who cling to it with humble mind and purified senses have their steps fortified in the race of this present life by its lamp's illumination; but those who seek it with foreign and reckless senses are burned by the eternal fire, as symbolized by the four sons of Aaron. For when Eleazar and Ithamar offered the sacred fire to the Lord according to Moses' instruction, they obtained the dignity of the priestly office, but Nadab and Abihu, attempting to offer strange fire to the Lord, were punished with the most dreadful death. Anyone who wants to avoid danger should flee from this example. So who, who in this deed, will interpret well-spoken words poorly?</p>

<p>They seize upon, and attack only him who, as it was said of the simple and just man, tries to interpret in the Mediator between God and men, when he says: "For it is written: He will command his angels concerning you, and with their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone." To make his temptation argument stronger, he drew an example from divine writings, so that he might more willingly drink the cup of his temptation if it had the seasoning of the holy Scriptures. For if he is to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures, then he is to be followed in deceitful temptations. And if he is to be followed in deceitful temptations, then he is to be embraced in all other behaviors. But he is not to be embraced in all other behaviors; therefore, he is not to be imitated in interpreting the Scriptures. For the blessed Jerome says: The devil interprets the Scriptures badly. Indeed, both heretics and schismatics, who are certainly his

 followers, understand the divine Scriptures wrongly, interpret them worse, and observe them in the worst way. However, Catholics, instructed by the examples of Truth, resist the temptations of the ancient enemy and oppose the machinations of heresies. Receiving the manna of the divine word with a pure and sound mind, they are nourished by its sweet foods, which, when collected improperly, do not boil with worms, that is, their consciences and the innermost thoughts are not pierced by the pricks of pride. Therefore, discussing what was written arrogantly or ignorantly by Constantine and Herena to the venerable pope Adrian of the city of Rome,</p>

<p>Or, in the shortest summary possible, how the holy Scriptures should not be understood or interpreted differently or adapted to each person's own understanding, but should be understood according to sound and sober teaching. Now, let's follow the order of testimonies, which has been arranged from the holy Scriptures or the treatises of the holy fathers, and which has been improperly or not properly used by those known to have sat in the aforementioned synod, in an appropriate order with the Lord's favor. We will only briefly state what the holy fathers have determined about these matters, or how they were declared by venerable men, which madness has accumulated to support their error. After listing these things in the present first two volumes, the series of the following two books, with the Lord's blessing, will examine what they have less learnedly and contrary to the institution of the holy fathers declared due to the excessive veneration of images, preceding in the following chapter, how the holy Roman church among other churches is held in the highest regard for matters of faith.</p>

<p>The sacred Roman Catholic and apostolic Church, which is preferred over other churches for reasons of faith, must be consulted whenever a question arises. Before we delve into the discussion of the testimonies, which the Easterners have absurdly criticized in their synod, we thought it fitting to explain how the holy Roman Church is preferred by the Lord over other churches and should be consulted by the faithful. This is especially true since testimonies should be taken only from those scriptures that it accepts as canonical, and the teachings of other doctors should be embraced only if they were accepted by Gelasius or other pontiffs of that holy see. These teachings should not be interpreted according to anyone's personal judgment, but clearly and soberly understood as they were intended. For blessed Augustine says, when establishing which scriptures should be accepted or how they should be understood: "The most diligent investigator of divine Scriptures will be the one who first reads and knows all the Scriptures, and if not yet understanding them, at least reads them, especially those called canonical." For he will read the others more safely, instructed by the faith of truth, so that they do not preoccupy the weak mind and, deceiving with dangerous lies and phantasms, cause any prejudice against sound understanding. In the canonical Scriptures, he should follow the authority of the many Catholic churches, among which those that have apostolic sees and receive epistles should certainly be included.</p>

<p>They brought out. For since this seat is generally preferred by all apostolic seats established throughout the world, much more should that seat be preferred above all others, which has even been placed above other apostolic seats. Just as Peter stands out among the other disciples and all the apostles, so it is known that the Roman apostolic seat stands out among the other apostolic seats. For this seat was preferred not by any synodical constitutions over other churches but by the authority of the Lord himself, saying, "You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it, and I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." Not inappropriately, the blessed Paul, the teacher of the nations, was associated with this, so that the authority of that holy church might be firmly established, as one was chosen by the fisherman to fish souls, and the other by the persecutor to fortify the church, so that in one the true confession of the Son of God appeared, and in the other the sacred preaching of the divine word; For the same Son of God granted to one the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and to the other the key to open the words of the law, but to both the power of signs, so that one going to him by the cross, and the other by the sword, leaving to the faithful the pledge of their bodily burden and the brilliance of their example and the beauty of their word and holy blood, they illuminated the said Roman church.</p>

<p>When they said to him, he was like a house built on the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɑlɪd">solid</phoneme> rock that neither the coming floods nor the blowing winds could shake. Therefore, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sæŋk">sacred</phoneme> faith, fortified by <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈspɪrɪtʃuəl">spiritual</phoneme> weapons and nourished by the life-giving sources of light and goodness, withstands the terrible and atrocious heresies and serves the sweet cups of preaching to the Catholic churches around the world. The blessed Jerome, a man learned in divine laws and skilled in many languages, while dwelling in the fields of Bethlehem and being consulted by the blessed Pope Damasus at Rome on difficult questions, is known to have consulted him in turn for matters of faith. And whether it was about the substance of things to be said or not said, or which parts of the East should be communicated with, he humbly prayed to receive the answers. A wonderful thing and worthy of great praise: he asks advice from the one who asks him, consults the one who consults him. Though he sees himself as a master in interpreting the divine scriptures, he is not ashamed to be a disciple in matters of faith to the venerable pontiff, and the one who unravels the intricate knots of sacred law.</p>

<p>There is a request to determine whether the term 'hypostasis' should be used and with whom it should be shared in the East. This shows that holy and learned men, shining with the lamp of preaching and science in different parts of the world, not only did not depart from the holy Roman Church but also sought help from it in times of necessity to strengthen their faith. As we have previously stated and demonstrated with examples, all Catholic churches should regularly observe this, seeking assistance from it after Christ to fortify their faith. The Church, without blemish or wrinkle and trampling underfoot the monstrous heads of heresies, strengthens the minds of the faithful in faith. Although many have departed from its holy and venerable communion, our church has never left it. Instead, guided by its apostolic teaching and receiving all good and perfect gifts from Him, it has always received revered charisms. From the early days of faith, while standing firm in sacred religious unity with it and being only slightly distant in the celebration of duties, which is not against faith, our church was united in the order of singing with the venerable memory of our illustrious and excellent father, King Pippin, through his care and industry and the arrival in Gaul of the most reverent and holy man, Stephen, the bishop of the city of Rome. This was so that the order of singing would not differ where the order of belief was the same, and that those united by the sacred reading of one sacred law would also be united by the venerable tradition of one manner of singing.</p>

<p>Do not let the varied celebrations of duties separate you, which the devoted piety of true faith has united. This is what we did when God granted us the kingdom of Italy. We aimed to elevate the status of the Holy Roman Church, inspired by the salutary exhortations of the most reverent Pope Adrian. Specifically, we wanted more churches in that region, which once refused the tradition of the apostolic seat in chanting, to now embrace it with all diligence. Let them adhere to the order of chanting, just as they adhere to the gift of faith. Not only the provinces of Gaul, Germany, and Italy, but also the Saxons and some northern peoples are known to have been converted to the basics of true faith through us, with God's approval.</p>

VII. "It does not pertain to the worship of images, what is written in Genesis: 'God created man in His own image and likeness'." In this testimony, the argument put forth by them in their assembly to support the error of worshipping images is inconsistent and exceedingly flawed, as it is far removed from their assertion by many indicators. Where there is no semblance of truth, the debate is not greatly complicated. Therefore, since no person of sound mind believes that it pertains to the matter they strive to apply it to, but rather a spiritual saying must be examined with a spiritual inquiry, it remains for us to briefly note what the style of the holy fathers has delivered on this matter. So that what has been carelessly usurped by them, and spiritually delivered by venerable men filled with the Holy Spirit, may be diligently accepted by the reader's industry.</s>

  <p>
    And I hear that the Son is eternal and one work. I hear the speaker, I recognize the doer, but I also read of one image and one likeness of both the Father and the Son. This likeness is not of diversity, but of unity. For a man cannot be in the image of God except through the image of God. Therefore, the image of God must be considered from the nobility of the inner man.

    Firstly, just as God is one, always, entirely present everywhere, giving life to all things, moving and governing them, as the Apostle confirms, that "in Him we live, move, and have our being," so too the soul, in its body, is entirely present everywhere, giving it life, moving, and governing it. For it is not greater in the larger parts of the body and smaller in the smaller parts, but wholly present in the smallest and wholly present in the largest. And this is the image of the unity of almighty God, which the soul has within itself. This soul also has a certain image of the Holy Trinity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firstly, because just as God exists, lives, and knows, so too the soul, in its highest form, exists, lives, and knows. There is also another trinity in it, made in the image of its Creator, the perfect and supreme Trinity, which is in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And although of one nature, it has three dignities within itself, that is, intellect, will, and memory. This same idea, although in different words, is designated in the Gospel, where it says: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind," that is, with all your intellect, with all your will, and with all your memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    For just as the Son is begotten from the Father, from the Father...
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>And the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son as well.</s>
    <s>In the same way, willpower is generated from understanding, and from these two together, memory proceeds.</s>
    <s>This can be easily understood by any wise person.</s>
    <s>For a soul cannot be perfect without these.</s>

    <s>The law of nature is wonderfully represented in the nature of our inner person.</s>
    <s>The likeness must be seen in the character, so that just as God the Creator, who created man in His own image, is love, is goodness, and is just, patient and meek, pure and merciful, and other virtues of the saints which are read about Him, so man was created to have love, to be good and just and patient and meek, pure and merciful.</s>
    <s>The more anyone has these virtues within themselves, the closer they are to God and the more they will resemble their Creator.</s>

    <s>Blessed Augustine also explained that man was made in the image and likeness of God.</s>
    <s>When divine Scripture mentions the outward and inward man and distinguishes them, and the Apostle said, ‘Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day’, it can be asked, which of these is made in the image and likeness of God?</s>
    <s>For it is foolish to ask if one, which one?</s>
    <s>Who doubts that it is rather the one who is renewed, than the one who perishes?</s>
    <s>Whether both are, is a great question.</s>
    <s>For if the outward man is Adam and the inward Christ, both are well understood; but since Adam, as he was made by God, did not remain good and by loving carnal things became carnal, it can not unreasonably be considered that this very thing was for him to fall, to lose the image and likeness of God; and thus he himself is renewed and he himself is the inward man.</s>
  </p>

 
  <p>
    Is it both outward and inward? Or according to the body, so that the inward part is according to the soul, and the inward part is resurrection and renewal, which now happens according to the death of the previous life, that is, sin, and according to the regeneration of new life, that is, righteousness? 
  </p>
  <p>
    He calls these two men in such a way: one is old, which we should discard, and the other is new and should be put on as mentioned in Ephesians 4:24. He again calls the former the image of the earthly man, because it is according to the sin of the first man, who is Adam; the latter is the image of the heavenly man, because it is according to the righteousness of the second man, who is Jesus Christ. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The outward man, who is now corrupted, will be renewed in the future resurrection when he pays the death that is owed to nature by the law given in paradise through the commandment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    How it is not incongruent that the body is also said to be made in the likeness of God is easily understood by anyone who carefully considers what was said: "And God made all things very good." For no one doubts that He Himself was good first. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For many things can be said to be similar to God in various ways: some according to virtue and wisdom, because in Him is virtue and wisdom not made; others in that they merely exist, because He exists supremely and primarily; others in that they are, because He is supremely and primarily. 
  </p>
  <p>
    And therefore, those things which merely exist but do not live or know are not perfectly but slightly similar to Him, because they too are good in their order, while He is above all.
  </p>


<p>
All good things come from the one who is good. <s>Everything that lives and does not understand shares a little more in likeness.</s> <s>For what lives also exists, but not everything that exists also lives.</s> <s>Moreover, those who understand are so close in likeness that there is nothing closer among creatures.</s> <s>For what shares in wisdom both lives and exists; what lives must exist, but it does not have to understand.</s> <s>Therefore, since a person can participate in wisdom through their inner self, they are in the image of God in such a way that no nature comes between and thus nothing is closer to God.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>And indeed, what understands, lives, and exists is the best of all creatures.</s> <s>If we consider the outer person, who perceives through the body with the five well-known senses that we share with animals—since these senses can be corrupted by physical discomforts brought about by persecution—</s> <s>it is not surprising that this person is also called a participant in the likeness of God, not only because they live, which is also seen in animals, but more so because they turn toward the guiding mind illuminated by wisdom, which animals cannot do because they lack reason.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The body of a human being is also unique among earthly animals.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>The body is not laid low facing the ground, but stands upright, visible and gazing at the sky, which is the beginning of visible things.</s>
    <s>Even though it is known to live not by its own presence but by that of the soul, it is good not only because it exists and as long as it exists, but also because it is made in such a way that it is more suited for contemplating the sky.</s>
    <s>In this way, it can rightly be seen as made more in the image and likeness of God than other animal bodies.</s>
    <s>However, since a person is not rightly called a human without life, it is perhaps more accurate to understand that a person is not just the body alone, the external human, nor just the life that is in the body's senses, but both together.</s>
    <s>It is not unwise to distinguish that the image and likeness of God, who is also called the Son, is different from being made in the image and likeness of God as we understand it in humans.</s>
    <s>There are also those who do not in vain understand that two terms are used, image and likeness, since if it were one thing, one term would suffice.</s>
    <s>They want the mind to be made in the image, which is formed by the truth itself without any intervening substance, and which is also called the spirit, not the Holy Spirit who is of the same substance as the Father and the Son, but the spirit of humans.</s>
    <s>The Apostle distinguishes them this way, as in 1 Corinthians 2:11: 'No one knows what is in a person except the spirit of that person, and no one knows what is in God except the Spirit of God.'</s>
    <s>Similarly, about the human spirit, it says in 1 Thessalonians 5:23: 'May your spirit, soul, and body be kept safe.'</s>
    <s>And this too is made by God, just like the rest of creation.</s>
    <s>For it is written in Proverbs 24:12.</s>
  </p>


<p>
In Proverbs, it is written: <sub alias="Know this">Scito</sub> that the Lord knows the hearts of people, and the one who formed the human spirit knows everything. Therefore, it is accepted without doubt that this spirit is made in the image of God, in which there is the intelligence of truth. For no creature is interposed between it and the truth. The rest of the human being seems to be made in likeness, because every image is indeed similar, but not everything that is similar is also a proper image; it might be said in a way of speaking. But one must be careful in such matters, lest anything be assumed too strongly, keeping in mind that since every body is extended through local spaces, it should not be believed that the substance of God is anything like this. For if something is smaller in part than in whole, it is not suitable to the dignity of the soul, how much less to the majesty of God.
</p>
<p>
See how subtly and healthily the holy men have understood that man is made in the image and likeness of God, namely the image in the soul, in which there is intellect, will, and memory; the likeness in morals, that is, in love, justice, goodness, and holiness, which are all incorporeal! How far removed are those who apply this testimony to images formed by the hands of artisans from the sense and teaching of these holy men! It is not for my discourse to discuss this, but it is left to the reader's judgment to understand how senseless they are in this matter. Not my pen, but their own sense should remind them.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, whoever understands that man is made in the image and likeness of God as an image formed by an artisan...

  <p>
    <s>
      To believe that something in God has a body, which is blasphemous to believe, is what this belief shows. 
    </s>
    <s>
      For if a man, made in the image and likeness of God, aligns with man-made images, then man, according to his physical form, is made in the image of God. 
    </s>
    <s>
      And if man is made in the image of God according to his physical form, then God is corporeal.

    <s>
      However, God is incorporeal.

      VIII. What is the difference between image and likeness or equality?
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Since, with God's help, we have explained according to the sound and sober doctrine of the holy fathers' opinions, how it should be understood that God created man in His own image and likeness, it is now worthwhile to briefly discuss what the difference between image and likeness or even equality is, so that those who, for the sake of worshiping images, are carried away on the open fields of empty assertions, understanding the difference between these three things, which they almost think are one, may realize how much they are in error, and those who are eager to read this may gain some benefits of understanding.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, these three things must be distinguished: because everything that is an image is a likeness, but not everything that is a likeness is an image. 
    </s>
    <s>
      And while an image is never without likeness, likeness is much more.
