    Heretical teachings are an error.
    <s>Prophets, I say, call Christ the image of the invisible Father and the figure of His substance.</s>
    <s>He is the brightness of eternal light and the flawless mirror of God's majesty and the image of His goodness.</s>
    <s>Thus, with the prophets and apostles and Augustine, I will strive to compare this with the one who worships God.</s>
    <s>See how much is said: 'brightness', that the clarity of the Father's light is in the Son; 'flawless mirror', that the Father is in the Son; 'image of goodness', that not a body in a body, but the entirety is seen in the Son.</s>
    <s>The image teaches it is not dissimilar, a character signifies it is expressed, and brightness denotes it is eternal.</s>
    <s>So the image is not a physical painting, not composed of dyes, not of wax, but simple from God, derived from the Father, expressed from the source.</s>
    <s>Through this image, the Lord showed the Father to Philip, saying, "Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the Father, and how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?</s>
    <s>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me?"</s>
    <s>For he saw the Father in the image of the Son.</s>
    <s>See what kind of image it is: this image is clarity, this image is justice, this image is the power of God; it is not mute, because it is the Word; it is not insensible, because it is wisdom; it is not empty, because it is power; it is not void, because it is life; it is not dead, because it is resurrection.</s>
    <s>So you see, when the image is mentioned, it signifies the Father, whose image is the Son, because no one can be their own image.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore...
  </p>


<p>
<s>
We have approved the image of God not as material images, as they babble, but as the Son of God according to the opinions of the holy fathers.
</s>
<s>
It remains for us to briefly explain how we are 'sealed in him'.
</s>
<s>
Therefore, we are sealed in him when, according to the Apostle in Romans 6, we were baptized in the death of Christ, anointed with the holy oil, and received the privilege of the Christian name, as it is said in the Song of Songs:
</s>
<s>
'Your name is oil poured out.'
</s>
<s>
The divine prophecy given through Isaiah is fulfilled, where it says: 'You shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord will bestow.'
</s>
<s>
Therefore, we are sealed in him who, according to the Apostle, has sealed us and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts, in whom we are also sealed by the Spirit for the day of redemption.
</s>
<s>
We are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God so that both our spirit and soul are imprinted with the seal of God, and we receive that image in which we were created in the beginning, which we neither completely lost nor kept entirely pure in us because if we had completely lost it, it would not be said: 'Surely in the image of God does man walk,' and yet he is troubled.
</s>
<s>
And if we had kept it entirely pure, the Apostle would not have said: 'Be transformed by the renewal of your mind' and 'We are transformed into the same image from glory to glory.'
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
This is what Bishop Gregory of Nyssa said, from which they draw to support their error.
</s>
</p>

  <p>
    <s>
      Everything pulls us, and both life and preaching are unknown to us.
    </s>
    <s>
      What we should observe in this matter, we are thoroughly taught by the advice of the Apostle Paul, who rightly says: Test the spirits to see if they are from God; and also: Do not believe every spirit, but test the mind.
    </s>
    <s>
      For while, as we have said before, both the life and preaching of Bishop Gregory of Nyssa are unknown to us, the testimonies that are brought forth from his works are seen to be less suitable to confirm doubtful matters.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence his doctrine is neither to be praised highly nor entirely condemned by us, but rather, putting aside his teachings along with those of others whom we do not know, it remains for us to be content with the teachings of the illustrious Latin doctors, whose life and preaching are known to us, or the Greeks, who were Catholics and were equally translated into our language.

    <s>
      Indeed, the text of the testimony, which they brought forth from the sixth synod in the same heap of nonsense, which they wrote in favor of worshipping images...
    </s>
  </p>


<p>
In some venerable images, the picture of the shepherd pointing with the finger of the precursor is shown, which signifies the grace left to us, showing us the sheep, Christ our Lord. However, although it wasn't exactly stated by them as it is in the same synod, nor was it used by them in the sense of adoring certain images, it is known that they made some mention of it; but since it almost has no strength of completeness in Latin, is weak in sense, unpolished in words, and in some part lacking in reason, it is shown to offer no support to their error.
</p>
<p>
The opinion of John, the Bishop of Constantinople, which they use as evidence for the adoration of images, is known not to pertain to what they think. But neither the opinion of John, the Bishop of Constantinople, even though it has been mutilated by them, nor the other opinions of the holy fathers, which we found corrupted in the writing of the same synod, is believed to provide any support to their error; for in it, there is no mention of the images that are usually in the basilicas, but rather those which the Roman emperors, in their pagan and superstitious rites, ostentatiously adored out of their own arrogance. Indeed, we have found no ancient kings to have committed such sacrilegious impiety, nor have we read of any other nation so subjected to such cruelty and servitude to idols as this one.

    It has been shown that the bear represents the kingdom succession of the Medes and Persians. The leopard symbolizes the kingdom of the Macedonians. In the fourth place, just as the statue has iron legs, there is also a certain terrifying and very dreadful beast described with iron teeth. Talking about it in detail would take too long now. Unlike the other beasts, it doesn't have individual characteristics but combines all the signs of cruelty from the previous beasts. It is said to have devoured the nations it destroyed and trampled underfoot those it subjected to tributes. It served the worship of demons so much that it unfortunately worshipped the idols of some conquered nations alongside its own idols.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it is utterly vain and entirely unreasonable to take examples from it within the holy church, which are believed by Catholics to be completely rejected because of the stain of paganism. Unless, perhaps, it is allowed in this part that error supports error, and a vain thing takes another vain thing as an example, and a crooked thing is thought to derive power from something not straight. Thus, the text of John's sentence—if it is indeed that of John—is found criticized in the same most foolish reading of the synod: 'Do you not wrong him who is introduced? Do you not know that if anyone insults the image of the emperor, he insults the emperor himself?'
  </p>


<p>
<s>
An emperor, primarily due to his dignity, suffers an insult? 
</s>
<s>
Don't you know that if someone damages an image made of wood or color, it's not seen as an attack on a lifeless element, but as an insult to the emperor himself whose image it represents?
</s>
<s>
Similarly, the same applies to God the Father, as stated in the sermon on Holy Thursday: 
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Everything was made for the glory of God and for our benefit: the clouds to provide rain, the land to produce abundant fruits, the sea for navigation; without exception, all things serve humans, but more importantly, the image of God.
</s>
<s>
For when the imperial cult introduces images into the cities and the judges and people praise them, they are not honoring the wooden plank or the writing on the melted wax, but the figure of the emperor.
</s>
<s>
In the same way, one does not honor the earthly appearance of creation, but the same heavenly figure.
</s>
<s>
This sentiment, although it may lack the elegance of speech and the erudition of words, and may seem far from the matter at hand, neither provides solace to their denigration nor does it cause us any inconvenience.
</s>
<s>
It does not instill any discord in the senses of the Christian faith, especially since it is divine.
</s>
<s>
We should not pollute the character of God's image within us with evil deeds, nor by sinning and thus defiling the image and likeness to which we were created.
</s>
<s>
This seems to say that anyone who insults the image of the emperor is not just insulting the image, but the emperor himself.

    If the common people, partly wild with joy, partly captivated by the novelty of worldly pomp, partly eager for inflated honor, partly driven by the vice of flattery, and partly terrified by public security measures, honor the images of emperors with vain and harmful praises, what does that matter to us who glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ?

    <s>There comes a word, just as our redemption was offered to God, according to our likeness and made man, although it may seem to have an incomplete meaning due to either the interpreter's ignorance or the writer's fault, it does not imply a certain kind of worship of images there.</s>
    <s>But neither does it contain any affirmation or even mention of this error, which they say he mentioned after a few words: "Images fulfill the work of parables signifying virtue, to which the eyes and the touch of the hand can be applied, holding in our minds an invisible vision."</s>

  <p>
    <s>Therefore, since this book is not available to us, which is said to have been published in Greek by the aforementioned scholar, we must seek the sense of this chapter among disordered and improper words, as if someone were seeking coins in dusty or dirty wrappings of any material.</s>
    <s>For as we conjecture, this chapter's text seems to signify that, while Christ, existing in the form of God, clothed in the likeness of our flesh, became man and was offered to God for the redemption of our life, in the true image of the Father, showed us the vision of the same Father according to this: "Whoever sees me, sees the Father."</s>

    He indicated the mysteries to our senses in such a way as the imagination of these things, whose images they are, is in some way shown - this indeed according to the uncertainty of conjecture. Aside from the ambiguities of doubt, it is clear that no adoration of images is designated here. 
  </p>
  <p>
    XXI. That it is not against the Christian religion, as they say, not to worship and not to adore images. 
    <break time="500ms" />
    The instruments of the Christian religion are indeed great, which, although they depend on the solidity of faith and the love of God and neighbor, it is far too long to enumerate in detail. Among these, the worship and adoration of images hold no place at all, since they are established by no document of antiquity nor supported by example, but are almost entirely rejected by the words of the divine Scriptures.
  </p>


  <p>
    The powerful trumpet of divine Scripture proclaims that we should worship God alone, adore Him alone, and glorify Him alone. Therefore, we must be careful and fear greatly that while trying to introduce the worship and adoration of images into Christian religion, we do not seem to undermine the unique worship and adoration due to one God. These two things are so mutually opposed that if one stands, the other cannot. For if the exclusive worship due to God alone remains unshaken—and it truly will remain unshaken—the worship of images will be utterly nullified. And if the worship of images is not disrupted, the worship due to God alone will not be unique. Therefore, if the stronghold or the glorious emblem of Christian religion is the worship and adoration of one God—and it certainly is—then to show this to images or any other things is against Christian religion. And if not worshipping or venerating these images is against Christian religion, as they claim, then to worship or adore God alone and to highlight the stronghold of His worship and adoration would be against Christian religion. Therefore, God alone is to be worshipped, God alone is to be adored, God alone is to be glorified—<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="salm">Ps.</phoneme> 148:13.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of Him, it is said through the prophet: "His name alone is exalted." And His saints, who, having triumphed over the devil, reign with Him either because they fought bravely so that the state of the church could reach us, or because they are known to help the same church with their constant prayers and intercessions, are to be venerated.
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>But truly, with all their care and worship removed, whether they are in basilicas for the memory of events and decoration or not, they can bring no evidence to Catholic faith, since they are known to have no role in accomplishing the mysteries of our salvation.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>XXII. Those who erect images to remember the saints or even the Lord himself do not have a good memory.</s>
    <s>The prophet says, "For me, it is good to be close to God."</s>
    <s>Since God is spirit, according to John 4:24, "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth," one can adhere to him not in a physical way but spiritually, and one can be joined to him not through bodily senses but through the rational vision of the soul.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, as the most holy Augustine rightly says, we are warned to turn away from this world, which is indeed physical and perceivable, and toward God, that is, truth, which is grasped by intellect and inner mind, which always remains and is unchanging, and does not have a false image from which it can be distinguished.</s>
  </p>


<p>
To turn with complete enthusiasm to contemplating Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:24.
</p>
<p>
To look at the virtues that are derived from Him in His saints, we don't need physical sight, which we share with irrational animals, but rather spiritual sight. The prophet asked the Lord to grant him this spiritual sight when he said: "Open my eyes, and I will see the wonders of your law." Psalm 118:18.
</p>
<p>
The Lord was not referring to physical ears when He said: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." Matthew 11:15. 
</p>
<p>
He commands that the people of Israel be deprived of these senses as a punishment for their unfaithfulness, not that their limbs be weakened, when He says to the prophet Isaiah: "Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart." Isaiah 6:10.
</p>
<p>
Given this, those who confess to being overwhelmed by great blindness are admitting that they have so corrupted the memory of the soul, that without the aid of images, they are compelled to stray from the service of God and the veneration of His saints. They do not consider themselves capable of lifting the eye of their mind above the physical creation to draw in the eternal light without the support of physical creations. But lest they try to defend their error with this argument — since we, too, admit that images should be kept for the memory of past events — the strength of their argument is undermined by this truth.
</p>


  <p>
    <s>It is one thing to hold onto them out of fear of forgetting, and another thing out of love for decoration; one thing willingly, another out of necessity; one thing in order to avoid forgetting God and His saints, and another in order to remember past deeds. <break time="400ms"/>
    It is one thing to see things that, if not seen, do no harm, and another to see things that, if not seen, are harmful, since clearly a person can be saved without looking at images, but cannot be saved without knowing God. <lang xml:lang="la">John 17:3.</lang> <break time="400ms"/>
    Therefore, since the human mind must cling to Him in whose image it was made, so that no creature is placed between it and the truth, which is Christ, it is foolish to think that it should be reminded through material images to avoid forgetting Him. <lang xml:lang="la">John 14:6.</lang> <break time="400ms"/>
    For since Christ's descent into hell, His ascent into heaven, and the fruits of our hope are not to be sought in visible things, but only in the heart, the Apostle Paul testifies when he says: "Hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what they see? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience." <lang xml:lang="la">Romans 8:24-25.</lang> <break time="400ms"/>
    And again: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down, or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead. But what does the Scripture say? 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of faith that we proclaim." <lang xml:lang="la">Romans 10:6-10.</lang>
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</s>
    <s>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</s>

    <s>Concerning the opposition to the practices of the blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome, regarding the worship or destruction of images:</s>
    <s>The images, whose most insolent worship was promoted by Constantine and his mother Irene, as well as by Tarasius, bishop of Constantinople, for the purpose of holding synods,</s>
    <s>their erroneous practice gave us the material for this present discussion.</s>
    <s>The blessed Gregory, bishop of the city of Rome, prohibited the worship and destruction of images, avoiding vague language and unnecessary ambiguity.</s>
    <s>Instead, he clearly and purely instructed what should be observed and followed in this matter, addressing his directives to Serenus, bishop of Marseilles.</s>
    <s>While these individuals seem to condemn their predecessors or parents who destroyed the images as abominable, and those who worshipped them are believed to have been similarly condemned,</s>
    <s>amidst these differing errors, one should adhere to a single straightforward course.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Heading towards the crossroads, the bishop places himself in the middle and intervenes, offering weapons to both sides fighting against each other. He strikes both those who worship the images and those who break them with the spear of pontifical zeal. Ignoring those who worship here and the others who break there, he aligns himself with our church, which, following the path of moderation, chooses to remember these images as ornaments. Thus, he disregards both those worshiping here and those breaking there.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is reported that the venerable Pope both praised and criticized the aforementioned Serenus: "It was reported to us," he said, "that you broke the holy images out of an ill-considered zeal, under the pretext that they should not be worshiped. While we fully commend you for opposing their worship, we absolutely condemn you for breaking them."
  </p>
  <p>
    "And a little later: 'What should not have been broken, as it was placed in churches not for worship but solely for the instruction of the ignorant, should have been left intact. And because venerable places have long accepted the depiction of the histories of the saints for good reason, if you had tempered your zeal with discretion, you could have achieved your aim healthily and gathered the flock instead of scattering it.'"
  </p>
  <p>
    "For the same venerable bishop believed that the breaking of images disturbed the minds of the common people, and fearing the scandal for the weak, he imposed these actions."
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>When he instructs the believers, he permits them to have images in churches everywhere, but he avoids any form of worshipping them.</s>
    <s>He says: The different members of the church must be gathered, and it must be shown to them with the testimonies of the Holy Scriptures that no man-made object is to be worshipped.</s>
    <s>Because it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him.'</s>
    <s>He then adds that the images, which had been made for the education of the people, so that those who do not know letters might learn the story by looking at the pictures, had been seen to turn into objects of worship.</s>
    <s>Therefore, you are moved to order that these images be broken, and to tell them: If you want to keep the images in the churches for the purpose for which they were originally made, you may allow them to be displayed and kept in every way, <break time="500ms"/> but make it clear that it was not the sight of the historical story shown by the painting that displeased you, but the worship that was improperly given to the images.</s>
    <s>And with these words, soothe their minds and bring them back to your agreement.</s>
    <s>If anyone wishes to make images, do not prohibit it, but avoid worshipping images in every way.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>This is the teaching and guidance of the revered pontiff, under which we do not refuse to have images in churches, but we completely reject their worship.</s>
    <s>Whoever either breaks or worships them should recognize that they are going against this principle in every way.</s>

  <p>
    For love, to be displayed by the apostles, they admit it was handed down, they say it is necessary, to show by which examples it has been established or by which documents it is proved to have been promulgated. Did Peter perhaps establish this to be shown by images, who gently restrained Cornelius from worshipping him? Or John, who, when desiring to worship an angel, was told not to do so but to worship God? Or Paul, who feared the superstitious Lycaoanians wanted to bring this to him? Or Barnabas, who, together with Paul, rejected this? Since the angel and the apostles forbid themselves to be worshipped, who is so foolish and insane to dare say that they instituted the worship of images, especially since, even if they had to be worshipped, angels and humans are of different merit and definition and so are their images.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, if angels or humans, as the reason of the present example teaches, are not to be worshipped, except for the worship shown by the duty of love and greeting, much less are images, which are devoid of reason and not worthy of greeting or worship, because they are insensible, to be worshipped. If they are not to be worshipped, indeed because they are not, they are said to commit a twofold offense in this part, either because they worship them or because they lie that it was handed down to them by the apostles to do so. Finally, the apostle Paul, that evangelical innkeeper, who led the human race astray from the vision of the heavenly homeland and into the defection of this world.

<p>
The images of the Lord—why try to compare them, when they are known to differ so much from the signs of mysteries? And to liken the thing that was created by the command of the Lord's voice to those created by any artisan's craft? 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, those were created by the Lord's command, while these are made with the help of skillful art; those by the holy man Moses, these by any craftsman; those by the lawgiver, these by a painter; those overflow with mysteries, these with only the colors of dyes. Those images were a wonder for those present and signified certain mystical and secret things about the future; these images, however, only remind people of the miracles and future signs. The typical prefigurations of these things, or what is within them, were shown in the previous book. Now, it is briefly necessary to explain how much they differ from man-made images.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, those who try to compare the material images created by any craftsmen to the Lord's command, which was created by the Lord's command with Moses obeying, are mistaken.

    He should demonstrate the laws to the people so they can observe them, <break time="500ms" /> following the example shown to him on the mountain, <break time="500ms" /> he should make a tabernacle, <break time="500ms" /> so that when he enters it, the glory of the Lord will cover it.

To witness miracles, before the excellent prophet and crowned king, <sub alias="danced">luderc</sub> with great joy and did not blush to lead it to the destined place with musical harmonies and sweet hymns. Because it stood out with so many signs and privileges from its creators, it could rightly be compared to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, since neither the creator of such merit nor the workmanship of such glory could be found, it remains that they place the legislator of our age before men and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with all handmade images and not attempt to compare things so worthless and devoid of mysteries to a matter so sublime and full of the signs of mysteries.
</p>
<p>
For if, as they said, the images could be compared to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, it is necessary that there be something about them that could be compared to the mercy seat, and it is necessary that fearsome oracles be given from there. But no such oracles are given from there; therefore, as they foolishly think, the images cannot be compared to the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
You should understand that it is a great rashness and absurdity to wish to compare the frequently mentioned images to the body and blood of the Lord, just as in the same vanity, they adore those images.
</p>


  <p>
    This is written for the gods and is read.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Lord says in the Gospel: "True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth," we are amazed at the madness of those who have become so foolish in the worship of images that, even though it is clear that images have neither spirit nor truth, they not only worship them but also dare to equate them with the body and blood of the Lord. They say, "Just as the body and blood of the Lord are transformed from the fruits of the earth into a significant mystery, so too the images crafted by the skill of artists are transformed into the veneration of the persons they represent." 
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord is given to us to remember His passion and our salvation, which was granted to us by the same Mediator between God and men, through the hand of the priest and the invocation of the divine name. Images, on the other hand, do not require any ceremonial laying on of hands or consecration. They are known to be formed and assembled only by those who are experienced in the art of painting or skilled in the preparation of colors, or by those who have learned the craft of sculpture or other arts and understand the nature of the materials they use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, for the consecration of these, the priest, adorned with a miter, mixes the prayers of the surrounding people with his own, recalling with inner groaning the memory of the Lord's passion, His resurrection from the dead, and His most glorious ascension into heaven.
  </p>


<p>
Angels on the sublime altar of God and in the presence of His majesty beseech, while the painter, eager to complete the work, seeks only the beauty and supplement of colors for this formation. Therefore, it is far, far from the path of truth, reason, and discernment to try to equate images to the body and blood of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
For Melchizedek, the king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, in the type of the Lord's body and blood, is read to have offered not an image, but bread and wine. And by the Mosaic mouth, in the prefiguration of our Redeemer, whose flesh we take for the remission of sins and whose blood's staining we use to evade the attacking angel, a lamb is ordered to be eaten by families, and the use of images for worship or adoration is entirely renounced. 
</p>
<p>
The Psalmist also sang sweetly about the bread of angels, namely Christ, to be eaten by men, and that the creators of images become like these images. For the Author of the human race Himself, who did not disdain to take on flesh for our sake, when the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New was approaching on the day of His most holy passion, established this saving beginning. Taking the bread, blessing it, and breaking it, He gave this salvific bread to His disciples.

<lang xml:lang="en-US">Take this and eat it; this is my body.</lang>

<lang xml:lang="en-US">In the same way, he took the cup after supper, giving it to his disciples and saying:</lang> 
<lang xml:lang="en-US">Take this and drink from it; this is the cup of my blood, the new and eternal covenant, poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.</lang>
</p>
<p>
<lang xml:lang="en-US">As the Church holds firmly to the clear and sacred mystery represented both through the mystical figures of the Old Testament and the institution of the New Testament, the practice of worshipping images should not be equated. The Old Testament clearly prohibits this practice, and the New Testament does not permit it either, in fact, it condemns it.</lang>
