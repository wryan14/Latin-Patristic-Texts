    In that, he didn't say: 'My image is truly life, and the picture bearing my name is truly salvation,' but: 'Whoever paints my likeness and worships my man-made image remains in me and I in him.' And he who said: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you, did not say: 'Unless you paint my image and worship the likeness made by art, you will not have life in you.' He who said: I am the bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of it, he will not die but will have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day; and again: As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me; and again: This is the true bread of God, which came down from heaven and gives life to the world. Whoever eats it remains forever, and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world. Whoever believes in me will never be hungry or thirsty. Nothing like this is found to be said about images, as we have mentioned, for he established the remembrance of his most sacred passion not in art, but in the consecration of his body and blood, nor did he decree that faith and confession should be in pictures, but in the mouth and heart, as Scripture says: With the heart one believes unto righteousness.

It leads to salvation.

<p>
When he says: <sub alias="come">Quum</sub> 1 for example says: <sub alias="If">Si</sub> you remain in me, and my words remain in you, it clearly shows that we should not remain in images and images in us, but we should remain in him through faith and his words in us through study and completion of works.
</p>
<p>
Paul the Apostle, a chosen vessel, sees that the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord is to be preferred above almost all other sacraments, and he says: <sub alias="Let">Probet</sub> a man examine himself and then eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without honor, eats and drinks judgment upon himself. So he shows the great care we must take in examining ourselves before partaking of these holy things, and he strikes with severity those who approach negligently and unworthily. But he says nothing similar about those who avoid adoration of images, but rather about those who misuse images, he says: <sub alias="And">Et</sub> they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood is vastly different from images painted by artists. The sacrament is made by the invisible work of the Holy Spirit, while images are made by the visible hand of an artist. The sacrament is consecrated by a priest invoking the divine name, while images are painted by a painter using human skill.
</p>


<p>May the altar of God be raised high by divine hands, while these altars, built by human hands through skill, are placed on the wall for the admiration of onlookers.</p>
<p>Through the former, sins are forgiven; through the latter, if carelessly used, sins are added.</p>
<p>The former neither grows nor diminishes in power, while the latter, according to the artist's skill, can increase or decrease in beauty.</p>
<p>The former is affirmed by a new antiquity and an ancient novelty, while the latter are often corrupted by decaying age.</p>
<p>The former is the life and nourishment of souls, while the latter are merely food for the eyes.</p>
<p>The former leads through consumption to the entrance of the heavenly kingdom, while the latter, through sight, carry the memory of events.</p>
<p>The former could not be abolished by the church, not even during persecutions, while the latter sometimes have their colors washed away by stains.</p>
<p>And while no one can be saved without the former, all who have true faith can be saved without the latter. It is clear that no one with sound mind and understanding equates these with such a great mystery.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who try to bind everyone without the veneration of images with the chain of anathema should be asked what they think of the apostles. For no series of Catholic Scriptures teaches that they ever worshipped images, and yet no believer doubts that they, and even their followers, have entered the heavenly kingdoms.</p>

<p>
We keep images for the sake of memory and veneration, maintaining the purity of our faith. If this error, where they try to equate images with the books of Holy Scripture, is compared with their other errors, although it is of great enormity in itself, compared to others—such as equating images with the Ark of the Covenant, the body and blood of the Lord, and the mystery of the cross—it is undoubtedly found to be lesser, especially since neither those nor these can properly be equated. Those have been predestined before time by the highest, secret, and prophetic decree of God and have been graciously granted through the ages for the benefit of human salvation. They have holy and venerable authors, distinguished by the lamps of virtues and the signs of miracles, like Matthew and certainly the Lord himself, who granted the mystery of his body and blood and the sacrament of the cross for our salvation. On the contrary, these images are produced by the vanity of pagan authors and bring no exhibition of salvation or any sacramental privilege to mortals. They only please the eyes, through which, like certain envoys, they imprint the memory of past events on our hearts.
</p>
<p>
At that time, when Moses was with the people of God in the wilderness, and by the command of the Lord was teaching the sacred law and the most sacred rites of ceremonies to the people, instructing humanity in the worship of the divine, Cecrops, a certain king of the Athenians, was led astray by a demon.
</p>


<p>
The poison stirred the simple minds of the pagans towards the worship of images and false gods. At the same time, when the people of God received the commandments of life, he prepared the cups of perpetual death and the seeds of long-lasting error to lure souls. This is what Sedulius refers to:
</p>
<p>
Those whom deadly evil, whom the doctrine of the Attic dog devoted to worries, 
creeps in.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the use of images, which has grown from pagan traditions, should neither be equated with nor hold the same value as the books of the sacred law because spiritual teachings are found in books, not in images. As the Apostle Paul did not say, 'Whatever is painted is painted for our teaching,' but he said: 'Whatever is written is written for our teaching,' Romans 15:4, so that through patience and the comfort of the Scriptures, we might have hope in God. Nor did he say, 'Every painting,' but 'Every Scripture is divinely inspired and useful for teaching,' 2 Timothy 3:16-17, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. Finally, on the fiftieth day after the sacrifice of the lamb and the crossing of the Red Sea.

In the same way, Moses taught about the origin of the world not by painting, but by writing. Everything he knew through the spirit of prophecy, whether it was about past events—like the beginning of the world, the creation of man, the flood, or the stories of the patriarchs—or about the things happening in his own time—like the events involving Balaam and Balak and others who were not present with him—he conveyed through writing. And the things he understood about the future through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, like the transgression of the Jewish people, their captivity, and the coming of Christ, he recorded in five books. He did this not by painting, but by writing under the command of the Lord for future generations. It is not written that he took pictures, but that he took a book and read it aloud to the people. As the Apostle writes, Moses read all the commandments of the law to the entire people, and after a few moments, he sprinkled the book and all the people, so we can know that the lawgiver used not painted images but the most beneficial Scriptures.

And when a woman caught in adultery had been presented to Him, with a crowd surrounding her, and the Pharisees, filled with deception, posed a dilemma to Him, which is termed inevitable by the teachers of secular literature. He avoided the horns of the dilemma, being neither cruel nor consenting to bloodshed by ordering the stoning of the adulteress through the severity of legal rigor, nor a transgressor of the law and supporter of sinners by dismissing her unpunished against the law's sentence.

<p>
Instead, He, as a just and gentle heavenly philosopher, struck them gravely with the weapon of His proposition. They, fearing to hear their own crimes, departed one by one.

<p>
It is said that He wrote on the ground with His finger, not painted, so that the law, which was once written by His finger on stone to signify the hardness of the Jews' hearts, might be written by His finger in the ground of the hearts of the Gentiles, who, receiving the seeds of the divine word, bring forth worthy fruits to their Creator daily. 
</p>

Thus, through the stone tablets, the rigor of the Old Testament and the hardness of the Israelite nation, and through the ground written by the Lord's finger, the hearts of the Gentiles are made soft for believing and bringing forth fruits.

Arrogance is kept in check by the fear of losing virtues, which cannot be possessed without humility. The desire for vain glory, which is the enemy of virtues, is avoided. Pride is crushed by the fear of diabolic ruin and the example of Christ's humility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Galatians 5:22-23, we find the instruments of the fruits of righteousness: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. In these virtues, there is a remedy: neither the wise boast in their wisdom nor the strong in their strength, and neither the simple nor the weak despair in their inability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Excessive joy does not elevate the joyful, nor does excessive grief weigh down the sorrowful. The wealthy are not made proud by their abundance, nor are the poor broken by their need. In these virtues, there is a standard for how leaders should act towards their subjects and how subjects should act towards their leaders, how marriages should be cherished, how worldly matters should be handled with prudent deliberation, and how the country should be defended.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enemies are driven out, and both foreign and domestic matters are managed. To summarize, these virtues contain both the perpetual nourishment of the soul and the wisdom and knowledge for this life, which is the grace of life, and the teachings for eternal life. It is a treasure lacking no good, overflowing with all good things.

<p>Anyone who approaches devoutly to this place, whatever they seek faithfully, they rejoice in having gained successfully.</p>
<p>If the love of worldly wisdom and secular solace delights anyone, let them approach the armories of divine law, which surpass the wise of the world, both in the height of their merits and in time, and the depths of liberal studies. They will rejoice in knowing what they know and discovering what they do not know. There, they will find the elegance of proper speech, the etymologies of names, the varieties of schemes, and the complexities of tropes. About which blessed Augustine says: Let the learned know that our authors used all the modes of speech, which grammarians call tropes. Though these tropes, that is, modes of speech, are recognized in sacred writings, their knowledge helps somewhat in understanding them. They will also find histories and metrics, all of which belong properly to the art of grammar.</p>
<p>But perhaps someone will say: I do not find there the scansions of meters and the precise measurements of times. Let them know that there are many meters and rhythms in the divine Scriptures, but the translation of language does not allow the same intervals of time in a foreign language as in the original. Yet it retains the same meanings and properties of things, because if someone owes us gold, it does not matter much if it is not the same coin as the one received, as long as it is of the same weight and brilliance. For, as we learned from blessed Jerome, very skilled in the Hebrew language, certain things...</p>

</p>
<p>

<s>There, you will find laws or sentences, grand things spoken grandly, modest things humbly, and moderate things temperately.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Some things stand out; definitions or ways of syllogisms, which through subtle investigation affirm those things that are in doubt.</s>
    <s>Topics, which, being sources of senses and origins of words, provide arguments for everyone, namely grammarians, poets, orators, and even philosophers.</s>
    <s>These arguments are not only coherent in scholarly language but also in everyday and tumultuous speech.</s>

  <p>
    <s>For although speech may be tumultuous, although it may be common, if it is used for any practical purposes of life, it will come to topics.</s>
    <s>Through these, as through certain local rules, one will find guidelines that cannot or should not be deviated from.</s>
    <s>In them, one will also recognize terms that are difficult to transgress without losing sense.</s>

  <p>
    <s>And to say everything briefly, all speech, unless it comes to topics, will undoubtedly remain indefinite.</s>

    <s>There, in numbers through the art of arithmetic, you will find the secrets and depths of senses, since, as the Scripture says, "God made everything in measure, number, and weight" (Wisdom 11:21).</s>

It is pure, it is the tool of heavenly teaching and eternal proclamation, shining with the purest eloquence, as the prophet says: "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path, O Lord." The apostle says: "The word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating to the division of soul and spirit." It is the dispeller of darkness, as Solomon attests, saying: "The commandment of the law is a lamp and the light of life and reproof and discipline." Through Isaiah, it is said: "At night my spirit watches for you, O God, because your precepts are the light of the world." It always commands what is vital, prohibits what is harmful, removes what is earthly, and persuades what is heavenly. It is, I say, a fountain flowing from the heavenly margin, from which the more it is drawn, the less it is expended, and the more it is divided into many parts, the more it increases in understanding. It is a money bag, from which the things given are not lost, and the constant use of giving does not bring diminution, but the more devotion is given from it, the more it increases.

        And when it is thrown out, it gets filled up more and more.

        So, none of these things we have briefly touched upon, or similar things which we skipped for the sake of brevity, can be found in images, oh worshipper of images, oh devotee of lifeless things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since these are devoid of all these merits, you are to be pitied rather than admired for wanting to equate them with the books of the divine Scriptures, where so many good things are found. You, who claim to preserve the purity of your faith in images, remember to stand humbly beside them with incense; let us diligently seek out the commandments of the Lord in the books of the divine law!

    <p>
        You illuminate pictures with lights; we frequent the divine Scriptures! You are a worshipper of painted colors; we are worshippers and receivers of hidden meanings. You soothe with painted tablets: we are soothed by divine conversations. You focus on figures of things, in which there is neither sight, nor hearing, nor taste, nor smell, nor touch; we focus on the divine law, which is blameless, in which the testimonies of the Lord's righteousness, or His commandments, fear, or judgments are found!

        Each of these the psalmist beautifully sums up through the seventh type of definition, which dialecticians call cata metaphor, that is, 'through translation,' because it shows briefly what a thing is, under the perfection of the number six, which according to the experience of arithmetic is considered perfect, because it is divided by its parts and these parts are recombined into one without any loss.

<p>Either it returns to itself through its growth, <break time="500ms"/> thus it has been defined.</p>
<p>The Law of the Lord is flawless, <break time="500ms"/> converting souls; <break time="500ms"/> the testimony of the Lord is trustworthy, <break time="500ms"/> giving wisdom to the simple. <break time="500ms"/> The statutes of the Lord are right, <break time="500ms"/> rejoicing the heart; <break time="500ms"/> the commandment of the Lord is pure, <break time="500ms"/> enlightening the eyes. <break time="500ms"/> The fear of the Lord is clean, <break time="500ms"/> enduring forever; <break time="500ms"/> the judgments of the Lord are true, <break time="500ms"/> righteous altogether. <break time="500ms"/> More to be desired are they than gold, <break time="500ms"/> even much fine gold, <break time="500ms"/> and sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p>All these things are adorned by the perfection of the number six, <break time="500ms"/> because although they seem to differ in some respects, <break time="500ms"/> each pertains to the perfection of the law by which holy men are made perfect. <break time="500ms"/> Just as the number six is not complete without one, <break time="500ms"/> so if anything is taken away, <break time="500ms"/> the integrity of perfection is mutilated.</p>
<p>The law is indeed flawless, <break time="500ms"/> because it consists of perfect truth, <break time="500ms"/> which through the Savior was not condemned, <break time="500ms"/> but rather proved to be fulfilled. <break time="500ms"/> He said, "I have not come to abolish the law, <break time="500ms"/> but to fulfill it." <break time="500ms"/> And so we might know that the gospel is also the law of the Lord, <break time="500ms"/> consisting of the two Testaments, <break time="500ms"/> the new and the old. <break time="500ms"/> He added, "The Law of the Lord is perfect, <break time="500ms"/> converting souls."</p>


<p>
The souls are lifted,
</p>
<p>
because the pages of the Old Testament have the strictness of unyielding severity, while the New Testament offers an invitation and gentleness, through which those who stray are corrected and brought to the grace of Christ. Therefore, the testimony of the Lord is faithful, for whatever God promises is fulfilled with utmost truth. This testimony grants wisdom to the humble, not to the proud or those boasting with arrogance, but to the humble ones, about whom the Apostle says: "Do not become children in understanding, but be infants in malice."
</p>
<p>
Thus, the Father gives testimony, the Son gives testimony, and the Holy Spirit gives testimony; and just as they are of one essence and nature, so they are also exalted in giving testimony. It is read in the Gospel that the Father bore testimony about the Son; the Apostle writes to Timothy about the Son: "I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified under Pontius Pilate"; and about the Holy Spirit, the same Apostle says: "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit."
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the justice of the Lord is rightly said to be so, because he is known to have done as he taught, and there is nothing different in his mouth than in his actions. They bring joy to the hearts, because they soothe the minds of the righteous with the promise of eternal rewards. Confident in receiving these rewards was he who said: "From now on, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me."

      Furthermore, the judgments of God, which are described by the prophet as true and justified in themselves, are His commands, which are written in the Old and New Testaments because they are truly pronounced by judgment.

      I say true, metaphorically, and justified, because they make their observers truthful and just.
    </s>
    <s>
      The difference between God's judgment and His judgments is that judgment in the singular is the general examination, while His judgments in the plural are the sacraments found in the two Testaments, not in images or pictures.
