Patrologia Latina Volume 

I turn laughter into tears and joy into weeping. I transform applause into lamentation and cheerfulness into sorrow. I see Nature's secrets forced into silence, and multitudes perishing in the shipwreck caused by Venus's monstrosity. Venus warring against Venus turns men into women, and by magic art unmans her own devotees. Neither deceit brings sadness, nor does the adulterer's fraud bring tears, nor does cunning—no, it is genuine grief that gives birth, genuine pain that produces offspring. The Muse asks, pain itself commands, Nature herself pleads that I give them a tearful song through my weeping.
Alas, where has Nature's grace departed? The pattern of proper conduct, the standard of chastity, the love of modesty—all gone! Nature weeps, moral customs fall silent, and shame, orphaned from its ancient nobility, is utterly banished. The masculine sex shamefully abhors how it degenerates into the passive role. A man transformed into a woman dishonors his sex, and the art of perverse Venus makes him a hermaphrodite. He becomes both subject and predicate, a single term serving double duty—he stretches the laws of grammar far beyond their limits.
He denies his manhood, becoming in Nature's art a barbarian. What he practices is not proper art but rather a trope—and yet this transfer cannot truly be called a trope; this figure falls more properly into the category of vice. Here is a perverted logic by which a simple conversion in art destroys the laws of Nature. He strikes upon an anvil that coins no seed; the hammer itself recoils from its own anvil. No form of the womb marks any matter; rather, the plowshare labors on a barren shore. Thus the use of Venus is badly scanned in dactylic meter, where the long syllable refuses to yield to the short.
Though every form of a man might entreat with feminine appearance—always inferior in this honor—and though his face might be fashioned like Helen daughter of Tyndareus, and though he might worship beauty that surpasses Adonis and Narcissus, still she is spurned. Though that beauty might plead eloquently and argue that the divinity of form makes him a goddess—by whose power the thunderbolt would languish in Jove's hand, and every string of Phoebus's lyre would fall silent in idleness—by which the free man would become a slave, and Hippolytus himself would sell his own modesty, enjoying love of such a one—whose kisses, once imprinted, would sweeten with their juice, and would give honeyed honeycomb in the mouth.
The spirit would depart, devoted to kisses upon the mouth, and would play entirely with itself upon the lips, so that dying thus in myself, dead to myself, I might enjoy in her a blessed life as my other self. But nowadays it is not just that the Phrygian adulterer pursues Helen—rather, Paris begets unspeakable monstrosities with another Paris. It is not just that Pyramus seeks Thisbe's kisses through the cracks—for this Venus, no little crack pleases. It is not just that Achilles son of Peleus feigns a virgin's actions to prove himself a virginal man—rather, he wickedly exchanges Nature's gift for a counterfeit, selling his sex for the love of profit. From the temple of the guardian spirit of procreation, such men deserve to be anathema, for they deny to Genius both his tithes and his rightful due.

Chapter One: The Vision of Lady Nature. While I was repeatedly reciting this elegy in mournful tones, a woman appeared—representing Nature herself—whose beauty I shall now describe.

Nature seemed to be hastening her approach toward me, having descended from the innermost palace of the imperishable world. Her hair sparkled not with borrowed light but with its own radiance—not merely representing the appearance of rays by imitation, but surpassing their very nature with its native brilliance, transforming the maiden's head into a starry body. Her hair, divided by a double parting, abandoned nothing of the heights above yet did not disdain to smile with a kiss upon the earth. A certain path the width of a lily divided the dispute of her hair in diagonal intersection, and this diagonal division was never a detriment to her face but rather enhanced its beauty.
A golden band reconciling the gold of her hair into the harmonious dance of legitimate order marveled that it had found a face to match. Indeed, the visual impression of the golden color that followed created a paradox for the eyes. Her forehead, spreading out into an ample plain and lilied with milky color, seemed to compete with the lily itself. Her eyebrows, starred with golden radiance, neither wandering into a forest nor reduced to excessive scarcity, maintained the mean between the two extremes. The serene tranquility of her eyes, flattering with friendly brightness, displayed the freshness of twin stars. Both nostrils, perfumed with honeyed fragrance—neither too low nor unjustly protruding—represented a certain distinction. The spikenard of her mouth offered delicate feasts of fragrance to the nostrils. Her lips, rising with moderate fullness, invited novices of Venus to kisses.
Yet others tarnish the color of beauty with the dark hue of adulterous desire. They deflower Flora's flower by making it bloom into vice. Why did I adorn the face of Helen with divine beauty, when she forced beauty's proper use into the abuse of prostitution, abandoning her royal marriage bed and foully binding herself to Paris?
Pasiphae too, driven mad by the furies of exaggerated lust, cunningly celebrating bestial marriage with a brute beneath a cow's disguise, trapped herself in a more shameful fallacy through the bull's astonishing sophistry. Myrrha also, stung by the goads of desire for her father's embrace, degenerating from a daughter's love, performed a mother's role with her own father.
Medea, playing stepmother to her own son, destroyed Venus's glorious little work in order to pursue Venus's inglorious deed. Narcissus too, occupied by his own shadow which falsely represented another Narcissus, believing himself to be another self, fell into love's danger with himself.
Many other young men too, clothed in beauty's honor by my grace, intoxicated by love of money, transferred their hammers of Venus to the function of anvils. Such a multitude of monstrous men spreads across the whole world, and by their bewitching contagion, chastity is poisoned.
Of those who profess the grammar of Venus, some embrace only the masculine gender, others the feminine, others the common or promiscuous gender. Some, like irregular nouns, decline irregularly—in the feminine gender during winter, in the masculine during summer.
There are those who, disputing in the logic of Venus, exchange the law of subject and predicate in their conclusions through mutual relation. Some, acting in place of the subject, do not know how to be predicated. Others, only predicating, do not observe the legitimate subjection of the subject.
Others, disdaining to enter Venus's palace, practice their lamentable game in its vestibule. Against all these, the laws complain and arm themselves, seeking to avenge their injuries with the avenging sword.
Do not be surprised if I proceed into these profane novelties of speech, since profane men dare to rage even more profanely. I belch forth such things indignantly, so that modest people may reverence the mark of modesty, while the shameless may be excluded from the brothels of shamelessness.
Knowledge of evil is useful caution, which may punish those branded with the culpable mark of shamelessness, and reward those immune from such things. Now the file of my solution has eliminated the difficulty of your question.
Solution to Alan's second question. I came down from the inner chambers of heaven's palace to the decline of this fallen earthly realm precisely to lay out a lamentation of complaint about humanity's detestable excesses with you, as with my familiar and confidant, and to determine with you what punishment should be given in response to such criminal opposition—so that punishment equal to the bite of these crimes might bite back with the law of retaliation.
Then I said, O mediatrix of all things, unless I feared that the abundance of my questions might provoke your benevolence to disgust, I would expose the darkness of another doubt to the light of your clarification.
Then she replied, On the contrary, share all your questions with my hearing—not only recent ones but even those ancient with the rust of age—so that by the firmness of our solutions, the assault of your doubts may be calmed.
Alan's third question. Then I said, I wonder why, while examining the fictions of poets, you direct the armed stings of your invectives only against the plagues of the human race, when we read that the gods too limped with the same foot of transgression.
Jupiter, transferring the youth Ganymede to the heavens, transferred relative Venus into the metaphorical. He who was appointed to serve him drink at the table by day, Jupiter made subject to himself in bed by night. Bacchus and Apollo too, co-heirs of their father's lasciviousness, not by divine power but by superstitious Venus's trickery, turned boys into women through deceit.
Nature's response. Then she, shaping her face of authentic serenity into a troubled expression, said, Are you using a question unworthy of the face of doubt, clothing it in the garment of inquiry? Or are you trying to give credence to the shadowy fictions of poets, which the craft of poetic art has painted?
Do not the more mature treatises of philosophy eliminate with a higher file of distinction those things discussed in the childish cradle of poetic discipline? Are you unaware how poets prostitute naked falsehood to their audiences without any cloak of excuse, intoxicating their listeners' ears as if enchanted by honeyed sweetness?
How they cloak that very falsehood with a certain hypocrisy of plausibility, so that through images of examples they may seal people's minds on the anvil of moral instruction? Yet while the poetic lyre sounds falsehood in the surface bark of the letter, inwardly it speaks to listeners the secret of higher understanding, so that when the outer shell of falsehood is cast aside, the reader may secretly find within the sweeter kernel of truth.
Poets sometimes unite historical events with playful fables through elegant fiction, so that from the fitting conjunction of diverse elements, a more elegant picture of the narrative itself may result.
However, when poets dream of a plurality of gods, or when these gods are said to have submitted their hands to Venus's rods, in these things the shadow of falsehood becomes light—and in this the poet is not found to have degenerated from the nature of his art.
For since the dreams of Epicurus are now put to sleep, the madness of the Manichees is healed, the subtleties of Aristotle are refuted, and the fallacies of Arius are deceived, reason proves, the world proclaims, faith believes, and Scripture testifies to God's unique unity—in whom no stain is found, whom no plague of vice assails, with whom no motion of temptation contends.
He is the splendor never failing, life unwearied and undying, the ever-flowing fountain, the wise seminal source of life, the principal principle, the initial beginning of goodness.
Therefore, although many people have literally abused such bounds of Venus—as the poets have testified—that narrative which claims either that gods exist or that they engaged in Venus's gymnastics lies, and darkens into the sunset of excessive falsehood. For this reason, I covered such things with the cloud of silence, but explained other matters in the light of true narration.
To this I replied, I now recognize that my question smells of excessive crudeness, but if some other humble question might dare approach your dignity's hearing, I would seek something by asking.
To this she said, Have I not long since laid out the free reins of inquiry without any obstacle of restraint?
The fourth question. Then I said, I wonder why certain portions of your tunic, which should be joined in the weaving of marriage, suffer divorces at that part of their joining where the image of man is represented in the picture's dreams.
Solution to the question. Then she said, From what has been explained you can already deduce what the figured parenthesis of the tear symbolizes mystically. Since, as we said, many humans arm themselves with injuries against their own mother, thereby establishing between themselves and her the greatest chasm of discord, they violently lay violent hands on me, tear my garments from me piece by piece, and force me—bereft of clothing as far as they are able—to play the prostitute in a brothel, when they ought to clothe me with the honor of reverence.
Therefore this is depicted on the garment through this tear: that in the vicious assaults of man alone, my ornaments of modesty suffer the insults of tearing.
Then I said, Now the waves of my doubts, calmed by the serenity of your solutions, grant my mind a respite from interrupting. If it would please your affection, I would affectionately desire to know something.
Alan's fifth question. What reasonable reason, what indiscreet indiscretion, what misdirected love has forced the spark of reason to sleep so deeply in man, that man, intoxicated by the Lethean cup of sensuality, became an apostate in your laws—indeed, that he would unlawfully war against your laws?
Solution to the question. To this she replied, If you wish to recognize the origin of this most shameful plague, you must kindle higher the small fire of your mind, and you will find more eagerly the appetite for understanding. Let subtlety drive away the dullness of intellect, let stability of attention restrain the waves of thoughts.
Taking my beginning from a higher point, I wish to weave the sequence of my narration with more excellent inquiry. I do not wish to explain my propositions with plain plainness of words as before, or to profane profane things with profane novelties of words—but rather to gild shameful matters with the golden ornaments of modest words, and to clothe them in the various colors of beautiful speech.
It is fitting to purple the dross of these vices with gilded readings, and to embalm the vicious stench with honey-flowing words, lest if the stench of such a dunghill should reach the ears of excessive promulgation, it might invite the people to the stomach of indignation and nauseating vomit.
Yet sometimes, as we tasted above, because words must be related to the things of which we speak, the deformity of speech must conform to the shapelessness of things. In the following treatise, however, lest harsh speech offend the readers' hearing or turpitude find place in a virginal mouth, I wish to bestow the cloak of euphonious speech upon these monsters of vice.
Then I said, Now the hunger of my intellect, the keenness of my burning genius, the flame of my inflamed mind, the stability and constancy of my attention demand what you promise.
Then she said, When God wished to mark out from the ideal bridal chamber of preconception the structure of the world's palace, to paint the mental word that he had conceived from eternity concerning the world's constitution in its real existence—as if in material word—then as the world's elegant architect, as the golden smith of a golden work, as the artful artist of stupendous craft, as the maker of an admirable work, not with the laboring support of external instrument, not with the aid of preexisting matter, not by the demand of pressing need, but by the command of arbitrary will alone, God fabricated the admirable beauty of the world's palace.
God assigned various species of things to the world's palace, which, though separated by the conflict of differing kinds, he tempered by the congruence of lawful order. He imposed laws and bound them with sanctions. Thus things contrary by the opposition of their kinds—between which place had placed distance from opposites—by joining them with the reciprocal kisses of a certain mutual relationship into the peace of friendship, he exchanged the strife of resistance.
Therefore, with all things harmonizing through the subtle chains of invisible joining, plurality returned to unity, diversity to identity, dissonance to consonance, discord to concord by peaceful union.
But after the universal craftsman clothed all things with the faces of their natures and married all things to one another in the lawful marriages of proportions, willing that by the circuit of mutual relation between being born and dying, stability should be given to perishing things through instability, infinity through finitude, eternity through temporality, and that the series of things should be woven continuously by the ordered reciprocation of birth—
he established that, coined with the seal of expressed conformation, under the lawful path of derivable propagation, like things should be produced from like things. Therefore he appointed me as his vicar, the minter for stamping the kinds of things, so that I, coining the forms of things on their proper anvils, would not allow the conformed to deviate from the form of the anvil—but that by my working skill, the face of the copy should in no way deviate from the face of the exemplar, defrauded of no gifts of nature.
Therefore, obeying the command of the commander, working and sealing various things as if related, exemplifying the image of the exemplar in the form of the example, conforming conforming things from the conformable, I rendered the faces of individual things sealed.
Yet I exercised the ministry of this operation so much under the command of divine power that the right hand of supernal majesty directed the hand of my attention, because the pen of my writing would deviate by sudden aberration unless guided by the finger of the supreme disposer.
But because I could not polish so many species of things without the supporting craft of a subordinate artificer, and since it pleased me to dwell in the pleasant palace of the ethereal region, where the strife of winds does not destroy the peace of serenity, where the accidental night of clouds does not bury the unwearied ether, where no injury of storm rages, where no raving madness of thunder threatens—
I placed Venus, skilled in ineffable knowledge and sub-vicar of my operation, in the world's suburb, so that under the judgment of my precept, with the supporting industry of her husband Hymenaeus and her son Cupid, laboring in the various fashioning of terrestrial animals, regularly adapting her craftsman's hammers to her anvils, she might weave the series of the human race in unwearied continuation and repair the injuries of those cut off by the Fates' hands.
While in this context of narration speech about Cupid arose, I inserted into the aforesaid narration, by the syncopated parenthesis of my words, the content of this question.
Alan's sixth question. Ah, ah, unless I feared incurring offense to your benevolence by injury to your syncopated speech and by hunting after my questions, I would wish to know Cupid's nature—of whom your speech has given some small mention—by the picture of your description.
For although many authors have painted his nature under the allegorical covering of enigmas, they have left us no traces of certainty. Yet such potential authority is read through experience in the human race, that no one—whether marked with the seal of nobility, clothed in the beauty of privileging wisdom, fortified with the armor of strength, robed in the cloak of beauty, or endowed with the honors of other graces—can exempt himself from the generality of Cupid's domination.
Solution to the question. Then she, with a measured movement of her head and words promising rebuke, said, I believe you serve as a mercenary in Cupid's camps and are connected to him by a certain kinship of intimate familiarity. You affectedly try to investigate his inextricable labyrinth, when you ought rather to adapt the attention of your mind more attentively to my narration enriched with the riches of meanings.
But nevertheless, before the digression of my speech proceeds to what follows, because I sympathize with the weakness of your humanity, I wish to uproot the darkness of your ignorance according to the measure of my ability. Moreover, I am bound by the vow of promise to the solutions of your questions. Therefore, whether describing by certain description or defining by legitimate definition, I will demonstrate the undemonstrable thing, I will disentangle the inextricable.
although this thing itself, not liable to any complexions of nature, not awaiting the investigation of intellect, could be designated by no seal of description. Therefore, let this description be given of the circumscribed thing, let this explanation proceed of the inexplicable nature. Let this knowledge be held concerning the unknown, let this science be obtained concerning the knowable—though with the height of style chastened.
Love is peace with hatred, faith with fraud, hope joined with fear, and madness mixed with reason. Sweet shipwreck, light burden, pleasant Charybdis, unharmed languor, and satisfied hunger. Satisfying starvation, drunken thirst, false pleasure, joyful sadness, joys full of evils. Sweet evil, evil sweetness, sweetness bitter to itself, whose fragrance is tasty, whose taste is tasteless.
Pleasant tempest, bright night, dark light, living death, dying life, sweet evil. Sin of pardon, venial fault, playful punishment, pious crime—indeed, sweet wickedness. Unstable game, stable delusion, weak strength, movable firmness, moving the fixed.
Foolish reason, demented prudence, sad prosperity, tearful laughter, sick rest. Soothing hell, sad paradise, pleasant prison, springlike winter, wintry spring, evil. The mind's fierce moth, which the king's purple feels, but which does not pass by the beggar's cloak either.
Does not Cupid, working many miracles through reversal, transform every kind of human being? When this madness rages, Scylla lays aside her fury, and pious Aeneas begins to be Nero. Paris thunders with the sword, Tydeus softens with love, Nestor becomes young, and Myrrha becomes old.
Thersites begs Paris for beauty, Davus begs Adonis, and all of Adonis passes into Davus. Rich Crassus is needy, and Codrus abounds by needing. Bavius produces poems, Virgil's muse grows dull. Ennius speaks eloquently and Marcus falls silent. Ulysses becomes foolish, Ajax becomes wise by losing wisdom.
He who previously conquered by solving the sophisms of authors is conquered by this monster, though taming other monsters. Any woman rushes into crime, and moreover, if this madness sickens her mind, the daughter slays the father, the sister the brother, or the wife the husband by deceit, preempting the hand of fate.
And thus by ascending she wickedly abbreviates her husband's body, while reaping his head with stealthy sword. The mother herself is forced not to know the name of parent, and tricks in childbirth, while giving birth herself. The son is amazed to have found a stepmother in his mother, frauds in faithfulness, tricks in piety.
Thus in Medea two names equally fight, while she desires to be both parent and stepmother at once. She did not know how to be a sister or preserve herself as sister, while Byblis was too friendly to Caunus. Thus also Myrrha, too much subject to her parent, was a parent in her father, a mother in her father.
But why should I teach more? Every lover is forced to go under Cupid's spear and dissolve all laws for him. He wars in all, his rule scarcely excepts anyone, his lightning and anger strike all things. Against whom integrity cannot prevail, nor prudence, nor grace of form, nor abundance of wealth, nor pinnacle of nobility.
Thefts, deceits, fear, anger, fury, fraud, impulse, error, sadness—these hold his hospitable kingdoms. Here reason is to lack reason, and the measure is to lack measure, and the faith is to have had no faith. Proposing sweet things he takes up bitter ones, he brings in poison, concluding the best things with evil end.
Enticing he entices, laughing he mocks, anointing he pricks, and affecting he infects, the lover hates. Yet you yourself will be able to bridle this pain if you flee—no stronger potion is given. If you wish to avoid Venus, avoid places and times, for place and time give him fodder.
If you pursue, he follows. By fleeing he is put to flight. If you yield, he yields. If you flee, he flees. Now from this device of my teaching, the theory of Cupid's art becomes clear—but through the book of experience, you will be able to obtain the practice.
Nor is it surprising if I insert notes of reproof in the aforesaid depiction of Cupid, although he is connected to me by a certain clasp of blood kinship. For neither the cloudy rust of detracting malignity, nor the heat of burning hatred going forth, nor the tyrant of envy raging outward impelled me to these invectives of accusation—but lest I seem to strangle by silence the evidence of truth speaking for itself.
I do not rebuke Cupid's original nature in honesty, if it is circumscribed by the reins of modesty, if it is chastened by the bridles of temperance, if the seed of digression does not escape its appointed limits, or if its heat does not boil over into excessive swelling. But if its spark has burst into flame or its little spring has swollen into a torrent, the excess's luxury demands the sickle of amputation, the swelling of abundance desires the relief of medicine.
Since every excess disturbs the gait of temperate moderation, and the inflation of diseased abundance swells as if into certain abscesses of vices. Therefore the preliminary theatrical speech, wandering through playful lasciviousness, is offered as a dish to your childishness. Now let the somewhat more mature style return to the purpose of the predetermined narration.
As I taught above by way of foretaste, I appointed Venus to the material propagation of terrestrial animals, so that by forging she might spread out various materials in things to be materialized. I myself, in the manifold purification of natures, in order to apply the hand of supreme finishing to her works—and so that the fidelity of instruments might exclude the leaven of depraved operation—I formed for her two lawful hammers, with which she might both beware the snares of the Fates and present things of multiple essence.
I also assigned noble workshops of anvils to her craft, commanding that by adapting these same hammers to them, she might faithfully devote herself to the fashioning of things, and not permit the hammers to wander from the anvils by any aberration.
I had also bestowed upon her a most powerful pen for the office of writing, so that on suitable pages demanding this same pen's writing—of which she had been made partaker by the benefit of my generosity—she might shape the kinds of things according to the rule of my orthography, and not allow it to wander from the path of proper description into the byway of false writing.
But since generative intercourse itself was bound to connect things of different sexes, dissimilar by ordered complexions, for executing the propagation of things—so that in its connections it might observe the canonical constructions of the grammatical art, and so that the nobility of her craft might suffer no detriment to its glory from ignorance of any art—I taught her to be instructed in courtly precepts under magisterial discipline, namely that discipline which would admit the rules of grammatical art in the artful unions of its constructions, but would exclude others outside the ordinary, redeemed by no excuse of figure.
For although grammar attests that reason of nature has recognized two genders specifically—masculine and feminine—even though some humans, impoverished by the mark, could in my opinion be deemed by the designation of neuter gender, nevertheless I impressed upon Venus under intimate admonitions with the thunder of threats that in her conjunctions, by reason of requirement, she should celebrate the natural construction of masculine and feminine gender only.
For when the masculine gender takes to itself its feminine by the requirement of generative relationship, if the construction of these same genders is celebrated anomalously, so that things of the same sex are constructed with each other, that construction indeed will be able to earn no pardon from me—neither by the remedy of calling forth nor by the support of conception.
For if the masculine gender should seek a similar gender by some injury of irrational reason, no honesty of figure will be able to excuse the vice of that construction's joining, but it will be shamed by the inexcusable monstrosity of solecism.
Moreover, my precept declared to Venus that she herself, observing ordinary suppositions and appositions in her constructions, should assign the thing pre-marked by the character of feminine sex to the office of supposition, and should place the thing specified by masculine gender in the seat of the apposed—so that neither could the apposed decline into the place of the supposed, nor could the supposed migrate into the region of the apposed.
And even when both are governed by the other, the apposed should retain its adjectival property, the supposed should retain what is proper to subjective property, invited by the laws of requirement.
Moreover, I added that Venus's conjunction should not receive the uniform habit of transitive construction, or the course of reciprocation, or the winding of retransition—content with the straight direction of transition alone—or suffer by excessive interruption of any digressing nature, so that the active gender might by usurping assumption become passive, or the same might return to active by the disposition of its own property, or retaining active nature under passive form, might assume for itself the law of the deponent verb.
Nor is it surprising if many maxims, inscribed under the title of grammatical faculty, suffer rejection from the domicile of venereal art, since she admits into the bosom of her familiarity those that obey the rules of her precept, but suspends by exclusion of eternal anathema those that try to storm her laws by the assaults of most eloquent contradiction—
since the authority of philosophical assertion confesses that many maxims are common to diverse faculties, but that some have no license of wandering beyond the dwellings of their own disciplines.
But because I knew Venus would enter the conflict of disputation as a new contestant against such clever oppositions of the Fates, and lest Venus should fear by some evasion of fallacy the subtleties of Atropos's constraining conclusion, I taught her the discipline by which she might proceed according to the precepts of disputative discipline beyond the forms of her own arguments.
And how in the fraudulent arguments of her adversary she might find the hiding place of fallacy, so that she could more securely conduct the agony of disputation against the snares of the adverse party, and refute by counter-example arguments of similar oppositions.
I also enjoined that her syllogistic combination, content with the compendium of two terms and subject to no Aristotelian figures, should be woven by the fitting arrangement of three propositions—to such extent that in each proposition, the major extreme should perform the office of predication, while the minor should be held by the laws of subjection.
In the first proposition truly, by no mode of true inherence, but by the sole reason of intrinsic contract, let the predicate inhere in the subject. In the assumption truly, of relative eyes, by reciprocal impressions, let the major extreme be more expressly connected to the minor. But in the conclusion of most express inherence, let the carnal connection of subject and predicate be celebrated by the truer bond.
This also was my counsel: that by no pestiferous retrogression of conversion should the terms of venereal combination, preserving the rights of analogical predication, alternate the turns of their seats.
And lest the fallacy of the consequent, born from the conformation of similars, could impede Venus's industry, I specified the terms with special marks, so that by the familiar intuition of free recognition, she might boldly recognize which terms the inferior grade of subjection demanded, which the superior apex of predication demanded by right of its relationship—lest if the inconsequent combination of terms did not hold proportionate relationship in common, the deformity of uniform triviality should be born.
But just as I wished to anathematize from Venus's gymnasiums certain observances of grammar and dialectic by the incursion of most hostile hospitality, so I forbade to Venus's craft the metonymic propositions of rhetoricians, which mother rhetoric, embracing in the lap of her amplitude, fashions with many honors—
lest if by the course of too harsh transference, from its protesting subject, the prize be alienated into another—wit into crime, urbanity into rusticity, trope into vice, excessive color into discoloration.
With these insignia of equipment and nobility, Venus passed into the homeland of earthly habitation. She, laboring and sweating with supporting instruments to weave the sequence of human generation, mending with subtle needle those cut off by the Fates' hands, more subtly renews these things. And thus she fulfills the duties of stipendiary administration with most dutiful care.
But since the spirit grows disgusted from the sameness of maternal satiety, and the appetite for executing the purpose is extinguished by the pressing burden of daily labor, the unity of work so often repeated infests Venus with disgust, and the effect of continuous labor excludes the affection for laboring.
Therefore she, more desiring to be effeminized by sterile leisure than to be exercised by fruitful labors, preferred holiday idleness to business operations, and began childishly to grow young with the desires of excessive idleness.
And since from him in whom the torpor of idleness encamps, all the soldiery of virtue is banished, and the sterility of idleness is wont to produce fecundity of depraved offspring. The flooding deluge of drink also foams over into excessive lusts, and unbridled gorging of food belches forth similar nauseas of superfluity.
Venus, stung by these lethal furies, defiling the chastity of the marriage bed against her husband Hymenaeus, began to fornicate concubinarily with Antigamus. Ensnared by her adulterer's death-bearing suggestions, she uncivilly changes liberal work into mechanical, regular into anomalous, civil into rustic. Denying my precept, disinheriting the hammers from the consortium of anvils, she condemns them to adulterous anvils.
The native anvils themselves, deploring the absence of their hammers, seem to demand them tearfully. And she who used to oppose the shield of defense to Atropos's sword mowing down all things, is now bound to her by mutual treaty in stability of reconciliation. Permitting fate's sickle to range too much through the harvest of the human race, she compensates for the loss by no origin of new seed.
but rather, destroying herself by grammatical constructions, inverting herself by dialectical conversions, transferring her art into figure and figure into vice with discolored rhetorical colors—and while she perpetuates the enticements of concubinage with her adulterer by fornicating excesses, receiving from him in place of a son, she is made partner to a bastard.
Who, since he rejoices in no pleasantness of delight, wishes to take midday rest in the pleasures of no playful cheerfulness—so that as if by antiphrasis, joke is spoken from jokelessness—custom has impressed upon him the name Jocus.
Therefore two sons have been given to Venus: discrepant by disparate kind, dissimilar by law of birth, soon differing in titles, deformed in craft. For Hymenaeus, at the boundary of uterine brotherhood in affinity, whom a lineage of more excellent dignity exalts, propagates for himself from Venus Cupid as son.
But Antigamus, descended from buffoonish or ignoble kind, by adulterating, playfully parents for himself the adulterous son Jocus. The former's birth is excused by marriage's solemnity; the latter's propagation is accused by the vulgarity of open concubinage.
In the former, the urbanity of paternal civility shines forth; in the latter, the rusticity of paternal incivility darkens. The former inhabits silvery fountains lustrous with brightness; the latter indefatigably frequents places condemned to perpetual aridity. The former has fixed his tents on pleasant plain; to the latter the wooded valleys are pleasing.
The former passes nights unfailingly in tabernacles; the latter continues days and nights under the open sky. The former wounds whom he hunts with golden hunting spears; the latter pierces whom he strikes with iron javelins. The former intoxicates his guests with bittersweet nectar; the latter destroys his own with sour drink of wormwood.
Now my speech has inscribed upon the page of your mind how the damnable ruin of idleness has educated Venus to excess, how the inundation of flooding drink produces poisonous fire, how, drawing its origin from gorging of food, the elephantine leprosy of luxury has struck many.
Behold, concerning humans languishing with Venus's acute fever, I have sung a mournful song of sorrowful lamentation. Now likewise for others whom the diseased crowd of other vices disturbs, let us tune the cithara of complaining speech under elegiac song.
For many, while avoiding and escaping the voracious gaping mouth of gluttonous Charybdis, are shipwrecked by unexpected peril in the abyss of malignant Scylla. Many also, while escaping the swollen encounters of impetuous torrent, are caught in the sliminess of the swamp. Others, while declining with consulting caution the precipices of the overhanging mountain, are dashed on the level plain by spontaneous precipitation.
Therefore, what I shall discuss, fix to your mind with the nail of tenacious memory, and by vigilance of spirit shake off the sleep of torpor, so that aroused with me by maternal affections, you may grieve in compassion for the shipwrecks of endangered humans. And armored with the shield of preliminary admonition, you may meet the monstrous army of vices, and if any depraved seeds dare sprout in the garden of your mind, uproot them with the sickle of mature cutting.
Then I said, Long since my mind, exhilarated by the compendium of your instruction, inclines a most willing ear to your corrections.
Then she said, Alas, how virtue conquered by vice labors toward ruin with headlong step! Every form of virtue exults, the reins of fury are loosened by vice. Justice's morning star languishes—the shadow of its shadow scarcely remains surviving. It mourns its extinguished star of honor, lacking light, abounding in night.
While the lightning of crimes thunders through the world, the night of fraud clouds over faith's south wind. Yet no stars of virtues redeem the abyss of this night. Evening of faith descends upon the world, and nighttime chaos of fraud abounds.
Faith languishes by fraud, fraud also deceives fraud by fraud. Thus deceit presses on by guile. Customs lack custom in a world lacking morals. Laws lack law, and the rights of justice lose their own rights. Now every right is made without right, law flourishes without law.
The world degenerates. The golden ages of the world now degenerate. The poverty of iron clothes the world—the nobility of gold once clothed it. Now frauds seek cloaks of hypocrisy, and the odorous stench of crimes
seeks for itself the balms of virtues to give a cloak to depraved odor. Thus nettle to roses, seaweed to hyacinths, dross to silver, dye to purple—poverty of form is cloaked, so that crimes sometimes redeem appearances.
But crime strips off all ornaments and does not color itself with justice's light. For vice openly glosses itself, fraud itself becomes the tongue of its own fury. What safety remains when deceit arms even mothers against their own children?
When brotherly love labors under fraud, and the right hand lies to its sister? The right of integrity is judged reprobate to observe the upright, and piety's law is wickedness. To be chaste is now shame to all. Without shame, the inhuman human strips off human uses of humanity. Therefore the degenerate one puts on the degenerate acts of the brute, and thus de-humanizing should be de-humanized.
Alan's seventh question. To this therefore I replied, Since the wanderer of this understanding roams in the air of generality, but specificity is friend to understanding, I would wish that you might unfold the vices which you entangle in a certain ball of generality, through the multicolored intervals of most beautiful species.
Nature's response. Since it is unseemly for the deserving reason of your request to be defrauded of fulfillment's merit, it is right that individual vices be noted for you separately with individual marks.
Since therefore it has already been said how the whole world is endangered by the almost universal fire of impure Venus, it now remains to be said how the same world is shipwrecked by the most universal flood of gluttony.
Since gluttony is as it were a certain proem to venereal execution, and as it were a certain antecedent to the venereal consequent.
Note therefore that certain daughters of ancient idolatry—thoroughly uprooted—try in the present instant to restore their mother's empire and to raise her revived from the dead by certain prophetic songs. These, by prostitute's office, whitening with the face of phantasmic love, enticingly attract lovers and fraudulently lure them.
who under sad joy, under friendly cruelty, under hostile friendship—like Sirens sweet even unto destruction—presenting the melody of delight only on the surface, lead their lovers to the shipwreck of idolatry. One of these, to speak with a fictitious name by the congruence of property, can be called Bacchilatry.
Concerning excessive drink. This Bacchilatry, depriving her lover of reason's spark, exposes him to the darkness of brutish sensuality. She also intoxicates her lover so much in prostitute's manner that he is forced to affect Bacchus too emphatically—to such extent that the drinker, bound to Bacchus by the chain of excessive delight, is believed to exhibit to him the worship of divine majesty.
So much so that the Bacchus-worshipping man, not bearing Bacchus to be separated from himself by local distance, does not allow his god to linger long in the foreign capsules of vessels—but so that the divinity of this same god may attend him more familiarly, he encloses him in the barrel of his belly.
But because the stomach's capsule often cannot long sustain such a guest's divinity, this same god shamefully evaporates either through the arctic pole of the eastern gate, or through the antarctic of the western region.
Many times also the worshipper of Bacchus constructs hospitality for Bacchus in cups powerful with material honor, so that his divinity may shine more divinely in a golden vessel.
Whence the same wine, competing in brightness with ethereal splendors, contending in greenness with emerald colors, and excelling many flavors by the majesty of its own taste, provokes the sons of drinking by the sophistical dignities of its properties, so that they themselves celebrate Bacchus with ineffable love as the secret of ineffable divinity.
Who also, animated by these things, lest anything of that divinity remain unexhausted, swallow Bacchus down to the dregs, and thus force their god to descend dishonorably into the Tartarean abyss of the belly. And while thus they proceed from the specific to the most general kind of drinking, they ascend the superlative degree of drunkenness.
This plague attacks not only men of plebeian commonness, but also makes the haughty necks of prelates bow to it—to whom the graces of Bacchus are not sufficient, which nature's grace poured into him. But also usurping reed-like attraction, now Bacchus glorying in marriage with roses, now breathing the fragrance of another flower, now arrogating to himself some privilege by hyssop's partnership, now enriched externally with the gifts of other things—they swallow him down into the impetuous Charybdis of the throat.
to such extent that without sea they incur shipwreck, without sadness weeping, without illness lethargy, without drowsiness the sleep of drunkenness. Who, when struck by drunkenness's force, while they devote effort to psalm-singing, breaking verses by excessive interruption, they insert the importunate north wind of hangover.
Concerning superfluity of foods. Not only the aforementioned desire of drink, but also dog-like greed for food ensnares many, whose disordered pleasures and disorderly thoughts dream up new preparations of food for themselves.
Who, while they pay the daily debt of food too abundantly to the tax collector, the overabundant tax collector is forced to return to his debtor. These treasure whatever they possess in the chest of the stomach. And although rust does not bite that deposit with corrosion's tooth, nor does the sophism of embezzling thief steal it away, yet by the more shameful theft of digesting heat, it more shamefully vanishes.
These invite the purse to the vomit of coins, invite the chest of money to nausea, so that they can more precisely flatter the tax collector stomach. Inwardly they enrich the belly with the riches of foods, outwardly they are placed in naked and pure poverty.
This pestilence also, not content with common humility, proceeds more profoundly to prelates, who—with salmon and pike and other fish distinguished by equivalent nobility, tortured by various martyrdoms of cooking—adulterating the office of baptizing, baptize them in the font of sacred pepper, so that baptized from such baptism, they may obtain the grace of multiform flavor.
On the same table, the terrestrial animal is submerged by pepper's flood, the fish swims in pepper, the bird is bound by its viscosity. And while so many kinds of animals are imprisoned in the one prison of the belly, the aquatic animal marvels that the terrestrial and aerial kind are entombed with it in the same sepulcher.
To which, if license of exiting were given, scarcely would the amplitude of the gate suffice for those going out.
These aforesaid plagues make a bridge through which one reaches the brothels of luxury. These are the introductions through which one enters the art of stealing. These give birth to diseases, sow poverty. These are nurses of discord, sisters of insanity, mothers of intemperance, huntresses of filth.
Through these, the human race exceeds the limits of modesty, sets aside the reins of temperance, breaks the seals of chastity, does not attend to the grace of my generosity.
For although my generosity provides so many dishes for so many people, rains down so many copious dishes, yet they—ungrateful for the grace—abusing lawful things too unlawfully, loosening the reins of gluttony—while they exceed the measures of eating, extend the lines of drinking to infinity. Who, seducing their palates with the sharpness of salty things, are forced to thirst more often, so that they drink often and much.
Concerning avarice. There is also another daughter of idolatry, whom—if the property of the name retains its kinship of signification in the word—it is fitting to call by the fitting name Nummularty.
This is the malice through which money is deified in the souls of humans, authority of divine veneration is exhibited to coin—through which, where coin speaks, the trumpet of Ciceronian eloquence grows hoarse; where coin fights alongside, the lightnings of Hector's soldiery fall silent; where money fights, Herculean virtue is conquered.
For if anyone is armed with money, as if with silver breastplates, the torrential rush of Ciceronian eloquence, the lightning of Hector's charge, the strength of Herculean virtue, the shape-shifting cleverness of Ulysses are counted as nothing.
For the hunger of having so envelops that dialectic's subtlety is mute, rhetoric's civility languishes. Where the fullness of coins pleads, now Cicero sells the coin of his eloquence, Lucretia exchanges the jewels of her modesty for gold, Penelope lays aside the modesty of her twenty-year chastity for a price.
Even Hippolytus, if he should hear the whispering prayers of coins, does not wish to be step-mothered by his stepmother's prayers. For if money whispers in the judge's ear, Orpheus's lyre, Amphion's song, Virgil's muse are suffocated by money's voice.
Now the rich man, shipwrecked in the depths of riches, thirsts for wealth with the fires of dropsical thirst, and placed in the midst of them, plays Tantalus. The poor man also, although he cannot actually exercise material avarice, yet retains archetypal stinginess within.
When someone gazes upon philosophy face to face like Plato, when they are sealed with the mirror of chastity like Hippolytus, envy expends all the stings of its slander against such a person.
For envy assigns boldness to the madness of recklessness, twists prudence of mind into the cunning of fraud or into pompous verbosity.
Through envy's slander, even modesty degenerates into hypocrisy.
This plague of envy wastes away many people who, while trying to diminish the brightness of another's reputation, are the first to experience the loss of their own integrity.
To such people, another's prosperity is adversity, another's adversity is prosperity.
They are saddened by another's joy, and they rejoice in another's sadness.
These people measure their wealth by another's poverty, their poverty by another's wealth.
They either try to cloud the serenity of another's reputation with the fog of slander, or steal that same glory through silence alone.
They either corrupt the sincerity of another's virtue with wicked interpretations, or wed the leaven of falsehood to truths.
Alas, what monster is more monstrous than envy? What loss more damaging? What fault more culpable? What punishment more painful?
This is the abyss of erroneous blindness, the hell of the human mind, the goad of contention, the sting of anxiety.
What are the impulses of envy but enemies of human tranquility, agents of mental plunder? The hostile watchfulness of a troubled soul, the night watches against another's happiness?
What does it profit anyone if the serenity of prospering fortune applauds them, if their body rejoices in the crimson of beauty, if their mind shines forth with the splendor of wisdom, when the robbery of livid envy plunders the riches of the mind?
When it turns the serenity of prospering fortune into the clouds of adversity? Converts the gold of beauty into the dross of ugliness? When inglorious spite robs prudence of its glory?

Remedies against envy.

If anyone wishes to banish the rust of spite, the moth of envy from the treasure of the mind, let them find their own sorrow in another's pain by feeling compassion, make another's joy their own by rejoicing with them, weigh their own riches in another's wealth, and mourn their own poverty in another's poverty.
If you see another's virtue celebrated with the solemnities of fame, do not make the feast day of proclamation ordinary through slander, but in the noon of your declaration, let the lamp of another's virtue brought into the common space shine more brightly.
If you see any indulging in the barking of slander against the titles of another's fame, remove yourself from the pack of barking dogs, or by presenting admonition, blunt the slanderous tongues, grind down the teeth of corrosion, bite back the bites of slander.

On flattery.

To this cloaked assembly of vices, flattery adds its portion of malignity.
Struck by this pestilence are the courtiers of princes, palace dogs, craftsmen of flattery, smiths of praises, potters of falsehood.
These are the ones who sound the trumpet of high-sounding commendation in the ears of the wealthy, who belch forth the honeycombs of honeyed flattery, who anoint the head of the rich man with the oil of flattery in order to extract gifts, who place pillows of praises under the ears of prelates, who either shake fictitious dust from their very cloaks or artfully pluck feathers from an already featherless tunic.
They redeem with begging praises the deeds of the wealthy upon which the favor of indignant fame spits.
They establish praises according to gifts, favors according to donations, proclamations of flattering fame according to payment.
For if a torrent of prodigality gleams in the house of a rich man, the flatterer pours himself out entirely in praise of prodigality; but if the rich man's gift smells of wintry avarice's torpor, the greedy flatterer grows cold in the praise of commendation, freezes in the gift; but if the gift seems by its very nature to demand the drums of praises, the poet of flattery swells with a high-sounding style of commendation.
But if the poverty of the gift begs for the support of fame, he impoverishes the dignity of fame with a humbler style; for where the magnitude of the gift speaks, the flatterer belches forth hypocritical praises, shadowy reputations from the treasure of his heart.
For if the one for whom the gift speaks has been cast down by such a storm of ugliness that scarcely fragments of natural gifts remain in him, the poems of flattery will dream up for him the prerogative of beauty; they will falsely claim that the tiniest confines of pusillanimity are palaces of magnanimity; they will present even the humble hiding places of sluggish avarice as excess of prodigality; they will falsely claim that even the lowliness of plebeian birth is august with the title of Caesarean nobility.
What more? If in someone a multitude of crimes camps out, excused by no virtue from vices, as long as a gift appears as mediator, the mercenary flatterer of praises superficially colors the appearance of vices with a thin tunic of commendation.
On the contrary, if the noon of all beauty brightens in someone's face, if the tongue gleams with silver pearls of eloquence, if the chamber of the mind flashes with the ornaments of virtues, yet if the craftsman of flattery does not expect the favor of a gift, he labors to mix fogs with the summits of vices into the light of such great honesty.
What therefore is the anointing of flattery but the extracting of gifts? What is the allusion of commendation but the illusion of prelates? What is the smile of praise but their derision?
For since speech is the faithful interpreter of understanding, and words are faithful pictures of the soul, the face is the seal of the will, the tongue is accustomed to be the prophet of the mind, flatterers separate the face from the will, the word from the soul, the tongue from the mind, the speech from the understanding by a wide interval of departure.
For they smile with external whitewashing praise upon many whom they mock with internal mental ridicule; they praise many outwardly with plausible applause whom they inwardly cheat with contradictory derision.
Outwardly they applaud with a virginal face, inwardly they sting with a scorpion's barb; outwardly they pour down honeyed showers of flattery, inwardly they vomit forth tempests of slander.

Alanus pleads with Nature.

Then I, restraining the chariot of continuous narration, said, I would wish that with the rational defenses of your teaching you would strengthen the little fortress of my mind against the furious armies of these vices.

Remedies against the vices.

Lest the Scylla of gluttonous voracity plunge you into the deep night of lusts, offer the reins of moderation to your palate, pay tribute to your belly more modestly. Let the path of your throat drink the rain of wine, taste Bacchic cups modestly. Drink sparingly, so that your mouth seems to be giving kisses to the cups of Bacchus. Let the water of wine break pride, let rivers temper the fury of Bacchus. Let Thetis offer herself married to wine, let the bride restrain the tyranny of her husband. Plain, simple, rare eating grinds down the quarrels of proud flesh. So that the tyrant may press you less harshly, always becoming proud in this flesh, so sluggish Cupid may spend his leisure, let the reins of lust be reined in you, let the languishing sting of flesh grow numb, thus flesh will become servant to spirit. Give freely the bolt of the door of sight, bridle your little eyes lest too wickedly the assaults of light hunt outside and the messenger offer prey to the mind. If the fever of possessing intoxicates anyone, let them force money out of mind. Let ambition feel the triumph of mind, let the necks of conquered Cupid be pressed down. Let not money itself linger in closed purses and sleep lazily, being available to no one, but rather let it keep watch, guardian of honor for rich uses. If time is present, if place demands, let the mass of buried money arise, let purses vomit forth coins completely. Let all gifts serve for honor. If you wish to trample the necks of pride, the blasts of swelling, the thunders of spirit, weigh the weight of fallen origin, the labors of life and the receipt of death.

The arrival of Hymenaeus.

While Nature's speech was proceeding along this path of special teaching, behold, a man by the miracle of sudden appearance, without any banner of our foreknowledge, presented his presence to our sight.
He seemed subject to the law of no single age, for now he bloomed truly with youth, now the serious face of mature age spoke, now his countenance seemed plowed with the furrows of old age.
Just as he fluctuated with the changing face of many ages, so his uncertain stature: now lesser quantity brought it lower to the ground, now the balance of equalized moderation increased the poverty of stature, now with bold height of quantity it contended with gigantic excesses.
In his face no traces of feminine softness remained, but only the authority of manly dignity reigned.
His face was neither drenched with showers of weeping nor brightened with the playfulness of laughter, but free from both, it more modestly aspired toward tears.
His hair, having obtained a truce from strife, confessed the craft of an artful comb, yet lay adorned with the balance of moderate grooming, lest if it wandered in irregular arrangements it might seem to migrate into feminine softness.
And lest a little cloud of hair bury the area of his forehead, the extremity of his hair felt the bite of scissors.
His face, as manly dignity demanded, deviated from no grace of beauty.
His chin now sprouted its first down, now there a more abundant grass fringed it, now it seemed to grow wild with the fleece of a luxuriant beard. Now the severity of the razor chastised the excess of beard.
Rings gemmed with stones like stars, making his hands bright with exceptional radiance, rendered him a new sun.

Concerning the garments of Hymenaeus.

His garments now you would believe to be common with coarser material in ordinary craftsmanship, now to be magnificent with most artful weaving of finer material.
In these, the stories of pictures dreamed of wedding events.
Yet the soot of antiquity had almost forced the painted images to fade.
There the language of painting confessed woven in the sacramental tablet of witness, the purpose of matrimony, the peaceful unity of marriage, the inseparable yoke of nuptials, the indissoluble bond of those marrying.
For in the book of painting was read in shadowy form what solemnity of exultation applauds weddings, what sweetness of melody solemnizes nuptials, what special generality of guests smiles upon marriages, what general pleasantness of the lyre concludes matrimonies.
A numerous company of instrumental musicians also adorned the approach of the aforesaid man.
But these musicians themselves, embodying in themselves the sadness of their master, had imposed silence on their instruments.
Wherefore the workshops of instruments which the torpor of silence made tongueless seemed to aspire to groaning.
Therefore, after local proximity brought him near to Nature, she, marking him by name with an offering of greeting, gave him an offering of a kiss.
From the mark of his very name and from the speaking signs of other circumstances, I recognized that it was Hymenaeus who had come, whom Nature, placing him at her right hand, honored with the dignity of her right hand.

The arrival of Chastity.

While a certain festivity of conversation was being celebrated between Nature and Hymenaeus, behold, a virgin, the dawn of her beauty charming all, by the sudden presence of her arrival, by the direction of her journey seemed to aspire to our presence.
In whose beauty such solemnity of craftsmanship resulted that the finger of polishing nature faltered in nothing.
Her face begged for the hypocrisy of no artificial color, but the right hand of the Omnipotent had planted the rose contending with the lily in her face with a wonderful mixture of nature.
Her eyes, disciplined by the modesty of simplicity, wantoned in the excursions of no petulance.
Her lips, retaining their proper vigor, neither exhausted by kisses nor by caresses seemed to have experienced the preludes of Venus.
Yet her face, sweating into tears, you would believe to be shipwrecked in a river of tears.
A garland materially made from lilies joined by the marriage of crossed insertion smiled upon the ornaments of her head.
Yet the swan-like whiteness of her hair, disdaining to supplicate the whiteness of lilies, displayed a contradictory brightness.
Her garments also would have surpassed snows with their truer proofs of whiteness, had not painting, devising various colors, deceived their whiteness.
For in these, under the invention of painting, it seemed woven how the chastity of Hippolytus, fortified by the wall of constancy, persisted in refuting the assaults of stepmother's lust.
There Daphne, lest she suffer the loss of virginal freedom, put to flight the enticements of Phoebus by flight.
There Lucretia shut out the loss of broken modesty by the shortcut of death.
There in the mirror of painting I could behold Penelope, the mirror of chastity.
And, to encompass in a brief narrative path the many words of painting that should be passed over, the industry of depiction defrauded no daughter of birth of her dish of commendation.
The nobility of a golden seal, which like a starry multitude of jaspers shone with stars, gleamed in the right hand of the aforesaid virgin.
But a turtledove sitting upon her left hand, under the appearance of elegiac song, with calamitous wailings fitted the lyre of its voice.
A company of young maidens clung to her footsteps for the solace of the journey and for obedient service.
When Nature perceived her near through proximity of place, coming to meet her with solemn encounter, with the preface of greeting, the prelude of a kiss, the marriage of embrace, she painted outwardly her mental affection; and while the name of the aforesaid virgin shone forth in the preface of greeting, I recognized the present arrival of Chastity.

The arrival of Temperance.

And while Nature applauded her with the festivity of conversation, behold, a matron disciplining her progress with orderly modesty seemed to trace the path of her journey toward us.
Her stature was circumscribed by the limits of moderation.
Her age tended toward the noon hour, yet the noon of life in no way met winter's deadness of beauty; the ruin of old age also tried to sprinkle her hair with its snows, which the virgin herself had not permitted to wander in irregular flowing over the space of her shoulders, but compelled its excess under discipline.
Her garments seemed neither to boast the glory of noble material nor to bewail the loss of cheapness; but obeying the canons of moderation, neither truncated by the cutting of excessive brevity, they had escaped wandering from the surface of the earth, nor did they clothe the face of the earth with superfluous portions, but tasted it with a brief tasting of a kiss; for the belt, moderating the flow of the tunic, recalled enormity to rule.
A necklace, keeping watch over the vestibules of the bosom, denied entrance to the hand.
In the garments, painting taught by the faithfulness of its letters what circumcision should be in human words, what circumspection in deeds, what moderation in dress, what severity in gesture, what restraint of the mouth in foods, what chastisement of the throat in drink.
Therefore Nature, receiving the aforesaid virgin surrounded by few attendants, with the applause of hasty meeting, with multiple epilogue of kisses and the auspice of specific greeting, figured the heap of her affection; and the expressed expression of her own name brought in the favorable arrival of Temperance.

The arrival of Generosity.

And while Nature venerated the presence of Temperance with the gift of friendly greeting, behold, a woman, aided by whose beauty's brilliance the material day displayed the appearance of a more serene countenance, hastening her journey by hurrying, seemed to direct the lines of her steps toward us.
Her stature, disdaining poverty, exceeded the rule of human height.
Her head, not pressed down in humiliation toward earth making her face bent, but lifting her gaze to higher things with erect neck, directed the course of her sight to loftier things.
Nature sculpted her appearance with polished refinement so that in her she might admire the skill of her own craft.
A diadem, not redeeming poverty by the distinction of workmanship nor recovering cheapness by the nobility of material, but presenting singular sovereignty in both, blazed on her head without the bite of destroying possession.
Yet her golden hair, more flaming with more pleasing fire, seemed in disdain to provide benches to the golden diadem; which, neither cut short by the craft of scissors nor gathered into bundles of braiding, but luxuriating in slower flowing, transgressing the boundaries of her shoulders, seemed to condescend to the poverty of earth.
Her arms, not condemned to the poverty of shortness but flowing with the course of length, not turned backward but you would believe about to pass forward; her hands, capable of no reciprocal tightness of clasping but extended by the unfolding of generous exposure, affected the offices of giving.
Her garments also, obtaining their material from golden and silken threads joined by the kiss of insertion, as the subtlety of work was commended by the generosity of material, rejoiced in the marks of such great craft that you would believe not a material but even a celestial hand had labored on the work.
In which the imaginary credibility of painting, by the artful trick of its management, condemned with the reproach of anathema men laboring under the notorious crime of avarice; but compensated the sons of generosity, titled with proclamations of fame, with the grace of blessing.
Therefore the aforesaid woman, surrounded only by three attendants, while she pressed on with hastening her steps, behold, Nature with celebrated encounter befriending her approach, halving the kiss with greeting, syncopated the greeting with a kiss.
While the special distinction of her form, the courtliness of specified dress, the individuality of gesture proclaimed the arrival of Generosity, the name resounding in the greeting, I received the confirmation of this matter freed from the cloud of doubt.

The arrival of Humility.

While Nature was paying to Generosity the rights of first greeting and friendly applause, behold, a girl, slower with the slowness of lingering step, more serene with the placidity of dove-like countenance, humbler with the smallness of more chastened stature, seemed to turn toward us with the modesty of tortoise-like step.
Yet to the humility of stature, the grace of beauty had come as patron; which, not usurped by the mechanical deceits of human craft but flowing from the living spring of nature, had breathed upon the whole body with the ornament of beauty.
Her hair had been cut short with such biting of scissors that the figure of cutting almost migrated into excess.
Her hairs, wandering in some byway of disorder, entangled in inexplicable complication, you would believe were quarreling among themselves.
Her head, cast down with profound lowering, bent humbly toward the earth.
Her garments, not degenerate from the native color of material by adulteration of applied color, defended the commonness of suburban material by the aid of artful workmanship.
There it was read inscribed in the fabulous inventions of painting how Humility shone forth with the banner of distinction in the catalog of virtues; but Pride, suspended by the mark of excommunication from the sacramental synod of virtues, was condemned to the destruction of extreme banishment.
Therefore to her as she approached, Nature coming in meeting with more earnest haste, sweetening the dish of her greeting with the seasoning of kisses, displayed the countenance of heartfelt affection.
In the particular idioms of the person, the arrival of Humility was revealed to me.

Nature's plaintive speech with Hymenaeus and the aforesaid virgins.

When Hymenaeus and the aforesaid virgins mirrored in Nature's face the appearance of internal complaint and labored to produce the ideas of internal grief into images of external lamentation, behold Nature, anticipating words with words, said:
O sole lights of human darkness, morning stars of a setting world, special planks for the shipwrecked, singular ports amid worldly waves!
By the maturity of rooted knowledge I know what is the reason of your assembly, what the occasion of your coming, what the cause of lamentation, what the beginnings of grief.
For men, formed only by the appearance of humanity but inwardly cast down by the deformity of bestial enormity, whom I grieve to have clothed with the cloak of humanity, try to disinherit you from the patrimony of earthly habitation, completely usurping earthly dominion for themselves, forcing you to return to your heavenly dwelling.
Since therefore my own matter is at stake when the neighboring wall is inflamed by fire, suffering with your compassion, grieving with your sorrow, in your groaning I read my own groaning, in your adversity I find my own loss.
Therefore omitting nothing of what is appropriate, having achieved my proper end in myself, insofar as I am able to extend the arm of my power, I will strike them with vengeance answering to vice.
But because I cannot exceed the limit of my power, nor is it within my capacity to completely uproot the poison of this pestilence, following the rule of my possibility, I will brand with the mark of anathema men ensnared in the windings of the aforesaid vices.
But it is fitting that Genius be summoned, who serves me in priestly office, so that he may eliminate them from the catalog of natural things, from the boundary of my jurisdiction, with the assisting presence of my judicial power and with the agreeable grace of your assent, by the pastoral rod of excommunication.
Hymenaeus will be the most proven executor of this embassy, with whom shine the stars of stellar eloquence, with whom is located the treasury of examining counsel.

The embassy of Hymenaeus with Nature's letter to Genius.

Then those standing by, resting from the tears of their complaint, with profound lowering of heads, submissively paid thanks to Nature with abundant profession; but Hymenaeus, humbling himself in the present sight of Nature with bent knees, confessed himself bound to the assigned embassy.
Then she marked a paper document with the inscription of this kind of exemplary verse.
Nature, by the grace of God, first vicarious creatrix of the worldly city, to Genius, similar to herself as another self, and to him befriended through all things by the kindnesses of serene fortune.
Since similar things rejoice in the sprinkling of dissimilar things and in the social relation of similar things, finding in you as in a mirror shining with likeness another me of Nature, I am bound by the knot of heartfelt affection, either advancing in your advancement or failing with equal balance in your failing, wherefore the affection should be circular, so that you may respond with reciprocation of love.
The evidence of the crime committed, bearing the image of an outcry, clearly declares to you the shipwreck of the human race.
For you see how men dishonor the honesty of original nature with bestial enticements, stripping off the privileged nature of humanity, they transmigrate into beasts by degeneration of character, pursuing improper desires in following Venus, shipwrecking in the whirlpools of gluttony, burning with the vapors of cupidity, flying with fictitious wings of pride, indulging in the bites of envy, gilding others with the hypocrisy of flattery.
No one presses medicinal remedies against these diseases of vices; no one chastises this torrent of crimes with the barrier of defense; no one restrains these waves of wickedness with the stability of a port.
The virtues also, unable to sustain such an onslaught of hostile conflict, flee to us as their only asylum of defense and remedy of life.
Since therefore our cause is vexed by common devastation, both softening with prayers and commanding you by the virtue of obedience, and by commanding I warn, and by warning I command, that with every sophistry of excuse banished, you hasten your approach to us, so that with the assisting presence of me and my virgins, separating the sons of abomination from the sacramental communion of our Church, you may strike them with the severe rod of excommunication with due solemnity of office.
After this, she handed to the ambassador for delivery the letter sealed with a signet seal, in which artificial skill had carved the name and image of Nature.
Then Hymenaeus with more solemn countenance concluding his thanks of joy, and beginning the assigned embassy, and rousing his companions from the sleep of laziness, ordered that they, attending to their instrumental instruments, rouse them from the sleep of silence and invite them to the measures of harmonious melody.
Then they, enticing their instruments with certain preludes, painted a voice uniformly deformed, similar in dissimilarity, with multiform measure:
Now the trumpet greeting war with terrible clang thundered, speaking the preludes of kindred war, marking similar tumult with similar roar. The horn wounded the air with false wound. The wandering voice of this, the abnormal voice of this knows not how to comply with instrumental measures and scorns to favor art, and music marvels at the unbridled song. The pleasing voice of the cithara, calming more pleasingly than these, bestowed feasts of honeyed golden voice, which, varying and coloring the face of varied song, now produces tears in voice, feigning sorrow, now paints falsehoods of false laughter in sound. And the lyre which always sings like the nightingale with pleasant song, more sweetly enticing, recites preludes of sleep to the eyes and buries the murmurs of offended mind. The pipe, which vigilant keeps watch skillfully at night, indeed compensates by voice in vigils the losses of sleep, smiled on the ears through which the rest of the stony hardness of heart is made, and the harshness of hard mind is compelled to melt and drive away its own rigidity. The drums with slow step of dull voice delayed this course of voice and such keenness of flight. Nor yet is it wholly defrauded of the honor of song if someone strikes it with subtle blow of beating, and the hand rouses it and tastes it with friendly touch, joined with deep drawing of exhausted air. When organs belched wind with sweet noise, the unequal equality of these, the discordant concord, indeed the similar dissension of dissimilar voices is divided when joined and joined when divided. Cymbals sounded with plebeian sound, begging voice, which by clamoring never plead to our ears, scarcely worthy to merit human hearing. There was none greater, better, or more pleasing than that one with which one concluded to the aforesaid songs, the sweet song of five strings, whose footsteps the rival crowd adored, whose voice they worshipped in song. And that which disputes with discordant mouth with the cithara, the psaltery stored up in honeycomb, honeyed in flavor, a pleasing voice sounded bearing small gifts of song. Rattles demanding the touch of girlish right hand, of feminine tongue, prophet of Mars and war, sang miracles of unheard voice with voice.

Nature resumes her plaintive speech.

Therefore while Hymenaeus was indulging in the mysteries of mystical embassy, Nature, weaving together the elegiac speech of troubled complaint, recounted the injuries of those by whose pressing wickedness the majesty of her commonwealth had felt the abundant damage of profound loss.
Among whom she more sharply accused one before the others with stings of reproach, who more carelessly than others strove to dishonor Nature.
Although every grace of nobility flattered nature, although prudence befriended with its gifts, and although magnanimity raised him up, generosity taught him, yet because the whole mass labored with the harshness of a small leaven, the setting of one virtue completely clouded the rising of other virtues.
The eclipse of one virtue compelled the stars of other virtues to die by ecliptic recession.
And when Generosity saw these reproaches directed at her pupil, not daring to color his vices with the cloak of defense, with humble downcast lowering of head, she fled to the remedies of tears.

Nature consoles Generosity and condemns Prodigality.

Nature, weighing what the lowering of head, what the emission of tears might signify, said:
O Virgin, by whose distinguished architecture the human mind is destined to be the palace of virtues, through whom men will obtain the rewards of favorable grace, through whom the ancient ages of the golden age revive, through whom men bind themselves with the glue of heartfelt friendship—eternal Being, producing you by the generating kiss of its eternal Mind, has granted you to me as a sister from the same womb.
Not only does the belt of native kinship join you to me, but also the lasting bond of love chains us together.
Wherefore from the examination of my will, the balance of your discretion does not allow your will to wander; for such a union of conformity, indeed a unity of union reconciles our minds in faithful peace, that not only does that feigned union clothe itself in the image of unity, but also with the phantom of union set aside, it aspires to the essence of identity.
Therefore no injury rages against either that does not rage against the other, no enticement harms either that is not also hostile to the other.
Therefore whoever, with the crying blasphemy of shameless perpetration, labors to effeminate the title of my dignity, by the urgency of injurious vexation attempts to detract from your honor.
He also who abuses nature's gifts by the outflow of excessive prodigality is stripped of fortune's gifts by the damage of excessive waste.
Thus also the prostituted commonness of prodigality falsely professes the honor of generosity, and the torrent of riches is diverted into the dryness of poverty; the splendor of wisdom strays into the setting of foolishness; the rigor of magnanimity is loosened into the boldness of temerity.
Therefore I am wearied with a certain wonder why in the condemnation of him who strives to damage us more injuriously than others, you cannot restrain the flood of tears.
Then Generosity, removing the stream of tears from the region of her face by a surer remedy, and recalling the lowering of her head to higher things, said:
O original beginning of all things born! O special support of all things! O queen of the worldly realm! O faithful vicar of the supreme celestial prince, who under the authority of the eternal emperor corrupt faithful administration with no corruption.
To whom the universality of worldly origin is bound to obey by the requirement of specific nature, as the expressed equality of intimate knowledge requires, the golden chain of affection connects me to you.
Therefore he who, selling his own nature at a loss, attacks you with the assault of excessive rebellion, fights against me with the importunity of equal upheaval.
Who, although deceived by the shadowy image of credulity, believes himself to be a fellow soldier in my ranks, and men deceived by the theatrical representation of prodigality smell in him the traces of Generosity, yet he is suspended by long banishment from the benefit of our friendship.
But because it is ours to sympathize with compassion for the windings of erroneous wandering, I cannot help but be moved by the pestiferous display of his senseless will.

The arrival of Genius.

While an intercalary conference of dramatic conversation was being celebrated among these virgins, behold Genius, with the applauding joy of instrumental music, appeared with new brilliance of appearance.
His stature, fittingly modified by the canon of moderation, neither complained of the cutting away of diminution nor was saddened by the addition of superfluity; his head, clothed with frosty hairs of whiteness, bore the mark of wintry old age; yet his face, polished with youthful smoothness, was furrowed by no plowing of old age.
His garments, with workmanship following nature, knowing the poverty of neither this nor that, seemed now to be brightened with hyacinth, now to be kindled with scarlet color, now to be made more expressly white with fine linen; in which images of things, living momentarily, expired so often that they slipped from the investigation of our knowledge.
He bore in his right hand a reed of papery fragility never resting from the service of his writing; but in his left, a skin stripped of its hairy covering by the bite of a razor, on which, with the aid of an obedient stylus, images of things migrating from the shadow of painting to the truth of essence were given the life of their kind; and when these were put to sleep by the death of deletion, others were recalled to life by the birth of new creation.
There was Helen, semi-divine by her beauty, who through her beauty could be called Beauty itself.
There in Turnus the thunderbolt of audacity, in Hercules vigor reigns.
There in Capaneus gigantic height ascended; in Ulysses fox-like cunning flourished.
There Cato was wonderfully intoxicated with the nectar of chaste sobriety.
Plato gleamed with stellar splendor of genius.
There the starry tail of the Tullian peacock gleamed.
There Aristotle wrapped his thoughts in the hiding places of enigmatic speech.
After the solemnity of this inscription, the left hand, as if coming to aid the weary sister of the right hand fatigued by the labors of continuous depiction, usurped the office of painting; the right hand holding the tablets; which, departing from the path of correct writing with the limping of false writing, created figures of things, indeed shadowy ghosts of figures with half-full painting.
There Thersites, clothed in the raggedness of ugliness, demanded the skill of more expert craftsmanship.
There Paris was figured in the softness of incestuous desire.
There the verses of Ennius, starved of the grace of thoughts, transgressed metrical art with unbridled license.
There Pacuvius, not knowing how to moderate the course of narration, placed the beginning in the retrograde series of his treatise.

How Truth accompanied Genius.

Therefore while Genius was solemnly applying effort to these skills of painting, Truth as daughter to father stood attending with modest service, who was propagated not by the promiscuous itch of lust, but was derived by this genial kiss alone of Nature and her offspring, when the eternal Idea greeted Hyle contemplating the mirror of forms, having kissed her through the vicarious intervention of an iconic interpreter.
In her face the divinity of divine beauty was read, having spurned the nature of our mortality.
Her garments, proclaiming the right hand of the celestial craftsman, inflamed with the splendors of tireless radiance, could be canceled by no moths of antiquity; which were joined to the virginal body with such connection that no separation of stripping off would ever make them foreign to the virginal body.
But others, as if of adventitious nature, with preceding appendages, now offered small tastes of sight to the eyes, now shaped themselves to the investigation of the eyes.
Opposite, Falsehood standing more attentively hostile to Truth, whose face clouded with the soot of ugliness confessed no gifts of nature in itself, but old age, submitting the face to valleys of wrinkles, had gathered it up, universally entangling it.
Her head seemed clothed neither with the garment of hair, nor did the veil of a covering excuse baldness, but an infinite plurality of rags, which the plural infinity of children had woven as garment for her.
She, secretly ambushing the truth of painting, whatever that one conformably formed, this one informally deformed.

How Nature met the arriving Genius.

Therefore Nature, giving looser reins to her step, solemnly displaying solemn encounter, gave kisses fermented by no poison of illicit Venus but signifying embraces of mystical desire and also figuring the harmony of mystical affection to the arriving Genius.

Genius addresses Nature.

When mutual congratulation was completed at the limit of fulfillment, Genius imposed silence, his hand requesting silence, and consequently coined the matter of his voice into this form of speech:
O Nature, not without the divine breathing of internal inspiration, from the balance of your discretion has proceeded this imperial edict, that all who by abusive disuse strive to render our laws obsolete, and resting on the feast day of our solemnity, may be struck with the sword of anathema.
And because the law of this legitimate promulgation does not attack the law of justice, and the balance of your judgment sits upon the examination of my discretion, I hasten quickly to strengthen the rule of your edict.
For although my mind, troubled by the deformed vices of men, journeying in the hell of sadness, knows not the paradise of joy, yet in this it smells the beginnings of pleasant joy, that it sees you with me sighing for the sighs of due vengeance.
Nor is it surprising if in the conforming union of our wills I find the melody of concord, since the notion of one exemplar Idea has brought us forth into native being, the condition of one official administration conforms us, since no hypocritical love joins our minds with superficial bond of affection, but the modesty of chaste love inhabits the internal hiding places of our souls.
While Genius was forming the course of his speech with this compendium of words, as if with the aurora of his exclamation being born, withdrawing for a little while the darkness of sadness, with the honor of her dignity preserved, Nature paid to Genius the rights of thanks.

Here Genius promulgates the excommunication against those named above.

Then Genius, after laying aside common garment, vested with the more celebrated ornaments of priestly vestment, under this image of words, called forth outwardly from the innermost chambers of mind the aforesaid series of excommunication, with this course of speech preceding:
By the authority of superessential Being and its eternal Notion, with the assent of the celestial host, and with Nature and the other virtues supporting by their ministry, let every one be separated from the kiss of supernal affection, let him be degraded from nature's grace as the merit of ingratitude demands, let him be segregated from the uniform council of natural things, whoever either distorts the lawful course of Venus, or incurs the shipwreck of gluttony, or feels the nightmare of drunkenness, or thirsting experiences the burning of avarice, or climbs the shadowy height of insolent arrogance, or suffers the heartfelt destruction of spite, or communicates the fictitious love of flattery.
Whoever makes abnormal exception from the rule of Venus, let him be deprived of Venus's seal.
Whoever is submerged in the abyss of gluttony, let him be chastised with the shame of begging.
Whoever is put to sleep by the Lethean river of drunkenness, let him be vexed by the fires of perpetual thirst.
He in whom the thirst of possessing burns white-hot, let him incur perpetual poverty.
Whoever, exalted on the precipice of arrogance, belches forth the spirit of elevation, let him descend ruinously into the valley of cast-down humility.
Whoever enviously gnaws the riches of another's happiness with the moth of slander, let him first find himself the enemy there.
Whoever hunts little gifts from the rich by the hypocrisy of flattery, let him be cheated of the reward of sophistic merit.
After Genius granted an end to his speech with this destruction of anathema, the attending company of Virgins applauding this imprecation strengthened Genius's edict with swift word of confirmation, and the lamps of wax candles in the hands of the virgins, shining at noon with their lights, seemed cast down to earth with a certain scorn and lowering, dejected by the sleep of extinction.

Conclusion of the work.

When the mirror of this imaginary vision was withdrawn, the sight of the previous mystical apparition abandoned me as I was roused from ecstasy into sleep.
