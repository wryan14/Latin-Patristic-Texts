      "original_latin": "(Quod ad tactum vestis eius cecus illuminatus sit) \nII. Oculorum quidam lumine destitutus in sacrario beati Petri Annonem quasi pro stipis obtentu suppliciter compellans ad eius vestigia provolvitur. Collecta ex parte lateris veste illius, uno dumtaxat ex officialibus episcopi rem considerante, cæcos orbes fide plenus defricavit, moxque detersa caligine novæ lucis exortum cum gaudio et admiratione suscepit. Neque iam aliud poposcit aut clamavit, qui tanti restitutionis dono potiebatur, sed dissimulans ac discedens uni tantum ministrorum, quod in se factum gloriabatur, aperuit. Is ad mensam præsule solita frequentia discumbente, pariter accumbens, sciscitante illo ubi o cæcus idem haberetur, respondit eum impetrato quod optaverat ilico recessisse. Quid hoc esset viro Dei, ut diceret imperante: \"Satis,\" inquit, \"et ultra consuetam mortalibus largitatem homini contulistis; nam ad genua vestra cæcus procubuit, inde surrexit videns. Quid hoc munere præstantius? Unde nec ultra comparuit, qui post acceptos oculos aliud quid accipere non quæsivit.\" Expalluit ad ista sacerdos, et quantum publicæ existimationis auram refugeret, evidens de se præsentibus experimentum dedit. Custos namque sui nec appetens alieni sic gloriam dabat Altissimo, ut nullum in se admitteret famæ vel favoris obsequium.",
