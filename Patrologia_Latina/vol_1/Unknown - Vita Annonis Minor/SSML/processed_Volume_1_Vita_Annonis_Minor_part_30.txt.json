Habebat autem vir beatus, ut ex predictis partim declaratur, magnam quoque prescientie gratiam, qua futura nonnulla per Spiritum predixisse compertus est. In quibus est illud, quod, cum in Goslaria publicis maiorum regni conventibus interesset, a quodam ex latere regis clerico, nomine Hildolfo, familiaritatis intuitu rogatus, ut codicem sacramentorum, quem habebat, insignem donaret eidem: „Hanc\", inquit, „interim postulatione carebis, donec iuri tuo conferantur omnia, que in capelle mee supellectili continentur\". Dicebat vero, quod et evenit, quoniam hunc sibi proximum in cathedra episcopali successurum previdebat.",
