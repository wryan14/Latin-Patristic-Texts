      "original_latin": "(De duobus a suspendio per eius personea similem formam liberatis) \nErat in urbe Mogontiac regalis curie quodam tempore celebritas edicta, quo, dum a regni magnatibus undique properaretur, et hic pontifex iter accelerans quodam in loco pernoctare disposuit, in quo fama ferebatur, et regem nocte proxima mansiones accepturum. Ea die iuvenes duo provincialium iudicio sententiam damnationis innocenter acceperant statimque colla torquibus innodati ad suspendium urgebantur. Nullus erat miseris expurgandi locus aut venia, nulla contra legem iniqua defensio. Iam gelidus ossa pavor penetraverat, iam sola mortis expectatione stabant exanimes. Cum inter angustias ad exorandum Deum animati clamores validos ab intimis dabant, eius omnipotentiam, eius implorantes clementiam, quatinus intervenu cuiuscumque servi, sui, quomodo vellet, morti eos eximeret, quandoquidem at cunctis exclusa pietate nemo de presentibus esset, quem communis naturen consolacio ad misericordiam traheret. Audivit miserator Dominus invisibilemque visibiliter adesse iubens potestatem ad declarandum mortalibus suum super Annone testimonium in illius eam effigie potissimum voluit apparere. Namque, dum illi manibus ad tergum retroactis sursum traherentur, in ipso mortis et vite sevox duello hi, qui circumstabant, prelibatam de regis adventu famam replicantes pendentibus huiusmodi confabulationis auditum infundere. Protinus ambo tracti, corporalibus oculis in similitudinem quandam percepit sermonis quasi regem ipsum comitatu imperiali circumfusum conspiciunt, advenire magnae dignitatis clericum inter frequentias illas habentem, cuius habitudo faciei totam, in qua post agnitus Anno est, proprietatem exprimabat. Hic universis praetereuntibus solus in miseros pio conversus oculo locum quantocius adiit seque medium utriusque supponens, hac manu destruit, altera vero sinistrum usque ad medias noctis tenebras singulis in pedibus sustinuit.",

They were urged to escape with these words: \n        <s>\"Run away, pitiful ones, wherever you wish. Your liberator is God, powerful and merciful.\"</s>\n        After he said this, he vanished, and the young men marveled at the clear power of divine goodness. They decided to take refuge in one of the nearby villages.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Strangely, although many paths diverged, they turned only toward the village where the heavenly messenger Anno had set up camp. Out of many houses, they sought the one where he had stayed, even though they had no knowledge of his name or presence. When they saw the man whose likeness had saved them from death, they fell at his feet, expressing with tears and thanks that he was a servant and friend of the highest majesty through whom God had saved them from hanging between life and death.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        There was clear evidence of faith as the ugly marks of the ropes were still visible on their necks. Then the bishop, impatient with his usual praise, rejected them as deceivers, but signaled to some of the clergy to take them aside and subtly investigate the reason for their condemnation. When they responded simply to every inquiry without any deceit, it was found worthy of acceptance, as the innocence of the young men was proven, and Anno's merit shone with the liberation of the innocent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        He burst forth in praise, saying: \n        <s>\"This should not be attributed to me; these are your works, Christ. Your mighty deeds of kindness are revealed in them, as you, the pious protector of innocence, have shown mercy to the innocent so they would not perish.\"</s>\n        After spending some money on these men, he continued his journey, moving, as it is said, from strength to strength.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Mirumque in modum, cum plura se obvia ferrent diverticula, in solam, qua solatii caelestis minister Anno stationem metatus est, declinaver villam, et ex multis mansionibus non aliam quam, quo ipse successerat, domum petiere, cum tamen super eius nomine vel praesentia nil compertum haberent. At ubi conspexere virum, cuius similitudo a morte eos absolverat, totis concussi membris ad eius vestigia prociderunt, illum lacrimis, illum gratiarum actione summis maiestatis servum et amicum protestantes, per quem Deus eos diem cum nocte pendentes ad vitam servaverit. Credendi evidens id erat argumentum, quod feda facies operiente macie collis astrictorum visebantur adhuc torquium nodi expressi. Tunc presul solito su√¶ laudis impatiens illos quidem veluti fallaces repulit, innuit autem quibusdam clericorum, ut seorsum eis assumptis rem subtitler et causam damnationis illorum scrutarentur.
