Sirmium was composed by Hosius and Potamius in the year 357.
There is one God.
The term "substance" should be avoided.
The Father is greater than the Son.
When it was believed that there was a debate about faith in the year 465, everything was carefully examined and discussed at Sirmium, with our most holy brothers and fellow bishops, Valens, Ursacius, and Germinius, present.
It is agreed that there is one almighty God and Father, as believed throughout the world:
and His only Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, begotten from Him before the ages.
However, we cannot and should not proclaim two gods, because the Lord Himself said:
"I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20:17).
Therefore, there is one God of all, as the Apostle taught.
"Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also."
Since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith (Romans 3:29-30).
But everything else agreed, and there could be no discrepancy.
As for what concerned some or many regarding the substance, which in Greek is called "usia," or more clearly "homoousion," or what is called "homoiousion," there should be no mention at all;
nor should anyone proclaim it because it is neither contained in the divine Scriptures nor can it be comprehended by human knowledge, nor can anyone explain the birth of the Son, about whom it is written, "Who will declare His generation?" (Isaiah 53:8).
It is clear that only the Father knows how He begot His Son, and the Son, how He was begotten by the Father.
There is no ambiguity that the Father is greater.
No one can doubt that the Father is greater than the Son in honor, dignity, glory, majesty, and even in the name of Father, as testified by Himself, "The one who sent me is greater than I" (John 14:28).
And everyone knows this to be Catholic, that there are two persons, the Father and the Son, with the Father being greater, and the Son subject to all that the Father has subjected to Him.

The Father has no beginning, is invisible, immortal, and incapable of suffering. The Son, however, is born from the Father, God from God, light from light. As mentioned earlier, no one knows the generation of the Son except the Father. This same Son of God, our Lord and God, as it is written, took on flesh or a human body, becoming a man from the womb of the Virgin Mary, as the Angel announced in Luke 1:31.
As all Scriptures teach, and especially the Apostle, the teacher of nations, He took on human form from the Virgin Mary, through whom He suffered. The core point of the entire faith and its confirmation is that the Trinity must always be upheld, as we read in the Gospel: Go and baptize all nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew 28:19. The number of the Trinity is complete and perfect. The Spirit, the Comforter, comes through the Son, who was sent according to the promise, to instruct, teach, and sanctify the Apostles and all believers.
Essence and substance explained. Council of Ancyra in the year 358. The Son as an image is not different from the Father in name only.
In response to these many and significant declarations of impiety, the Eastern bishops gathered to define their beliefs. Since we must often refer to essence and substance, it is important to understand what essence means, so that when we discuss things, we do not remain unaware of the meanings of the words. Essence is the thing that exists, or from which it exists, and which persists in its permanence. Essence, nature, kind, and substance can be spoken of for each thing. Essence is specifically called so because it always exists. It is also called substance because the thing that is must exist in itself; whatever exists undoubtedly remains in its kind, nature, or substance. Therefore, when we say essence signifies nature, kind, or substance, we understand it as the thing that always exists in all these.
Now let's review the faith definitions set by the Eastern bishops.

If anyone hears that the Son of God is the image of the invisible God and claims that being the image of God is the same as being the invisible God Himself, without truly acknowledging the Son, let them be condemned.
Similarly, there is another point: He receives life from the Father. The idea of those who wish to preach only the names Father and Son is rejected, since whenever there is an image, the nature of the one it resembles cannot be different.
No one is an image of themselves; instead, an image must reflect the one whose image it is.
Therefore, an image is a resemblance imagined and indistinguishable from the thing it equals.
So, there is the Father, and there is the Son: because the Son is the image of the Father; and for something to be an image, it must have the appearance, nature, and essence of its origin according to the image.
And if anyone hears the Son saying,
For as the Father has life in Himself,
so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself
(John 5:26),
and they claim the same one received life from the Father, who also admits,
I live because of the Father
(John 6:57),
as if the one who gives and the one who receives are the same: let them be condemned.
The Son's essence is not unlike the Father's because He is His image.
The distinction is made between the giver and the receiver, so that the same one is not the only and solitary being.
Since anyone who believes in one solitary being in the context of giver and receiver is condemned, it cannot be understood that He received from Himself, who gave.
For He is not the only one who lives and through whom others live; because one lives for himself, and another claims to live through the origin: and no one will assert that the same one is both the life user and the cause of living.
And if anyone hears that the only begotten Son of the invisible God is similar and does not say that the Son, who is the image of the invisible God, is understood according to essence: as if not truly calling Him the Son, let them be condemned.
Similarly, just as the Father, so He has life in Himself.
The life of the Father and the Son is the essence of both.
An indistinguishable and dissimilar nature is confirmed.

Since the only Son of God is the image of the invisible God, He must closely resemble God's essence in both appearance and nature.
How can we distinguish the nature of the Son from the Father by an indifferent kind, when the Son, existing in what belongs to the Father, naturally shares in what is generated in Him-namely, glory, virtue, power, invisibility, and essence?
Therefore, in these equal aspects of divine goodness, we understand that the Son is not lesser because He is the Son, nor does the Father exceed because He is the Father.
The Son is envisioned with the Father in appearance and is not different in kind. The similarity of the Son, generated from the Father's substance, does not allow for a difference in substance, and the Son, as the image of the invisible God, fully encompasses all the Father's divinity in whatever form it is.
This truly defines what it means to be the Son: to perfectly reflect the truth of the Father's form, envisioned in His nature.
If anyone hearing this asks,
"For as the Father has life in Himself, so He granted the Son also to have life in Himself"
(John 5:26), and does not acknowledge the Son's similarity to the Father in essence as evidence of what He said, let him be accursed.
It is clear that the life understood in the Father signifies substance; the life of the Only Begotten, which is generated from the Father, is also understood as essence, thus indicating the similarity of essence to essence.
The perfect birth of an indistinct nature is linked to such a confession of its origin. For what is life in both is signified as essence in both.
In the life that is generated from life, that is, essence born from essence, it is not different in birth because life comes from life, holding within it the similar nature of its origin; because the essence of the begotten and begetting, the life possessed and given (indeed from the Father and given to the Son), does not differ in likeness.
For what God begot from Himself, from the likeness of His nature, He did not abandon, where the unbegotten likeness is the natural property of the substance.

It has nothing except what it has been given, and just as it has life, it has been given life. Thus, what comes from the essence, like life from life, is born similar to itself according to the essence, without any difference or dissimilarity between the one being born and the one begetting.
Verse 5.
If someone says, "He founded or created me" (Proverbs 8:22), and "He begot me" (Proverbs 8:25), hearing from the same source, they should not interpret this as being born from a similarity of essence. Instead, they should understand "He begot me" and "He created me" as meaning the same thing.
It's not about saying the Son is a perfect Son of God signified by two names, but rather that through the names "He created me" and "He begot," only the condition is stated, not the Son. Just as Wisdom has offered a devout understanding from two names: let him be accursed.
17. The phrase "He created me" must be understood in light of "He begot me." This highlights the distinction between birth and creation.
Those who claim the Son of God is a creature or creation are contradicted by reason.
The impious presumption of heretics is evident when they say they have read "The Lord created or founded me," interpreting creation in a certain way. However, they omit the following sentence, which provides context to the former. They misuse the first statement to support their impiety by claiming it refers to a creature because Wisdom said it was created.
If it was created, how could it also be born?
Every birth, whatever it is, derives its nature from the begetting nature: creation, however, begins with the power of the creator, who can create a creature from nothing.
Therefore, Wisdom, which stated it was created, in the same context, specifically in verse 25, explained why it said it was created and also begotten: referring creation to the immutable nature of the parent, which, beyond the form and habit of human birth, without any diminishment or change of itself, created from itself what it begot.
The work of the creator does not involve suffering, mixture, or birth.
What is created from nothing begins to exist at some point.

Creation is an act of power, brought into being by the one who establishes it, rather than a birth from nature itself. True birth represents the perfect unfolding of legitimate origin and genuine nature, where the nature of what is begotten derives from the nature of what begets it.
The Son of God is not begotten through physical division but is born as a perfect God from a perfect God. This is why Wisdom refers to Him as created, emphasizing that His genesis excludes any physical weakness. By stating that He is both created and born, it clarifies the nature of His origin.
Those who only attribute a resemblance of power to the Son are mistaken. To demonstrate that His nature stems from birth and not mere creation, it is also stated that He was born. By acknowledging both creation and birth, it offers a full understanding of His origin while highlighting the unchangeable nature of the Father and affirming that the nature born from God the Father is legitimate and proper.
This discussion brings clarity to the concepts of perfect birth, creation, and generation: one aspect remains unchanged, and the other embodies the true nature. Both concepts merge into one, achieving perfection. The Son, born from God and unchanged by God, is born of the Father, illustrating that He is created. The unchanging and natural Father establishes the Son, thereby generating Him.
Therefore, the notion that the Son of God is merely a creature is condemned, as it is a heretical view. This opinion of creation from nothing, devoid of the perfection of divinity, is refuted by the truth of natural generation.
If anyone sees in the Son the likeness of the Father in essence, it is evident through what the Son Himself declares: For just as the Father has life in Himself, He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. John 5:26.

Based on effectiveness, through what is taught: For what the Father does, the Son does likewise, granting similarity only in effectiveness, but denying the Son according to essence, which is the most important part of our faith, as if denying himself the knowledge of eternal life, which is in the Father and the Son: let him be anathema.
The likeness of power comes only from the likeness of nature.
Life is signified by essence.
Heretics, confined by the authority of the Scriptures, usually grant this only to the Son: that he is only similar to the Father in power, but deny him the likeness of nature.
Foolish and impious, not understanding that the likeness of power comes only from the likeness of nature.
For a lesser nature never achieves the power of a superior and greater nature.
Or what will those who assert these things profess about the almighty God the Father if the power of an inferior nature equals his own power?
It cannot be denied that the Son can do the same, as he said: Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise (John 5:19).
But the likeness of nature follows the likeness of power when he says: Just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself (John 5:26).
In life, there is the signification of nature and essence: just as it is possessed, it is taught to be given to possess.
Therefore, the likeness of life holds the likeness of power: for the likeness of power cannot be unlike in nature.
And so it is necessary that the likeness of essence follows the likeness of power: because just as the Father does what he does, the Son does the same: just as the Father has life, he has given life to the Son to have.
Therefore, the rashness of impious profession is condemned, which, confessing the likeness of power, dares to preach dissimilarity of nature: since the faith of our principal hope is to confess the same divine substance in the Father and the Son.

If anyone claims to believe in the Father and the Son but suggests that the Father has a different essence from Himself, yet similar in power, speaking against the essence of the Son and denying that the Son is truly God, let them be cursed.
Heretics deceitfully confessing the Father and the Son are refuted for denying the Son's distinction from the Father due to similarity in nature.
These heretics often evade the truth by mixing and confusing words, capturing the ears of the unwary with familiar terms, acknowledging the Father and the Son in name only, not in the truth of their natural essence.
They know that God is called the Father of all creation and remember that all the saints are called the sons of God.
By this logic, they confess the Father and the Son according to common names, so they are called Father and Son rather than truly being so.
They are said to be, but are not, if there is a distinct nature of differing essence, since the truth of the paternal name can only come from the offspring of its nature.
Therefore, the Father cannot be called the father of a substance that is alien and different from Himself, because perfect birth does not involve a discordant diversity of original substance.
Thus, all impiety is rejected, which speaks of the Father as not the father of a son born from His own nature.
For God will not be called Father if He has a creation similar in power and effectiveness, but if He has begotten a nature not different from His own essence, because natural birth does not accept a diversity of paternal nature.
For this reason, cursed are those who claim that the Father is the father of a nature different from His own, as if something other than God is born from God, and they think that the essence of the Father degenerated in the Son by generation.
For they destroy, as much as they can, the unbegotten and unchangeable essence of the Father, who dared to introduce a dissimilarity of a degenerate natural essence in the birth of His Only Begotten.

If anyone believes the Son is similar in essence to the Father and claims the Son is the same as the Father, or a part of the Father, or originates through emanation or passion like human sons from a non-physical Father, let him be accursed.
All forms of deception are guarded against, and no opportunity for fraud is allowed.
Many heretics assert that the Son is similar in divinity to the Father, suggesting that this likeness means the Father is the same as the Son, because indistinct likeness seems to imply uniqueness and singularity.
What does not differ in kind appears to remain united in nature.
The Son, being born, is not the same as the Father, nor something entirely different from the Father.
They propose that the Son is distinct from the Father due to their personal differences.
But birth does not support this fiction; for union does not involve birth.
What is born has a father of its birth.
Although the divinity of the one born from the begetter is indistinct, he is not both the begetter and the begotten; as they must remain distinct from each other, and the begotten cannot be unlike the begetter.
Therefore, accursed is he who claims the similarity of nature between the Father and the Son erases the personal significance of the Son: because when nothing differs from something else through mutual likeness, the likeness itself, without achieving union, acknowledges the Father and the Son, as the Son is the unchanging likeness of the Father.
The Son is not a part of the Father, so it cannot be said that the born and the begetter are the same.
Nor is it an emanation, where a continuous flow through a physical and individual path retains the same flow at its origin, being its own origin through an ongoing series and course.
It is a perfect birth, maintaining the likeness of nature: not conceived and born through a physical birth, but existing as an incorporeal Son from an incorporeal Father through the likeness of the same nature.

And if anyone, because the Father is never understood to be the Son, and the Son is never understood to be the Father, speaks of the Son as different from the Father, because the Father is one and the Son is another, as it is said, "There is another who bears witness about me, and the Father who sent me" John 5:32, due to this holy understanding of the distinctness of the Father and the Son in the Church, fearing that the Son and the Father might ever be understood as the same, does not say that the Son is like the Father even according to essence: let them be accursed.
How carefully two heresies against God's Son were defeated.
It was said to the Apostles of the Lord: "Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves" Matthew 10:16.
Through this, He wanted the nature of living creatures that differ from each other to be in us: but in such a way that the cunning of the serpent would be tempered by the innocence of the dove, and the innocence of the dove would be guided by the wisdom of the serpent; so that there would be both simple wisdom and wise simplicity: which command has been kept in the explanation of this faith.
For the previous statement we discussed took care that, through the similarity of essence, a personal union would not be proclaimed;
nor would the indifference of nature destroy the birth of the Son;
and that there would not be one solitary being for us in understanding, because one would not differ from the other in kind:
but the following statement again met that wisdom of the serpent, to which we are urged to conform with the simplicity of the dove, through simple and apostolic wisdom;
lest perhaps, because personal union is not accepted, since the Father is one and the Son is another, a preaching of dissimilar nature could arise again:
lest when one is the sender and another is the one sent (since the sent and the sender are not the same), it might be thought that the sent and the sender are of separate and dissimilar natures, when the born and the begetter cannot be of different essences.
Therefore, in the Father and the Son, the similarity of an undifferentiated nature is retained through the essence of birth:
yet it does not bring harm to the person, so that the one who is sent and the one who sends are the same, the similarity of nature.

Neither does the uniqueness of the person mean he can be called both the Son and the Father, nor does it take away the likeness of nature.
Thus, the truth of birth supports the likeness of essence, and this likeness does not lose the personal truth of birth.
Similarly, the distinction between the begetter and the begotten does not exclude their likeness of essence; although they cannot be the same, they are not of different natures.
If anyone ever interprets God the Father of the only begotten Son as existing within time, rather than beyond time and beyond human understanding, claiming that the only begotten Son existed without suffering, they stray from the evangelical message.
This message, which omits the time interval between the Father and the Son, teaches us that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John 1:1: let him be accursed.
The Father is not bound by time.
The Gospel tells us the Son exists beyond just being born.
It is a sacred belief that the Father is not confined by time, for the truth of his timeless nature surpasses all understanding.
Although the very name of the Father, which religiously acknowledges the impassible origin of the one being born, is not limited by time, because the eternal and infinite God the Father cannot be seen as temporal.
According to the evangelical message, the only begotten God the Word is known to be with God in the beginning, beyond just being born.
If anyone claims that the Father is older than the Son or that the Son is younger than the Father: let him be accursed.
The Son, as the image of the Father, is not younger than him.
Since God has always been the Father, he has always been the Father, and always the Son.
The likeness of essence, configured in kind, is also taught as indifferent to time.
This ensures that the one who is the image of God, the Word, who is God with God in the beginning, and who is like the Father, has no temporal division from the Father, maintaining his perfection as the image, the Word, and God.

If he is indeed declared to be younger in time, he loses both the truth of the image and likeness, because a likeness cannot exist if it is different in time.
Since God the Father is timeless, He cannot have any sense of time; otherwise, He wouldn't be the Father. Similarly, the Son cannot be bound by time, or else He wouldn't be the Son.
That's why the Father is not said to be older than the Son, nor the Son younger than the Father, because the truth of both names exists only together.
If anyone attributes the timeless nature of the only begotten Son to the unbegotten essence of God, suggesting the Son is the Father, let him be anathema.
The Son, although timeless, is not unbegotten.
The earlier definition seemed to give heretics a chance, since it denied the time of the Son's birth, as it would be blasphemous if the Father were subject to time; however, He would be if the Son were.
By denying time, there was a risk that the Father, who is unbegotten, would be seen as both Father and Son, under the name of the Son.
Where the time of birth is excluded, the idea of being unbegotten seems accepted, suggesting that one whose birth is not in time might not be thought to be born.
Therefore, to prevent this heresy of union from emerging due to the denial of time, this impiety is condemned, which attempts to link the timeless birth to the unique and sole substance of the unbegotten essence.
Being timeless is different from being unborn; one can be born outside of time, while the other is eternally self-existent.
The reason for these definitions. Explanation as applied by Hilary. By whom their subscription was extorted. A summary of these.
We have reviewed, beloved Brothers, all the definitions of faith published by the Eastern bishops, which they established in a synod gathered among themselves against the recently emerging heresy.

We did our best to tailor our explanations to their level of understanding, using their words instead of imposing our own. They make decisions based on their conscience and long-held beliefs, resisting any new and irreverent ideas. They even compelled those who had endorsed or accepted the heresy at Sirmium to admit their ignorance and agree to these decrees.
The Son is the perfect image of the Father, and through the mystery of this image, the Son remains, ensuring the Father endures as well. When the Son is declared the image of the Father, it signifies no difference in substance from Him. The life that the Father possesses and the Son receives signifies no difference in their essence.
The Son is not a created being but shares the same substance as the Father. Just as there is no difference in power between them, their essence remains the same. The Father, in generating the Son, does not diminish Himself through any difference in nature. Despite the likeness in their nature, the distinction in their names-Father and Son-precludes them from being one and the same.
It is rightly stated that the Father sends and the Son is sent, yet this does not imply any distinction in essence between them. The truth of the Father's identity is timeless, and the Son is not subsequent to the Father in time. Beyond all time, the perfect birth of the Son does not allow for the misconception of Him not being born.
Decrees were issued at certain times, for specific reasons.

Faith sometimes changes. In fact, dear brothers, the teachings of faith that have been shared emerged recently among a few in the East, right around the time when you rejected the introduced heresy.
The reason for explaining it was that it was decided to remain silent about being of one substance. However, in earlier times, due to various reasons, it was necessary for other expressions of faith to be documented, and this can be understood from the nature of those writings.
When we know all that has been done by them, we can more easily and thoroughly bring about a religious and unity-conducive resolution to the matters we question.
The exposition of the church's faith, published in the year 341, was presented at the synod during the dedication of the Antiochene church's completion. Ninety-seven bishops were present, who explained this when one of the bishops was suspected of holding heretical views.
We believe, following the evangelical and apostolic tradition, in one God, the Father almighty, the creator, maker, and provider of all things that exist, from whom everything comes; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son, God through whom all things were made, who was begotten from the Father.
God from God, whole from whole, one from one, perfect from perfect, king from king, Lord from Lord, the word, wisdom, life, true light, true way, resurrection, shepherd, gate, unchangeable and immutable, the unchangeable image of divinity, essence, power, and glory, the firstborn of all creation, who always existed in the beginning with God as the Word and God, as it is said in the Gospel, "And the Word was God" (John 1:1), through whom all things were made, and in whom everything holds together:
Who in the last days descended from above and was born of a virgin according to the Scriptures, and became the lamb, the mediator between God and humans, predestined for our faith, and the leader of life.
For he said: "For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me" (John 6:38).

He suffered, rose again for us on the third day, ascended into heaven, and now sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.
And in the Holy Spirit, who was given for comfort, sanctification, and completion to believers, just as the Lord Jesus Christ ordained the disciples, saying:
Go, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-eight, verse nineteen.
Clearly, the Father is truly the Father, the Son is truly the Son, and the Holy Spirit is truly the Holy Spirit. These names are not given lightly; they carefully signify the unique essence, order, and glory of each person, so they are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony.
Therefore, with this faith, and having it from the beginning to the end in the sight of God and Christ, we anathematize every heretical and wicked sect.
If anyone teaches outside the sound Scriptures and true faith, saying anything about time, space, or age before the Son was begotten: let them be accursed.
And if anyone claims the Son is a creation, like any other creation; or a birth, as births are; or a making, like creations are, and not as the divine Scriptures have handed down; and if anyone teaches or preaches anything other than what we have received: let them be accursed.
For we truly and with reverence believe and follow all that has been handed down in the divine Scriptures by the prophets and the apostles.
This faith, perhaps, seems less explicit in speaking of the similar essence of the Father and the Son, especially when it emphasizes the proper essence, order, and glory of each named person in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so they are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony.
After the purpose of the council, a new heresy arose following the Nicene synod.

The Easterners have accurately named the three substances of the Trinity.
First, it's important to know that a gathering in Antioch wasn't held against the heresy claiming the Father and the Son were of dissimilar substance, but rather against the heresy that, after the holy council of Nicaea, tried to introduce three names for the Father.
We'll delve into this topic further later on.
At the beginning of my discourse, I asked for the patience and understanding of those reading and listening, urging them to wait until all my words were spoken, so no one would judge me prematurely without fully grasping my speech.
Therefore, the holy council aimed to eliminate the falsehoods distorting the truth of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by the number of names:
ensuring that, without specific reasons for each name, the threefold naming wouldn't falsely unify under one name, where the Father alone would bear both the name of the Holy Spirit and the Son.
For this reason, they declared there to be three substances, teaching that the persons exist through substances, without separating the substance of the Father and the Son through dissimilar essence.
As it was stated: The idea that they may be three in substance and one in harmony isn't disputed, because when the Spirit, known as the Paraclete, is named, it's more fitting to preach unity through harmony rather than through essence by the similarity of substance.
This formula proclaims the same essence of the Father and the Son.
It distinguishes between birth and unbegottenness.
The Son is immutable.
However, the entire previous discourse didn't differentiate the Father and the Son by any diversity of essence or nature.
When it's said, God from God, whole from whole, there's no doubt that the whole God is born from the whole God.
Indeed, the nature of God from God doesn't differ: and the whole from the whole is in those to whom the Father belongs.
One from one excludes the sufferings of human birth and conception:
ensuring that, while one is from one, he isn't from elsewhere, nor different, or other, but is one from one, perfect from perfect.

There's no difference in origin between birth and unbegottenness; both are equally perfect. A King from a King. The power, referred to by the same name, doesn't admit any difference in power. Lord from Lord. The rule is also equal in the Lord: there's no difference in the confessed dominion in both without diversity.
That, after many other things, is stated as immutable and unchangeable-an unchangeable image of divinity, essence, power, and glory-is absolute. For God from God, whole from whole, one from one, perfect from perfect, king from king, and Lord from Lord, with all the glory and nature of divinity in which the Father remains, the Son is also born and subsists; He also has this from the paternal substance, so that He is not changeable.
For in His birth, the nature from which He was born wasn't changed, but the Son obtained unchangeable essence from the unchangeable authority of nature. For although He is an image, He is an unchangeable image, not altered through dissimilarity in the paternal essence from which He was begotten, because the image of the paternal essence would be born in Him.
Indeed, when He is taught to be the firstborn of all creation, He is also called the Word of God, who was always with God in the beginning. While He is firstborn, He is shown to be born; while He always existed, He is not separated from the Father by time.
Therefore, there can be no seen division of substances, note, by this synod, which aimed at nothing else but to exclude the union through the term of three substances with a triple name introduced to separate a different substance in the Son and in the Father. Since the whole exposition of faith distinguishes neither the Father and the Son, unbegotten and only-begotten, by time, nor by name, nor by essence, nor by dignity, nor by dominion.
It is also worthy of common conscience to recognize the other faiths written by the same Eastern bishops in different places and times, so that through multiple confessions, the sincerity of conscience can be understood.

Faith According to the Synod of the East

The holy synod gathered at Sardica from various provinces of the Eastern regions: Thebaid, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Paphlagonia, Galatia, Bithynia, Hellespont, Asia, the two Phrygias, Pisidia, the islands of the Cyclades, Pamphylia, Caria, Lydia, Europe, Thrace, Emimontus, Mysia, the two Pannonias, has declared this faith.
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, creator and maker of all things, from whom every fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named.
We also believe in his only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, through whom all things were made in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible: who is the Word, and wisdom, and power, and life, and true light.
And who in the last days for us was incarnate, born of the holy Virgin, crucified, died, was buried, and rose from the dead on the third day. He was received into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and is coming to judge the living and the dead, to give to each according to their works; whose kingdom will continue without end in the endless ages.
For he sits at the right hand of the Father not only in this age but also in the one to come.
We also believe in the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom, after returning to heaven, he sent to the Apostles to teach them and remind them of everything, through whom the souls of those who sincerely believe in him are sanctified.
However, those who say that the Son of God is from non-existent things, or from another substance, and not from God, and that there was a time or age when he was not, the holy and catholic Church recognizes as strangers.

Similarly, those who claim there are three gods, or that Christ is not God and has not existed forever, or that Christ is not the Son of God, or that He is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, or that the Son is unbegotten, or that the Father begot the Son neither by decision nor by will: these individuals are condemned by the holy and catholic Church.
This faith establishes the eternal origin of the Son, asserting His origin from the very substance of God.
The exposition of this faith is concise but employs comprehensive definitions. It condemns those who claim the Son came from non-existent things, assigning Him an origin that is enduring and not begun.
To ensure it is understood that this origin, from which He was born and remains, is nothing other than the substance of God, it declares as blasphemous those who say the Son was born from any other substance and not from God.
Therefore, since He was not made from nothing, nor from anywhere other than God, it is beyond doubt that what exists is of God. The essence of the only begotten Son is not generated from non-existent things or from anything other than the unbegotten and eternal substance of the Father.
It also rejects intervals of time and ages, so that He who does not differ by nature cannot be separated by time.
God is only one; how can many be spoken of? The faith mentioned above proclaims the one substance of the Father and the Son. In every possible way, wherever concerns might arise, all approaches of the heretics are blocked so that no diversity is proclaimed in the Son.
It condemns those who say there are three gods because, according to the truth of nature, this substance does not accept a number of names unless, as it is in humans and angels, where a name is given from the honor of merits, yet the substance differs between them and God. Therefore, there are many gods. However, in the nature of God, there is only one God; yet the Son is also God because His nature is not different. And since God is from God, both must be God, whose essence is not distinguished by any difference in kind.

The significance of the name is overlooked in naming because there's no variation in nature's quality.
Thus, it's a curse to invoke gods or deny the Son as God, clearly showing that the shared name represents a substance that is consistent in its attributes.
In acknowledging God the Father, who was not born, and God the Son, the only begotten, since neither differs in essence, both are God, yet God is to be believed and declared as one.
Therefore, with great care and diligence, the bishops' faith emphasizes the sameness in nature between the begotten and the begetter, reinforcing the unity of the name.
However, faith doesn't rightly teach that the solitary God is the Son, who is born of will.
Yet, to prevent the proclamation of one God from affirming the solitary God's substance as unique and without offspring, it immediately rejects this rashness, which would, because God is one, confess one solitary God the Father, embodying both the Father and Son.
Since in the generating Father and the born Son, God would be declared one due to their nature's substance being identical.
The holy faith does not recognize the Son as unbegotten, as the nature of the Son is inherently linked to birth.
Moreover, His nature is so perfectly of birth that He, being born from God's substance, is also born from His will and counsel.
For from will and counsel, not from physical nature, the absolute perfection of God's essence, born from God's essence, is fulfilled.
Therefore, it's appropriate to reconsider the faith that wasn't recorded long ago when Photinus was removed from his bishopric.

We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, creator and originator, from whom every fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named.
And in His only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was born from the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, through whom all things were made in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.
He is the Word, the wisdom, the power, the life, and the true light, who in the last days became incarnate for us, was born of the holy Virgin, was crucified, died, and was buried.
He also rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come at the end of the world to judge the living and the dead and to repay each according to their deeds, with a kingdom that endures forever.
He will be at the right hand of the Father, not only in this world but also in the future.
And in the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom He promised to the Apostles after He ascended to heaven, sent to teach them and remind them of everything, through whom the souls of those who sincerely believe in Him are sanctified.
One. But those who say: The Son is from nothing, or from another substance, and not from God; and that there was a time or age when He did not exist: the holy and catholic Church knows them to be strangers.
Two. If anyone says that the Father and the Son are two gods: let them be accursed.
Three. And if anyone, saying there is one God, does not confess that Christ, the God before ages, was the Son of God obedient to the Father in the creation of all things: let them be accursed.
Four. And if anyone dares to say that the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary: let them be accursed.
Five. And if anyone says that the Son is from Mary according to foreknowledge or predestination, and not born from the Father before ages, and through whom all things were made: let them be accursed.
Six. If anyone says that the substance of God expands and contracts: let them be accursed.
Seven.

If anyone claims that the Son of God is a spread-out substance or refers to the width of His substance as the Son, let them be cursed.
If anyone describes the Son of God as an implanted or spoken word, let them be cursed.
If anyone says that the Son born of Mary is merely a man, let them be cursed.
If anyone suggests that God and the man born of Mary perceives God as unbegotten in this manner, let them be cursed.
If anyone hears The Word became flesh (John 1:14) and believes the Word was transformed into flesh or took on flesh through change, let them be cursed.
If anyone hears that the only Son of God was crucified and claims His divinity experienced corruption, suffering, change, diminishment, or death, let them be cursed.
If anyone interprets Let us make man (Genesis 1:26) as not being spoken by the Father to the Son, but rather that God spoke to Himself, let them be cursed.
If anyone argues that the Son was not seen by Abraham (Genesis 18), but instead the unbegotten God or a part of Him, let them be cursed.
If anyone claims that Jacob did not wrestle with the Son as a man (Genesis 32:24), but with the unbegotten God or a part of Him, let them be cursed.
If anyone does not interpret The Lord rained from the Lord (Genesis 19:24) as referring to the Son and the Father, but believes He rained from Himself, let them be cursed. For the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father.
If anyone calls the Lord and Lord, Father and Son (since the Lord from the Lord), two gods, let them be cursed. We do not equate the Son with the Father or compare them but understand Him as subordinate. For He did not descend into Sodom without the Father's will; nor did He rain from Himself, but from the Lord, by the authority of the Father; nor does He sit at the right hand by Himself, but hears the Father saying, Sit at my right hand (Psalm 110:1).
If anyone claims the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one person, let them be cursed.
If anyone refers to the Holy Spirit as the paraclete and claims He is the unbegotten God, let them be cursed.

If anyone, as the Lord taught us, does not recognize that the Advocate is distinct from the Son, for He said, "And the Father will send you another Advocate, whom I will ask" John 14:16, let them be cursed.
If anyone claims that the Holy Spirit is a part of the Father or the Son, let them be cursed.
If anyone asserts that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three gods, let them be cursed.
If anyone interprets the words, "I am the first God, and I am the last God, and besides me, there is no God" Isaiah 44:6, in a way that undermines the only-begotten God before the ages, let them be cursed.
If anyone claims that the Son is created by the will of God as if He were merely a part of creation, let them be cursed.
If anyone says that the Son was born against the will of the Father, let them be cursed.
For the Father was neither compelled against His will nor driven by necessity to beget the Son when He did not desire to.
But as soon as He willed, He showed that He begot Him from Himself, without time and without suffering.
If anyone claims the Son is unbegotten and without beginning, suggesting two without beginning, two unbegotten, and two uncreated, making two gods, let them be cursed.
For the Head, which is the beginning of all, is the Son; the Head, which is the beginning of Christ, is God.
Thus, we refer all things to the one who is without beginning, the beginning of all, through the Son.
And again, affirming the understanding of Christianity, we say that if anyone does not acknowledge that Christ is God, the Son of God, existing before the ages and serving the Father for the perfection of all things, but claims that from the time He was born of Mary, He was named Christ and Son, and began to be God, let them be cursed.
The many deceptions of Photinus are refuted.

The Son is not different from the Father in substance or time.
As the situation evolved, those gathered found it necessary to provide a more detailed explanation of faith, addressing multiple questions.
This was because the heresy revived by Photinus was attempting to infiltrate the Catholic Church in various subtle ways.
This was done so that every form of pure and unblemished faith could stand against each type of heretical deception, matching every affirmation of faith to the opportunities for treachery.
Following that comprehensive explanation of the sacraments, the foundation for explaining faith against heretics began here.
But those who claim that the Son comes from nonexistence, or from another substance and not from God, and that there was a time when he did not exist, are considered outsiders by the holy and Catholic Church.
What room is there for ambiguity here?
What remains of the conscience of sincere faith?
The Son is not from nonexistent things, ensuring he does not have an origin from nothingness.
He does not originate from any other substance except that of God, so nothing else is inherent in him but all that is of God.
Since he does not originate from nothing, he does not derive his existence from elsewhere.
He does not differ in time, making the Son timeless with the Father.
Therefore, everything is inseparable between the unbegotten Father and the only-begotten Son, as the equality in time, through the very sameness of the existing Father from whom the nativity is derived, does not distinguish them in essence.
If anyone claims that the Father and the Son are two gods, let them be accursed.
And if anyone, while professing there is one God, does not acknowledge that Christ, before the ages, as the Son of God, obeyed the Father in the creation of all things, let them be accursed.
Just as they are one in essence, they are also one in the kind of essence.
The devout profession of the name provides us with complete understanding of these matters.

It's important to understand that while it's wrong to claim the Father and the Son are two separate gods, it's also incorrect to deny that the Son is God. So, when discussing two gods, we exclude the idea of different substances that are separate from each other.
There's no other essence besides that of God the Father, from which the eternal Son of God is born.
Although we must acknowledge God the Father and proclaim Christ, the Son of God, as God, recognizing two gods is considered irreligious.
They can only be one in essence because their essence is singular.
If anyone claims that the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary, let them be anathema.
The Son and the Father are not the same person.
This contradicts those who say the Son only existed before Mary through predestination.
To prevent heretics from saying the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary due to differences in the named essence of the Father and the Son, a decisive judgment was made that whoever confesses this is anathema.
The unity of the name, based on the essence of an undifferentiated nature, doesn't eliminate the personhood of the begotten essence, so the substance of the one unique God is understood through the unity of the name.
The name of both essences, that is, the one God, is proclaimed because of the indistinguishable substance of their undifferentiated nature.
If anyone says that the Son existed only through foreknowledge and predestination before Mary, and was not born of the Father before all ages, and that all things were made through Him, let them be anathema.

The Son of God, our God of all, before being born in the flesh, is understood not to exist according to foreknowledge and predestination, rather than according to the essence of His existing nature.
This is due to the Father's foreknowledge, as He predestined Him to exist at a specific time, specifically to be born of a virgin.
He was announced to us, rather than existing from eternity in the substance of divine nature.
All the things He spoke through the prophets about the mysteries of His incarnation and passion were spoken by the Father according to the foreknowledge about Him.
Therefore, the perversity of this doctrine is condemned, which claims that the only-begotten Son of God is known to us, born from the Father before all ages, and creating the ages themselves with all creatures, rather than predestined to be born.
If anyone says the substance of God can expand or contract, let them be anathema.
Expansion and contraction do not apply to God.
Neither is the Son an expansion of divine substance.
Contracting and expanding are physical experiences, but God, who is spirit and moves as He wills, does not expand or contract Himself through a change of substance.
Remaining free beyond the necessity of physical nature, He provides what He wills, when He wills, and where He wills, from Himself.
Therefore, it is impious to attribute a change of substance to such a great power's freedom.
If anyone says that the Son makes the substance of God expand, or calls the breadth of His substance the Son, let them be anathema.
The previous statement, even if it intended to teach about the unchangeable God, set the stage for this subsequent heresy.
For some have dared to extend the unborn God up to the holy Virgin by an expansion of substance, suggesting that the breadth drawn out by a certain aspect of His nature, assuming man, might be called the Son.
Nor was the Son, perfect God before all ages, later born as man.
The whole of this the Catholic faith condemns, in which the Father is said to be changeable, and the born Son is denied.

If anyone claims that the Son, the Word of God, is merely an implanted or expressed word: let them be cursed.
How heretics proclaim the Son of God as the Word.
The Son from Mary is God and man.
Heretics, as much as they can, deny the Son of God, asserting that he is merely a word, specifically a spoken word from the mouth of a speaker, and an incorporeal sound of a non-substantial voice. They claim that for God the Father, the Son is this kind of word, expressed in sound through our inherent nature of speaking.
Therefore, this entire deceit is condemned: claiming the Word of God, which was in the beginning with God, is just like a word of implanted and expressed speech.
If anyone says that the Son from Mary is only a man: let them be cursed.
We proclaim the Son of God from Mary as both man and God. But to ensure what we proclaim as God and man does not become an opportunity for deceit, it is immediately added:
If anyone says that God and man born from Mary, understanding God to be unbegotten: let them be cursed.
The Son is distinguished from the Father only by birth. Taking on flesh, he was not changed.
The substance retains its name and power.
Since it is cursed to say the Son of God from Mary is a man without God; and it is under the same judgment to say that in man God is unbegotten: it is not said that God, who is in man, is not God; but the unbegotten God is denied, distinguished from the Father by the Son not by the name of nature, because there is no diversity of substance, but only by the authority of being unbegotten.
If anyone hearing "The Word became flesh," thinks that the Word was transformed into flesh or says that it took on flesh by changing: let them be cursed.
The deity did not suffer corruption when the Son of God was crucified.
The dignity of divinity is preserved: so that in what "The Word became flesh" means, while the Word became flesh, it did not lose what it was as the Word through the flesh, nor was it transformed into flesh, so that it would cease to be the Word; rather, the Word became flesh, so that the flesh would begin to be what the Word is.

Otherwise, how could the flesh possess virtues in its actions, find glory on the mountain, understand the thoughts of human hearts, offer security in suffering, and embody life in death? Yet, God, who undergoes no change, lost none of His goodness when He became flesh.
12.
If anyone hears that the only Son of God was crucified and claims that His divinity suffered corruption, changeability, alteration, diminishment, or destruction: let them be cursed.
49.
What suffering and passion mean.
The Son appeared to the fathers.
It is clearly shown why the Word, even though it became flesh, was not transformed into flesh. While these forms of suffering affect the weakness of the flesh, God, the Word made flesh, could not be altered by suffering. Suffering and being changed are not the same because suffering of any kind changes the perception, pain, and endurance of all flesh. However, the Word that became flesh, although it subjected itself to suffering, was not altered by the ability to suffer. It could endure suffering, but it was not subject to the ability to suffer because the ability to suffer indicates a weak nature; whereas suffering is the endurance of inflicted things. Since God is unchangeable, when the Word became flesh, it contained the potential for suffering without the weakness of the ability to suffer. Therefore, the nature remains unchangeable even in suffering, because it originates from a substance that is indifferent to its Creator, from an impassible essence.
13.
If anyone says that the words "Let us make man" (Genesis 1:26) were not spoken by the Father to the Son, but that God spoke to Himself: let them be cursed.
14.
If anyone does not say that the Son appeared to Abraham (Genesis 17:1), but instead says it was the unbegotten God or a part of Him: let them be cursed.
15.
If anyone says that it was not the Son who wrestled with Jacob as a man (Genesis 32:26), but the unbegotten God or a part of Him: let them be cursed.
16.
If anyone does not understand "The Lord rained from the Lord" (Genesis 19:24) to refer to the Son and the Father, but says that He rained from Himself: let them be cursed.
For the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father.
50.

Photinus' Opinion.
Because Photinus, against whom the meeting was convened, denied these things, they needed to be added to the faith.
This was to ensure that no one would dare to proclaim the Son of God merely as the son of the virgin, and to prevent attributing all the superior qualities, unique to the Son of God, solely to God the Unbegotten, in a foolish display of heretical madness.
While referring these things to the Father, they would deny the substance to the Son.
Since these issues have been resolved, they left us no need to interpret them further.
If anyone says that there are two gods, referring to Lord and Lord, Father and Son, because the Lord is from the Lord, let them be accursed.
We do not make the Son equal or comparable to the Father; rather, we understand Him to be subject.
He did not descend to Sodom without the Father's will; nor did He rain down on His own, but from the Lord, with the authority of the Father.
Nor does He sit at the right hand by Himself, but hears the Father saying, "Sit at my right hand" (Psalm One Hundred Nine, verse one).
This definition is free from suspicion.
The Son, while not equated with the Father, maintains the equality of nature.
Both the preceding and following statements completely exclude any suspicion that might arise from these words, ensuring that a diversity of dissimilar deities is not preached in referring to Lord and Lord.
In this, He is not compared, because it is impious to claim there are two gods.
But this does not mean the Son is not compared or equated with the Father, lest He be considered not to be God Himself.
Since it is anathema to deny Christ as God, it cannot be deemed profane to name two gods, so that Christ might also be preached as God.
By the property of natural essence, therefore, there is one God, because from God the Father, who is one God, the only begotten Son, God is born.
He has no other source than from God, that He is what God is.
Because of the indistinguishable essence of Him who is begotten from Him who begot, there cannot be an indifferent single name of nature.

In this significant way, the Son is neither compared nor equated with the Father while he remains subject through obedience. The Lord reigns by the Lord's will, not from himself, as per Photinus or Sabellius. He sits at the right hand of God when he is told to sit. He is sent, he receives, and in all things, he follows the will of the one who sent him.
However, this submission in piety does not diminish his essence, nor does religious duty degrade his nature. Thus, both the unbegotten Father is God, and the only begotten Son of God is God, yet there is one God. The submission of the Son is taught alongside his dignity, even as he is called Son. Although it is of God the Father, it is still a name by nature. Having this name, he submits to the Father both in obedience and in name, demonstrating that the submission bears witness to the natural essence.
If anyone says the Father and the Son are one person: let him be accursed.
The Father and the Son are not one person. Absolute perversity doesn't require contradiction, yet some have dared to claim one person from two names.
If anyone says the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is the unbegotten God: let him be accursed.
The Holy Spirit is not the unbegotten God. He is distinct from the Son. Claiming the Comforter as the unbegotten God is subject to anathema. It is impious to say that the unbegotten God is the one sent by the Son for our consolation.
If anyone, as the Lord taught us, does not say the Comforter is other than the Son; for he said: And he will send you another Comforter, whom I will ask the Father: let him be accursed.
We remember that the Comforter was sent by the Son, and this is what faith initially explained. Yet, because the Son often said through the power of indistinguishable nature that his works are the works of the Father, saying: I do the works of my Father.

He will also send the Comforter, as he often promised. Sometimes he mentioned that the Comforter would be sent by the Father, as he usually referred all his actions to the Father.
This has led some heretics to claim that he himself is the Son, the Comforter. However, by saying another Comforter will be sent by the Father, he highlights the distinction between the one sending and the one being asked.
If anyone claims that the Holy Spirit is a part of the Father or the Son, let them be anathema.
The Holy Spirit is not a part of the Father or the Son.
The absurdity of heretical thinking has made it necessary to clarify this, not as a question.
Since the name of the Holy Spirit has its own meaning, and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, has his own substance, role, and order, and since the Father and Son are consistently described as unchangeable, how can the Holy Spirit be considered a part of either the Father or the Son?
But because this idea is often put forward by the impious, it had to be rejected by the holy ones.
If anyone says the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three gods, let them be anathema.
The concept of three gods is denied.
Claiming two gods is irreligious, as we remember and proclaim that only one God is acknowledged everywhere.
How much more condemnable is the notion of three gods in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?
Because heretics say this, Catholics rightly condemn it.
If anyone interprets the statement, 'I am the first God, and I am the last God, and besides me, there is no God' (Isaiah 44:6), as being solely against idols and false gods, in a Jewish sense against the only-begotten God before the ages, let them be anathema.
The phrase 'There is no God besides me' does not deny the Son as God.
With the multitude of gods condemned and only one God acknowledged, the Son of God cannot be denied as God.
Truly, this affirms the true essence of nature: the name, which is not meant to be numbered, belongs to essence. What is not God besides me cannot take away from the Son what is God, because there is no other God, except the one who is from God.

Through the voice of God the Father, it is impossible for Him not to be God, as He is born from His own essence.
This is why the Jews refer to the union with God, because they do not know the only-begotten God.
When we deny the existence of two gods, we reject any difference in the natural essence between the Father and the Son, because the phrase there is no God besides me dispels the false belief in other gods.
While confessing one God, we also identify the Son as God; we proclaim no difference in substance between the two under one name.
If anyone claims that the Son was created from the will of God as if He were just another creature, let them be cursed.
The Son is from God's substance, unlike creatures that come from His will.
God's will brought substance to all creatures, but He gave nature to the Son through a perfect birth from an unchanging and uncreated substance.
For all things were created as God intended; however, the Son, being born from God, exists just as God does.
Nature did not produce something unlike itself; born from God's substance, the Son carries the essence of nature according to origin, not according to creatures, from the will.
If anyone says the Son was born unwillingly by the Father, let them be cursed.
The Father was not forced or driven by any natural necessity to unwillingly beget the Son; rather, He desired it instantly, without time and without suffering, to present Him as the only-begotten from Himself.
Thus, the Son is not from an unwilling Father.
Since the Son is taught to exist not from will, like everything else, so that He might have essence not only according to will but also according to nature, it seemed to give heretics the chance to claim that God the Father had to generate the Son from Himself, as if compelled by natural law.
But this is not the condition of the Father in God: for in the indescribable and perfect birth of the Son, neither did will alone generate the Son, nor was the essence of natural law changed or coerced by command.

The essence wasn't created, nor is the nature of the creator different from what's created, and there's no solitude in the name of the Father in time.
Long before all times, the Father, from His own nature, willingly and without suffering, bestowed upon the Son the essence of a natural birth.
If anyone claims that the Son is unbegotten and without beginning, suggesting two beings without beginning, two unbegotten, and two gods, let them be accursed.
For the head, the beginning of all, is the Son, but the head of Christ is God.
Thus, we trace everything back to one unbegotten, the beginning of all, through the Son.
The unity of God doesn't permit the Son to be unbegotten.
Confessing the Son as unbegotten is deeply impious.
Then there wouldn't be one God: because the nature of the one unbegotten God requires that one God be proclaimed.
Therefore, since there is one God, there can't be two unbegotten beings: this is why God is one (since both the Father is God, and the Son of God is God), because unbegottenness belongs to one alone.
The Son is God because He exists from the essence of the unbegotten.
Therefore, holy faith rejects the idea of an unbegotten Son; so through one unbegotten God, one God is proclaimed.
The only-begotten nature, generated from the unbegotten essence, is encompassed in the name of the one unbegotten God.
For the Son is the head of all, but the head of the Son is God.
Everything is referred to one God by this order and confession: since all things begin from Him, of whom He Himself is the beginning, namely, God the Father.
Again, to affirm the understanding of Christianity, we say: if anyone does not acknowledge that Christ is God, the Son of God existing before the ages and serving the Father for the perfection of all, but claims that He was named Christ and Son only from the time He was born of Mary and began to be God then, let them be accursed.
The heresy of Photinus.
The main point of our faith.
It was necessary to conclude the condemnation of his heresy, for which the assembly was convened, with a full exposition of the faith it opposed; which falsely claimed that the Son of God began with the Virgin birth.

This is the main point of our faith according to the teachings of the gospel and the apostles:
Our Lord Jesus Christ, God and Son of God, should not be separated from the Father in any aspect-whether in honor, authority, substance, or time.
Sixty-two.
The challenge of discussing God in few words.
The truth has been pursued, as understood, through the guidance and opinions of bishops, and explained through individual written professions of faith, with every kind of impious proclamation extinguished.
For the infinite and immense God cannot be fully expressed or comprehended by the brief statements of human speech.
Often, the brevity of words misleads both listeners and teachers:
Conciseness can lead to misunderstanding, or the intended meaning can be distorted and not clearly resolved by reason.
Thus, with understanding, bishops have used many definitions and more abundant words to teach:
So that they might instill the truth through various distinctions for the listeners and avoid anything dangerous or obscure about divine matters in this multifaceted resolution of many opinions.
Sixty-three.
Faith in the East.
Frequently explained; sound in few.
Hosius.
Forced subscriptions of faith.
Westerners are unaware of written faiths.
It shouldn't seem strange to you, dearest brothers, that faith has been explained so frequently:
This necessity arises from the threat of heresy.
The danger in the Eastern Churches is so significant that it is rare to find priests or people of this faith, which you should assess for yourselves.
Authority has been wrongly given to some for impiety:
And with the exile of bishops, whose cause you are aware of, the strength of the profane has increased.
I am not speaking of foreign matters, nor am I writing about unknown things:
I have witnessed the faults of the present, not of laypeople, but of bishops.

Without Bishop Eleusius and a few others with him, most of the ten provinces of Asia, where I live, do not truly know God. I almost wish they didn't know Him at all; it would be easier to forgive them for ignorance than for opposition. But the distress of these bishops cannot be contained, and they seek the unity of faith that they lost long ago through others.
The initial faith presented had this necessity because at Sirmium, through forgetting his actions and words, Hosius introduced a new and long-simmering doctrine of impiety. I won't dwell on him, leaving him to judgment so it may be known what kind of person he was before. Everywhere you look, there are scandals, schisms, and betrayals.
As a result, some who had previously written otherwise were compelled to subscribe to a profession of faith. I don't criticize the most patient Eastern bishops, for whom the profession of faith, following the intention of blasphemy, was sufficient. It seems a cause for rejoicing that in such heretical stubbornness among blaspheming bishops, someone is welcomed as repentant.
But in the midst of these things, blessed and glorious are you in the Lord, who maintain the perfect and apostolic faith with a clear conscience, and have not required written professions of faith until now! You did not need the letter because you were abundant in spirit. Nor did you desire to write it down, for what you believed in your heart, you professed with your mouth for salvation.
You did not need to read from a bishop what newly baptized believers held. But necessity led to the custom of explaining and subscribing to faith. Where the sense of conscience is at risk, that's where the letter is necessary. And surely, there is no hindrance in writing what is beneficial to confess.
Hilary's faith concerning the Father and the Son: We indeed confess, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, always innocent, and willingly write, not of two gods, but of one God: and not without acknowledging God the Son of God; for He is God from God.

There aren't two who are unbegotten, because by the authority of being unbegotten, God is one.
This doesn't mean the Only Begotten isn't God; in fact, his origin is from the unbegotten substance.
While they aren't one being, their substance isn't different.
The name of God isn't applied to different natures, but to the indistinguishable essence of one name and nature.
No one is superior to the other in terms of substance, but one is subject to the other by the nature of birth.
The Father is greater because He is the Father, and the Son isn't lesser because He is the Son.
The meaning differs, but the nature doesn't.
The Father isn't confined by time, yet the Son isn't denied being coeternal with the Father.
The Father is proclaimed in the Son because the Son has nothing dissimilar to the Father: the Son is confessed in the Father because what the Son is comes from nowhere else.
They're aware of their mutual and similar nature because they are equal; they don't think they are one because they are one; they are proclaimed as one through the consistency of their indistinguishable nature, so they aren't a single being.
Words may fail Hilary, but not the meaning.
I've explained, dear ones, as much as human language allows, and the Lord, as He knows, has always granted my prayers, the conscience of common faith.
And if anything is lacking, indeed because almost nothing has been said, remember it's not the meaning but the words that fail me.
Perhaps I may criticize my nature in this, but I don't criticize my will: and I forgive my nature if it cannot speak of God as it wishes, for it's sufficient for salvation to believe in the things of God.
He moves on to another part of the booklet.

Before reaching a conclusion, avoid making judgments.
As far as I know, neither my faith nor yours is at risk before God for five hundred years. I've shown you, as you requested, what the earlier faith was according to the Eastern bishops.
I'll briefly reiterate, as this represents the faith of only a few bishops among the many Eastern Churches.
I've also explained my beliefs about divine matters according to apostolic teaching.
It's important for you to understand, without any suspicion, the things that might lead us astray from the simplicity of truth, since there's no longer a reason to listen otherwise.
Although I'm not worried about being judged based on the entirety of the faith, I still hope to be judged fairly about myself, unless everything is resolved.
When "Homousion" is preached correctly,
many of us, dear brothers, declare that the Father and the Son are of one substance, but it's important to ensure this declaration is made with true piety.
This term holds both the conscience of faith and the potential for deceit.
If likeness in nature means not just form but essence, then we can faithfully proclaim one substance, provided we understand it as the likeness of nature's property.
This means their oneness signifies equality, not singularity.
By equality, I mean an indifference in likeness, so that likeness is seen as equality.
Thus, equality is termed one because it is equal.
However, claiming oneness does not imply a single entity.
Therefore, one substance is rightly proclaimed if it neither negates a distinct person nor divides one substance into two, maintaining that by nature and birth, it is so alike it's called one.

The same voice can be misinterpreted in three different ways.
When we say the Father and the Son are of one substance, implying they exist separately yet are one and the same under two different names:
we must not think of the Son as merely a name without acknowledging this unity, if we claim the same unique and singular essence for both the Father and the Son.
This misunderstanding can lead to the idea that the Father is divided from himself, separating a part of himself as the Son.
Heretics often assert this by claiming one substance, and they find our confession appealing because it can be vague and lead to error.
Another error suggests that when we say the Father and the Son are of one substance, it implies a prior substance from which they both derive equally:
thus suggesting three entities: one substance and two inheritors of that substance.
Just as two co-heirs share an inheritance that existed before them, two equals might appear to share a prior substance.
However, asserting a single substance for the Father and the Son might imply:
either one entity with two names, or a divided substance creating two incomplete substances, or a third prior substance used by both, thus called one because it was split into two.
In this case, where is the concept of birth? How do we understand the Father and the Son if they are seen more as a division or sharing of a prior substance rather than a natural birth?
Where can "Homousion" be safely affirmed?
With such significant dangers to faith, we must be careful with our language;
so that what is understood piously is not spoken impiously, and an innocent conscience does not become guilty due to heretical interpretations.
When a Catholic speaks of one substance of the Father and the Son, he should not begin with this concept:
nor consider it the most crucial aspect, as if without it, true faith cannot exist.

He confidently asserts one substance, having previously mentioned that the Father is unbegotten; the Son is born, existing from the Father and akin to the Father in power, honor, and nature.
He is subject to the Father as his source: he did not consider equality with God, in whose form he remained, as something to be seized; he was obedient unto death.
He is not from nothing, but is a birth.
He is not unbegotten, but coeternal.
He is not the Father, but is the Son from him.
He is not a part, but is whole.
He is not the author himself, but is an image: the image of God from God, born into God.
He is not a creature, but is God.
Not another God in the kind of substance, but one God through the essence of an identical substance.
God is not one person, but nature: because nothing different and dissimilar exists in the born and the begetter.
And after these explanations, by declaring one substance of the Father and the Son, he does not err: or by denying one substance, he already sins.
Let it not be preached simply and before other things.
Therefore, let no one think that one substance is denied by us: for its reasoning is shown so that it is not denied.
Let no one think that one substance should be preached in a brief and bare manner: so that it can be reverently said to be one substance.
For I do not hear, Christ was born of Mary; unless I also hear, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.
John 1:1
I do not hear, Christ was hungry; unless after forty days of fasting I hear, Man shall not live by bread alone.
Matthew 4:4
I do not hear, he was thirsty; unless I hear, Whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never thirst.
John 4:13
I do not hear, Christ suffered; unless I hear, Now is the time for the Son of Man to be glorified.
John 12:23
I do not hear, he died; unless I hear, he rose again.
Let us not present anything solitary from the divine sacraments to the suspicion of listeners and to the occasion of blasphemers.
Before the birth of the Son, before subjection, before the similarity of nature must be preached: so that it is not impiously preached that the Father and the Son are of one substance.

I don't understand why it's considered most important and necessary to proclaim something above all else that cannot be piously proclaimed first, and must impiously be denied afterward.
It can be spoken of piously, and it can also be left unsaid piously.
It's not, dear brothers, about denying that the Father and the Son share the same essence, but it shouldn't be preached irrationally either.
Let their essence be one due to the nature of their properties, not from division, union, or sharing.
We can piously say they share one essence, and we can also piously leave it unsaid.
You have their birth, you have their likeness.
Why do we hold onto the word suspiciously when we don't differ in understanding the matter?
Let us believe and say they share one essence; but through the nature of their properties, not suggesting an impious union.
Let it be one due to likeness, not isolation.
Is the term 'homoousios' less appropriate?
But perhaps likeness seems to hold little propriety in itself.
If this is the case, I ask how else can I equate one to another except through likeness?
Or is being similar not the same as being equal?
If I say one, it carries the suspicion of singularity; if I say similar, it implies an indifferent comparison.
Between similar and one, I ask what place equality holds, and I inquire whether it pertains more to likeness or isolation.
There is no equality in dissimilar things, nor is there likeness within one.
What's the difference between similar and equal, so that equal can again be distinguished from one?
Therefore, equals are not dissimilar, and what else can similarities be but equals, when there's no equality among dissimilar things?
Likeness of nature signifies perfect equality.
What likeness was to Moses, equality is to John.
Therefore, dear brothers, when we proclaim the Son to be like the Father in everything, we're proclaiming nothing other than equality.
Likeness signifies perfect equality, and this is to be understood from the holy Scriptures.

We read, "Adam lived for two hundred and thirty years, and he fathered a son in his own likeness and image, and named him Seth" (Genesis 5:3). I'm asking what kind of likeness and image Adam passed on to Seth. Remove the body's weaknesses, the beginning of conception, the pains of childbirth, and all human necessities: I question whether this likeness in Seth is different by nature from his creator, or if there was a different kind of essence in both, in case Seth, born of Adam, should not have a natural essence. But it is indeed the likeness of Adam, even if we deny it; because it is not a different nature.
The likeness of nature did not present a different kind of nature in Seth, because Seth was not born from elsewhere: thus likeness equates things themselves by the likeness of not indifferent essence. Therefore, every son, according to natural birth, is the equality of the father; because it is also the likeness of nature.
Blessed John teaches about the nature of the Father and the Son, which Moses says was the likeness in Seth and Adam, that this is the same equality of nature, for he says: "For this reason the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God" (John 5:18).
Why do we burden sluggish minds, weighed down by heavy sins, with the teachings and sayings of such great men, and tire dull and reckless minds against the indissoluble preachings of the impious? Through Moses, Seth is the likeness of Adam; through John, the Son is equal to the Father: and we seek something unknown between the Father and the Son, which nature does not accept. He is like the Father, he is the son of the Father, he was born of him: through this alone can it be piously proclaimed that they are one. Confessing likeness without equality is refuted.
Nor does it escape me, dearest Brothers, that there are some who, while confessing likeness, deny equality. But let them speak as they wish, and spread the poison of their blasphemy to the ignorant.

When people claim there's a difference between similarity and equality, I ask where this equality originates.
If the Son is similar to the Father in essence, virtue, glory, and time, I question why he isn't considered equal.
This was established in the early faith as a condemnation: anyone who claims the Father has a different essence from the Son should be cursed.
If, then, he did not give a nature different or dissimilar to the one he begot without passion, he could have only given his own essence.
Thus, similarity is a property, property is equality, and equality makes no difference.
What makes no difference is one; not by union of person, but by equality of nature.
The same virtue exists in both the Son and the Father.
Even though, both by common sense and divine authorities, it's understood there's no difference between similarity and equality, since according to Moses and John, the Son is both similar and equal to the Father:
let's see if the Lord, when the Jews were upset because he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal to God, actually taught that he is equal to God.
He said, "The Son can do nothing by himself, but only what he sees the Father doing" (John 5:19).
He distinguished the source by saying, "He cannot do anything by himself," signifying obedience when he added, "but only what he sees the Father doing."
It's not a difference in virtue to be unable to do anything unless he sees, because nature, rather than sight, provides virtue:
indeed, it's obedience, being able to do when he sees.
So, by the fact that he can do when he sees, he shows he doesn't receive virtue from sight, but assumes power by the authority of sight.
Therefore, the virtue of nature doesn't differ between the Father and the Son: this ability, which the Father has, is given not from an increase in nature, but from the example of the source.
Finally, the honor that submission preserved, the virtue of nature equaled.
For he submits: "For whatever he does, the Son does likewise" (John 5:19).
Isn't similarity equal?
It is indeed equal, even if we deny it: for he does the same things likewise.
Aren't things done similarly the same?

Do they not also embrace equality?
Or is there a difference between what is similar and what is equal, when things made in the same way are regarded as the same?
Unless perhaps someone argues that things which are the same are not equal, suggesting that similar things shouldn't be called equal: even though things made in a similar way are not only considered equal, but also seen as the same.
Homoeusion can rightly be stated.
Therefore, Brothers, the similarity of nature is free from any suspicion of insult. The Son cannot be seen as lacking the Father's nature simply because He is similar. There is no similarity unless it stems from the equality of nature; however, the equality of nature cannot exist unless it is one; truly one, not by unity of person, but by kind.
This is a pious faith, this is a religious understanding, this is a saving word. It is not to deny the one substance of the Father and the Son because He is similar, but to declare Him similar because they are one.
Explained, my dearest, with a faithful and pious understanding of one substance, known in Greek as homoousion, and similar substance, called homoeusion. Along with the pitfalls that can arise from either the misleading brevity or the risky nakedness of words now fully demonstrated: the remaining discussion must be directed to the holy Eastern bishops; so that, with no lingering doubts about our faith, any remaining suspicions from words may be clarified. They will pardon someone who speaks more openly with them from the faith of a shared conscience.
Praise to the Easterners for curbing heresy.
O men, truly devoted to apostolic and evangelical doctrine, whom the warmth of faith ignites in the deep darkness of heretical night!
What a great hope of restoring true faith you have brought by steadfastly repelling the bold attacks of deceit!
For previously, in obscurity and hidden corners, it was denied that the Lord Christ is by nature the Son of God. Lacking the essence of the Father, it was proclaimed that He originated with creatures from non-existence.

Now, with the declaration of public authority, heresy is emerging.
What was once whispered in secret is now openly boasted about as a victory.
How many hidden ways did it not try to infiltrate the Catholic Church before?
What secular powers did it not use with the lure of false religion?
Corrupt people went so far as to deceive the Emperor into listening, even though they did not dare to preach this publicly themselves.
They misled the unknowing king, preoccupied with wars, to expose the faith to treachery and impose a belief system on the Churches before they were reborn.
They forced opposing bishops and us into exile at will, imposing the necessity of impiety.
But let us continue to be exiled, as long as the truth starts to be preached.
Thanks to the Lord, through your advice, the Emperor recognized his ignorance and acknowledged that the error was not his but of those who encouraged him, through the judgments of your faith.
He exempted himself from the envy of impious will in the sight of God and men, and by honoring your delegation, he recognized the falsehood of those whose authority led him into envy, compelled by your declaration of his ignorance.
The authors of the Sirmian formula are always deceitful, but they are cleverly criticized and refuted.
Christ is one, not two.
The subscription of Valens and Ursacius is suspect.
I fear and believe, dear brothers, that they deceive, for they have always deceived.
Even the current subscription contains falsehood.
They excuse themselves, wanting the terms "homoousion" and "homoiousion" to be silent, claiming both words mean the same thing.
I believe the bishops are unskilled and ignorant of the meaning of "homoousion," as if there were never any synods or disputes about this.
Suppose they didn't know "homoousion" or "homoiousion" meant similar in essence.
If they didn't know this, why did they want the begetting of the Son to be unknown?
If it is indescribable, does that mean it is unknowable?

But if we don't know how He was born, can we really be unaware that the Son of God, born from the same essence as God, shares the same nature? Haven't they read that the Son should be honored just as the Father is honored
(John 5:25), rather than giving preference to the Father in honor?
Do they not realize that the Father is seen in the Son
(John 14:9), so that the Son does not differ in dignity, brightness, and majesty? Or does their misunderstanding stem from thinking that the Son is beneath the Father, just like others, failing to distinguish Him from them?
The subordination of the Son is due to His nature, while that of others is because of the frailty of their creation. They certainly knew He suffered, but I challenge them to say when they knew He suffered alongside someone else.
They avoid the terms "homoousion" and "homoiousion," because they're not explicitly written anywhere. I ask, where did they assume He suffered with someone else? Or are they suggesting that two suffered, as the term "compassion" implies? Where is the statement that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? Or are they implying Jesus Christ is one person and the Son of God another?
If He is not the same within and outside as the Son of God, they may believe in the ignorance of "homoousion" if such ignorance is permissible. But if even in these matters such ignorance is irreverent and cannot be falsely excused, I worry that claiming ignorance about "homoiousion" is deceptive.
I'm not overly concerned about the forgiveness you've granted, as it is right to leave what belongs to God to God, and human error stems from ignorance. But let bishops Valens and Ursacius forgive me, for I cannot believe that they are truly ignorant given their age and experience. It's very hard not to suspect deceit if they can't clear themselves without deception.
But may the Lord grant that we are mistaken in our thinking rather than them being truly ignorant. For I'd rather be judged for my flawed thinking than see your faith compromised by aligning with a heretical conscience. I urge you, most holy men, to consider my concerns with goodwill. The Lord is witness to my conscience that I have no intention to undermine your faith with these explanations you've brought from Sirmium.

Please forgive me if there are some things I cannot understand, but I find comfort in this:
I have read that the spirit of prophets is subject to the prophets
First Corinthians 14:32.
From this, I feel it might not be presumptuous to think I can grasp what others might not.
Not that I would dare to suggest you lack any knowledge, but concerning the unity of the Catholic faith, let's acknowledge that we have concerns just as you do.
A letter was delivered to Sirmium about the explanation of homoousios and homoiousios.
Homoousios is wrongly rejected because of birth.
I understand the letter you requested to be read by Valens, Ursacius, and Germinius at Sirmium, regarding the explanation of homoousios and homoiousios, is both cautious and open in some parts.
The explanation of homoousios and homoiousios left no difficulty unresolved.
Indeed, regarding homoiousios, meaning "of similar essence," there is a common understanding.
But about homoousios, meaning "of one essence," you initially declared it should be rejected because the term implies that substance was understood before they were divided.
I understand this misunderstanding.
This is a misguided idea and should be rejected by the Church's common judgment.
Secondly, you mentioned that our forefathers, when Paul of Samosata was declared a heretic, also rejected homoousios because it suggested the Father and the Son were solitary and unique to themselves.
Even now, the Church sees this as profoundly misguided, understanding it as calling the Father and the Son into solitude and singularity, denying the distinct properties of persons.
Thirdly, you cited the rejection of homoousios at the council of Nicaea, where our forefathers, pressured by those who said the Son was a creature, introduced the term homoousios, which shouldn't be accepted as it's not found in any writings.
I am quite surprised by what you have said.

If the term homoousion is to be rejected because it is new, then homoiousion might also be at risk since it is not found in Scripture. In that case, it would be condemned by general consensus. However, I do not criticize this; I would rather introduce something new than reject it irreverently.
So, setting aside the question of novelty, the issue doesn't even lie with matters condemned by our collective judgment. After all, who in their right mind would claim a third substance common to both the Father and the Son? Or, after being reborn in Christ and acknowledging the Son and the Father, who would argue that in Christ, the Father and the Son are one and the same, as Paul of Samosata suggested?
Our judgment is consistent in condemning the heretics' impieties. We not only reject but also detest this interpretation of homoousion. Therefore, there is no misunderstanding where there is a common agreement in condemning the error.
What was accepted by the Nicene Council should not be disapproved. As I prepare to discuss the third question, I urge you not to turn suspicions into conflict where there is peace of conscience, and not to assume I am bringing up anything except for the sake of unity. It's pointless to fear criticism of a word when the concept it represents poses no issue.
Does it bother anyone that homoousion was accepted at the Nicene Council? If this is troubling, then one must necessarily agree with what the Arians denied. For homoousion was denied so that the Son of God would not be seen as born from the substance of God the Father, but rather as created from nothing, like other creatures.
We are not introducing anything new; the Arians' own treachery, documented in numerous writings, serves as its own witness. If the confessors' understanding was pious because of the impiety of those who denied it, I wonder why it is being undermined today when it was piously accepted in the past. If it was accepted piously, why has establishing piety become a crime, when it extinguished impiety through the same means by which it was impious?
The aim of the Nicene Council.

The Nicene Creed. Let's consider what the Council of Nicaea aimed for by confessing
homoousios, meaning "of the same substance." They certainly did not intend to spark a heresy arising from a flawed understanding of
homoousios. I don't believe they meant that the Father and the Son divided a single, prior substance into their own.
We will reverently include this faith, once written, into our discussion without irreverence. We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born from the Father as the only begotten, that is, from the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same substance with the Father, which in Greek is called
homoousios, through whom all things were made, both in heaven and on earth, who for our salvation came down, was incarnate, and became human, and suffered, and rose again on the third day, and ascended into heaven, and is coming to judge the living and the dead. And in the Holy Spirit.
Those, however, who say, "There was a time when he was not," and "Before he was born he was not," and that "He was made from nothing," or from a different substance or essence, claiming that God is changeable and mutable: the Catholic Church anathematizes them. The most holy council of religious men did not introduce some prior substance that was divided into two, but the Son was born from the substance of the Father.
Do we deny this? Or what else do we confess? And after the other explanations of the common faith, it says, "Begotten, not made, of the same substance with the Father," which in Greek is called
homoousios. What opportunity is there for a flawed understanding here? The Son is proclaimed to be born from the substance of the Father, not made: so that the birth of divinity is not a creation of making. Therefore, "of the same substance" means not that he exists as one or alone, but that he is born from the substance of God, not existing from elsewhere, nor existing in any diversity of differing substance.

Isn't it our belief that it doesn't originate from elsewhere, nor does it exist in a different form? Or does homoousion mean anything other than the essence of the two is one and the same, according to the nature of their origin, because the essence of the Son is not from elsewhere? Since it isn't from elsewhere, both are rightly believed to be of one essence; because the Son's substance comes solely from the Father's nature.
Should homoousion be dismissed because it is often misunderstood? On the contrary, is it argued that it should be rejected because of this misunderstanding? If we fear misunderstanding, should we also remove what is written in the Apostle: "There is one mediator between God and humans, the man Christ Jesus" (First Timothy chapter two, verse five); because Photinus uses it to support his heresy: and should it not be read by us because he misinterprets it?
Should we let the letter to the Philippians be destroyed, either by fire or erasure, lest Marcion misreads it: "And being found in appearance as a man" (Philippians chapter two, verse seven), claiming it's a fantasy rather than the reality of the body? Should the Gospel of John not exist, lest Sabellius learns from it: "I and the Father are one" (John chapter ten, verse thirty)? And should those now saying that Christ is a creature not write: "The Father is greater than I" (John chapter fourteen, verse twenty-eight)?
Should those who argue that the Son is unlike the Father avoid reading: "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mark chapter thirteen, verse thirty-two)? Should the books of Moses not exist, lest darkness be seen as co-eternal with God, who dwells in unapproachable light; because in Genesis, chapter one, verse two, day follows night: lest Methuselah's years surpass the age of the flood (Genesis chapter five, verse twenty-six), and not only eight souls are saved (First Peter chapter three, verse twenty).
Should God, hearing the outcry of the Sodomites whose sins are complete, descend as if unaware of their transgressions, to see if their sins match the outcry, and God seems not to know what He already knows (Genesis chapter eighteen, verse twenty-one)? Should we also not know the tomb of Moses, buried by those who laid him to rest (Deuteronomy chapter thirty-four, verse six)? Should these, as heretics believe, suggest that the law itself is contradictory and adversarial? And because these are not understood by them, should they not be read by us?

If it seems necessary, let them also perish-though I don't mean this lightly, but because of the necessity of the response-all those divine and holy Gospels of human salvation. This ensures they don't contradict each other in their statements. So that the Lord, about to send the Holy Spirit, is not read as having been born of the Holy Spirit himself. And when he is about to announce death by the sword, he doesn't indicate to buy a sword as he is about to suffer.
For instance, in Matthew chapter twenty-six, verse fifty-two, as he is about to descend to the dead, he is not with the thief in paradise, as mentioned in Luke chapter twenty-two, verse thirty-six.
So that finally, the apostles are not found guilty. They were commanded to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as stated in Matthew chapter twenty-eight, verse nineteen, yet they baptized only in the name of Jesus, as mentioned in Acts chapter ten, verse forty-eight.
To you, Brothers, I speak with a voice for those who are no longer nurtured with milk but are strong with solid food, as noted in Hebrews chapter five, verse twelve.
Is it because the wise of the world do not understand these things, and they seem foolish to them, that we will be wise with the world by believing these foolish things? And because these things are blind to the wicked, will we not shine with the truth of the understood doctrine? It is wrongly judged against holy things if, because they are not considered holy by some, they should not exist.
Therefore, let us not glory in the cross of Christ, because it is a scandal to the world, nor preach death in the living God, lest God be accused of being dead by the wicked.
Eighty-six. Or because it was rejected by eighty bishops, the term "homoousion" is misunderstood. What does it matter to me who understands it well? The Samosatene confessed "homoousion" wrongly, but did Arius deny it better? Eighty bishops rejected it long ago, but recently three hundred and eighteen accepted it.
Indeed, to me, that very number is sacred here, in which Abraham, the victor over impious kings, as mentioned in Genesis chapter fourteen, verse fourteen, is blessed by him who is the form of the eternal priesthood.
Those who rejected the heretic did not also prove against the heretic? The authority of the ancients is weighty; is the holiness of these also light? If they felt contrary things to each other, we ought to judge and approve the better. But if by approving and disapproving they established one thing both ways, why do we overturn what has been well established?
Eighty-seven.

Did Hosius, who was present at Nicaea, decide that silence was necessary?
Perhaps someone might argue that some of those at the council back then believed silence was needed regarding homoousios.
Reluctantly, I must ask: Did they not also decide that silence was necessary about homoiousios?
I beg you, let no one other than the old man Hosius, who excessively cherishes his own solemnity, think that silence is necessary about either.
Where will we find ourselves amid such heretical madness if we fail to maintain either by not accepting both?
It cannot be considered impious to say that if neither is found written, neither should be confessed, or both should.
What does Hilary understand by homoousios?
Concerns about homoousios arise.
I understand homoousios, holy men, as God from God, not of dissimilar essence, not divided, but begotten, and from the substance of the unbegotten God, a single-begotten nativity in the Son, according to similarity.
This understanding was greatly confirmed for me by homoousios.
Why do you condemn my faith in homoousios, which, through the profession of homoiousios, you cannot help but approve?
You condemn my faith, or rather your own, when you criticize its understanding in the name.
But does someone else misunderstand it?
Let us collectively condemn faulty understanding, not remove the security of faith.
Do you think we should adhere to the Synod of Samosata to prevent anyone from misappropriating homoousios according to the understanding of Samosata?
Let us also subscribe to the council of Nicaea, so the Arians do not disapprove of homoousios.
But is there a fear that, according to faith, homoousios might not signify homoiousios?
Let it be determined that they are of no difference, of one and similar substance.
But can homoousios be misunderstood?
Let it be established how it can be understood correctly.
We wisely agree on one and the same thing; I ask that what we agree on is holy among us.
Forgive me, Brothers, as I have often asked: You are not Arians; why are you considered Arians by denying homoiousios?
Homoiousios is not without offense.

Homoousios-You might say: The ambiguity of
homoousios disturbs me.
Again, I urge you to listen without being troubled: the simplicity of
homoousios concerns me.
Often, things that are similar can be misleading.
I worry about gold leaf because it might mislead me, though it appears like gold.
I am cautious of milk's appearance, wondering if the milk offered to me is not sheep's milk but resembles cow's milk.
For sheep's milk to truly be sheep's milk, it must come from a sheep.
True resemblance lies in the truth of nature.
However, the truth in the nature of both does not deny
homoousion.
This is indeed likeness according to essence, if a mass similar to another mass isn't deceptive, and if milk of the same color doesn't differ in taste.
Nothing can resemble gold unless it is gold; it can't resemble milk unless it's of the same kind.
The color of wine has often misled me, yet taste revealed it to be a different liquid.
I have seen meats that look alike, but taste later revealed their different natures.
I am wary of these similarities that don't stem from the unity of nature.
Faith of Ancyra Secretly Sent to Sirmium by Some.-Indeed, Brothers, I fear the heresies of the East emerging at various times: and what I express fear about, I have already read.
In what you, as delegation ministers accepted with some Orientals' consent, brought to Sirmium for subscription, there's no room for suspicion: but initially, there was a significant amount of offense, which I believe you, most holy men Basil, Eustathius, and Eleusius, kept quiet to avoid scandal.
If these matters were written correctly, they should not have been kept silent.
However, if they are now silent because they weren't written correctly, we must ensure they aren't mentioned later.
For now, I'm holding back from discussing these matters: yet you agree with me that not all the faith written at Ancyra was the same.
I'm not speaking of rumors; I have the testimony of letters, not from laypeople but given by bishops.
Exhortation to Accept
homoousion.

He first heard the Nicene Creed just before his exile.
I urge you, brothers, to cast aside suspicion and eliminate any chance for it.
To affirm the homoousion, let us not dismiss the homousion. Let's think of all the holy and resting priests: what will the Lord judge about us if we now condemn them? What will become of us, who bring this to the point where, because they were not bishops, we also have not truly begun? After all, we were ordained by them, and we are their successors.
Should we renounce the episcopate because we have assumed its office from something condemned? Forgive my sorrow, brothers, but what you dare is impious. I cannot bear the thought that the homousion, according to a religious understanding, is condemned. The name itself holds no crime, as it does not disrupt the essence of faith.
I neither know nor understand homoeusion, except from the confession of similar essence. I testify to the God of heaven and earth that even when I had heard neither, I always understood both to mean the same through homousion and homoeusion: that nothing can be similar to itself by nature unless it is of the same nature.
Having been reborn long ago and remaining in the episcopate for some time, I only encountered the Nicene faith when I was about to be exiled. However, the understanding of homousii and homoeusii was revealed to me through the Gospels and the Apostles. What we seek is pious. Let us not condemn the fathers, nor embolden heretics, lest while we label something heresy, we inadvertently foster it.
Our fathers interpreted the nature of homousii devoutly after the Nicene Synod, and books exist as testament, with conscience intact. If anything needs further explanation, let us consult together. A strong state of faith can be established among us, ensuring that well-founded beliefs remain secure and those poorly understood are not dismissed.

I have stepped forward, dear brothers, setting aside the shame of human conscience and forgetting my humility, to write about these great and hidden matters.
Driven by my love for you, I feel compelled to address issues that have remained unspoken and unaddressed until now.
I have shared what I believe, knowing it is my duty to serve the Church, to make the voice of my episcopate in Christ known through these writings, in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels.
It is your responsibility as a community to discuss, anticipate, and take action to ensure that you preserve with a religious conscience what you have faithfully maintained so far, and hold on to what you already possess.
Please remember my exile in your holy prayers: I do not know whether, after explaining this faith, returning to you in the Lord Jesus Christ will be as joyful as the security of dying.
I wish that God and our Lord keep you untainted and unharmed until the day of revelation, dear brothers.
