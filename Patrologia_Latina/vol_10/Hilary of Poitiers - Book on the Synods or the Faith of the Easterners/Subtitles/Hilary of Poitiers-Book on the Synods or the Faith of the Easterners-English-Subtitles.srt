1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,587
Sirmium was composed by Hosius and Potamius in the year 357. There is one God.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:42,291
The term "substance" should be avoided.
The Father is greater than the Son.
When it was believed that there was a debate about faith in the year 465, everything was carefully examined and discussed at Sirmium, with our most holy brothers and fellow bishops, Valens, Ursacius, and Germinius, present.
It is agreed that there is one almighty God and Father, as believed throughout the world:
and His only Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, begotten from Him before the ages.
However, we cannot and should not proclaim two gods, because the Lord Himself said:
"I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" (John 20:17).

3
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,703
Therefore, there is one God of all, as the Apostle taught.

4
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:58,996
"Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also."
Since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith (Romans 3:29-30).

5
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:02,643
But everything else agreed, and there could be no discrepancy.

6
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:28,818
As for what concerned some or many regarding the substance, which in Greek is called "usia," or more clearly "homoousion," or what is called "homoiousion," there should be no mention at all;
nor should anyone proclaim it because it is neither contained in the divine Scriptures nor can it be comprehended by human knowledge, nor can anyone explain the birth of the Son, about whom it is written, "Who will declare His generation?" (Isaiah 53:8).

7
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:35,171
It is clear that only the Father knows how He begot His Son, and the Son, how He was begotten by the Father.

8
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,053
There is no ambiguity that the Father is greater.

9
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:49,935
No one can doubt that the Father is greater than the Son in honor, dignity, glory, majesty, and even in the name of Father, as testified by Himself, "The one who sent me is greater than I" (John 14:28).

10
00:01:49,935 --> 00:02:00,934
And everyone knows this to be Catholic, that there are two persons, the Father and the Son, with the Father being greater, and the Son subject to all that the Father has subjected to Him.

11
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:06,023
The Father has no beginning, is invisible, immortal, and incapable of suffering.

12
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:10,241
The Son, however, is born from the Father, God from God, light from light.

13
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:14,743
As mentioned earlier, no one knows the generation of the Son except the Father.

14
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:24,661
This same Son of God, our Lord and God, as it is written, took on flesh or a human body, becoming a man from the womb of the Virgin Mary, as the Angel announced in Luke 1:31.

15
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:32,982
As all Scriptures teach, and especially the Apostle, the teacher of nations, He took on human form from the Virgin Mary, through whom He suffered.

16
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:47,801
The core point of the entire faith and its confirmation is that the Trinity must always be upheld, as we read in the Gospel: Go and baptize all nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew 28:19.

17
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,651
The number of the Trinity is complete and perfect.

18
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:59,371
The Spirit, the Comforter, comes through the Son, who was sent according to the promise, to instruct, teach, and sanctify the Apostles and all believers.

19
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:01,195
Essence and substance explained.

20
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,133
Council of Ancyra in the year 358.

21
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,894
The Son as an image is not different from the Father in name only.

22
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:13,734
In response to these many and significant declarations of impiety, the Eastern bishops gathered to define their beliefs.

23
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:24,449
Since we must often refer to essence and substance, it is important to understand what essence means, so that when we discuss things, we do not remain unaware of the meanings of the words.

24
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,921
Essence is the thing that exists, or from which it exists, and which persists in its permanence.

25
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,853
Essence, nature, kind, and substance can be spoken of for each thing.

26
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:37,216
Essence is specifically called so because it always exists.

27
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:45,537
It is also called substance because the thing that is must exist in itself; whatever exists undoubtedly remains in its kind, nature, or substance.

28
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:53,004
Therefore, when we say essence signifies nature, kind, or substance, we understand it as the thing that always exists in all these.

29
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:56,766
Now let's review the faith definitions set by the Eastern bishops.

30
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:09,577
If anyone hears that the Son of God is the image of the invisible God and claims that being the image of God is the same as being the invisible God Himself, without truly acknowledging the Son, let them be condemned.

31
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:13,287
Similarly, there is another point: He receives life from the Father.

32
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:22,508
The idea of those who wish to preach only the names Father and Son is rejected, since whenever there is an image, the nature of the one it resembles cannot be different.

33
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:27,473
No one is an image of themselves; instead, an image must reflect the one whose image it is.

34
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:32,548
Therefore, an image is a resemblance imagined and indistinguishable from the thing it equals.

35
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:44,060
So, there is the Father, and there is the Son: because the Son is the image of the Father; and for something to be an image, it must have the appearance, nature, and essence of its origin according to the image.

36
00:04:44,060 --> 00:05:02,666
And if anyone hears the Son saying,
For as the Father has life in Himself,
so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself
(John 5:26),
and they claim the same one received life from the Father, who also admits,
I live because of the Father
(John 6:57),
as if the one who gives and the one who receives are the same: let them be condemned.

37
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:06,431
The Son's essence is not unlike the Father's because He is His image.

38
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,760
The distinction is made between the giver and the receiver, so that the same one is not the only and solitary being.

39
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:21,654
Since anyone who believes in one solitary being in the context of giver and receiver is condemned, it cannot be understood that He received from Himself, who gave.

40
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:34,312
For He is not the only one who lives and through whom others live; because one lives for himself, and another claims to live through the origin: and no one will assert that the same one is both the life user and the cause of living.

41
00:05:34,312 --> 00:05:47,625
And if anyone hears that the only begotten Son of the invisible God is similar and does not say that the Son, who is the image of the invisible God, is understood according to essence: as if not truly calling Him the Son, let them be condemned.

42
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,736
Similarly, just as the Father, so He has life in Himself.

43
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:53,900
The life of the Father and the Son is the essence of both.

44
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,956
An indistinguishable and dissimilar nature is confirmed.

45
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,847
Since the only Son of God is the image of the invisible God, He must closely resemble God's essence in both appearance and nature.

46
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:18,005
How can we distinguish the nature of the Son from the Father by an indifferent kind, when the Son, existing in what belongs to the Father, naturally shares in what is generated in Him-namely, glory, virtue, power, invisibility, and essence?

47
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:27,326
Therefore, in these equal aspects of divine goodness, we understand that the Son is not lesser because He is the Son, nor does the Father exceed because He is the Father.

48
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:31,767
The Son is envisioned with the Father in appearance and is not different in kind.

49
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:44,212
The similarity of the Son, generated from the Father's substance, does not allow for a difference in substance, and the Son, as the image of the invisible God, fully encompasses all the Father's divinity in whatever form it is.

50
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:51,120
This truly defines what it means to be the Son: to perfectly reflect the truth of the Father's form, envisioned in His nature.

51
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:05,046
If anyone hearing this asks,
"For as the Father has life in Himself, so He granted the Son also to have life in Himself"
(John 5:26), and does not acknowledge the Son's similarity to the Father in essence as evidence of what He said, let him be accursed.

52
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:17,272
It is clear that the life understood in the Father signifies substance; the life of the Only Begotten, which is generated from the Father, is also understood as essence, thus indicating the similarity of essence to essence.

53
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:22,042
The perfect birth of an indistinct nature is linked to such a confession of its origin.

54
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,167
For what is life in both is signified as essence in both.

55
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:43,973
In the life that is generated from life, that is, essence born from essence, it is not different in birth because life comes from life, holding within it the similar nature of its origin; because the essence of the begotten and begetting, the life possessed and given (indeed from the Father and given to the Son), does not differ in likeness.

56
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:52,580
For what God begot from Himself, from the likeness of His nature, He did not abandon, where the unbegotten likeness is the natural property of the substance.

57
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:58,422
It has nothing except what it has been given, and just as it has life, it has been given life.

58
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:09,401
Thus, what comes from the essence, like life from life, is born similar to itself according to the essence, without any difference or dissimilarity between the one being born and the one begetting.

59
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:09,847
Verse 5.

60
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:20,993
If someone says, "He founded or created me" (Proverbs 8:22), and "He begot me" (Proverbs 8:25), hearing from the same source, they should not interpret this as being born from a similarity of essence.

61
00:08:20,993 --> 00:09:52,169
Instead, they should understand "He begot me" and "He created me" as meaning the same thing.
It's not about saying the Son is a perfect Son of God signified by two names, but rather that through the names "He created me" and "He begot," only the condition is stated, not the Son. Just as Wisdom has offered a devout understanding from two names: let him be accursed.
17. The phrase "He created me" must be understood in light of "He begot me." This highlights the distinction between birth and creation.
Those who claim the Son of God is a creature or creation are contradicted by reason.
The impious presumption of heretics is evident when they say they have read "The Lord created or founded me," interpreting creation in a certain way. However, they omit the following sentence, which provides context to the former. They misuse the first statement to support their impiety by claiming it refers to a creature because Wisdom said it was created.
If it was created, how could it also be born?
Every birth, whatever it is, derives its nature from the begetting nature: creation, however, begins with the power of the creator, who can create a creature from nothing.
Therefore, Wisdom, which stated it was created, in the same context, specifically in verse 25, explained why it said it was created and also begotten: referring creation to the immutable nature of the parent, which, beyond the form and habit of human birth, without any diminishment or change of itself, created from itself what it begot.
The work of the creator does not involve suffering, mixture, or birth.
What is created from nothing begins to exist at some point.

62
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:58,833
Creation is an act of power, brought into being by the one who establishes it, rather than a birth from nature itself.

63
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:07,784
True birth represents the perfect unfolding of legitimate origin and genuine nature, where the nature of what is begotten derives from the nature of what begets it.

64
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:13,516
The Son of God is not begotten through physical division but is born as a perfect God from a perfect God.

65
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:19,247
This is why Wisdom refers to Him as created, emphasizing that His genesis excludes any physical weakness.

66
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:23,778
By stating that He is both created and born, it clarifies the nature of His origin.

67
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:27,708
Those who only attribute a resemblance of power to the Son are mistaken.

68
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:33,494
To demonstrate that His nature stems from birth and not mere creation, it is also stated that He was born.

69
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:45,721
By acknowledging both creation and birth, it offers a full understanding of His origin while highlighting the unchangeable nature of the Father and affirming that the nature born from God the Father is legitimate and proper.

70
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:54,455
This discussion brings clarity to the concepts of perfect birth, creation, and generation: one aspect remains unchanged, and the other embodies the true nature.

71
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,238
Both concepts merge into one, achieving perfection.

72
00:10:57,238 --> 00:11:02,697
The Son, born from God and unchanged by God, is born of the Father, illustrating that He is created.

73
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:06,954
The unchanging and natural Father establishes the Son, thereby generating Him.

74
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:12,577
Therefore, the notion that the Son of God is merely a creature is condemned, as it is a heretical view.

75
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:19,291
This opinion of creation from nothing, devoid of the perfection of divinity, is refuted by the truth of natural generation.

76
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:30,699
If anyone sees in the Son the likeness of the Father in essence, it is evident through what the Son Himself declares: For just as the Father has life in Himself, He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.

77
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,245
John 5:26.

78
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:50,534
Based on effectiveness, through what is taught: For what the Father does, the Son does likewise, granting similarity only in effectiveness, but denying the Son according to essence, which is the most important part of our faith, as if denying himself the knowledge of eternal life, which is in the Father and the Son: let him be anathema.

79
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,867
The likeness of power comes only from the likeness of nature.

80
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,452
Life is signified by essence.

81
00:11:55,452 --> 00:12:05,015
Heretics, confined by the authority of the Scriptures, usually grant this only to the Son: that he is only similar to the Father in power, but deny him the likeness of nature.

82
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:10,753
Foolish and impious, not understanding that the likeness of power comes only from the likeness of nature.

83
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:15,015
For a lesser nature never achieves the power of a superior and greater nature.

84
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:22,720
Or what will those who assert these things profess about the almighty God the Father if the power of an inferior nature equals his own power?

85
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,387
It cannot be denied that the Son can do the same, as he said: Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise (John 5:19).

86
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:38,841
But the likeness of nature follows the likeness of power when he says: Just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself (John 5:26).

87
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:45,398
In life, there is the signification of nature and essence: just as it is possessed, it is taught to be given to possess.

88
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:51,628
Therefore, the likeness of life holds the likeness of power: for the likeness of power cannot be unlike in nature.

89
00:12:51,628 --> 00:13:03,541
And so it is necessary that the likeness of essence follows the likeness of power: because just as the Father does what he does, the Son does the same: just as the Father has life, he has given life to the Son to have.

90
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:16,984
Therefore, the rashness of impious profession is condemned, which, confessing the likeness of power, dares to preach dissimilarity of nature: since the faith of our principal hope is to confess the same divine substance in the Father and the Son.

91
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:29,827
If anyone claims to believe in the Father and the Son but suggests that the Father has a different essence from Himself, yet similar in power, speaking against the essence of the Son and denying that the Son is truly God, let them be cursed.

92
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:37,160
Heretics deceitfully confessing the Father and the Son are refuted for denying the Son's distinction from the Father due to similarity in nature.

93
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:48,033
These heretics often evade the truth by mixing and confusing words, capturing the ears of the unwary with familiar terms, acknowledging the Father and the Son in name only, not in the truth of their natural essence.

94
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:53,900
They know that God is called the Father of all creation and remember that all the saints are called the sons of God.

95
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,929
By this logic, they confess the Father and the Son according to common names, so they are called Father and Son rather than truly being so.

96
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:09,527
They are said to be, but are not, if there is a distinct nature of differing essence, since the truth of the paternal name can only come from the offspring of its nature.

97
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:19,186
Therefore, the Father cannot be called the father of a substance that is alien and different from Himself, because perfect birth does not involve a discordant diversity of original substance.

98
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:24,749
Thus, all impiety is rejected, which speaks of the Father as not the father of a son born from His own nature.

99
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:36,279
For God will not be called Father if He has a creation similar in power and effectiveness, but if He has begotten a nature not different from His own essence, because natural birth does not accept a diversity of paternal nature.

100
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:48,518
For this reason, cursed are those who claim that the Father is the father of a nature different from His own, as if something other than God is born from God, and they think that the essence of the Father degenerated in the Son by generation.

101
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:58,582
For they destroy, as much as they can, the unbegotten and unchangeable essence of the Father, who dared to introduce a dissimilarity of a degenerate natural essence in the birth of His Only Begotten.

102
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:12,046
If anyone believes the Son is similar in essence to the Father and claims the Son is the same as the Father, or a part of the Father, or originates through emanation or passion like human sons from a non-physical Father, let him be accursed.

103
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:16,563
All forms of deception are guarded against, and no opportunity for fraud is allowed.

104
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:28,016
Many heretics assert that the Son is similar in divinity to the Father, suggesting that this likeness means the Father is the same as the Son, because indistinct likeness seems to imply uniqueness and singularity.

105
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:31,458
What does not differ in kind appears to remain united in nature.

106
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,889
The Son, being born, is not the same as the Father, nor something entirely different from the Father.

107
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,621
They propose that the Son is distinct from the Father due to their personal differences.

108
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:45,600
But birth does not support this fiction; for union does not involve birth.

109
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,697
What is born has a father of its birth.

110
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:58,989
Although the divinity of the one born from the begetter is indistinct, he is not both the begetter and the begotten; as they must remain distinct from each other, and the begotten cannot be unlike the begetter.

111
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:17,647
Therefore, accursed is he who claims the similarity of nature between the Father and the Son erases the personal significance of the Son: because when nothing differs from something else through mutual likeness, the likeness itself, without achieving union, acknowledges the Father and the Son, as the Son is the unchanging likeness of the Father.

112
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:23,132
The Son is not a part of the Father, so it cannot be said that the born and the begetter are the same.

113
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:32,918
Nor is it an emanation, where a continuous flow through a physical and individual path retains the same flow at its origin, being its own origin through an ongoing series and course.

114
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:44,210
It is a perfect birth, maintaining the likeness of nature: not conceived and born through a physical birth, but existing as an incorporeal Son from an incorporeal Father through the likeness of the same nature.

115
00:16:44,856 --> 00:18:30,493
And if anyone, because the Father is never understood to be the Son, and the Son is never understood to be the Father, speaks of the Son as different from the Father, because the Father is one and the Son is another, as it is said, "There is another who bears witness about me, and the Father who sent me" John 5:32, due to this holy understanding of the distinctness of the Father and the Son in the Church, fearing that the Son and the Father might ever be understood as the same, does not say that the Son is like the Father even according to essence: let them be accursed.
How carefully two heresies against God's Son were defeated.
It was said to the Apostles of the Lord: "Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves" Matthew 10:16.
Through this, He wanted the nature of living creatures that differ from each other to be in us: but in such a way that the cunning of the serpent would be tempered by the innocence of the dove, and the innocence of the dove would be guided by the wisdom of the serpent; so that there would be both simple wisdom and wise simplicity: which command has been kept in the explanation of this faith.
For the previous statement we discussed took care that, through the similarity of essence, a personal union would not be proclaimed;
nor would the indifference of nature destroy the birth of the Son;
and that there would not be one solitary being for us in understanding, because one would not differ from the other in kind:
but the following statement again met that wisdom of the serpent, to which we are urged to conform with the simplicity of the dove, through simple and apostolic wisdom;
lest perhaps, because personal union is not accepted, since the Father is one and the Son is another, a preaching of dissimilar nature could arise again:
lest when one is the sender and another is the one sent (since the sent and the sender are not the same), it might be thought that the sent and the sender are of separate and dissimilar natures, when the born and the begetter cannot be of different essences.

116
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:43,724
Therefore, in the Father and the Son, the similarity of an undifferentiated nature is retained through the essence of birth:
yet it does not bring harm to the person, so that the one who is sent and the one who sends are the same, the similarity of nature.

117
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:51,262
Neither does the uniqueness of the person mean he can be called both the Son and the Father, nor does it take away the likeness of nature.

118
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:57,717
Thus, the truth of birth supports the likeness of essence, and this likeness does not lose the personal truth of birth.

119
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:07,319
Similarly, the distinction between the begetter and the begotten does not exclude their likeness of essence; although they cannot be the same, they are not of different natures.

120
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:20,880
If anyone ever interprets God the Father of the only begotten Son as existing within time, rather than beyond time and beyond human understanding, claiming that the only begotten Son existed without suffering, they stray from the evangelical message.

121
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:30,156
This message, which omits the time interval between the Father and the Son, teaches us that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

122
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,784
John 1:1: let him be accursed.

123
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,520
The Father is not bound by time.

124
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,666
The Gospel tells us the Son exists beyond just being born.

125
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:43,609
It is a sacred belief that the Father is not confined by time, for the truth of his timeless nature surpasses all understanding.

126
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:55,164
Although the very name of the Father, which religiously acknowledges the impassible origin of the one being born, is not limited by time, because the eternal and infinite God the Father cannot be seen as temporal.

127
00:19:55,164 --> 00:20:02,433
According to the evangelical message, the only begotten God the Word is known to be with God in the beginning, beyond just being born.

128
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:08,888
If anyone claims that the Father is older than the Son or that the Son is younger than the Father: let him be accursed.

129
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:12,197
The Son, as the image of the Father, is not younger than him.

130
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:16,971
Since God has always been the Father, he has always been the Father, and always the Son.

131
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:21,474
The likeness of essence, configured in kind, is also taught as indifferent to time.

132
00:20:21,474 --> 00:20:33,842
This ensures that the one who is the image of God, the Word, who is God with God in the beginning, and who is like the Father, has no temporal division from the Father, maintaining his perfection as the image, the Word, and God.

133
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:43,565
If he is indeed declared to be younger in time, he loses both the truth of the image and likeness, because a likeness cannot exist if it is different in time.

134
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:49,487
Since God the Father is timeless, He cannot have any sense of time; otherwise, He wouldn't be the Father.

135
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:53,716
Similarly, the Son cannot be bound by time, or else He wouldn't be the Son.

136
00:20:53,716 --> 00:21:02,175
That's why the Father is not said to be older than the Son, nor the Son younger than the Father, because the truth of both names exists only together.

137
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:10,859
If anyone attributes the timeless nature of the only begotten Son to the unbegotten essence of God, suggesting the Son is the Father, let him be anathema.

138
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,453
The Son, although timeless, is not unbegotten.

139
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:24,845
The earlier definition seemed to give heretics a chance, since it denied the time of the Son's birth, as it would be blasphemous if the Father were subject to time; however, He would be if the Son were.

140
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:32,401
By denying time, there was a risk that the Father, who is unbegotten, would be seen as both Father and Son, under the name of the Son.

141
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:41,480
Where the time of birth is excluded, the idea of being unbegotten seems accepted, suggesting that one whose birth is not in time might not be thought to be born.

142
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:53,435
Therefore, to prevent this heresy of union from emerging due to the denial of time, this impiety is condemned, which attempts to link the timeless birth to the unique and sole substance of the unbegotten essence.

143
00:21:53,435 --> 00:22:00,372
Being timeless is different from being unborn; one can be born outside of time, while the other is eternally self-existent.

144
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,233
The reason for these definitions.

145
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,094
Explanation as applied by Hilary.

146
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,349
By whom their subscription was extorted.

147
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:07,421
A summary of these.

148
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:18,474
We have reviewed, beloved Brothers, all the definitions of faith published by the Eastern bishops, which they established in a synod gathered among themselves against the recently emerging heresy.

149
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:25,620
We did our best to tailor our explanations to their level of understanding, using their words instead of imposing our own.

150
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,197
They make decisions based on their conscience and long-held beliefs, resisting any new and irreverent ideas.

151
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:37,858
They even compelled those who had endorsed or accepted the heresy at Sirmium to admit their ignorance and agree to these decrees.

152
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:44,881
The Son is the perfect image of the Father, and through the mystery of this image, the Son remains, ensuring the Father endures as well.

153
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:49,994
When the Son is declared the image of the Father, it signifies no difference in substance from Him.

154
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:55,003
The life that the Father possesses and the Son receives signifies no difference in their essence.

155
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:58,876
The Son is not a created being but shares the same substance as the Father.

156
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:03,265
Just as there is no difference in power between them, their essence remains the same.

157
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:08,119
The Father, in generating the Son, does not diminish Himself through any difference in nature.

158
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:14,677
Despite the likeness in their nature, the distinction in their names-Father and Son-precludes them from being one and the same.

159
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:21,287
It is rightly stated that the Father sends and the Son is sent, yet this does not imply any distinction in essence between them.

160
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:26,451
The truth of the Father's identity is timeless, and the Son is not subsequent to the Father in time.

161
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:31,873
Beyond all time, the perfect birth of the Son does not allow for the misconception of Him not being born.

162
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,920
Decrees were issued at certain times, for specific reasons.

163
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:36,977
Faith sometimes changes.

164
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:46,963
In fact, dear brothers, the teachings of faith that have been shared emerged recently among a few in the East, right around the time when you rejected the introduced heresy.

165
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:52,677
The reason for explaining it was that it was decided to remain silent about being of one substance.

166
00:23:52,677 --> 00:24:02,952
However, in earlier times, due to various reasons, it was necessary for other expressions of faith to be documented, and this can be understood from the nature of those writings.

167
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:12,245
When we know all that has been done by them, we can more easily and thoroughly bring about a religious and unity-conducive resolution to the matters we question.

168
00:24:12,245 --> 00:24:21,019
The exposition of the church's faith, published in the year 341, was presented at the synod during the dedication of the Antiochene church's completion.

169
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,888
Ninety-seven bishops were present, who explained this when one of the bishops was suspected of holding heretical views.

170
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:45,666
We believe, following the evangelical and apostolic tradition, in one God, the Father almighty, the creator, maker, and provider of all things that exist, from whom everything comes; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son, God through whom all things were made, who was begotten from the Father.

171
00:24:45,666 --> 00:25:26,418
God from God, whole from whole, one from one, perfect from perfect, king from king, Lord from Lord, the word, wisdom, life, true light, true way, resurrection, shepherd, gate, unchangeable and immutable, the unchangeable image of divinity, essence, power, and glory, the firstborn of all creation, who always existed in the beginning with God as the Word and God, as it is said in the Gospel, "And the Word was God" (John 1:1), through whom all things were made, and in whom everything holds together:
Who in the last days descended from above and was born of a virgin according to the Scriptures, and became the lamb, the mediator between God and humans, predestined for our faith, and the leader of life.

172
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:33,056
For he said: "For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me" (John 6:38).

173
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:40,133
He suffered, rose again for us on the third day, ascended into heaven, and now sits at the right hand of the Father.

174
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:43,581
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.

175
00:25:43,581 --> 00:26:01,783
And in the Holy Spirit, who was given for comfort, sanctification, and completion to believers, just as the Lord Jesus Christ ordained the disciples, saying:
Go, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-eight, verse nineteen.

176
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:08,114
Clearly, the Father is truly the Father, the Son is truly the Son, and the Holy Spirit is truly the Holy Spirit.

177
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:17,667
These names are not given lightly; they carefully signify the unique essence, order, and glory of each person, so they are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony.

178
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:26,259
Therefore, with this faith, and having it from the beginning to the end in the sight of God and Christ, we anathematize every heretical and wicked sect.

179
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:35,021
If anyone teaches outside the sound Scriptures and true faith, saying anything about time, space, or age before the Son was begotten: let them be accursed.

180
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:50,736
And if anyone claims the Son is a creation, like any other creation; or a birth, as births are; or a making, like creations are, and not as the divine Scriptures have handed down; and if anyone teaches or preaches anything other than what we have received: let them be accursed.

181
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:58,593
For we truly and with reverence believe and follow all that has been handed down in the divine Scriptures by the prophets and the apostles.

182
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:14,760
This faith, perhaps, seems less explicit in speaking of the similar essence of the Father and the Son, especially when it emphasizes the proper essence, order, and glory of each named person in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so they are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony.

183
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,282
After the purpose of the council, a new heresy arose following the Nicene synod.

184
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,687
The Easterners have accurately named the three substances of the Trinity.

185
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:37,729
First, it's important to know that a gathering in Antioch wasn't held against the heresy claiming the Father and the Son were of dissimilar substance, but rather against the heresy that, after the holy council of Nicaea, tried to introduce three names for the Father.

186
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,095
We'll delve into this topic further later on.

187
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:52,244
At the beginning of my discourse, I asked for the patience and understanding of those reading and listening, urging them to wait until all my words were spoken, so no one would judge me prematurely without fully grasping my speech.

188
00:27:52,244 --> 00:28:09,967
Therefore, the holy council aimed to eliminate the falsehoods distorting the truth of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by the number of names:
ensuring that, without specific reasons for each name, the threefold naming wouldn't falsely unify under one name, where the Father alone would bear both the name of the Holy Spirit and the Son.

189
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:20,433
For this reason, they declared there to be three substances, teaching that the persons exist through substances, without separating the substance of the Father and the Son through dissimilar essence.

190
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:34,422
As it was stated: The idea that they may be three in substance and one in harmony isn't disputed, because when the Spirit, known as the Paraclete, is named, it's more fitting to preach unity through harmony rather than through essence by the similarity of substance.

191
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:37,893
This formula proclaims the same essence of the Father and the Son.

192
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:40,523
It distinguishes between birth and unbegottenness.

193
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:41,627
The Son is immutable.

194
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:47,991
However, the entire previous discourse didn't differentiate the Father and the Son by any diversity of essence or nature.

195
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:53,828
When it's said, God from God, whole from whole, there's no doubt that the whole God is born from the whole God.

196
00:28:53,828 --> 00:29:00,087
Indeed, the nature of God from God doesn't differ: and the whole from the whole is in those to whom the Father belongs.

197
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:10,500
One from one excludes the sufferings of human birth and conception:
ensuring that, while one is from one, he isn't from elsewhere, nor different, or other, but is one from one, perfect from perfect.

198
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:16,152
There's no difference in origin between birth and unbegottenness; both are equally perfect.

199
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:17,190
A King from a King.

200
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,503
The power, referred to by the same name, doesn't admit any difference in power.

201
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:22,322
Lord from Lord.

202
00:29:22,322 --> 00:29:28,328
The rule is also equal in the Lord: there's no difference in the confessed dominion in both without diversity.

203
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:36,191
That, after many other things, is stated as immutable and unchangeable-an unchangeable image of divinity, essence, power, and glory-is absolute.

204
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:51,971
For God from God, whole from whole, one from one, perfect from perfect, king from king, and Lord from Lord, with all the glory and nature of divinity in which the Father remains, the Son is also born and subsists; He also has this from the paternal substance, so that He is not changeable.

205
00:29:51,971 --> 00:30:00,270
For in His birth, the nature from which He was born wasn't changed, but the Son obtained unchangeable essence from the unchangeable authority of nature.

206
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:11,572
For although He is an image, He is an unchangeable image, not altered through dissimilarity in the paternal essence from which He was begotten, because the image of the paternal essence would be born in Him.

207
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:19,162
Indeed, when He is taught to be the firstborn of all creation, He is also called the Word of God, who was always with God in the beginning.

208
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:25,496
While He is firstborn, He is shown to be born; while He always existed, He is not separated from the Father by time.

209
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:39,692
Therefore, there can be no seen division of substances, note, by this synod, which aimed at nothing else but to exclude the union through the term of three substances with a triple name introduced to separate a different substance in the Son and in the Father.

210
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:49,629
Since the whole exposition of faith distinguishes neither the Father and the Son, unbegotten and only-begotten, by time, nor by name, nor by essence, nor by dignity, nor by dominion.

211
00:30:49,629 --> 00:31:01,642
It is also worthy of common conscience to recognize the other faiths written by the same Eastern bishops in different places and times, so that through multiple confessions, the sincerity of conscience can be understood.

212
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:05,207
Faith According to the Synod of the East

213
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:28,774
The holy synod gathered at Sardica from various provinces of the Eastern regions: Thebaid, Egypt, Palestine, Arabia, Phoenicia, Coele-Syria, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Paphlagonia, Galatia, Bithynia, Hellespont, Asia, the two Phrygias, Pisidia, the islands of the Cyclades, Pamphylia, Caria, Lydia, Europe, Thrace, Emimontus, Mysia, the two Pannonias, has declared this faith.

214
00:31:28,774 --> 00:31:36,970
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, creator and maker of all things, from whom every fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named.

215
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:54,509
We also believe in his only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, through whom all things were made in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible: who is the Word, and wisdom, and power, and life, and true light.

216
00:31:54,509 --> 00:32:03,008
And who in the last days for us was incarnate, born of the holy Virgin, crucified, died, was buried, and rose from the dead on the third day.

217
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:16,087
He was received into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and is coming to judge the living and the dead, to give to each according to their works; whose kingdom will continue without end in the endless ages.

218
00:32:16,087 --> 00:32:21,692
For he sits at the right hand of the Father not only in this age but also in the one to come.

219
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:35,494
We also believe in the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom, after returning to heaven, he sent to the Apostles to teach them and remind them of everything, through whom the souls of those who sincerely believe in him are sanctified.

220
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:48,754
However, those who say that the Son of God is from non-existent things, or from another substance, and not from God, and that there was a time or age when he was not, the holy and catholic Church recognizes as strangers.

221
00:32:49,175 --> 00:33:08,400
Similarly, those who claim there are three gods, or that Christ is not God and has not existed forever, or that Christ is not the Son of God, or that He is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, or that the Son is unbegotten, or that the Father begot the Son neither by decision nor by will: these individuals are condemned by the holy and catholic Church.

222
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,206
This faith establishes the eternal origin of the Son, asserting His origin from the very substance of God.

223
00:33:14,206 --> 00:33:18,478
The exposition of this faith is concise but employs comprehensive definitions.

224
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:25,160
It condemns those who claim the Son came from non-existent things, assigning Him an origin that is enduring and not begun.

225
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:37,484
To ensure it is understood that this origin, from which He was born and remains, is nothing other than the substance of God, it declares as blasphemous those who say the Son was born from any other substance and not from God.

226
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:44,440
Therefore, since He was not made from nothing, nor from anywhere other than God, it is beyond doubt that what exists is of God.

227
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:53,094
The essence of the only begotten Son is not generated from non-existent things or from anything other than the unbegotten and eternal substance of the Father.

228
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:59,283
It also rejects intervals of time and ages, so that He who does not differ by nature cannot be separated by time.

229
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:01,638
God is only one; how can many be spoken of?

230
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:06,020
The faith mentioned above proclaims the one substance of the Father and the Son.

231
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:13,852
In every possible way, wherever concerns might arise, all approaches of the heretics are blocked so that no diversity is proclaimed in the Son.

232
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:28,805
It condemns those who say there are three gods because, according to the truth of nature, this substance does not accept a number of names unless, as it is in humans and angels, where a name is given from the honor of merits, yet the substance differs between them and God.

233
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,503
Therefore, there are many gods.

234
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:36,747
However, in the nature of God, there is only one God; yet the Son is also God because His nature is not different.

235
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:42,553
And since God is from God, both must be God, whose essence is not distinguished by any difference in kind.

236
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:48,920
The significance of the name is overlooked in naming because there's no variation in nature's quality.

237
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:57,430
Thus, it's a curse to invoke gods or deny the Son as God, clearly showing that the shared name represents a substance that is consistent in its attributes.

238
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:07,368
In acknowledging God the Father, who was not born, and God the Son, the only begotten, since neither differs in essence, both are God, yet God is to be believed and declared as one.

239
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:16,592
Therefore, with great care and diligence, the bishops' faith emphasizes the sameness in nature between the begotten and the begetter, reinforcing the unity of the name.

240
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:21,588
However, faith doesn't rightly teach that the solitary God is the Son, who is born of will.

241
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:36,028
Yet, to prevent the proclamation of one God from affirming the solitary God's substance as unique and without offspring, it immediately rejects this rashness, which would, because God is one, confess one solitary God the Father, embodying both the Father and Son.

242
00:35:36,028 --> 00:35:42,781
Since in the generating Father and the born Son, God would be declared one due to their nature's substance being identical.

243
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:48,930
The holy faith does not recognize the Son as unbegotten, as the nature of the Son is inherently linked to birth.

244
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,903
Moreover, His nature is so perfectly of birth that He, being born from God's substance, is also born from His will and counsel.

245
00:35:55,903 --> 00:36:03,206
For from will and counsel, not from physical nature, the absolute perfection of God's essence, born from God's essence, is fulfilled.

246
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:10,178
Therefore, it's appropriate to reconsider the faith that wasn't recorded long ago when Photinus was removed from his bishopric.

247
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:17,768
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, creator and originator, from whom every fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named.

248
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:28,967
And in His only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was born from the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, through whom all things were made in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.

249
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:38,946
He is the Word, the wisdom, the power, the life, and the true light, who in the last days became incarnate for us, was born of the holy Virgin, was crucified, died, and was buried.

250
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:44,934
He also rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father.

251
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:53,250
He will come at the end of the world to judge the living and the dead and to repay each according to their deeds, with a kingdom that endures forever.

252
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,239
He will be at the right hand of the Father, not only in this world but also in the future.

253
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:10,824
And in the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, whom He promised to the Apostles after He ascended to heaven, sent to teach them and remind them of everything, through whom the souls of those who sincerely believe in Him are sanctified.

254
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:11,046
One.

255
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:22,189
But those who say: The Son is from nothing, or from another substance, and not from God; and that there was a time or age when He did not exist: the holy and catholic Church knows them to be strangers.

256
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:22,411
Two.

257
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:26,735
If anyone says that the Father and the Son are two gods: let them be accursed.

258
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:27,068
Three.

259
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:37,324
And if anyone, saying there is one God, does not confess that Christ, the God before ages, was the Son of God obedient to the Father in the creation of all things: let them be accursed.

260
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:37,601
Four.

261
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:43,422
And if anyone dares to say that the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary: let them be accursed.

262
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:43,700
Five.

263
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:54,399
And if anyone says that the Son is from Mary according to foreknowledge or predestination, and not born from the Father before ages, and through whom all things were made: let them be accursed.

264
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:54,621
Six.

265
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:59,334
If anyone says that the substance of God expands and contracts: let them be accursed.

266
00:37:59,334 --> 00:37:59,666
Seven.

267
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:08,684
If anyone claims that the Son of God is a spread-out substance or refers to the width of His substance as the Son, let them be cursed.

268
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:13,795
If anyone describes the Son of God as an implanted or spoken word, let them be cursed.

269
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:18,372
If anyone says that the Son born of Mary is merely a man, let them be cursed.

270
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:25,266
If anyone suggests that God and the man born of Mary perceives God as unbegotten in this manner, let them be cursed.

271
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:34,241
If anyone hears The Word became flesh (John 1:14) and believes the Word was transformed into flesh or took on flesh through change, let them be cursed.

272
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:44,048
If anyone hears that the only Son of God was crucified and claims His divinity experienced corruption, suffering, change, diminishment, or death, let them be cursed.

273
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:53,261
If anyone interprets Let us make man (Genesis 1:26) as not being spoken by the Father to the Son, but rather that God spoke to Himself, let them be cursed.

274
00:38:53,261 --> 00:39:01,344
If anyone argues that the Son was not seen by Abraham (Genesis 18), but instead the unbegotten God or a part of Him, let them be cursed.

275
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:10,140
If anyone claims that Jacob did not wrestle with the Son as a man (Genesis 32:24), but with the unbegotten God or a part of Him, let them be cursed.

276
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:20,304
If anyone does not interpret The Lord rained from the Lord (Genesis 19:24) as referring to the Son and the Father, but believes He rained from Himself, let them be cursed.

277
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:23,454
For the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father.

278
00:39:23,454 --> 00:39:30,051
If anyone calls the Lord and Lord, Father and Son (since the Lord from the Lord), two gods, let them be cursed.

279
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:35,460
We do not equate the Son with the Father or compare them but understand Him as subordinate.

280
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:50,438
For He did not descend into Sodom without the Father's will; nor did He rain from Himself, but from the Lord, by the authority of the Father; nor does He sit at the right hand by Himself, but hears the Father saying, Sit at my right hand (Psalm 110:1).

281
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:55,965
If anyone claims the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one person, let them be cursed.

282
00:39:55,965 --> 00:40:02,444
If anyone refers to the Holy Spirit as the paraclete and claims He is the unbegotten God, let them be cursed.

283
00:40:03,335 --> 00:41:46,319
If anyone, as the Lord taught us, does not recognize that the Advocate is distinct from the Son, for He said, "And the Father will send you another Advocate, whom I will ask" John 14:16, let them be cursed.
If anyone claims that the Holy Spirit is a part of the Father or the Son, let them be cursed.
If anyone asserts that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three gods, let them be cursed.
If anyone interprets the words, "I am the first God, and I am the last God, and besides me, there is no God" Isaiah 44:6, in a way that undermines the only-begotten God before the ages, let them be cursed.
If anyone claims that the Son is created by the will of God as if He were merely a part of creation, let them be cursed.
If anyone says that the Son was born against the will of the Father, let them be cursed.
For the Father was neither compelled against His will nor driven by necessity to beget the Son when He did not desire to.
But as soon as He willed, He showed that He begot Him from Himself, without time and without suffering.
If anyone claims the Son is unbegotten and without beginning, suggesting two without beginning, two unbegotten, and two uncreated, making two gods, let them be cursed.
For the Head, which is the beginning of all, is the Son; the Head, which is the beginning of Christ, is God.
Thus, we refer all things to the one who is without beginning, the beginning of all, through the Son.
And again, affirming the understanding of Christianity, we say that if anyone does not acknowledge that Christ is God, the Son of God, existing before the ages and serving the Father for the perfection of all things, but claims that from the time He was born of Mary, He was named Christ and Son, and began to be God, let them be cursed.
The many deceptions of Photinus are refuted.

284
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,602
The Son is not different from the Father in substance or time.

285
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:56,962
As the situation evolved, those gathered found it necessary to provide a more detailed explanation of faith, addressing multiple questions.

286
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:03,315
This was because the heresy revived by Photinus was attempting to infiltrate the Catholic Church in various subtle ways.

287
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:13,269
This was done so that every form of pure and unblemished faith could stand against each type of heretical deception, matching every affirmation of faith to the opportunities for treachery.

288
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:19,835
Following that comprehensive explanation of the sacraments, the foundation for explaining faith against heretics began here.

289
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:30,848
But those who claim that the Son comes from nonexistence, or from another substance and not from God, and that there was a time when he did not exist, are considered outsiders by the holy and Catholic Church.

290
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,860
What room is there for ambiguity here?

291
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,401
What remains of the conscience of sincere faith?

292
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:40,325
The Son is not from nonexistent things, ensuring he does not have an origin from nothingness.

293
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:46,944
He does not originate from any other substance except that of God, so nothing else is inherent in him but all that is of God.

294
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:51,709
Since he does not originate from nothing, he does not derive his existence from elsewhere.

295
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:55,309
He does not differ in time, making the Son timeless with the Father.

296
00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:08,016
Therefore, everything is inseparable between the unbegotten Father and the only-begotten Son, as the equality in time, through the very sameness of the existing Father from whom the nativity is derived, does not distinguish them in essence.

297
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:12,252
If anyone claims that the Father and the Son are two gods, let them be accursed.

298
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:22,312
And if anyone, while professing there is one God, does not acknowledge that Christ, before the ages, as the Son of God, obeyed the Father in the creation of all things, let them be accursed.

299
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:26,230
Just as they are one in essence, they are also one in the kind of essence.

300
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,048
The devout profession of the name provides us with complete understanding of these matters.

301
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:40,123
It's important to understand that while it's wrong to claim the Father and the Son are two separate gods, it's also incorrect to deny that the Son is God.

302
00:43:40,123 --> 00:43:45,893
So, when discussing two gods, we exclude the idea of different substances that are separate from each other.

303
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:51,182
There's no other essence besides that of God the Father, from which the eternal Son of God is born.

304
00:43:51,182 --> 00:43:58,447
Although we must acknowledge God the Father and proclaim Christ, the Son of God, as God, recognizing two gods is considered irreligious.

305
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:01,973
They can only be one in essence because their essence is singular.

306
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:07,049
If anyone claims that the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary, let them be anathema.

307
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,560
The Son and the Father are not the same person.

308
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,207
This contradicts those who say the Son only existed before Mary through predestination.

309
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:25,907
To prevent heretics from saying the unborn God, or a part of Him, was born of Mary due to differences in the named essence of the Father and the Son, a decisive judgment was made that whoever confesses this is anathema.

310
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:37,447
The unity of the name, based on the essence of an undifferentiated nature, doesn't eliminate the personhood of the begotten essence, so the substance of the one unique God is understood through the unity of the name.

311
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:44,873
The name of both essences, that is, the one God, is proclaimed because of the indistinguishable substance of their undifferentiated nature.

312
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:55,932
If anyone says that the Son existed only through foreknowledge and predestination before Mary, and was not born of the Father before all ages, and that all things were made through Him, let them be anathema.

313
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:07,253
The Son of God, our God of all, before being born in the flesh, is understood not to exist according to foreknowledge and predestination, rather than according to the essence of His existing nature.

314
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:14,300
This is due to the Father's foreknowledge, as He predestined Him to exist at a specific time, specifically to be born of a virgin.

315
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:19,342
He was announced to us, rather than existing from eternity in the substance of divine nature.

316
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:28,178
All the things He spoke through the prophets about the mysteries of His incarnation and passion were spoken by the Father according to the foreknowledge about Him.

317
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:41,514
Therefore, the perversity of this doctrine is condemned, which claims that the only-begotten Son of God is known to us, born from the Father before all ages, and creating the ages themselves with all creatures, rather than predestined to be born.

318
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:45,905
If anyone says the substance of God can expand or contract, let them be anathema.

319
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:48,399
Expansion and contraction do not apply to God.

320
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:51,218
Neither is the Son an expansion of divine substance.

321
00:45:51,218 --> 00:46:00,108
Contracting and expanding are physical experiences, but God, who is spirit and moves as He wills, does not expand or contract Himself through a change of substance.

322
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:07,209
Remaining free beyond the necessity of physical nature, He provides what He wills, when He wills, and where He wills, from Himself.

323
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:12,197
Therefore, it is impious to attribute a change of substance to such a great power's freedom.

324
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:19,298
If anyone says that the Son makes the substance of God expand, or calls the breadth of His substance the Son, let them be anathema.

325
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:25,912
The previous statement, even if it intended to teach about the unchangeable God, set the stage for this subsequent heresy.

326
00:46:25,912 --> 00:46:37,188
For some have dared to extend the unborn God up to the holy Virgin by an expansion of substance, suggesting that the breadth drawn out by a certain aspect of His nature, assuming man, might be called the Son.

327
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:40,657
Nor was the Son, perfect God before all ages, later born as man.

328
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:47,162
The whole of this the Catholic faith condemns, in which the Father is said to be changeable, and the born Son is denied.

329
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:54,184
If anyone claims that the Son, the Word of God, is merely an implanted or expressed word: let them be cursed.

330
00:46:54,184 --> 00:46:56,975
How heretics proclaim the Son of God as the Word.

331
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:58,854
The Son from Mary is God and man.

332
00:46:58,854 --> 00:47:10,017
Heretics, as much as they can, deny the Son of God, asserting that he is merely a word, specifically a spoken word from the mouth of a speaker, and an incorporeal sound of a non-substantial voice.

333
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:17,137
They claim that for God the Father, the Son is this kind of word, expressed in sound through our inherent nature of speaking.

334
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:26,307
Therefore, this entire deceit is condemned: claiming the Word of God, which was in the beginning with God, is just like a word of implanted and expressed speech.

335
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:30,408
If anyone says that the Son from Mary is only a man: let them be cursed.

336
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:33,654
We proclaim the Son of God from Mary as both man and God.

337
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:46,014
But to ensure what we proclaim as God and man does not become an opportunity for deceit, it is immediately added:
If anyone says that God and man born from Mary, understanding God to be unbegotten: let them be cursed.

338
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:49,146
The Son is distinguished from the Father only by birth.

339
00:47:49,146 --> 00:47:51,197
Taking on flesh, he was not changed.

340
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:53,532
The substance retains its name and power.

341
00:47:53,532 --> 00:48:15,688
Since it is cursed to say the Son of God from Mary is a man without God; and it is under the same judgment to say that in man God is unbegotten: it is not said that God, who is in man, is not God; but the unbegotten God is denied, distinguished from the Father by the Son not by the name of nature, because there is no diversity of substance, but only by the authority of being unbegotten.

342
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:47,355
If anyone hearing "The Word became flesh," thinks that the Word was transformed into flesh or says that it took on flesh by changing: let them be cursed.
The deity did not suffer corruption when the Son of God was crucified.
The dignity of divinity is preserved: so that in what "The Word became flesh" means, while the Word became flesh, it did not lose what it was as the Word through the flesh, nor was it transformed into flesh, so that it would cease to be the Word; rather, the Word became flesh, so that the flesh would begin to be what the Word is.

343
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:59,136
Otherwise, how could the flesh possess virtues in its actions, find glory on the mountain, understand the thoughts of human hearts, offer security in suffering, and embody life in death?

344
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:04,003
Yet, God, who undergoes no change, lost none of His goodness when He became flesh.

345
00:49:04,003 --> 00:49:04,181
12.

346
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:14,925
If anyone hears that the only Son of God was crucified and claims that His divinity suffered corruption, changeability, alteration, diminishment, or destruction: let them be cursed.

347
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:15,103
49.

348
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:17,002
What suffering and passion mean.

349
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:18,901
The Son appeared to the fathers.

350
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:24,481
It is clearly shown why the Word, even though it became flesh, was not transformed into flesh.

351
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:31,900
While these forms of suffering affect the weakness of the flesh, God, the Word made flesh, could not be altered by suffering.

352
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:39,736
Suffering and being changed are not the same because suffering of any kind changes the perception, pain, and endurance of all flesh.

353
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:46,918
However, the Word that became flesh, although it subjected itself to suffering, was not altered by the ability to suffer.

354
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:57,899
It could endure suffering, but it was not subject to the ability to suffer because the ability to suffer indicates a weak nature; whereas suffering is the endurance of inflicted things.

355
00:49:57,899 --> 00:50:06,327
Since God is unchangeable, when the Word became flesh, it contained the potential for suffering without the weakness of the ability to suffer.

356
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:16,062
Therefore, the nature remains unchangeable even in suffering, because it originates from a substance that is indifferent to its Creator, from an impassible essence.

357
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:16,240
13.

358
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:25,440
If anyone says that the words "Let us make man" (Genesis 1:26) were not spoken by the Father to the Son, but that God spoke to Himself: let them be cursed.

359
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:25,618
14.

360
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:34,640
If anyone does not say that the Son appeared to Abraham (Genesis 17:1), but instead says it was the unbegotten God or a part of Him: let them be cursed.

361
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:34,818
15.

362
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:43,662
If anyone says that it was not the Son who wrestled with Jacob as a man (Genesis 32:26), but the unbegotten God or a part of Him: let them be cursed.

363
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:43,840
16.

364
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:53,990
If anyone does not understand "The Lord rained from the Lord" (Genesis 19:24) to refer to the Son and the Father, but says that He rained from Himself: let them be cursed.

365
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,136
For the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father.

366
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:57,314
50.

367
00:50:58,679 --> 00:50:59,660
Photinus' Opinion.

368
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,922
Because Photinus, against whom the meeting was convened, denied these things, they needed to be added to the faith.

369
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:19,808
This was to ensure that no one would dare to proclaim the Son of God merely as the son of the virgin, and to prevent attributing all the superior qualities, unique to the Son of God, solely to God the Unbegotten, in a foolish display of heretical madness.

370
00:51:19,808 --> 00:51:24,436
While referring these things to the Father, they would deny the substance to the Son.

371
00:51:24,436 --> 00:51:29,120
Since these issues have been resolved, they left us no need to interpret them further.

372
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:36,743
If anyone says that there are two gods, referring to Lord and Lord, Father and Son, because the Lord is from the Lord, let them be accursed.

373
00:51:36,743 --> 00:51:42,080
We do not make the Son equal or comparable to the Father; rather, we understand Him to be subject.

374
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:49,703
He did not descend to Sodom without the Father's will; nor did He rain down on His own, but from the Lord, with the authority of the Father.

375
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:57,000
Nor does He sit at the right hand by Himself, but hears the Father saying, "Sit at my right hand" (Psalm One Hundred Nine, verse one).

376
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,124
This definition is free from suspicion.

377
00:51:59,124 --> 00:52:03,317
The Son, while not equated with the Father, maintains the equality of nature.

378
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:14,535
Both the preceding and following statements completely exclude any suspicion that might arise from these words, ensuring that a diversity of dissimilar deities is not preached in referring to Lord and Lord.

379
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:18,836
In this, He is not compared, because it is impious to claim there are two gods.

380
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:25,317
But this does not mean the Son is not compared or equated with the Father, lest He be considered not to be God Himself.

381
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:32,668
Since it is anathema to deny Christ as God, it cannot be deemed profane to name two gods, so that Christ might also be preached as God.

382
00:52:32,668 --> 00:52:40,564
By the property of natural essence, therefore, there is one God, because from God the Father, who is one God, the only begotten Son, God is born.

383
00:52:40,564 --> 00:52:43,886
He has no other source than from God, that He is what God is.

384
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:51,346
Because of the indistinguishable essence of Him who is begotten from Him who begot, there cannot be an indifferent single name of nature.

385
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:59,152
In this significant way, the Son is neither compared nor equated with the Father while he remains subject through obedience.

386
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:03,757
The Lord reigns by the Lord's will, not from himself, as per Photinus or Sabellius.

387
00:53:03,757 --> 00:53:06,864
He sits at the right hand of God when he is told to sit.

388
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:11,747
He is sent, he receives, and in all things, he follows the will of the one who sent him.

389
00:53:11,747 --> 00:53:17,740
However, this submission in piety does not diminish his essence, nor does religious duty degrade his nature.

390
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:23,455
Thus, both the unbegotten Father is God, and the only begotten Son of God is God, yet there is one God.

391
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:28,116
The submission of the Son is taught alongside his dignity, even as he is called Son.

392
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:31,611
Although it is of God the Father, it is still a name by nature.

393
00:53:31,611 --> 00:53:39,657
Having this name, he submits to the Father both in obedience and in name, demonstrating that the submission bears witness to the natural essence.

394
00:53:39,657 --> 00:53:43,763
If anyone says the Father and the Son are one person: let him be accursed.

395
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:46,093
The Father and the Son are not one person.

396
00:53:46,093 --> 00:53:51,975
Absolute perversity doesn't require contradiction, yet some have dared to claim one person from two names.

397
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:56,968
If anyone says the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is the unbegotten God: let him be accursed.

398
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:59,299
The Holy Spirit is not the unbegotten God.

399
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:00,852
He is distinct from the Son.

400
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:04,626
Claiming the Comforter as the unbegotten God is subject to anathema.

401
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:09,730
It is impious to say that the unbegotten God is the one sent by the Son for our consolation.

402
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:19,995
If anyone, as the Lord taught us, does not say the Comforter is other than the Son; for he said: And he will send you another Comforter, whom I will ask the Father: let him be accursed.

403
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:25,266
We remember that the Comforter was sent by the Son, and this is what faith initially explained.

404
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:34,033
Yet, because the Son often said through the power of indistinguishable nature that his works are the works of the Father, saying: I do the works of my Father.

405
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:38,040
He will also send the Comforter, as he often promised.

406
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:44,821
Sometimes he mentioned that the Comforter would be sent by the Father, as he usually referred all his actions to the Father.

407
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:49,087
This has led some heretics to claim that he himself is the Son, the Comforter.

408
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:56,907
However, by saying another Comforter will be sent by the Father, he highlights the distinction between the one sending and the one being asked.

409
00:54:56,907 --> 00:55:02,102
If anyone claims that the Holy Spirit is a part of the Father or the Son, let them be anathema.

410
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:05,110
The Holy Spirit is not a part of the Father or the Son.

411
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:10,195
The absurdity of heretical thinking has made it necessary to clarify this, not as a question.

412
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:25,562
Since the name of the Holy Spirit has its own meaning, and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, has his own substance, role, and order, and since the Father and Son are consistently described as unchangeable, how can the Holy Spirit be considered a part of either the Father or the Son?

413
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:30,921
But because this idea is often put forward by the impious, it had to be rejected by the holy ones.

414
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:35,569
If anyone says the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three gods, let them be anathema.

415
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,538
The concept of three gods is denied.

416
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:43,389
Claiming two gods is irreligious, as we remember and proclaim that only one God is acknowledged everywhere.

417
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:48,311
How much more condemnable is the notion of three gods in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?

418
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:51,373
Because heretics say this, Catholics rightly condemn it.

419
00:55:51,373 --> 00:56:05,591
If anyone interprets the statement, 'I am the first God, and I am the last God, and besides me, there is no God' (Isaiah 44:6), as being solely against idols and false gods, in a Jewish sense against the only-begotten God before the ages, let them be anathema.

420
00:56:05,591 --> 00:56:09,365
The phrase 'There is no God besides me' does not deny the Son as God.

421
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:15,216
With the multitude of gods condemned and only one God acknowledged, the Son of God cannot be denied as God.

422
00:56:15,216 --> 00:56:21,341
Truly, this affirms the true essence of nature: the name, which is not meant to be numbered, belongs to essence.

423
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:28,559
What is not God besides me cannot take away from the Son what is God, because there is no other God, except the one who is from God.

424
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:35,675
Through the voice of God the Father, it is impossible for Him not to be God, as He is born from His own essence.

425
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:40,986
This is why the Jews refer to the union with God, because they do not know the only-begotten God.

426
00:56:40,986 --> 00:56:52,210
When we deny the existence of two gods, we reject any difference in the natural essence between the Father and the Son, because the phrase there is no God besides me dispels the false belief in other gods.

427
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:59,273
While confessing one God, we also identify the Son as God; we proclaim no difference in substance between the two under one name.

428
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:05,788
If anyone claims that the Son was created from the will of God as if He were just another creature, let them be cursed.

429
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:09,839
The Son is from God's substance, unlike creatures that come from His will.

430
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:17,723
God's will brought substance to all creatures, but He gave nature to the Son through a perfect birth from an unchanging and uncreated substance.

431
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:23,636
For all things were created as God intended; however, the Son, being born from God, exists just as God does.

432
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:33,272
Nature did not produce something unlike itself; born from God's substance, the Son carries the essence of nature according to origin, not according to creatures, from the will.

433
00:57:33,272 --> 00:57:37,543
If anyone says the Son was born unwillingly by the Father, let them be cursed.

434
00:57:37,543 --> 00:57:48,986
The Father was not forced or driven by any natural necessity to unwillingly beget the Son; rather, He desired it instantly, without time and without suffering, to present Him as the only-begotten from Himself.

435
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:51,504
Thus, the Son is not from an unwilling Father.

436
00:57:51,504 --> 00:58:07,546
Since the Son is taught to exist not from will, like everything else, so that He might have essence not only according to will but also according to nature, it seemed to give heretics the chance to claim that God the Father had to generate the Son from Himself, as if compelled by natural law.

437
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:19,208
But this is not the condition of the Father in God: for in the indescribable and perfect birth of the Son, neither did will alone generate the Son, nor was the essence of natural law changed or coerced by command.

438
00:58:19,919 --> 00:58:28,298
The essence wasn't created, nor is the nature of the creator different from what's created, and there's no solitude in the name of the Father in time.

439
00:58:28,298 --> 00:58:36,230
Long before all times, the Father, from His own nature, willingly and without suffering, bestowed upon the Son the essence of a natural birth.

440
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:45,111
If anyone claims that the Son is unbegotten and without beginning, suggesting two beings without beginning, two unbegotten, and two gods, let them be accursed.

441
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:49,468
For the head, the beginning of all, is the Son, but the head of Christ is God.

442
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:54,383
Thus, we trace everything back to one unbegotten, the beginning of all, through the Son.

443
00:58:54,383 --> 00:58:57,567
The unity of God doesn't permit the Son to be unbegotten.

444
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,415
Confessing the Son as unbegotten is deeply impious.

445
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:06,727
Then there wouldn't be one God: because the nature of the one unbegotten God requires that one God be proclaimed.

446
00:59:06,727 --> 00:59:17,843
Therefore, since there is one God, there can't be two unbegotten beings: this is why God is one (since both the Father is God, and the Son of God is God), because unbegottenness belongs to one alone.

447
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:21,641
The Son is God because He exists from the essence of the unbegotten.

448
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:28,008
Therefore, holy faith rejects the idea of an unbegotten Son; so through one unbegotten God, one God is proclaimed.

449
00:59:28,008 --> 00:59:34,599
The only-begotten nature, generated from the unbegotten essence, is encompassed in the name of the one unbegotten God.

450
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:38,118
For the Son is the head of all, but the head of the Son is God.

451
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:46,888
Everything is referred to one God by this order and confession: since all things begin from Him, of whom He Himself is the beginning, namely, God the Father.

452
00:59:46,888 --> 01:00:05,376
Again, to affirm the understanding of Christianity, we say: if anyone does not acknowledge that Christ is God, the Son of God existing before the ages and serving the Father for the perfection of all, but claims that He was named Christ and Son only from the time He was born of Mary and began to be God then, let them be accursed.

453
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:06,661
The heresy of Photinus.

454
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,225
The main point of our faith.

455
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:20,290
It was necessary to conclude the condemnation of his heresy, for which the assembly was convened, with a full exposition of the faith it opposed; which falsely claimed that the Son of God began with the Virgin birth.

456
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:34,193
This is the main point of our faith according to the teachings of the gospel and the apostles:
Our Lord Jesus Christ, God and Son of God, should not be separated from the Father in any aspect-whether in honor, authority, substance, or time.

457
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:34,733
Sixty-two.

458
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:37,162
The challenge of discussing God in few words.

459
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:48,227
The truth has been pursued, as understood, through the guidance and opinions of bishops, and explained through individual written professions of faith, with every kind of impious proclamation extinguished.

460
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:54,434
For the infinite and immense God cannot be fully expressed or comprehended by the brief statements of human speech.

461
01:00:54,434 --> 01:01:04,365
Often, the brevity of words misleads both listeners and teachers:
Conciseness can lead to misunderstanding, or the intended meaning can be distorted and not clearly resolved by reason.

462
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:19,963
Thus, with understanding, bishops have used many definitions and more abundant words to teach:
So that they might instill the truth through various distinctions for the listeners and avoid anything dangerous or obscure about divine matters in this multifaceted resolution of many opinions.

463
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:20,611
Sixty-three.

464
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:21,583
Faith in the East.

465
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,472
Frequently explained; sound in few.

466
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:23,849
Hosius.

467
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:25,469
Forced subscriptions of faith.

468
01:01:25,469 --> 01:01:27,682
Westerners are unaware of written faiths.

469
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:35,508
It shouldn't seem strange to you, dearest brothers, that faith has been explained so frequently:
This necessity arises from the threat of heresy.

470
01:01:35,508 --> 01:01:43,550
The danger in the Eastern Churches is so significant that it is rare to find priests or people of this faith, which you should assess for yourselves.

471
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:52,024
Authority has been wrongly given to some for impiety:
And with the exile of bishops, whose cause you are aware of, the strength of the profane has increased.

472
01:01:52,024 --> 01:02:00,336
I am not speaking of foreign matters, nor am I writing about unknown things:
I have witnessed the faults of the present, not of laypeople, but of bishops.

473
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:07,628
Without Bishop Eleusius and a few others with him, most of the ten provinces of Asia, where I live, do not truly know God.

474
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:13,530
I almost wish they didn't know Him at all; it would be easier to forgive them for ignorance than for opposition.

475
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:20,223
But the distress of these bishops cannot be contained, and they seek the unity of faith that they lost long ago through others.

476
01:02:20,223 --> 01:02:29,286
The initial faith presented had this necessity because at Sirmium, through forgetting his actions and words, Hosius introduced a new and long-simmering doctrine of impiety.

477
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:34,503
I won't dwell on him, leaving him to judgment so it may be known what kind of person he was before.

478
01:02:34,503 --> 01:02:37,875
Everywhere you look, there are scandals, schisms, and betrayals.

479
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:43,567
As a result, some who had previously written otherwise were compelled to subscribe to a profession of faith.

480
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:50,891
I don't criticize the most patient Eastern bishops, for whom the profession of faith, following the intention of blasphemy, was sufficient.

481
01:02:50,891 --> 01:02:57,584
It seems a cause for rejoicing that in such heretical stubbornness among blaspheming bishops, someone is welcomed as repentant.

482
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:08,492
But in the midst of these things, blessed and glorious are you in the Lord, who maintain the perfect and apostolic faith with a clear conscience, and have not required written professions of faith until now!

483
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:11,864
You did not need the letter because you were abundant in spirit.

484
01:03:11,864 --> 01:03:18,082
Nor did you desire to write it down, for what you believed in your heart, you professed with your mouth for salvation.

485
01:03:18,082 --> 01:03:21,982
You did not need to read from a bishop what newly baptized believers held.

486
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:25,723
But necessity led to the custom of explaining and subscribing to faith.

487
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:29,886
Where the sense of conscience is at risk, that's where the letter is necessary.

488
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:33,838
And surely, there is no hindrance in writing what is beneficial to confess.

489
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:46,748
Hilary's faith concerning the Father and the Son: We indeed confess, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, always innocent, and willingly write, not of two gods, but of one God: and not without acknowledging God the Son of God; for He is God from God.

490
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:52,467
There aren't two who are unbegotten, because by the authority of being unbegotten, God is one.

491
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:57,654
This doesn't mean the Only Begotten isn't God; in fact, his origin is from the unbegotten substance.

492
01:03:57,654 --> 01:04:00,818
While they aren't one being, their substance isn't different.

493
01:04:00,818 --> 01:04:06,627
The name of God isn't applied to different natures, but to the indistinguishable essence of one name and nature.

494
01:04:06,627 --> 01:04:12,333
No one is superior to the other in terms of substance, but one is subject to the other by the nature of birth.

495
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:17,260
The Father is greater because He is the Father, and the Son isn't lesser because He is the Son.

496
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,543
The meaning differs, but the nature doesn't.

497
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:24,315
The Father isn't confined by time, yet the Son isn't denied being coeternal with the Father.

498
01:04:24,315 --> 01:04:33,288
The Father is proclaimed in the Son because the Son has nothing dissimilar to the Father: the Son is confessed in the Father because what the Son is comes from nowhere else.

499
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:45,788
They're aware of their mutual and similar nature because they are equal; they don't think they are one because they are one; they are proclaimed as one through the consistency of their indistinguishable nature, so they aren't a single being.

500
01:04:45,788 --> 01:04:48,019
Words may fail Hilary, but not the meaning.

501
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:55,799
I've explained, dear ones, as much as human language allows, and the Lord, as He knows, has always granted my prayers, the conscience of common faith.

502
01:04:55,799 --> 01:05:02,542
And if anything is lacking, indeed because almost nothing has been said, remember it's not the meaning but the words that fail me.

503
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:13,123
Perhaps I may criticize my nature in this, but I don't criticize my will: and I forgive my nature if it cannot speak of God as it wishes, for it's sufficient for salvation to believe in the things of God.

504
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:15,353
He moves on to another part of the booklet.

505
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,873
Before reaching a conclusion, avoid making judgments.

506
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:23,616
As far as I know, neither my faith nor yours is at risk before God for five hundred years.

507
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:28,570
I've shown you, as you requested, what the earlier faith was according to the Eastern bishops.

508
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,209
I'll briefly reiterate, as this represents the faith of only a few bishops among the many Eastern Churches.

509
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:38,636
I've also explained my beliefs about divine matters according to apostolic teaching.

510
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:48,175
It's important for you to understand, without any suspicion, the things that might lead us astray from the simplicity of truth, since there's no longer a reason to listen otherwise.

511
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:56,449
Although I'm not worried about being judged based on the entirety of the faith, I still hope to be judged fairly about myself, unless everything is resolved.

512
01:05:56,449 --> 01:06:43,143
When "Homousion" is preached correctly,
many of us, dear brothers, declare that the Father and the Son are of one substance, but it's important to ensure this declaration is made with true piety.
This term holds both the conscience of faith and the potential for deceit.
If likeness in nature means not just form but essence, then we can faithfully proclaim one substance, provided we understand it as the likeness of nature's property.
This means their oneness signifies equality, not singularity.
By equality, I mean an indifference in likeness, so that likeness is seen as equality.
Thus, equality is termed one because it is equal.
However, claiming oneness does not imply a single entity.
Therefore, one substance is rightly proclaimed if it neither negates a distinct person nor divides one substance into two, maintaining that by nature and birth, it is so alike it's called one.

513
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:46,793
The same voice can be misinterpreted in three different ways.

514
01:06:46,793 --> 01:07:02,988
When we say the Father and the Son are of one substance, implying they exist separately yet are one and the same under two different names:
we must not think of the Son as merely a name without acknowledging this unity, if we claim the same unique and singular essence for both the Father and the Son.

515
01:07:02,988 --> 01:07:09,659
This misunderstanding can lead to the idea that the Father is divided from himself, separating a part of himself as the Son.

516
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:16,922
Heretics often assert this by claiming one substance, and they find our confession appealing because it can be vague and lead to error.

517
01:07:16,922 --> 01:07:29,512
Another error suggests that when we say the Father and the Son are of one substance, it implies a prior substance from which they both derive equally:
thus suggesting three entities: one substance and two inheritors of that substance.

518
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:35,915
Just as two co-heirs share an inheritance that existed before them, two equals might appear to share a prior substance.

519
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:49,795
However, asserting a single substance for the Father and the Son might imply:
either one entity with two names, or a divided substance creating two incomplete substances, or a third prior substance used by both, thus called one because it was split into two.

520
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:52,163
In this case, where is the concept of birth?

521
01:07:52,163 --> 01:07:59,695
How do we understand the Father and the Son if they are seen more as a division or sharing of a prior substance rather than a natural birth?

522
01:07:59,695 --> 01:08:24,067
Where can "Homousion" be safely affirmed?
With such significant dangers to faith, we must be careful with our language;
so that what is understood piously is not spoken impiously, and an innocent conscience does not become guilty due to heretical interpretations.
When a Catholic speaks of one substance of the Father and the Son, he should not begin with this concept:
nor consider it the most crucial aspect, as if without it, true faith cannot exist.

523
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:35,772
He confidently asserts one substance, having previously mentioned that the Father is unbegotten; the Son is born, existing from the Father and akin to the Father in power, honor, and nature.

524
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:45,397
He is subject to the Father as his source: he did not consider equality with God, in whose form he remained, as something to be seized; he was obedient unto death.

525
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:47,700
He is not from nothing, but is a birth.

526
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,826
He is not unbegotten, but coeternal.

527
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,543
He is not the Father, but is the Son from him.

528
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:54,373
He is not a part, but is whole.

529
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:59,570
He is not the author himself, but is an image: the image of God from God, born into God.

530
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,519
He is not a creature, but is God.

531
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:07,424
Not another God in the kind of substance, but one God through the essence of an identical substance.

532
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:14,038
God is not one person, but nature: because nothing different and dissimilar exists in the born and the begetter.

533
01:09:14,038 --> 01:09:22,660
And after these explanations, by declaring one substance of the Father and the Son, he does not err: or by denying one substance, he already sins.

534
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,848
Let it not be preached simply and before other things.

535
01:09:25,848 --> 01:09:32,699
Therefore, let no one think that one substance is denied by us: for its reasoning is shown so that it is not denied.

536
01:09:32,699 --> 01:09:40,789
Let no one think that one substance should be preached in a brief and bare manner: so that it can be reverently said to be one substance.

537
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:47,639
For I do not hear, Christ was born of Mary; unless I also hear, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.

538
01:09:47,639 --> 01:09:54,725
John 1:1
I do not hear, Christ was hungry; unless after forty days of fasting I hear, Man shall not live by bread alone.

539
01:09:54,725 --> 01:10:01,930
Matthew 4:4
I do not hear, he was thirsty; unless I hear, Whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never thirst.

540
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:08,307
John 4:13
I do not hear, Christ suffered; unless I hear, Now is the time for the Son of Man to be glorified.

541
01:10:08,307 --> 01:10:12,087
John 12:23
I do not hear, he died; unless I hear, he rose again.

542
01:10:12,087 --> 01:10:19,705
Let us not present anything solitary from the divine sacraments to the suspicion of listeners and to the occasion of blasphemers.

543
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:30,570
Before the birth of the Son, before subjection, before the similarity of nature must be preached: so that it is not impiously preached that the Father and the Son are of one substance.

544
01:10:31,751 --> 01:10:41,771
I don't understand why it's considered most important and necessary to proclaim something above all else that cannot be piously proclaimed first, and must impiously be denied afterward.

545
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:45,454
It can be spoken of piously, and it can also be left unsaid piously.

546
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:53,037
It's not, dear brothers, about denying that the Father and the Son share the same essence, but it shouldn't be preached irrationally either.

547
01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:58,507
Let their essence be one due to the nature of their properties, not from division, union, or sharing.

548
01:10:58,507 --> 01:11:03,003
We can piously say they share one essence, and we can also piously leave it unsaid.

549
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:05,494
You have their birth, you have their likeness.

550
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:10,423
Why do we hold onto the word suspiciously when we don't differ in understanding the matter?

551
01:11:10,423 --> 01:11:17,085
Let us believe and say they share one essence; but through the nature of their properties, not suggesting an impious union.

552
01:11:17,085 --> 01:11:19,522
Let it be one due to likeness, not isolation.

553
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:21,797
Is the term 'homoousios' less appropriate?

554
01:11:21,797 --> 01:11:25,155
But perhaps likeness seems to hold little propriety in itself.

555
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:29,921
If this is the case, I ask how else can I equate one to another except through likeness?

556
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:32,521
Or is being similar not the same as being equal?

557
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:38,479
If I say one, it carries the suspicion of singularity; if I say similar, it implies an indifferent comparison.

558
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:45,087
Between similar and one, I ask what place equality holds, and I inquire whether it pertains more to likeness or isolation.

559
01:11:45,087 --> 01:11:49,203
There is no equality in dissimilar things, nor is there likeness within one.

560
01:11:49,203 --> 01:11:54,565
What's the difference between similar and equal, so that equal can again be distinguished from one?

561
01:11:54,565 --> 01:12:01,768
Therefore, equals are not dissimilar, and what else can similarities be but equals, when there's no equality among dissimilar things?

562
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:04,260
Likeness of nature signifies perfect equality.

563
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,860
What likeness was to Moses, equality is to John.

564
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:14,117
Therefore, dear brothers, when we proclaim the Son to be like the Father in everything, we're proclaiming nothing other than equality.

565
01:12:14,117 --> 01:12:19,046
Likeness signifies perfect equality, and this is to be understood from the holy Scriptures.

566
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:28,101
We read, "Adam lived for two hundred and thirty years, and he fathered a son in his own likeness and image, and named him Seth" (Genesis 5:3).

567
01:12:28,101 --> 01:12:31,780
I'm asking what kind of likeness and image Adam passed on to Seth.

568
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:48,953
Remove the body's weaknesses, the beginning of conception, the pains of childbirth, and all human necessities: I question whether this likeness in Seth is different by nature from his creator, or if there was a different kind of essence in both, in case Seth, born of Adam, should not have a natural essence.

569
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:54,305
But it is indeed the likeness of Adam, even if we deny it; because it is not a different nature.

570
01:12:54,305 --> 01:13:05,456
The likeness of nature did not present a different kind of nature in Seth, because Seth was not born from elsewhere: thus likeness equates things themselves by the likeness of not indifferent essence.

571
01:13:05,456 --> 01:13:12,314
Therefore, every son, according to natural birth, is the equality of the father; because it is also the likeness of nature.

572
01:13:12,314 --> 01:13:31,549
Blessed John teaches about the nature of the Father and the Son, which Moses says was the likeness in Seth and Adam, that this is the same equality of nature, for he says: "For this reason the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God" (John 5:18).

573
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:42,421
Why do we burden sluggish minds, weighed down by heavy sins, with the teachings and sayings of such great men, and tire dull and reckless minds against the indissoluble preachings of the impious?

574
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:52,569
Through Moses, Seth is the likeness of Adam; through John, the Son is equal to the Father: and we seek something unknown between the Father and the Son, which nature does not accept.

575
01:13:52,569 --> 01:14:00,263
He is like the Father, he is the son of the Father, he was born of him: through this alone can it be piously proclaimed that they are one.

576
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:02,939
Confessing likeness without equality is refuted.

577
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:08,905
Nor does it escape me, dearest Brothers, that there are some who, while confessing likeness, deny equality.

578
01:14:08,905 --> 01:14:13,922
But let them speak as they wish, and spread the poison of their blasphemy to the ignorant.

579
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:20,735
When people claim there's a difference between similarity and equality, I ask where this equality originates.

580
01:14:20,735 --> 01:14:27,161
If the Son is similar to the Father in essence, virtue, glory, and time, I question why he isn't considered equal.

581
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:35,165
This was established in the early faith as a condemnation: anyone who claims the Father has a different essence from the Son should be cursed.

582
01:14:35,165 --> 01:14:42,888
If, then, he did not give a nature different or dissimilar to the one he begot without passion, he could have only given his own essence.

583
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:47,791
Thus, similarity is a property, property is equality, and equality makes no difference.

584
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:52,470
What makes no difference is one; not by union of person, but by equality of nature.

585
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:55,514
The same virtue exists in both the Son and the Father.

586
01:14:55,514 --> 01:15:16,482
Even though, both by common sense and divine authorities, it's understood there's no difference between similarity and equality, since according to Moses and John, the Son is both similar and equal to the Father:
let's see if the Lord, when the Jews were upset because he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal to God, actually taught that he is equal to God.

587
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:21,950
He said, "The Son can do nothing by himself, but only what he sees the Father doing" (John 5:19).

588
01:15:21,950 --> 01:16:07,888
He distinguished the source by saying, "He cannot do anything by himself," signifying obedience when he added, "but only what he sees the Father doing."
It's not a difference in virtue to be unable to do anything unless he sees, because nature, rather than sight, provides virtue:
indeed, it's obedience, being able to do when he sees.
So, by the fact that he can do when he sees, he shows he doesn't receive virtue from sight, but assumes power by the authority of sight.
Therefore, the virtue of nature doesn't differ between the Father and the Son: this ability, which the Father has, is given not from an increase in nature, but from the example of the source.
Finally, the honor that submission preserved, the virtue of nature equaled.
For he submits: "For whatever he does, the Son does likewise" (John 5:19).

589
01:16:07,888 --> 01:16:09,185
Isn't similarity equal?

590
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:13,525
It is indeed equal, even if we deny it: for he does the same things likewise.

591
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:15,667
Aren't things done similarly the same?

592
01:16:16,344 --> 01:16:18,131
Do they not also embrace equality?

593
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:24,753
Or is there a difference between what is similar and what is equal, when things made in the same way are regarded as the same?

594
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:36,948
Unless perhaps someone argues that things which are the same are not equal, suggesting that similar things shouldn't be called equal: even though things made in a similar way are not only considered equal, but also seen as the same.

595
01:16:36,948 --> 01:16:38,682
Homoeusion can rightly be stated.

596
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:43,045
Therefore, Brothers, the similarity of nature is free from any suspicion of insult.

597
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:47,408
The Son cannot be seen as lacking the Father's nature simply because He is similar.

598
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:56,764
There is no similarity unless it stems from the equality of nature; however, the equality of nature cannot exist unless it is one; truly one, not by unity of person, but by kind.

599
01:16:56,764 --> 01:17:00,969
This is a pious faith, this is a religious understanding, this is a saving word.

600
01:17:00,969 --> 01:17:07,959
It is not to deny the one substance of the Father and the Son because He is similar, but to declare Him similar because they are one.

601
01:17:07,959 --> 01:17:15,949
Explained, my dearest, with a faithful and pious understanding of one substance, known in Greek as homoousion, and similar substance, called homoeusion.

602
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:31,980
Along with the pitfalls that can arise from either the misleading brevity or the risky nakedness of words now fully demonstrated: the remaining discussion must be directed to the holy Eastern bishops; so that, with no lingering doubts about our faith, any remaining suspicions from words may be clarified.

603
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:37,026
They will pardon someone who speaks more openly with them from the faith of a shared conscience.

604
01:17:37,026 --> 01:17:39,339
Praise to the Easterners for curbing heresy.

605
01:17:39,339 --> 01:17:46,330
O men, truly devoted to apostolic and evangelical doctrine, whom the warmth of faith ignites in the deep darkness of heretical night!

606
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:52,164
What a great hope of restoring true faith you have brought by steadfastly repelling the bold attacks of deceit!

607
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:58,051
For previously, in obscurity and hidden corners, it was denied that the Lord Christ is by nature the Son of God.

608
01:17:58,051 --> 01:18:03,623
Lacking the essence of the Father, it was proclaimed that He originated with creatures from non-existence.

609
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:08,024
Now, with the declaration of public authority, heresy is emerging.

610
01:18:08,024 --> 01:18:12,071
What was once whispered in secret is now openly boasted about as a victory.

611
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:16,226
How many hidden ways did it not try to infiltrate the Catholic Church before?

612
01:18:16,226 --> 01:18:19,841
What secular powers did it not use with the lure of false religion?

613
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:27,070
Corrupt people went so far as to deceive the Emperor into listening, even though they did not dare to preach this publicly themselves.

614
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:35,433
They misled the unknowing king, preoccupied with wars, to expose the faith to treachery and impose a belief system on the Churches before they were reborn.

615
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:40,289
They forced opposing bishops and us into exile at will, imposing the necessity of impiety.

616
01:18:40,289 --> 01:18:44,444
But let us continue to be exiled, as long as the truth starts to be preached.

617
01:18:44,444 --> 01:18:54,749
Thanks to the Lord, through your advice, the Emperor recognized his ignorance and acknowledged that the error was not his but of those who encouraged him, through the judgments of your faith.

618
01:18:54,749 --> 01:19:07,213
He exempted himself from the envy of impious will in the sight of God and men, and by honoring your delegation, he recognized the falsehood of those whose authority led him into envy, compelled by your declaration of his ignorance.

619
01:19:07,213 --> 01:19:12,716
The authors of the Sirmian formula are always deceitful, but they are cleverly criticized and refuted.

620
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:13,957
Christ is one, not two.

621
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:16,708
The subscription of Valens and Ursacius is suspect.

622
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:21,241
I fear and believe, dear brothers, that they deceive, for they have always deceived.

623
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,884
Even the current subscription contains falsehood.

624
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:50,214
They excuse themselves, wanting the terms "homoousion" and "homoiousion" to be silent, claiming both words mean the same thing.
I believe the bishops are unskilled and ignorant of the meaning of "homoousion," as if there were never any synods or disputes about this.
Suppose they didn't know "homoousion" or "homoiousion" meant similar in essence.
If they didn't know this, why did they want the begetting of the Son to be unknown?
If it is indescribable, does that mean it is unknowable?

625
01:19:51,024 --> 01:19:58,342
But if we don't know how He was born, can we really be unaware that the Son of God, born from the same essence as God, shares the same nature?

626
01:19:58,342 --> 01:20:05,816
Haven't they read that the Son should be honored just as the Father is honored
(John 5:25), rather than giving preference to the Father in honor?

627
01:20:05,816 --> 01:20:12,825
Do they not realize that the Father is seen in the Son
(John 14:9), so that the Son does not differ in dignity, brightness, and majesty?

628
01:20:12,825 --> 01:20:20,092
Or does their misunderstanding stem from thinking that the Son is beneath the Father, just like others, failing to distinguish Him from them?

629
01:20:20,092 --> 01:20:26,071
The subordination of the Son is due to His nature, while that of others is because of the frailty of their creation.

630
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:31,792
They certainly knew He suffered, but I challenge them to say when they knew He suffered alongside someone else.

631
01:20:31,792 --> 01:21:47,402
They avoid the terms "homoousion" and "homoiousion," because they're not explicitly written anywhere. I ask, where did they assume He suffered with someone else? Or are they suggesting that two suffered, as the term "compassion" implies? Where is the statement that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? Or are they implying Jesus Christ is one person and the Son of God another?
If He is not the same within and outside as the Son of God, they may believe in the ignorance of "homoousion" if such ignorance is permissible. But if even in these matters such ignorance is irreverent and cannot be falsely excused, I worry that claiming ignorance about "homoiousion" is deceptive.
I'm not overly concerned about the forgiveness you've granted, as it is right to leave what belongs to God to God, and human error stems from ignorance. But let bishops Valens and Ursacius forgive me, for I cannot believe that they are truly ignorant given their age and experience. It's very hard not to suspect deceit if they can't clear themselves without deception.
But may the Lord grant that we are mistaken in our thinking rather than them being truly ignorant. For I'd rather be judged for my flawed thinking than see your faith compromised by aligning with a heretical conscience. I urge you, most holy men, to consider my concerns with goodwill. The Lord is witness to my conscience that I have no intention to undermine your faith with these explanations you've brought from Sirmium.

632
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:57,310
Please forgive me if there are some things I cannot understand, but I find comfort in this:
I have read that the spirit of prophets is subject to the prophets
First Corinthians 14:32.

633
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:02,031
From this, I feel it might not be presumptuous to think I can grasp what others might not.

634
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:10,424
Not that I would dare to suggest you lack any knowledge, but concerning the unity of the Catholic faith, let's acknowledge that we have concerns just as you do.

635
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:14,935
A letter was delivered to Sirmium about the explanation of homoousios and homoiousios.

636
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:17,453
Homoousios is wrongly rejected because of birth.

637
01:22:17,453 --> 01:22:27,576
I understand the letter you requested to be read by Valens, Ursacius, and Germinius at Sirmium, regarding the explanation of homoousios and homoiousios, is both cautious and open in some parts.

638
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:31,562
The explanation of homoousios and homoiousios left no difficulty unresolved.

639
01:22:31,562 --> 01:23:26,848
Indeed, regarding homoiousios, meaning "of similar essence," there is a common understanding.
But about homoousios, meaning "of one essence," you initially declared it should be rejected because the term implies that substance was understood before they were divided.
I understand this misunderstanding.
This is a misguided idea and should be rejected by the Church's common judgment.
Secondly, you mentioned that our forefathers, when Paul of Samosata was declared a heretic, also rejected homoousios because it suggested the Father and the Son were solitary and unique to themselves.
Even now, the Church sees this as profoundly misguided, understanding it as calling the Father and the Son into solitude and singularity, denying the distinct properties of persons.
Thirdly, you cited the rejection of homoousios at the council of Nicaea, where our forefathers, pressured by those who said the Son was a creature, introduced the term homoousios, which shouldn't be accepted as it's not found in any writings.
I am quite surprised by what you have said.

640
01:23:27,216 --> 01:23:34,281
If the term homoousion is to be rejected because it is new, then homoiousion might also be at risk since it is not found in Scripture.

641
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:37,287
In that case, it would be condemned by general consensus.

642
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:42,612
However, I do not criticize this; I would rather introduce something new than reject it irreverently.

643
01:23:42,612 --> 01:23:48,940
So, setting aside the question of novelty, the issue doesn't even lie with matters condemned by our collective judgment.

644
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:54,371
After all, who in their right mind would claim a third substance common to both the Father and the Son?

645
01:23:54,371 --> 01:24:03,968
Or, after being reborn in Christ and acknowledging the Son and the Father, who would argue that in Christ, the Father and the Son are one and the same, as Paul of Samosata suggested?

646
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:07,395
Our judgment is consistent in condemning the heretics' impieties.

647
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:11,033
We not only reject but also detest this interpretation of homoousion.

648
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:16,201
Therefore, there is no misunderstanding where there is a common agreement in condemning the error.

649
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:19,681
What was accepted by the Nicene Council should not be disapproved.

650
01:24:19,681 --> 01:24:30,280
As I prepare to discuss the third question, I urge you not to turn suspicions into conflict where there is peace of conscience, and not to assume I am bringing up anything except for the sake of unity.

651
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,972
It's pointless to fear criticism of a word when the concept it represents poses no issue.

652
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:38,822
Does it bother anyone that homoousion was accepted at the Nicene Council?

653
01:24:38,822 --> 01:24:43,146
If this is troubling, then one must necessarily agree with what the Arians denied.

654
01:24:43,146 --> 01:24:52,109
For homoousion was denied so that the Son of God would not be seen as born from the substance of God the Father, but rather as created from nothing, like other creatures.

655
01:24:52,109 --> 01:24:58,595
We are not introducing anything new; the Arians' own treachery, documented in numerous writings, serves as its own witness.

656
01:24:58,595 --> 01:25:07,717
If the confessors' understanding was pious because of the impiety of those who denied it, I wonder why it is being undermined today when it was piously accepted in the past.

657
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:15,468
If it was accepted piously, why has establishing piety become a crime, when it extinguished impiety through the same means by which it was impious?

658
01:25:15,468 --> 01:25:17,050
The aim of the Nicene Council.

659
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,945
The Nicene Creed.

660
01:25:18,945 --> 01:27:14,975
Let's consider what the Council of Nicaea aimed for by confessing
homoousios, meaning "of the same substance." They certainly did not intend to spark a heresy arising from a flawed understanding of
homoousios. I don't believe they meant that the Father and the Son divided a single, prior substance into their own.
We will reverently include this faith, once written, into our discussion without irreverence. We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born from the Father as the only begotten, that is, from the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of the same substance with the Father, which in Greek is called
homoousios, through whom all things were made, both in heaven and on earth, who for our salvation came down, was incarnate, and became human, and suffered, and rose again on the third day, and ascended into heaven, and is coming to judge the living and the dead. And in the Holy Spirit.
Those, however, who say, "There was a time when he was not," and "Before he was born he was not," and that "He was made from nothing," or from a different substance or essence, claiming that God is changeable and mutable: the Catholic Church anathematizes them. The most holy council of religious men did not introduce some prior substance that was divided into two, but the Son was born from the substance of the Father.
Do we deny this? Or what else do we confess? And after the other explanations of the common faith, it says, "Begotten, not made, of the same substance with the Father," which in Greek is called
homoousios. What opportunity is there for a flawed understanding here? The Son is proclaimed to be born from the substance of the Father, not made: so that the birth of divinity is not a creation of making. Therefore, "of the same substance" means not that he exists as one or alone, but that he is born from the substance of God, not existing from elsewhere, nor existing in any diversity of differing substance.

661
01:27:14,975 --> 01:27:20,658
Isn't it our belief that it doesn't originate from elsewhere, nor does it exist in a different form?

662
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:30,999
Or does homoousion mean anything other than the essence of the two is one and the same, according to the nature of their origin, because the essence of the Son is not from elsewhere?

663
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:39,238
Since it isn't from elsewhere, both are rightly believed to be of one essence; because the Son's substance comes solely from the Father's nature.

664
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:42,932
Should homoousion be dismissed because it is often misunderstood?

665
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:48,046
On the contrary, is it argued that it should be rejected because of this misunderstanding?

666
01:27:48,046 --> 01:28:05,149
If we fear misunderstanding, should we also remove what is written in the Apostle: "There is one mediator between God and humans, the man Christ Jesus" (First Timothy chapter two, verse five); because Photinus uses it to support his heresy: and should it not be read by us because he misinterprets it?

667
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:19,468
Should we let the letter to the Philippians be destroyed, either by fire or erasure, lest Marcion misreads it: "And being found in appearance as a man" (Philippians chapter two, verse seven), claiming it's a fantasy rather than the reality of the body?

668
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:26,741
Should the Gospel of John not exist, lest Sabellius learns from it: "I and the Father are one" (John chapter ten, verse thirty)?

669
01:28:26,741 --> 01:28:34,696
And should those now saying that Christ is a creature not write: "The Father is greater than I" (John chapter fourteen, verse twenty-eight)?

670
01:28:34,696 --> 01:28:47,254
Should those who argue that the Son is unlike the Father avoid reading: "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father" (Mark chapter thirteen, verse thirty-two)?

671
01:28:47,254 --> 01:29:07,369
Should the books of Moses not exist, lest darkness be seen as co-eternal with God, who dwells in unapproachable light; because in Genesis, chapter one, verse two, day follows night: lest Methuselah's years surpass the age of the flood (Genesis chapter five, verse twenty-six), and not only eight souls are saved (First Peter chapter three, verse twenty).

672
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:21,688
Should God, hearing the outcry of the Sodomites whose sins are complete, descend as if unaware of their transgressions, to see if their sins match the outcry, and God seems not to know what He already knows (Genesis chapter eighteen, verse twenty-one)?

673
01:29:21,688 --> 01:29:28,791
Should we also not know the tomb of Moses, buried by those who laid him to rest (Deuteronomy chapter thirty-four, verse six)?

674
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:34,246
Should these, as heretics believe, suggest that the law itself is contradictory and adversarial?

675
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:38,564
And because these are not understood by them, should they not be read by us?

676
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:48,795
If it seems necessary, let them also perish-though I don't mean this lightly, but because of the necessity of the response-all those divine and holy Gospels of human salvation.

677
01:29:48,795 --> 01:29:52,333
This ensures they don't contradict each other in their statements.

678
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:58,123
So that the Lord, about to send the Holy Spirit, is not read as having been born of the Holy Spirit himself.

679
01:29:58,123 --> 01:30:04,181
And when he is about to announce death by the sword, he doesn't indicate to buy a sword as he is about to suffer.

680
01:30:04,181 --> 01:30:14,743
For instance, in Matthew chapter twenty-six, verse fifty-two, as he is about to descend to the dead, he is not with the thief in paradise, as mentioned in Luke chapter twenty-two, verse thirty-six.

681
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:17,477
So that finally, the apostles are not found guilty.

682
01:30:17,477 --> 01:30:30,558
They were commanded to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as stated in Matthew chapter twenty-eight, verse nineteen, yet they baptized only in the name of Jesus, as mentioned in Acts chapter ten, verse forty-eight.

683
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:39,404
To you, Brothers, I speak with a voice for those who are no longer nurtured with milk but are strong with solid food, as noted in Hebrews chapter five, verse twelve.

684
01:30:39,404 --> 01:30:48,464
Is it because the wise of the world do not understand these things, and they seem foolish to them, that we will be wise with the world by believing these foolish things?

685
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:54,361
And because these things are blind to the wicked, will we not shine with the truth of the understood doctrine?

686
01:30:54,361 --> 01:31:00,419
It is wrongly judged against holy things if, because they are not considered holy by some, they should not exist.

687
01:31:00,419 --> 01:31:09,747
Therefore, let us not glory in the cross of Christ, because it is a scandal to the world, nor preach death in the living God, lest God be accused of being dead by the wicked.

688
01:31:09,747 --> 01:31:10,337
Eighty-six.

689
01:31:10,337 --> 01:31:58,319
Or because it was rejected by eighty bishops, the term "homoousion" is misunderstood. What does it matter to me who understands it well? The Samosatene confessed "homoousion" wrongly, but did Arius deny it better? Eighty bishops rejected it long ago, but recently three hundred and eighteen accepted it.
Indeed, to me, that very number is sacred here, in which Abraham, the victor over impious kings, as mentioned in Genesis chapter fourteen, verse fourteen, is blessed by him who is the form of the eternal priesthood.
Those who rejected the heretic did not also prove against the heretic? The authority of the ancients is weighty; is the holiness of these also light? If they felt contrary things to each other, we ought to judge and approve the better. But if by approving and disapproving they established one thing both ways, why do we overturn what has been well established?
Eighty-seven.

690
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:03,089
Did Hosius, who was present at Nicaea, decide that silence was necessary?

691
01:32:03,089 --> 01:32:09,841
Perhaps someone might argue that some of those at the council back then believed silence was needed regarding homoousios.

692
01:32:09,841 --> 01:32:15,142
Reluctantly, I must ask: Did they not also decide that silence was necessary about homoiousios?

693
01:32:15,142 --> 01:32:23,122
I beg you, let no one other than the old man Hosius, who excessively cherishes his own solemnity, think that silence is necessary about either.

694
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:29,205
Where will we find ourselves amid such heretical madness if we fail to maintain either by not accepting both?

695
01:32:29,205 --> 01:32:35,734
It cannot be considered impious to say that if neither is found written, neither should be confessed, or both should.

696
01:32:35,734 --> 01:32:38,077
What does Hilary understand by homoousios?

697
01:32:38,077 --> 01:32:39,863
Concerns about homoousios arise.

698
01:32:39,863 --> 01:32:51,861
I understand homoousios, holy men, as God from God, not of dissimilar essence, not divided, but begotten, and from the substance of the unbegotten God, a single-begotten nativity in the Son, according to similarity.

699
01:32:51,861 --> 01:32:55,320
This understanding was greatly confirmed for me by homoousios.

700
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:01,849
Why do you condemn my faith in homoousios, which, through the profession of homoiousios, you cannot help but approve?

701
01:33:01,849 --> 01:33:06,927
You condemn my faith, or rather your own, when you criticize its understanding in the name.

702
01:33:06,927 --> 01:33:09,104
But does someone else misunderstand it?

703
01:33:09,104 --> 01:33:13,735
Let us collectively condemn faulty understanding, not remove the security of faith.

704
01:33:13,735 --> 01:33:22,050
Do you think we should adhere to the Synod of Samosata to prevent anyone from misappropriating homoousios according to the understanding of Samosata?

705
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:27,295
Let us also subscribe to the council of Nicaea, so the Arians do not disapprove of homoousios.

706
01:33:27,295 --> 01:33:32,150
But is there a fear that, according to faith, homoousios might not signify homoiousios?

707
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:36,726
Let it be determined that they are of no difference, of one and similar substance.

708
01:33:36,726 --> 01:33:38,735
But can homoousios be misunderstood?

709
01:33:38,735 --> 01:33:41,915
Let it be established how it can be understood correctly.

710
01:33:41,915 --> 01:33:46,826
We wisely agree on one and the same thing; I ask that what we agree on is holy among us.

711
01:33:46,826 --> 01:33:53,411
Forgive me, Brothers, as I have often asked: You are not Arians; why are you considered Arians by denying homoiousios?

712
01:33:53,411 --> 01:33:55,364
Homoiousios is not without offense.

713
01:33:56,591 --> 01:34:00,097
Homoousios-You might say: The ambiguity of
homoousios disturbs me.

714
01:34:00,097 --> 01:34:05,036
Again, I urge you to listen without being troubled: the simplicity of
homoousios concerns me.

715
01:34:05,036 --> 01:34:07,639
Often, things that are similar can be misleading.

716
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:11,941
I worry about gold leaf because it might mislead me, though it appears like gold.

717
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:18,155
I am cautious of milk's appearance, wondering if the milk offered to me is not sheep's milk but resembles cow's milk.

718
01:34:18,155 --> 01:34:21,820
For sheep's milk to truly be sheep's milk, it must come from a sheep.

719
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,210
True resemblance lies in the truth of nature.

720
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:27,715
However, the truth in the nature of both does not deny
homoousion.

721
01:34:27,715 --> 01:34:35,735
This is indeed likeness according to essence, if a mass similar to another mass isn't deceptive, and if milk of the same color doesn't differ in taste.

722
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:40,887
Nothing can resemble gold unless it is gold; it can't resemble milk unless it's of the same kind.

723
01:34:40,887 --> 01:34:45,454
The color of wine has often misled me, yet taste revealed it to be a different liquid.

724
01:34:45,454 --> 01:34:49,916
I have seen meats that look alike, but taste later revealed their different natures.

725
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:53,793
I am wary of these similarities that don't stem from the unity of nature.

726
01:34:53,793 --> 01:34:56,395
Faith of Ancyra Secretly Sent to Sirmium by Some.

727
01:34:56,395 --> 01:35:03,247
-Indeed, Brothers, I fear the heresies of the East emerging at various times: and what I express fear about, I have already read.

728
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:19,074
In what you, as delegation ministers accepted with some Orientals' consent, brought to Sirmium for subscription, there's no room for suspicion: but initially, there was a significant amount of offense, which I believe you, most holy men Basil, Eustathius, and Eleusius, kept quiet to avoid scandal.

729
01:35:19,074 --> 01:35:23,270
If these matters were written correctly, they should not have been kept silent.

730
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:29,378
However, if they are now silent because they weren't written correctly, we must ensure they aren't mentioned later.

731
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:36,441
For now, I'm holding back from discussing these matters: yet you agree with me that not all the faith written at Ancyra was the same.

732
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:41,806
I'm not speaking of rumors; I have the testimony of letters, not from laypeople but given by bishops.

733
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:43,558
Exhortation to Accept
homoousion.

734
01:35:44,567 --> 01:35:47,508
He first heard the Nicene Creed just before his exile.

735
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:51,755
I urge you, brothers, to cast aside suspicion and eliminate any chance for it.

736
01:35:51,755 --> 01:35:54,967
To affirm the homoousion, let us not dismiss the homousion.

737
01:35:54,967 --> 01:36:00,739
Let's think of all the holy and resting priests: what will the Lord judge about us if we now condemn them?

738
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:07,218
What will become of us, who bring this to the point where, because they were not bishops, we also have not truly begun?

739
01:36:07,218 --> 01:36:10,758
After all, we were ordained by them, and we are their successors.

740
01:36:10,758 --> 01:36:15,876
Should we renounce the episcopate because we have assumed its office from something condemned?

741
01:36:15,876 --> 01:36:19,034
Forgive my sorrow, brothers, but what you dare is impious.

742
01:36:19,034 --> 01:36:24,424
I cannot bear the thought that the homousion, according to a religious understanding, is condemned.

743
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:28,563
The name itself holds no crime, as it does not disrupt the essence of faith.

744
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:33,354
I neither know nor understand homoeusion, except from the confession of similar essence.

745
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:46,041
I testify to the God of heaven and earth that even when I had heard neither, I always understood both to mean the same through homousion and homoeusion: that nothing can be similar to itself by nature unless it is of the same nature.

746
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:53,718
Having been reborn long ago and remaining in the episcopate for some time, I only encountered the Nicene faith when I was about to be exiled.

747
01:36:53,718 --> 01:36:59,653
However, the understanding of homousii and homoeusii was revealed to me through the Gospels and the Apostles.

748
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:00,851
What we seek is pious.

749
01:37:00,851 --> 01:37:07,385
Let us not condemn the fathers, nor embolden heretics, lest while we label something heresy, we inadvertently foster it.

750
01:37:07,385 --> 01:37:14,627
Our fathers interpreted the nature of homousii devoutly after the Nicene Synod, and books exist as testament, with conscience intact.

751
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:18,057
If anything needs further explanation, let us consult together.

752
01:37:18,057 --> 01:37:26,115
A strong state of faith can be established among us, ensuring that well-founded beliefs remain secure and those poorly understood are not dismissed.

753
01:37:27,095 --> 01:37:35,463
I have stepped forward, dear brothers, setting aside the shame of human conscience and forgetting my humility, to write about these great and hidden matters.

754
01:37:35,463 --> 01:37:41,646
Driven by my love for you, I feel compelled to address issues that have remained unspoken and unaddressed until now.

755
01:37:41,646 --> 01:37:52,092
I have shared what I believe, knowing it is my duty to serve the Church, to make the voice of my episcopate in Christ known through these writings, in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels.

756
01:37:52,092 --> 01:38:03,871
It is your responsibility as a community to discuss, anticipate, and take action to ensure that you preserve with a religious conscience what you have faithfully maintained so far, and hold on to what you already possess.

757
01:38:03,871 --> 01:38:13,678
Please remember my exile in your holy prayers: I do not know whether, after explaining this faith, returning to you in the Lord Jesus Christ will be as joyful as the security of dying.

758
01:38:13,678 --> 01:38:19,221
I wish that God and our Lord keep you untainted and unharmed until the day of revelation, dear brothers.
