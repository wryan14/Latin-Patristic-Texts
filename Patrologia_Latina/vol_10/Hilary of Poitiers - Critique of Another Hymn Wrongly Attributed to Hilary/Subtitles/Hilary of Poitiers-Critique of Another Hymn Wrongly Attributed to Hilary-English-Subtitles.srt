Critique of Another Hymn Wrongly Attributed to Hilary

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:13,550
In the manuscript of Cardinal Sirleto, which was once in the library of Altemps and now belongs to Cardinal Ottoboni, this hymn is followed by another, longer one.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,794
This could be considered late, as mentioned in the previous letter to Abraham.

4
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:19,808
It definitely suits the evening time.

5
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:33,902
It begins with the stars and serves as a kind of general confession of a soul, groaning under the attack of vices like lust, pride, envy, discord, vanity, gluttony, and unchecked joy, relying solely on God's mercy and the merits of Christ to seek forgiveness.

6
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:38,582
Moreover, it reflects the time of the Arian heresy, as it expresses a faithful spirit.

7
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:45,711
It explicitly condemns Arius and Sabellius by name, and adds no other heretics except, perhaps to complete the verses, Simon Magus.

8
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,541
However, the wording does not seem worthy of Hilary.

9
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,677
The verses are structured by the number of syllables rather than the rhythm.

10
00:00:52,677 --> 00:01:00,078
And although the speech should be in the feminine gender if this hymn were meant to be sung by a daughter, it is consistently masculine.

11
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:05,030
From the beginning to the end, let the reader decide what to think of the rest of the hymn.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,936
The Beginning

13
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:16,160
I feel unworthy to lift my sorrowful eyes to the bright stars of heaven, burdened by the weight of my sins:
Please spare those you have redeemed.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:24,176
I failed to do the good I should have done and committed countless shameful acts; my offenses know no bounds:
Help me, Christ.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,746
THE END.

16
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:29,933
Singing a hymn with a faithful voice, I reject Arius and the barking of Sabellius.

17
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,780
I never agree with Simon's grunting whispers.

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,754
With zeal for Christ, I am fervent in his name.

19
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:42,586
For the Holy Mother Church has nourished me with Catholic teachings through all time from her sacred breast.
