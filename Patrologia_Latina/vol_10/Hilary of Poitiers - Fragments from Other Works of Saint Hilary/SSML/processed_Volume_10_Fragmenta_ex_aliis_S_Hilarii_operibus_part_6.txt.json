      "original_latin": "713 Ex libro   ad Constantium imperatorem. VI. Filius Dei factus homo Deus est . . . . . . Deus\n   filius hominis factus est (homo enim factus est\nDeus, non Deus factus est homo), et (f sed) filius\nhominis factus est filius Dei. Superavit enim magnitudo\nDomini parvitatem servilis formae; ita ut\nipsa servilis forma, quam assumpsit, cessaret esse\nservilis per eum Dominum, qui eam assumpsit. Si enim qui natura non filii Dei, per ipsum efficiuntur\nfilii Dei; quanto magis ipse, qui natura filius\nDei est, hunc cum quo voluntate sua alvo virginali\nconceptus et natus est, ita sublimavit in Deum, ut in\nejus nomine omne genu flectatur, coelestium et terrestrium\net infernorum, et omnis lingua confiteatur,\nquia Dominus Jesus Christus in gloria est Dei patris.",
