      Abra laments her father's absence. I received your letters, in which I understand that you are longing for me. I certainly know this.

      I feel how much the presence of those who are loved is desired.

      Because I knew my absence was hard for you, I didn't want you to think I was neglecting you by being away for so long.

      I wanted to explain my journey and delays to you so you would understand that my absence is not out of neglect but for a good purpose.

      For, my daughter, as I hold you as my only child and as dear as possible, I want you to live as the most beautiful and healthiest of all.

      Hilary is away to obtain a precious garment and pearl for his daughter. I was informed that there is a certain young man who possesses a pearl and garment of inestimable value. 
    </s>
    <s>
      If someone could earn them from him, they would become richer and healthier beyond human wealth and health. 
    </s>
    <s>
      After hearing this, I set out to find him. 
    </s>
    <s>
      After traveling many long and difficult roads, I saw him and immediately fell to my knees. 
    </s>
    <s>
      He is such a handsome young man that no one dares to stand before him. 
    </s>
    <s>
      When he saw me kneeling, he asked what I wanted and what I was asking for. 
    </s>
    <s>
      I replied that I had heard of his garment and pearl and had come because of them, saying that if he would grant them to me, I had a daughter whom I loved deeply, for whom I sought this garment and pearl. 
    </s>
    <s>
      While I lay prostrate, I wept greatly, and night and day, with groans, I begged him to hear my prayer.
    </s>

    <s>
      How valuable this garment and pearl are. After this, because the young man is good and nothing is better than him, he said to me, "Do you know this garment and this pearl, which you ask of me with tears to grant to your daughter?" 
    </s>
    <s>
      I replied to him, "Lord, I have heard of them, and I believed by faith, and I know they are the best, and true salvation is to use this garment and to be adorned with this pearl." 
    </s>
    <s>
      He immediately ordered his servants to show me this garment and pearl, and so it was done. 
    </s>
    <s>
      I saw the garment first. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Daughter, I saw something indescribable. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Wasn't any silk compared to its fineness just straw? 
    </s>
    <s>
      Didn't snow seem dark compared to its whiteness? 
    </s>
    <s>
      Didn't gold seem dull next to its brightness? 
    </s>
    <s>
      It was multi-colored, and nothing compared to it. 
    </s>
    <s>
      After that, I saw the pearl. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Upon seeing it, I immediately collapsed. 
    </s>
    <s>
      My eyes could not endure its color. 
    </s>
    <s>
      No sight of the sky, light, sea, or land could compare to its beauty.
    </s>

  <p>
    <s>
      The benefits and qualities of both. As I lay prostrate, one of the attendants said to me, "I see you are a concerned and good father, and you desire this garment and pearl for your daughter. 
    </s>
    <s>
      But to desire them more, I will show you the benefits these items contain. 
    </s>
    <s>
      This garment is never eaten by moths, never wears out, never gets dirty, never tears by force, and is never lost to damage. 
    </s>
    <s>
      It remains always as it is. 
    </s>
    <s>
      The pearl has the virtue that if anyone wears it, they will not fall ill, not age, not die. 
    </s>
    <s>
      It contains nothing harmful to the body. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Whoever uses it will not experience anything that brings death, changes age, or impairs health." 
    </s>
    <s>
      Hearing this, daughter, I began to desire the pearl and garment even more. 
    </s>
    <s>
      As I lay prostrate, with unending tears and fervent prayer, I began to plead with the young man, saying, "Holy Lord, have mercy on my prayer, and take pity on my concern and life. 
    </s>
    <s>
      If you do not grant me this garment and pearl, I will be miserable and lose my daughter, who is alive. 
    </s>
    <s>
      I am willing to travel for this garment and pearl. 
    </s>
    <s>
      You know, Lord, that I am not lying to you."
    </s>

  <p>
    <s>
      Hilary's daughter is promised these things, provided she discards vain ornaments. After he heard my voice, he orders...
    </s>
  </p>
        Lift up; and he said to me, your prayers and tears have moved me, and it is good that you have believed this. And because you said you are willing to give your life for this pearl, I cannot deny it to you. But you must know my purpose and will. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        The garment I give is such that if anyone wishes to use another garment that is colored, silk, or gold, they cannot take my garment. But I will give it to the one who is content to be dressed not in a silk habit, but in natural colors and inexpensive fabric. Due to custom, the garment will have a very narrow purple stripe. Not even the purple itself will spread into the garment. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        The pearl you ask of me is of such a nature that no one can possess it who has another pearl. Other pearls are either from the earth or the sea, but mine, as you yourself see, is beautiful and precious, incomparable and heavenly, and does not deign to be where others are. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        For my things do not fit with human things. Whoever uses my garment and pearl is healthy forever; does not burn with fever, is not open to wounds, is not changed by years, is not dissolved by death. Always equal and eternal. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        However, I will give this garment and my pearl to you who ask, so you can bring it to your daughter. But first, you must know what your daughter wants. If she makes herself worthy of this garment and my pearl, that is, if she does not want to have silk, gold, and dyed garments, if she hates every other pearl, then I will grant you what you ask of me.

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        <p>He encourages his daughter to use modest clothes.</p>

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        After these words, daughter, I rise happily. Having this secret, I made this letter to you, begging you through my many tears to reserve yourself for this garment and pearl and not to make this old man miserable by losing such a thing, if you do not have this garment and pearl. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        But I testify to you, daughter, by the God of heaven and earth, that nothing is more precious than this garment and this pearl. It is your right to have it. If any other garment is brought to you, whether silk, dyed, or gold, say to the one who offers it to you: I am waiting for another garment, for which my father has been away from me for so long. He seeks it for me, which I cannot have if I have this. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        The wool of my sheep is enough for me, the color that nature provided is enough for me, the inexpensive fabric is enough for me. But I desire that garment which is said not to wear out, not to be torn, not to be cut. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        If a pearl is offered to you to hang around your neck or fit on your finger, say this: These useless and dirty pearls are not a hindrance to me. But I am waiting for that most precious, most beautiful, and most useful one. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        I believe my father, because he also believed the one who promised it to him, for which reason he signified to me that he is even willing to die. I am waiting for this, I desire this, which will provide me with health and eternity.

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        <p>He awaits his daughterâ€™s reply.</p>

        Morning and evening hymn. Mother of Abraham. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        Therefore, daughter, relieve my anxiety, and always read this letter of mine, and reserve yourself for this garment and pearl. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        You yourself can write back to me with any letters, without asking anyone, whether you reserve yourself for this garment and pearl, so that I know what to answer to that young man. If you desire it, if you expect it, I can happily think of returning to you. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        When you write back to me, then I will tell you who this young man is, what he is like, what he wants, what he promises, and what he can do. Meanwhile, I have sent you a morning and evening hymn, so you always remember me. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        If because of your age you do not understand the hymn and letter, ask your mother, who wishes she had given birth to you by her own manners to God. 

        <break time="500ms"/> 

        May God who gave you birth, guard you here and in eternity, my most beloved daughter.</speak>
