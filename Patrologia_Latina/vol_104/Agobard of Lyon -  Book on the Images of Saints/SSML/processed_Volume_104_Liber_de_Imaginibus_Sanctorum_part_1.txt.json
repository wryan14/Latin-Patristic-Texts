You want me to remain silent, to deny the truth. But no one can receive anything unless it is given from heaven. You yourselves have heard me say: I am not the Christ.

Look at what is happening to us. Understand what we should truly love. To love anyone more than Christ is like committing adultery. Why do I say this? Let’s hear John’s words. He could have been mistaken about his identity; he could have been perceived as someone he was not. Yet, he rejected false honor to hold on to the truth. Listen to what he says about Christ and himself: He who has the bride is the bridegroom. Be pure and love the bridegroom.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But who are you? What do you tell us? He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.

You humble yourself well, you stand deservedly, you do not fall deservedly, you listen deservedly, and you rejoice greatly at the bridegroom's voice.

He spoke with zeal, not for himself, but with the zeal of God. Why? For whom are you zealous? For I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. Why then do you fear? Why are you zealous? I fear, he said, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The whole Church is called a virgin. You see and rejoice that the members of the Church are diverse and endowed with different gifts.

As anyone who reads and understands the words of Saint Augustine knows, what human and carnal presumption invents is much worse than this.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In this context, those images called sacred are also included, not only by the sacrilegious who give divine worship to the work of their hands, but also by the foolish who attribute sanctity to lifeless images. They foolishly grant sanctification, which the Apostle says is achieved through the Word of God, to idols that have never spoken.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finally, Gideon, who the angel said was the bravest of men and is said to have died at a good old age, requested the golden earrings from the spoils of his companions, as narrated in the Divine Scripture. He received them and made an Ephod, placing it in his city, Ophrah. All Israel worshiped it, and it became a downfall for Gideon and his entire house. Although he did this in honor of God, because he placed it in his own city rather than where the Lord had chosen, which the law had forbidden, his house met destruction instead of elevation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To make it clear Gideon did not do this for foreign gods, it immediately follows: But after Gideon died, the children of Israel turned away and worshiped the Baals. When they worshiped the Ephod, it does not say they turned away from God; nor are Baals, Astartes, or any idols mentioned. But when they turned to foreign gods, Baals are immediately specified, which in Hebrew is plural and usually signifies idols in the Divine Scripture. Just as when the erring people made one calf in the desert, it was said: These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɛk.sə.dəs\">Exodus</phoneme> 32:4.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Not only is it wrong to give divine honor to those who do not deserve it, but it is also wrong to ambitiously honor the memories of the saints to gain popular glory.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

      "original_latin": "Et Apostolus de Domino nostro mediatore\nDei et hominum homine Christo Jesu: Propter quod\net Deus exaltavit illum, et dedit illi nomen, quod est\nsuper omne nomen. Quale vero hoc nomen sit, consequenter\nexponit: Ut in nomine Jesu omne genu\nflectatur, coelestium, terrestrium, et infernorum, et\nomnis lingua confiteatur quia Dominus Jesus Christus\nin gloria est Dei Patris. Hanc potestatem, laudem,\ndominationem, hoc nomen quod est super omne\nnomen, nullus sanctus angelus, nullus sanctus homo\nsibi usurpat. Angelus enim qui usurpavit, vel homo quem usurpare suasit, uterque corruit. Si autem\naliquis homo adoratur, vel angelus, praeter eum qui\net Deus et homo et summi esse consilii angelus, Propheta\ntestante, perhibetur, non est aliud nomen\nquod ist vel super hoc nomen quod est super omne nomen, aut aequale illi. Sed quia nullus Deo aequalis,\nnullus alius essentialiter Jesus, id est, Salvator. existit,\ncredamus Apostolo, cedamus divinae auctoritati;\nflectamus genu in nomine solius Jesu, quod est super omne nomen; ne si alteri hunc honorem tribuimus,\nalieni judicemur a Deo, et dimittamur secundum\ndesideria cordis nostri ire in adinventionibus\nnostris.
