They claim that ships come from there in the clouds, carrying crops that fall due to hailstorms and perish in tempests, to that region. Supposedly, these aerial sailors give payment to the Storm-makers and receive grains or other crops in return. From those blinded by such deep foolishness, we saw many in a certain gathering of people present four individuals in chains—three men and one woman—claiming they had fallen from those ships. These people were held in chains for several days and eventually, as I said, they were presented before us at a gathering of people to be stoned. But truth prevailed, and after much reasoning, those who had presented them were confounded according to the prophetic saying, as a thief is confounded when caught.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHowever, since this error, which generally possesses the minds of almost everyone in this region, must be judged by all who have reason, let us bring forth testimonies of the Scriptures by which it can be judged. Upon examining these, not we, but the truth itself, will refute this most foolish error. And all who align with the truth will rebuke the vessels of error, saying with the Apostle: \"Every lie is not from the truth.\" And what is not from the truth is certainly not from God; and what is not from God does not hear His words. As the Truth itself says: \"Whoever is from God hears the words of God. Therefore, you do not hear because you are not from God.\" In another place, it says with different words: \"My sheep hear my voice. Therefore, you do not hear because you are not my sheep.\"\n</p>\n</speak>",

The devil asked to test Job to prove this was true. The wicked, proud, and most foolish devil acted as if he knew the mind of God's man better than his Creator. The Lord, who is just and merciful, granted the devil power: first over all things, then over Job's children, next over his health, through the persuasion of his wife, and finally through the reproach and various scorn from his servants.\n        <break time=\"600ms\"/>\n        But the devil, defeated and confounded, departed; the servant of the Lord grew victorious and triumphant.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, the pious Lord, desiring, as the Apostle says about himself, that the greatness of the revelations might not make him proud, wanted to humble Job so that the greatness of his victory would not make him arrogant.\n        <break time=\"600ms\"/>\n        He did this not by taking away the things Job had lost, not by striking his body—through which he had already been tested like gold in a furnace—nor by comparing him to some great man, for there was no one like him on earth, as he was great among the people of the East. Instead, He began to humble Job greatly, sublimely showing him the immensity of His power, so that the faithful servant, by recognizing the ineffable and boundless wonders of his Creator, would despise himself, and by despising himself, bow down, as indeed happened.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This is evident in Job's words, where he says: \"Therefore I retract, and I repent in dust and ashes\" (Job 42:6).\n        <break time=\"600ms\"/>\n        Another translation explains it more clearly, saying: \"I despised myself, and melted away, and considered myself as dust and ashes.\"\n    </p>\n</speak>",
