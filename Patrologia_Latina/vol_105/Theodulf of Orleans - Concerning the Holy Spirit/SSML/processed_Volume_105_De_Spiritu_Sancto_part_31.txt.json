In that Trinity, it is not unique to the Father alone that He was not born, but rather that He begot the one Son. Nor is it unique to the Son alone that He did not beget, but that He alone was born from the essence of the Father. Nor is it unique to the Holy Spirit that He was neither born nor begot, but that He alone proceeds from the Father and the Son in unchangeable eternity.\n</speak>"
