Even though the Father begot the Son, and therefore the Son is not the Father, and the Son was begotten by the Father, and therefore the Father is not the Son, and the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son, but only the Spirit of the Father and the Son, also equal to the Father and the Son, and pertaining to the unity of the Trinity.\n  </p>\n</speak>"
