This is testified by the prophet, \"The Spirit of the Lord made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life\" (Job 33:4).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The Holy Spirit belongs to both the Father and the Son. Therefore, the Father and the Son are one, because the Father has nothing that the Son does not have. Something cannot proceed from and exist in two consubstantial beings at the same time unless they are one from whom it proceeds.\n    </p>\n</speak>"
