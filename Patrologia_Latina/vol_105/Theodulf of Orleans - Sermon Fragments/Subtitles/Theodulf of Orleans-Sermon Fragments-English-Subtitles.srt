Sermon Fragments
by Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans

2
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:08,608
It is hard for us to rise to virtues, but we fall into vices without effort.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,624
Virtues are difficult to achieve, while vices come easily.

4
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:14,016
We endure great struggles to ascend to heaven.

5
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:28,473
Just as those striving for the peak of virtues do not start from the top, but from modest beginnings, gradually reaching higher levels; likewise, those who fall into vices do not start with great crimes, but become accustomed to small ones, eventually rushing into greater ones.

6
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:33,414
It is useless to do good mixed with evil; one must first refrain from evil, then practice good.

7
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:38,406
This is indicated by the prophet when he says: səˈs to do evil, learn to do good" (Isaiah 1:16).

8
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,786
Vices must first be uprooted in a person, then virtues implanted.

9
00:00:41,786 --> 00:00:46,935
Truth cannot coexist with lies, modesty with boldness, faith with treachery, or chastity with lust.

10
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:54,163
The lust of the flesh is noticeable to everyone because it is immediately shameful on its own: and yet, in God's judgment, pride is lesser.

11
00:00:54,163 --> 00:01:02,484
However, one who is held by pride and does not feel it may fall into the lust of the flesh, so that through this he may be humbled, rising from shame and pride.

12
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:07,320
Every sinner is proud because by doing forbidden things, he holds God's commands in contempt.

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,537
Therefore, the beginning of every sin is rightly pride, because unless disobedience to God's commands comes first, the guilt of transgression does not follow.

14
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:18,761
Pride is the origin of all crimes and the ruin of all virtues.

15
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:21,257
It is the first in sin and the last in conflict.

16
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:26,094
It either overthrows the mind through sin at the start or finally casts it down from virtues.

17
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:37,014
It is the greatest of all sins, because it destroys the human mind through both virtues and vices; from the fault of pride, one often goes into the abominable impurity of the flesh, as one depends on the other.

18
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:45,023
Just as through the pride of the mind one goes into the prostitution of lust, so through the humility of the mind, the chastity of the flesh is preserved.

19
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:50,067
Yet God sometimes casts down the hidden pride of the mind through the manifest ruin of the flesh.

20
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:55,537
The impurity of lust stems from hidden pride in the spirit, as we see with the first man.

21
00:01:55,537 --> 00:02:00,432
When he became prideful against God, he immediately felt the shame of lust and covered himself.

22
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:05,893
Sometimes, a Christian faces a dual attack from the devil: secretly through pride and openly through lust.

23
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:12,591
But a servant of God, wisely aware of both, avoids lust to prevent falling into pride and fears pride to avoid succumbing to lust.

24
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,786
Demons are more supportive of those who are lustful and proud.

25
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:21,969
Although they promote other vices, they form a closer bond with these two, serving them more according to their desires.

26
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:27,379
The devil primarily rules over humanity through these two vices: pride of the mind and lust of the flesh.

27
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:34,489
Hence, the Lord speaks to Job about the devil, saying: "He lies under the lotus plants, in the covert of the reeds and marsh" (Job 40:21).

28
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,868
The reeds signify empty pride, and the marshy places represent the lust of the flesh.

29
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:45,669
Through these two vices, the devil takes hold of humans, either by elevating the mind in pride or corrupting the flesh through lust.

30
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,564
Therefore, lust must first be removed from the heart to prevent it from manifesting in actions.

31
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:56,747
It is said through the prophet: "Gird your loins with sackcloth" (Isaiah 32:11)>, meaning to cut off lusts in the heart.

32
00:02:56,747 --> 00:03:03,651
When the mind is driven towards fornication by demonic impulses, divine judgment and the eternal torment of fire should be considered.

33
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:07,000
Every temptation is restrained by the fear of greater punishment.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,401
The remembrance of the fire of hell extinguishes the fire of lust.

35
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,492
Continence is granted by God, but ask and you shall receive.

36
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:16,996
It is given when God is earnestly petitioned with internal groaning.

37
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:22,045
The beauty of chastity must be cherished, for its delight is found sweeter than that of the flesh.

38
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:28,692
For chastity is the fruit of sweetness, the untainted beauty of the saints, the health of the body, and the security of the mind.

39
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:39,243
For anyone who believes they have self-control but doesn't avoid other earthly desires, even if they aren't tainted by carnal indulgence, they are still stained by different worldly activities.

40
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,850
However, every sin can be healed through repentance.

41
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,112
No one can engage in spiritual battles unless they first conquer the flames of greed.

42
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:50,123
The mind cannot be free to contemplate God if it is burdened by worldly desires.

43
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,830
Greed and the love of money are the worst of all sins.

44
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,946
As Solomon says: "There is nothing more wicked than loving money" (Ecclesiasticus 10:10); greed is the root of all crimes.

45
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:03,759
As the Apostle Paul also says: "The love of money is the root of all evil" (First Timothy 6:10).

46
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,319
So if the root of crimes is cut, other branches of sin will not sprout.

47
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,675
Greed sold Christ, sold life, and bought death.

48
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:16,192
It is no wonder that those who have not extinguished the flame of their greed in life are consigned to the fires of hell in death.

49
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:18,950
It is useful to avoid gluttony and the desire for food.

50
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:28,526
What is more harmful than for the soul to serve the belly and food, which are destined for destruction, as the Apostle testifies: "God will destroy both them and it" (First Corinthians 6:13).

51
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:33,890
Food should be used not for indulgence or satisfaction, but solely to sustain the body for the work of God.

52
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:40,107
Just as all carnal desires are cut away by abstinence, so all the virtues of the soul are destroyed by the vice of gluttony.

53
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:44,819
No one can achieve the perfection of virtues unless they first conquer the greed of the belly.

54
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,730
No one can master other vices unless they first restrain the vice of gluttony.

55
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,192
One cannot easily expel unclean spirits from themselves without abstinence from gluttony.

56
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,954
Our external enemies are more strongly defeated when the internal vices are first extinguished.

57
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:01,364
For it is pointless to wage war outside when there is danger within.

58
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:04,171
Food generates gluttony, and drink produces drunkenness.

59
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,382
Drunkenness, in turn, creates mental disturbance, heart rage, and the flame of lust.

60
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:12,243
Drunkenness so alienates the mind that it becomes unaware of its whereabouts.

61
00:05:13,295 --> 00:07:07,007
Hence, in Proverbs, "The mighty," he says, "are prone to anger: they should not drink wine, lest when they drink, they forget wisdom" Proverbs 31:5.
Many people boast about drinking a lot and not getting drunk. Let them hear the prophet speaking against them: "Woe to those who are mighty at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink" Isaiah 5:22.
Isaiah reproves those who are given to excessive drinking and living recklessly, saying: "Woe to those who rise early in the morning to pursue drunkenness and drink until evening, so that they become inflamed with wine" Isaiah 5:11.
About such people, it is said elsewhere: "Woe to you, city, whose king is a youth and whose princes eat in the morning" Ecclesiastes 10:16.
Many serve the pleasures of drunkenness and gluttony from morning until sunset, not understanding why they were born, but held captive by bestial habits. They serve luxury and feasts all day long. The prophet Joel cries out to those who serve drunkenness, saying: "Wake up, you drunkards, and weep; wail, all you who drink wine in sweetness" Joel 1:5.
Therefore, the care of the flesh must be attentively moderated with discretion, so nothing is done excessively: for whatever is excessive and beyond measure is harmful; but whatever is done with moderation and temperance is beneficial. In every work, therefore, one must have moderation and temperance.
Hence, there are different precepts given to the faithful who live common life in the world, and others to those who renounce this world. To the former, it is said they should manage all their affairs well; to the latter, that they should forsake all their possessions: for it is not enough for those who seek perfection to renounce all their possessions unless they also renounce themselves according to the Gospel. That is, unless they abandon their own wills and renounce evil habits: so that he who was proud may become humble; he who was adulterous, may become chaste; he who was irritable, may strive to be gentle; he who was bold, may strive to be patient; he who was greedy, may become generous; he who withers in hatred or envy against his neighbor, may retain pure love of God and neighbor in his heart.

62
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:15,297
So, for each vice, let him adopt an opposing virtue and strive to embody good morals, so that he may earn forgiveness for his faults and a reward for his good deeds.

63
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:19,769
For the Lord says: ɛniˌwʌn wants to come after me, let him deny himself" (Matthew 16:24).

64
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:28,209
Therefore, those who follow the monastic life without strict commitment, the more loosely they pursue divine love, the more easily they are led back to worldly desires.

65
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:35,645
For an imperfect commitment seeks the desires of this life, and even if it has not acted on these desires, it is still tied to them through thought.

66
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,358
Thus, it is important to strongly resist bad thoughts.

67
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:50,567
For he who takes on the profession of holiness with the intention of eventually leading others is not a disciple of Christ but a follower of wickedness, because he strives to bear the burden of Christ's cross not for God, but for worldly love.

68
00:07:50,567 --> 00:08:02,625
Those who leave the world but follow the virtues of the commandments without humility of heart fall grievously from a height, because they are cast down more severely by the pride in their virtues than they could have slipped through vices.

69
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:09,357
Every servant of God should not exalt himself because of his merits, seeing that others from a lower state can become superior to him.

70
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:19,204
The conscience of a servant of God should always be humble and sorrowful, so that he does not become proud through humility and does not let his heart dissolve into lust through beneficial sorrow.

71
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:25,685
A servant of God should read and work without ceasing, lest the spirit of fornication stealthily take possession of an idle mind.

72
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:29,001
For pleasure yields to labor but quickly seizes upon an idle mind.

73
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:35,733
Look at Solomon, who, through idleness, became involved in many fornications and, through the vice of fornication, fell into idolatry.

74
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:45,078
Those who renounce the world out of fear of God but are still entangled in worldly matters, the more they involve themselves in worldly pursuits, the more they withdraw from divine love.

75
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:53,418
Those who try to serve both earthly concerns and divine exercises at the same time cannot embrace both, as Christ says: noʊˌwʌn can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).

76
00:08:54,072 --> 00:09:00,780
Because unless the overwhelming concerns of the world are first expelled from the secret of the heart, the soul within will never rise.

77
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:11,017
Those who wish to dedicate themselves to God and renounce the world are criticized for neglecting their own cares while attending to the needs of their relatives, separating themselves from the love of God.

78
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:18,719
A spiritual person should benefit their relatives but must be careful not to deviate from their spiritual purpose while striving to provide physical grace.

79
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:28,856
Many monks, out of love for their parents, have become entangled not only in worldly concerns but even in legal disputes, and in seeking the temporal welfare of their relatives, have lost their own souls.

80
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:37,851
Just as we should not hate our own souls, but rather their fleshly desires, we should not hate our parents, but rather the obstacles they present that hinder us from the right path.

81
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,926
Nonetheless, the Lord has commanded us to hate our parents as we do our own souls.

82
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:47,342
No one can understand the weight of turning from good to evil unless they first turn their whole mind to God.

83
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:55,094
The progress of each converted person is described as threefold: first, correcting from evil; second, doing good; third, receiving the reward of good works.

84
00:09:55,094 --> 00:10:03,641
Therefore, each person should hasten to God in repentance while they can, for if they are unwilling when they can, when they are willing later, they may not be able at all.

85
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:08,213
Hence the prophet says: Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.

86
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:10,002
Isaiah chapter fifty-five verse six.

87
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:20,885
And where can he be found, if not in this life, in which he is also near to all who call upon him in truth, Jesus Christ our Lord, who will prepare eternal life and glory for all who truly and faithfully believe in him?

88
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:24,048
Concerning All Orders of This Age

89
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:35,532
Since any sin that pleases or entices us should remain in our memory because our sins are already erased, let us not lose the reward of Christ's blood, nor stain the robe of the soul through iniquity, robbery, or lust.

90
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:40,431
We were down, now we are raised; we were wounded, now we are healed: there will be no excuse.

91
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:47,596
Whatever wrong the devil can entice us to do, he cannot drag us into it; he brings delight, not power; he suggests advice, not conflict.

92
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:55,235
Now, therefore, because of the birth of blessed Mary, let me speak to virgins, whether men or women, widows, the powerful, the poor, or servants.

93
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,816
There is no distinction by God except for merits.

94
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:03,084
So listen to me, all of you who are virgins in body by Christ's gift, I speak generally to everyone.

95
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:08,563
So listen to me, anyone who recognizes themselves in what I say: strive to be a virgin in heart as well.

96
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:19,679
Rejoice in the purity of the body so as not to lose the soul's grace; still rejoice in such a precious gift from Christ, rejoice with humility, weep with piety, give thanks for carrying such happiness in purity.

97
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:34,166
Be glad because you will follow the Lamb wherever he goes:
If, however, as we read in Revelation, no lie is found in your mouth, pray for perseverance, so that no worldly pleasure or the devil's envy takes away such a gift, clouds such brightness, or tarnishes such splendor.

98
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:45,914
Hold on firmly, do not lose the irreplaceable thing, do not lose the grace of the body for a moment of pleasure: do not contract the ugliness of the soul through the beauty of the corrupted form; do not let lust defeat you.

99
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:50,497
If you listen to me, you will remain; if not, you will lose what can never be restored.

100
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:51,972
Again, my message is to you.

101
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:55,081
Those who have spouses, I advise you to have them chastely.

102
00:11:55,081 --> 00:12:07,619
For Elizabeth, who lived chastely with her husband for many years, and both were faithful before God, deserved to have a son from a dead seed, who would honor the holiness of his parents and convert many unbelievers through his preaching.

103
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,043
Once again, I speak to you, widows.

104
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:16,353
Maintain your widowhood, do not be talkative, but wait in silence for the Lord, who will take care of the orphan and the widow.

105
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:19,682
A good widow is one who is in prayer and humility, ready with alms.

106
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:23,558
If she truly lacks the means, she should have a good will and sincere thought.

107
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,539
Women, do not curse, do not swear, do not be quick to speak.

108
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:33,694
You might think it's inconvenient for me to say these things: it is not my choice; I fear more the one who commands than the one who criticizes.

109
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:41,992
I say, let those who recognize this correct themselves; those who do not see it in themselves, rejoice, and hold firm, so they can speak to others for their salvation.

110
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:46,464
Now I speak to you, penitents, who have received and are performing penance in the church.

111
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,998
Persevere in weeping, mourn wisely in your remorse.

112
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:50,688
What does it mean to mourn wisely?

113
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:55,110
Do not seek temporal things in prayer, but eternal happiness and the forgiveness of sins.

114
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,098
Whoever prays in this way mourns wisely.

115
00:12:57,098 --> 00:13:46,587
Your tears should not fall to the ground in vain, because He is truthful when He says through the Prophet: "I have put my tears before you" Psalm fifty-six, verse eight.
You now ought to love God sufficiently and move from fear to love. Because we read in the Gospel about that sinful woman, who was forgiven much, loved much, and therefore you ought to love God greatly, who, by waiting and not punishing, has deemed you worthy to be led to repentance.
Now, a word to you, the poor. I speak to you who beg, who live from the alms of Christians, take comfort; your tribulation will turn into joy and your sorrow into happiness.
Do not be ungrateful that you beg, nor say anything against the Lord in your heart because of it.
Because He is just and merciful in all His works, and He made you poor so that by enduring hardship, you may acquire eternal life, and He made the rich so that by giving you their excess, they may find remedy for their sins: and therefore, be patient, wait for the Lord.

116
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:51,249
I am speaking to you, servants, those with earthly masters and those in servitude.

117
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:56,654
Obey your masters and love them from the heart, not just when being watched, but doing your work out of love.

118
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:59,976
For God has appointed them to rule over you, and you to serve them.

119
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:02,852
Serve well, because you will be rewarded for good service.

120
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,480
If you are good, you will be better than bad masters.

121
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,488
With the Lord, a person's soul is judged not by nobility, but by deeds; not by birth, but by actions.

122
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:13,761
Therefore, my message is for everyone, because Christ died for us.

123
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:22,785
Keep what I have said so that I may have fruit from you, and may the merciful Lord, who lives and reigns forever and ever, admit you all into the heavens where the grain is gathered.

124
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:23,033
Amen.

125
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:37,264
Now, dear brother Desiderius, do you wish for me to tell you a little about the writers, who, like lights of the firmament, shine throughout the world, and who were able to clearly bring out many things from the obscurities that hinder spiritual illumination due to carnal understanding?

126
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:47,875
I will speak, lest I fear the judgment of Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, upon me, saying that an unjust judgment of the elders may not be fulfilled: I am in distress on all sides, and likewise, I am in distress.

127
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,387
For if I wish to criticize these things, I will arouse adversaries and enmities everywhere.

128
00:14:52,387 --> 00:15:00,370
But if I wish to fulfill your request, you will never find it, but whose will seems to be condemned rather than to pass over the advice of many or to despise it.

129
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,039
Each of them has deserved to be diligently praised in the Holy Scriptures.

130
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:16,633
But gently and lightly, with all love, I try to fulfill everything peacefully, like a most exalted bishop flying over the mountain peaks, like an eagle, not considering the many spaces of the heavens, the locations of the earth, and the circle of waters.

131
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,071
He proclaims in clear speech.

132
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:25,360
For whoever wants to climb a fruitful tree hastens gradually to the higher and greater branches, but leaves the nearby branches to the little ones.

133
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,997
We, however, are the little ones.

134
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,023
I urge you, dear brothers, to work diligently for the progress and betterment of the people in your care.
