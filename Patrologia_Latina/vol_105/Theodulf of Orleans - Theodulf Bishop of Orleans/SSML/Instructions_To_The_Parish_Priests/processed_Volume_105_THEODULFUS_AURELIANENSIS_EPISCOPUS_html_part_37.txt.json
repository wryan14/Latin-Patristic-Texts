Demanding payment before accepting a guest is not only inhumane but also cruel. It turns what the Lord commanded to be done for the sake of receiving the kingdom of heaven into a means for acquiring earthly possessions.</p>\n</speak>",
            "original_latin": "XXV. Ut hospitalitatem omnes diligant et gratis exhibeant. Admonendi sunt ut hospitalitatem diligant, et nulli\nhospitium praebere detrectent, et si cui forte hospitium\npraestiterint, nullam ab eo mercedem accipiant,\nnisi forte ille, qui a te recipitur, sponte sua aliquid\ndet. Dicendumque illis qualiter multi per hospitalitatis\nofficium Deo placuerunt, dicente Apostolo, Per\nhanc enim placuerunt quidam Deo, angelis hospitio\nsusceptis Hebr XIII 2. Et iterum, Hospitales sine\nmurmuratione. I Petr IV 9. Et ipse Dominus ad judicium\ndicturus est, Hospes eram, et collegistis me\nMatth XXV 35. Sciant sane quicunque hospitalitatem\n amant, Christum se in hospitibus recipere. Nam ille modus hospitalitatis non solum inhumanus,\nsed etiam crudelis est, quo nunquam hospes in domum\nante recipitur, nisi prius dandi hospitii merces\ncompensetur, et quod Dominus agere jussit pro perceptione\nregni coelestis, pro acquisitione terrenarum\nrerum agatur.",
