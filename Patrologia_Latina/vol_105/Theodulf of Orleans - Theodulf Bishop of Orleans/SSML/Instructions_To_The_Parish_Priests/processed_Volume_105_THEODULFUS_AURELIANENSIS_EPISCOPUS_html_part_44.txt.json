Esurientes satiandi sunt, sitientes potandi, nudi\n operiendi, infirmi et qui in carcere sunt visitandi, et\nhospites colligendi, dicente Domino, Esurivi enim,\net dedistis mihi manducare: sitivi, et dedistis mihi\nbibere, etc. Matth XXV 35. Nam haec omnia, et in\nse quisque debet spiritaliter agere, et in aliis corporaliter\nadimplere, quia pene nihil prosunt haec omnia\nad vitam aeternam compensandam, si luxuriose, superbe,\ninvide, et, ne singula replicem, si vitiose et\ninordinate quis vivat, et a caeteris bonis operibus\nvacet. Qui ergo videt se Christum non habere, qui\ndixit, Ego sum panis vivus qui de coelo descendi Joan VI 41, et charitatem, quae est pastus animae, non\nhabet, esurit quidem: sed si per bona opera Christo\nadjungit se, et charitatis dulcedine replet, esurientem\nomnino se pavit. Qui doctrina Spiritus sancti et\n Scripturarum sanctarum fluentis caret, sitiens est;\nsed si se fluentis verbi Dei irriget, et mentem suam\nspiritalis poculi dulcedine ebriet, iste se sitientem\npotat. Qui videt se justitia, sive caeteris bonorum\noperum exhibitionibus nudatum, et induit se justitia,\nsive caeteris virtutibus, nudum se procul dubio vestit. Si in lecto vitiorum suorum jacet, et morbo iniquitatis\nsuae laborat, et funibus peccatorum suorum\nconstrictus est, et vitiorum suorum obsitus pariete in\ntenebris iniquitatis suae, est infirmus quidem; sed\nsi de luto vitiorum per confessionem egreditur, et\nper poenitentiae lamenta vinculis peccatorum absolvitur,\net ad lucem bonorum operum egreditur, infirmum\net in carcere positum se procul dubio visitat.",
