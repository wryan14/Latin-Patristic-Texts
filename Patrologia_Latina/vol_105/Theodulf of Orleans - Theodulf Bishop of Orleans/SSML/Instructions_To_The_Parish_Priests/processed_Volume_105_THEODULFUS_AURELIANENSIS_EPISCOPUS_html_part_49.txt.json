Ipsa autem Quadragesima cum summa observatione\ncustodiri debet, ut jejunium in ea, praeter dies\nDominicos, qui abstinentiae subtracti sunt, nullatenus\nresolvatur, quia ipsi dies decimae sunt anni\nnostri, quos cum omni religione et sanctitate transigere\n debemus. Nulla in his occasio sit resolvendi\njejunii, quia alio tempore solet jejunium charitatis\ncausa dissolvi, isto vero nullatenus debet. Quia in\nalio jejunare in voluntate et arbitrio cujuslibet positum\nest, in hoc vero non jejunare, praeceptum Dei\ntranscendere est. Et in alio tempore jejunare, praemium\nabstinenti acquirere est: in hoc vero, praeter\ninfirmos ac parvulos, quisquis non jejunaverit, poenam\nsibi acquirit, quia eosdem dies Dominus, et per\nMoysem, et per Eliam, et per semetipsum sacro jejunio\nconsecravit.",
