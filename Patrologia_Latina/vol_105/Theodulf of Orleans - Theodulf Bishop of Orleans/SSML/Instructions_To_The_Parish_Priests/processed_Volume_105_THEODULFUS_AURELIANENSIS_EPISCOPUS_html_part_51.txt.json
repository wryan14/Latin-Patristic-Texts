Solent plures, qui se jejunare putant, mox ut signum\naudiunt ad nonam, manducare, qui nullatenus\njejunare credendi sunt, si ante manducaverint quam\nvespertinum celebretur officium. Concurrendum est\nenim ad Missas, et auditis missarum solemnibus,\nsive vespertinis officiis, largitis eleemosynis, ad cibum\naccedendum est. Si vero aliquis necessitate\nconstrictus fuerit ut ad missam convenire non valeat,\naestimata vespertina hora, completa oratione\n sua, jejunium absolvere debet.",
