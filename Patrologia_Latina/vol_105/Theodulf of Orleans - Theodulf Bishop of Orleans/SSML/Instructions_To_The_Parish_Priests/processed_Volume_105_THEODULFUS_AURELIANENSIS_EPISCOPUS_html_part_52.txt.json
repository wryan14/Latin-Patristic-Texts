If someone can avoid consuming eggs, cheese, fish, and wine, it shows great virtue. However, if someone cannot abstain from these due to illness or work, they may use them. Just ensure to observe the fast solemnly until evening, and consume wine only for the refreshment of the body, not to drunkenness.</p>\n  <p>Abstaining from cheese, milk, butter, and eggs without fasting is foolish and unreasonable. Drunkenness and indulgence in wine are prohibited, not milk and eggs. The Apostle doesn't say: Do not eat milk and eggs, but rather, Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery (Ephesians 5:18).</p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "XL. A quibusnam abstinendum sit cum jejunatur. Abstinentia vero in his diebus omnium deliciarum\nesse debet, et sobrie, et caste vivendum. Qui\nvero ovis, caseo, piscibus et vino abstinere potest,\nmagnae virtutis est: qui autem his, aut infirmitate\ninterveniente, aut quolibet opere, abstinere non\npotest, utatur. Tantum ut jejunium usque ad vesperum\nsolemniter celebret: et vinum non ad ebrietatem,\nsed ad refectionem corporis sui sumat. A caseo\nvero, lacte, butyro et ovis abstinere, et non jejunare ,\ndementissimum est, et omni ratione semotum. Vini enim ebrietas et luxuria prohibita sunt,\n non lac et ova. Non ait Apostolus: Nolite comedere\nlac et ova, sed, Nolite inebriari vino, in quo est\nluxuria (Ephes. V, 28).",
