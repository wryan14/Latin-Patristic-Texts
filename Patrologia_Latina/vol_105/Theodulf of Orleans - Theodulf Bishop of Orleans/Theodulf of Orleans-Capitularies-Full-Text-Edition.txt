Capitularies of Theodulf of Orleans

It is decreed that Masses conducted by priests on Sundays should not be so public that the people can hear them.
Additionally, they should refrain from the public solemnities of the Mass, which should canonically take place at the third hour.
Some have developed a bad habit of listening to these Masses, whether for the deceased or any other purpose, which are typically conducted by priests on Sundays or other solemn days, and then spending the rest of the day from early morning in drunkenness, feasting, and idle talk rather than serving God.
Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that everyone gathers at the public holy mother church to listen to the solemnities of the Mass and the preaching.
It is also decreed that in the city where the bishop is established, all priests and people, both from the city and the suburbs, should stand reverently during the Mass until the bishop's blessing and communion.
Afterwards, if they wish, they may return to their titles with permission, having received the blessing and communion.
Priests must be extremely careful not to celebrate Masses in chapels, suburban monasteries, or suburban churches unless it is done cautiously before the second hour, with the doors unlocked, so that people cannot use this as an excuse to avoid public solemnities, the bishop's Mass, or preaching.
Instead, all suburban priests and those in the city, along with all the people, as mentioned before, should come together for the public celebration of the Mass.
No one, except children and the infirm, even if they have heard the Mass, should presume to eat and drink in the cities or parishes before the public service is completed.
If anyone attempts to violate these statutes, they shall be subjected to canonical judgment until satisfaction is made.

From the first fall of man, where the goodness of nature, like the very root of humanity, was corrupted, to now, the seedbed of vices has been sown into our nature and continues to flourish.
This is why we learn with effort, forget easily, rise to virtues with difficulty, and fall into vices effortlessly.
Therefore, with all mental vigilance, dear priests, we must strive to apply effort in learning and diligence in retaining what we have learned, especially those of us in leadership and similar roles within our order.
Thus, we admonish you, O priests of the Lord, to hold the Catholic faith both in memory and understanding, that is, the Creed, and whoever wishes to be saved must, above all, hold the Catholic faith.
All priests of the Lord must be examined to see whether they can recite the canon of the Mass and the secret prayer Te igitur from memory, and distinguish them well.
They should recite the names of the dead and the living in their proper places, orderly and with all devotion, conduct baptisms properly, and pronounce the words correctly.
They must avoid negligence in baptizing the sick, ensuring they do not baptize a healthy person under the pretense of illness, except on the appointed days of Easter and Pentecost.
They must remember not to demand anything for the ministry of baptism, whether from the baptized or their parents, not even a small gift or fee, but to perform it with thanksgiving and utmost devotion.
However, if the parents or those who receive them from the sacred fonts willingly and freely wish to give a gift, accept it without hesitation.
Priests must also be instructed and reminded that the tithes and offerings they receive from the faithful are stipends for pilgrims and the poor, and they should use them not as their own, but as entrusted to them.
They must know that they will have to give an account for all these things and face condemnation.

The administration of sacred canons is established as follows:
The funds should be divided into four parts: one part for the repair of the church building, another for distribution to the poor, a third for the priest and his clergy, and the fourth reserved for the bishop, to be used according to his prudent advice.
It must be strictly prohibited and clearly stated that no priest, deacon, or subdeacon should have women in his house if there could be any suspicion about them. This includes even those women whom the canons allow, as the devil may instigate crimes involving these women or their maidservants. Therefore, we do not permit a mother, aunt, or sister to live in the same house with a priest.
But if it is necessary for a priest, deacon, or subdeacon to support a woman, she should have a house in the village or town, far from the priestâ€™s residence, where he can provide for her needs.
According to the authority of the canons, it is also strictly prohibited for any woman to approach the altar, assist the priest, or stand or sit within the chancel during Mass.
Priests should be reminded that on Sundays, they should give a sermon to the people according to their ability, first advising the congregation to love one another, have brotherly charity, love the Lord more than themselves, and love their neighbor as themselves. They should abstain from all evil deeds, avoid doing to others what they do not want done to themselves, and do to others what they want done to themselves.
If the Lord grants understanding, the priest should explain as much as he truly understands from the Gospel or the Epistle of Saint Paul, and advise the congregation to attend church frequently, faithfully offer their oblations, and make confessions to God and the priests.

None among them should have engaged in adultery, incest, or fornication with women, men, or animals, nor should they condone such acts. If anyone has fallen into these sins, they should seek correction and publicly make amends with their priest.
Every Sunday, as much as possible, the priest should instruct his congregation on these matters and advise them to abstain from carnal pleasures on Saturday nights, all Sundays, and on feast days and fasts. This way, they can approach the church pure in body and heart, without defiling the celebration with impurity.
Priests of the Lord, according to canonical authority, should not demand payment for burials. If the deceased, while alive, requested that something from their possessions be given to the church, or if those responsible for their affairs after death voluntarily wish to give something, it is acceptable. However, nothing should be demanded by the priests or by those overseeing the church property.
It should also be upheld, according to the traditions of the elders, that no one should be buried within the church itself. Burials should take place in the atrium, porch, or chapel of the church. Near the altar, where the body and blood of the Lord are consecrated, no one should be buried.
If a priest harbors an adulterer or adulteress in his house and allows adultery to occur, he should know he will be stripped of his honor and rank. If he discovers such acts among his people and does not correct it immediately, either out of fear or for personal benefit, he should be excommunicated when it is revealed. However, if he has done all he can to excommunicate and prevent the evil but could not, he has saved his soul.

However, with all diligence, the archdeacon must report to his archbishop, and the archdeacon to the bishop.
Priests must thoroughly investigate cases of incest through trustworthy individuals who have the fear of God before their eyes.
If such cases are discovered, they must strive to correct them immediately, either on their own or with the help of the archdeacon or bishop, to eradicate the issue. This is to prevent being polluted by such a disgraceful crime and to avoid incurring the wrath of Almighty God due to the proximity of others.
Priests should be admonished and instructed to first be free from all bodily temptation. They must then preach to the people under their care, both through words and example, to abstain from all fornication and irrational lustfulness, akin to that of beasts.
They should prepare themselves for God with a pure body and mind, especially when receiving and judging the confessions of the faithful, offering kind advice. The time for penance should be established according to the severity of the sin, whether it is long or short, strict or lenient, or moderate.
When a priest receives a confession, whether the sin was committed once or repeatedly, voluntarily or forcibly, through drunkenness, or by any other means, he should identify the root cause of the sin and apply the appropriate remedy.
The remedy for sin should be applied according to the canons of the authentic holy Fathers, not according to human preference or will. In this matter, the will or favor of man should not be followed; instead, the will of God should be sought in all things through the Holy Scriptures. This is so that through worthy prayers and proper penance, the vengeance of Almighty God, provoked by man's sin, can be appeased.
The people should be admonished to penance, considering that human fragility often leads to sin. Although we have been helped by the passion of Christ, so that what the merit of sin demanded, Christ's passion would redeem.

With the sacred teachings of baptism, which grant forgiveness for all sins, we are washed clean. However, because we cannot live without encountering vices and the stain of sin due to our weaknesses, the merciful God has provided the remedy of true confession and repentance. The Lord says through the prophet: "I do not desire the death of the sinner, but that he should turn back and live." And the Gospel states: "Produce fruit in keeping with repentance." And the Apostle advises: "Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed." True confession brings about fruitful repentance by avoiding sins that need to be repented of, feeling genuine sorrow for past sins, cutting off the causes of sin, rejecting their suggestions, and not falling back into previous vices. Serious and mortal sins must be publicly lamented according to the teachings of the canons and holy Fathers. However, we acknowledge that mortal sins can also be absolved through private confession, provided there is a genuine change of heart, a rejection of worldly pride, and a devout commitment to pious living, correcting one's life, and embracing continual mourning. No one should despair of the mercy and infinite compassion of Almighty God, for it is written: "When a sinner turns from the error of his way and turns away from evil deeds, all his iniquities will be forgotten." The manner of repentance depends on the judgment of the priest. The priest, understanding the teachings of the holy Fathers, must impose penance on those confessing according to their authority. The authority of the canons and the holy Fathers is indeed a very firm institution.

If someone commits murder voluntarily or through treachery, they must undergo constant penance. If this act is publicly known, and if they are a layperson, they must give up their arms and all secular military service and make public amends. For forty days, they must pray outside the church, at the door. After this period, while sustaining themselves on bread and water, they are to be excluded from the communion of prayers for five years. After these five years, they can be received back into the communion of prayers only, but they must not offer or touch the body of the Lord at all.
If they persist for fourteen years, they can then be received into full communion with prayers, and near the end of life, they may receive the Eucharist as a provision for their journey. Their abstinence is at the discretion of the priest, and depending on the person and their ability, the abstinence from food should be imposed accordingly. If the murder is hidden, they should act secretly in the same manner as mentioned above.
If someone commits murder by accident, without intending to, the previous rule required seven years of penance with communion according to established stages. However, this definition by the Council of Ancyra grants a penance period of five years. For forty days, they must stand outside the door of the church. After this, for two years, they are to be separated from the prayers of the other faithful, not to communicate, not to offer. After two years, they are to be received into the communion of prayers and allowed to offer, but not to communicate. After five years, they are to be received into full communion. The abstinence from food remains at the discretion of the priest, depending on the person and their circumstances.
If someone, while traveling, either in their own house, in the city square, or in a village, suddenly or when attacked by another, or in a quarrel, defending themselves, without prior hatred, kills a person, they must do penance for seven years according to the canons. This includes three years deprived of communion and four years received in the communion of prayers and offerings. It will be at the discretion of the priest whether they are worthy to receive the body of Christ or to be separated from it until the completion of penance.

Abstinence from food will be managed by the priest based on the penitent's capability, devotion, and expression of tears.
Women who commit fornication and then kill their offspring, or take actions to expel conceived children from their womb, were historically excommunicated from the church for life. However, now, following the Council of Ancyra, they are subjected to a ten-year period of penance. During this time, they must pray outside the church door for forty days. After that, they are excluded from the communion of the faithful and from offerings for four years. Then, they are received back into the communion of prayers and must complete the ten-year period. Due to human kindness, they may receive the Eucharist after their penance. It will be at the discretion of the priest whether they should approach the body of Christ before completing their penance, depending on how deeply they are moved by tears and devotion. Abstinence from food will be under the priest's guidance based on their repentance and the quality of the individuals.
A woman who has married two brothers should be cast out until the day of her death. But out of humanity, she should be reconciled in her final sacraments, provided that the previous marriage is dissolved and she remains unmarried. Her husband must also undergo similar penance without a wife. If two brothers have fornicated with one woman, unaware of each other's actions, as soon as they learn of the adultery, the one who has her as a wife must leave her. After completing penance, if the wife has died, he may marry another, but not while she is alive. The woman, however, can never again enter into marriage and must undergo perpetual penance, receiving the grace of communion at the end of her life.
A woman who, while sleeping, suffocates her child, resulting in its death, shall do penance for six years. Her husband, if he was in the house, shall do penance for four years. If he was in the same bed, he shall do penance for two years on bread and water, and the remaining four years as the priest sees fit, with the priest imposing food abstinence accordingly.

Similarly, if a married man commits adultery, he should do penance and, after three years, he may receive communion. If a man's wife commits adultery and he publicly reveals it, he may choose to divorce her due to fornication. However, she should still do penance as previously mentioned. The man, while she is alive, is not permitted to marry another. Alternatively, if he wishes, he can reconcile with the adulteress, but only if they both do penance together. After completing the penance, they may be restored to the grace of communion, as stated before.
The same rule applies to women. If her husband commits adultery, she has the right to divorce him due to fornication, and she should remain single as long as her husband lives. Neither the man has the right to marry another while his first wife is alive, nor the woman to marry another man while her first husband is still living. However, they do have the right to reconcile with each other.
If a single woman or a single man commits fornication, they should do penance for five years. But if a single man commits adultery with another man's wife, or if a single woman commits adultery with another woman's husband, both are considered adulterers and should do penance as previously mentioned.
If someone commits theft, they should do penance for seven years, with three of those years on bread and water. The severity of the penance should match the severity of the theft. If the theft was committed out of necessity, the penance should be lessened. As Solomon says: "It is not a great sin if someone steals, for he steals to fill a hungry soul."
Anyone who commits perjury should also do penance for seven years. Anyone who gives false testimony and harms someone because of it should do penance for seven years and fully compensate the person they harmed with their false testimony. Only then can they receive forgiveness through penance. If they do not do this, their penance is in vain.

Those who act irrationally should be dealt with according to what is contained in the canons, specifically in the title with Greek words, translated into Latin from the Council of Ancyra, chapter 16. This includes three types of offenses: intercourse with animals, incest with relatives, and intercourse with men.
Anyone who has committed such a crime before the age of 20 should spend 15 years in penance before they can start participating in prayers. After another 5 years of simple communion, they may be received at communion with the offering, but only after they turn 20. However, their life during the time of penance should be examined to determine if they can obtain this leniency.
If anyone persists in these crimes, they should undergo a longer period of submission, and such individuals can never be promoted to the priesthood. Anyone who commits these crimes after the age of 20, and those who have wives, should spend 25 years in penance before being received into the communion of prayers. After another 5 years, they should receive full communion with the offering.
If those who have wives and are over the age of 50 commit these sins, they should only be granted communion at the end of their life. Those who have lived like mute animals and contaminated themselves and others with these sinsâ€”whether with relatives, animals, or menâ€”should, after the set time of penance, not stand and pray among others but among those thrown to the ground by an unclean spirit, that is, with the possessed.
Just as it is more abominable to have intercourse with a beast than with a man, it is also a more irrational crime to have intercourse with a man than with a woman. Sinning with a relative or a nun is an equal crime. The law of Moses judges this with death. Those who have had intercourse with a beast, a man, or a relative are similarly judged. The crime of a woman sinning with a woman is equal to that of a man sinning with a man, and the penance should be equal.

Regarding such matters, the Apostle says:
"For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are against nature."
"Similarly, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with desire for one another, men committing shameless acts with men."
However, what we have discussed applies to those who have publicly confessed and performed public penance. If this was done in secret, and they came privately to the priest and made a sincere confession, they should do penance in private according to their age, as mentioned earlier.
This means that if this happened before the age of 20 or out of ignorance, or if they did not know it was a crime, the treatment should be more lenient, based on the priest's judgment. The priest should consider how they fell into this sin and how long they were involved in it; and according to their confession, the appropriate mode of penance should be applied.
Specifically, if it occurred out of ignorance once or twice, whether with a man, an animal, or a relative, and once they realized it was a grave sin, they stopped immediately, then, to be more humane, they should do penance for seven years, abstain from meat for three years, and not take communion for one year, not even on Easter. They should not offer anything and must submit their entire mind, so that their spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.
The rest should be based on the individual's frailty, at the priestâ€™s discretion, in terms of abstaining from certain foods. If they were involved in this crime for a longer time, and after knowing it was a great sin they still committed it repeatedly, as mentioned earlier, they should do penance in the following way.
First, they should be separated from all communion for five years. After this, they should not offer or take communion for fifteen years, nor should they enter the church for prayer with other Christians. After this period, they should only be received into the communion of prayer. Then, after completing twenty years of penance, if they have done so well, with tears and full devotion, they should be received into full communion and reconciliation.

Similarly, the same rules apply for the other specified times mentioned above. If, God forbid, someone commits such a crime in holy places, their penance should be doubled. In the Scriptures, this terrible crime is referred to whether it is with a beast, with a male, or with a close relative. In the world, it is called impurity or a detestable sin to lie with a woman unnaturally, as Onan, the son of Judah, was struck down by God because he spilled his seed on the ground when he went into the woman.
Impurity is also called softness, whether it be through touch, sight, or recalling a woman, if some pleasure occurs while awake, or if someone exercises impurity between their own thighs, either alone or with another. About this, the Apostle Paul says: "Neither the impure shall inherit the kingdom of God." Also: "Nor let any impurity be named among you." And elsewhere: "Neither the soft shall inherit the kingdom of God." Whoever falls into these sins should repent as if for a crime that excludes them from the kingdom of God.
If a priest commits adultery, whether it is known and public, he shall cease from the order of the priesthood and undergo public penance for ten years. But if he does this secretly and confesses privately, let penance be imposed on him secretly. It shall be left to his discretion whether he should cease from that ministry, or whether, remaining, he can make a worthy satisfaction to the Lord from there. If he washes himself daily with tears and prayers and diligently works to extinguish his sins through the giving of alms, if it is secret, he can undertake penance secretly while remaining in his rank.
If he commits fornication, he will be purified in the same way for seven years. However, if he falls into sodomy, that is, with a male, he will be purified in the same way for fifteen years. The same rule applies for deacons and those in holy orders. Namely, a deacon should repent for seven years for adultery, for fornication for five years, for sodomy for ten years, for adultery for five years, for fornication for three years, and for sodomy for seven years.

Following the established steps to the final ecclesiastical rank, such observance should be maintained. No priest should excuse himself by what the Apostle Paul said: But because of fornication, each man should have his own wife. They should understand that this was only meant for those in the lay order or who have not yet reached the subdiaconate.
The canons do not allow anyone to reach the subdiaconate unless they have promised to maintain perpetual continence and chastity from that point onward. The priests of the Jews were commanded by the Lord through Moses to take wives, and priests were only chosen from the tribe of Levi, so that one lineage would be preserved through succession.
Now, however, people from all nations, just as they are allowed baptism, are also permitted to the priesthood. There is no necessity for them to take wives, as they are not succeeded by fleshly descent but by imitation of morals in the priesthood. Even the priests of the Jews, who did not have such a holy sacrifice as we do, stayed far from their homes during their service. Away from marital duties, they kept watch in the temple in continence and chastity until their ministry was completed.
Now, priests should always be continent because they should always serve. They handle not the victims of cattle, but the immaculate body and blood of the Lord Himself. Deacons and subdeacons also, in the Lord, as ministers in the handling of such a great sacrament, approach the altar.
For laypeople or those who do not approach the ministry of the altar, the Apostle commands that those who cannot contain themselves should marry: It is better to marry than to burn. This means it is better to take a wife legitimately than to burn with the deeds of fornication, adultery, sodomy, and impurity.
Priests should be advised to maintain mutual charity among themselves, avoiding all pride and biting envy, to provide a holy example to both the clergy and the laity.

They should not be greedy, covetous, drunkards, insolent, quarrelsome, or slander anyone. Instead, they should remain blameless in all things, providing an example of salvation to both the clergy and the people. By setting a positive example and progressing toward eternal life and moral goodness, they can uplift others in humility.
They should be advised not to practice usury in any form and to instruct the people and the clergy under them to avoid this vice according to the canons. Anyone who takes more than they give should understand they have committed usury. For instance, if someone lends wheat or another type of produce and receives money or something else of equal value instead of the same type of produce, they have undoubtedly committed usury.
If any member of the clergy presumes to do this, they should know they risk losing their rank. If it is a layperson, they will be excommunicated. Therefore, it is essential that those in the clerical order abstain from these practices and strongly instruct the people to avoid them entirely.
When a priest receives a confession, he should remind the penitent to confess the eight principal vices, promise to amend their ways, and accept penance as a remedy for their soul.
He should ask for the names of each of the eight principal vices and ensure the penitent confesses them all. Afterward, the appropriate penance should be applied.
The principal vices, which are rarely absent in anyone, are:
First, gluttony, or an insatiable appetite.
Second, fornication.
Third, sloth or sadness.
Fourth, greed.
Fifth, vanity.
Sixth, envy.
Seventh, wrath.
Eighth, pride.

If a priest sees someone who is shy and embarrassed to confess and reveal their sins, he should encourage them by saying:
"My brother, the Lord often encourages us to seek the remedies of true confession, not because God needs our confessionâ€”He who knows everything we do, say, and thinkâ€”but because we cannot be saved otherwise unless we confess, repent, and acknowledge whatever we have done negligently.
The devil is pained when sins are confessed and wants us to hide what we have done because the one who accuses himself of his sins will not be accused by the devil again on the day of judgment; provided that the one confessing, repenting, washes away what he has done and does not repeat his actions.
As the Apostle James says: "Confess your sins to one another." And Paul: "With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation." And Solomon: "He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy."
The Evangelist John also says: "If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
Similarly, the Psalmist says: "I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin."
We should understand that this great remedy for salvation means not repeating the wicked deeds or reopening old wounds with new injuries.
The first week before the start of Lent, confession should be made of all sins committed either in action or in speech.
And so, the priest should specifically mention the eight principal vices.
The first is gluttony, through which the devil deceived Adam and tempted Christ when he said: "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread." And it is cured by fasting.
The second principal vice is fornication, about which Solomon says: "A prostitute is a deep pit and a narrow well;" and the same doctor: "Who is stronger than Samson? Who is wiser than Solomon? Yet both were deceived by women, and it is healed by chastity."
The third principal vice is sloth, that is, instability of place. This does not allow a person to persevere in good.

These must be healed through perseverance in good work, because, as Gregory says, "doing good is useless if it is abandoned before the end of life."
The fourth principal vice is greed, which makes a man like hell. Nothing is more wicked than greed. This must be healed through the generosity of almsgiving; just as greed sinks one into hell, generosity lifts one towards heaven.
The fifth principal vice is vainglory, which lacks all good work. Just as a thrown stone does not reach heaven, prayer with vainglory does not reach God. This must be healed through the love of God.
The sixth principal vice is envy, of which Solomon says, "Through the envy of the devil, death entered the world." This must be healed through charity. Charity does not envy and endures all things.
The seventh principal vice is anger. Christ says, "Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment." Paul adds, "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry. Do not give the devil a foothold." And again, "Do not take revenge, but leave room for God's wrath." This must be healed through patience. "Blessed are the peacemakers," says the Lord, "for they will be called children of God." And again, "Love your enemies, do good to those who persecute you and slander you." Elsewhere, it is said, "In your patience, possess your souls."
Sadness itself is not the same as anger. Sadness pertains to sloth; worldly sadness produces death. Bad sadness leads to despair and instability. Hence, the slothful person is called sad. The apostles were not angry, but they were sad. Their sadness was turned into joy. This sadness or sloth, which is a vice, must be healed through spiritual joy.
The eighth principal vice is pride. Christ says, "Anyone who exalts himself will be humbled." Solomon says, "Where there is pride, there will be disgrace." Jesus, son of Sirach, says, "Pride is hateful before God and men." Augustine states, "What great pride in us, which deceived the angels? How much more does it wish to drown men?" Thus, angels became demons. Just as pride is the origin of all crimes, it is the ruin of all virtues.

Saint Gregory said:
"A rotten fruit is useless to farmers, and a proud fruit is useless to the Lord."
Just as the weight of the fruit breaks the branch, so pride destroys the beauty of souls.
Pride cast down the archangel and made him fall like lightning.
This can only be healed by humility, because through humility humans are made equal to angels.
These eight chief vices, and those stemming from them, if not purified here through confession and penance, cannot be purified on the day of judgment and lead people to hell.
Why is a person ashamed to confess, who was not ashamed to be defiled by sins?
By confessing, what was contracted by sinning is washed away.
How can a doctor heal a wound that the patient is ashamed to show?
The sinner is the patient, the wise priest is the doctor.
However, the one who confesses should kneel with the priest before God, and then confess everything he can remember from his youth of all the ways he has acted.
And if he cannot remember all his misdeeds, or if perhaps he is ashamed, the priest should ask him whatever is prescribed in the penitential book, whether he has fallen into that particular sin or another.
But still, he should not disclose all crimes to him, because many vices are listed in the penitential book which it is not appropriate for a person to know.
Therefore, the priest should not ask him about everything; lest, when he leaves, the devil persuades him to fall into a crime of those which he did not know before.
And after he has confessed all his sins, he should say the Creed, forgive all who have sinned against him, and promise amendment to God, vowing not to return to those sins again.
Once he has done all this, the priest will consider the magnitude of the faults and, according to the measure, impose a time of penance.
Then, over him, he will say the seven penitential psalms with the prayers that are in the sacramentary, and absolve him in peace.
It should be known, however, that if any of the bishops is defiled by one of the eight chief sins, he should do penance for fourteen years, a priest for twelve, a deacon for eight, a cleric for six, a layperson for four.

A woman who kills her newborn should repent for 14 years. If she kills her son, she should repent for 15 years. If she kills the child in the womb before birth, she should repent for 7 years. If an infant dies without baptism, the parents should repent for a whole year and should always perform some form of penance.
There are some sins which, as Isidore says, can be purified by purgatorial fire. These include overeating and overdrinking, resting, talking, being slow to visit the sick, coming to church, giving alms, sudden anger that is not held in the heart, and occasional drunkenness. For anger that remains in the heart generates hatred and desires revenge, and is considered one of the principal sins.
Some have said that minor sins include things like small perjury, if not frequent, speaking while joking or in anger, stealing small things, marrying a woman you defiled in a dream, hitting a person so that blood flows, cutting off a person's limb without causing death, having intercourse with your wife on a Sunday or on forbidden days, violating graves to build a house, neglecting to perform the sacrifice with proper diligence, drinking a potion or eating something unclean, giving usury, taking small things that don't belong to you, committing sacrilege in small matters, like stealing something from the church, stealing or defrauding church money, burning a house without causing great harm, getting others drunk for fun, eating carrion, that is, an animal killed by a beast or birds, or dying of disease. For these and similar sins, a bishop should repent for 7 weeks, a priest for 5 weeks, a deacon for 4 weeks, a subdeacon for 3 weeks, a cleric for 2 weeks, and a layperson for 1 week.
If found guilty of a greater crime in these matters or others, the length of penance will be increased or lessened according to the severity or estimation of the sin. Truly, if someone hates their brother, the duration of their hatred should be matched by an equal time living on bread and water.
Priests should also be reminded about the anointing of the sick, penance, and the Eucharist, so that no one dies without the Eucharist.

But if anyone seeks repentance during illness, when the priest comes to them, and they are unable to speak, it is established that trustworthy men who were with them from the beginning of the illness should provide true testimony of what they heard when the person could speak, whether about repentance, shaving their beard, or becoming a monk.
Then the priest, being informed, should fulfill his duty towards the person, and impose penance through guarantors, who should fulfill it on their behalf.
But if the bishop is so ill that he needs to be anointed, and another bishop is not available to perform the anointing, it is permitted for a priest to consecrate him with the anointing duty.
For there was no distinction between bishops and priests in the early times of the apostles' preaching; nor would there be now, if not for the dissension among many priests who taught different and contrary things due to the heretics.
First, however, repentance should be given to the sick. Then, if the illness permits, after washing the body, they should be dressed in white clothes, carried to the church, and laid on sackcloth with ashes sprinkled over them.
A cross and holy water should be brought there, so that when they come to them, specifically three priests, they may say the chapter: Peace to this house and to all who dwell in it. Peace to those entering and leaving in the name of the Lord. Then the priest should pour sacred oil into the holy water, and sprinkle it while saying the antiphon: Bless, O Lord, this house and all who dwell in it; for you, O Lord, have said: Peace to this house, etc. Bless, O Lord, those who fear you, both small and great. May you be blessed by the Lord, who made heaven and earth. And again he should say the antiphon: Purge me with hyssop, O Lord, etc.
And after giving the prayer, he should place the sacred ashes on the head and chest of the sick person in the form of a cross, saying: By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread until you return to the ground from which you were taken. You are dust, and to dust you will return. Then they should begin the seven penitential psalms for them. And, if they can, the sick person should stand with bent knees and head bowed or with their whole body prostrated.

After the litany is said, begin the anointing with the appropriate psalms and antiphon sung by the others. Make twelve signs of the cross with oil over the person, as follows:
First, a large cross between the shoulder blades up to the neck and across the shoulders with a prayer. Then, from the neck to the back of the head. Next, on the head to the forehead, crossing from ear to ear. The fourth and fifth crosses are on the eyes, specifically on the eyebrows. The sixth is on the nose, that is, the nostrils. The seventh is on the lips. The eighth and ninth crosses are on the ears, on the outer ears. The tenth is on the throat. The eleventh is on the chest. The twelfth and thirteenth are on the hands, one on each hand on the outside, and the remaining two are on the feet.
We make these fifteen crosses with holy oil on the sick person to signify the mystery of the Trinity and the five senses. Three times five makes fifteen. Since it is common to sanctify with an odd number, some prefer to make twenty crosses on the sick person: three between the shoulder blades, three on the shoulders, three on the neck, back of the head, and brain, three on the forehead and eyebrows, three on the nose and lips, two on the ears, two on the throat and chest, two on the hands, and two on the feet. Some add two on the temples and two on the inner hands.
Some say it is not necessary to make a cross with oil on the forehead or the inner hands of the priest. However, it does not matter. The bishop uses chrism, not the oil for the sick, on the foreheads of all those baptized and on the hands of priests. The presbyter makes a cross with exorcised oil, not the oil for the sick, on the chest and between the shoulder blades of those being baptized before baptism. Therefore, we see no harm in touching the same places with the oil for the sick during the anointing of the sick. The apostles, when anointing the sick with oil, made no more than three crosses with the oil on them.

The Greeks, following the apostolic tradition, make three crosses with oil. They pour oil from the bottle of the sick in the form of a cross over the head, clothes, and entire body of the sick person.
They start the cross from the head to the feet, from the right hand to the arms, and from the chest to the left hand, saying: "I anoint you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, so that the prayer of faith may save you, and the Lord may lift you up, and if you are in sins, they may be forgiven you."
Clothes soaked with oil are not to be buried with the sick. If they recover, the clothes are washed in a clean place and used again.
This anointing is for both clerics and laypeople, for both men and women if necessary. We read that some holy men anointed paralyzed girls with holy oil and healed them.
We also read that possessed people were anointed with holy oil and healed.
If a sick person falls into madness, according to the Council of Orange, all acts of piety should still be shown to them, including communion if they believed in the Catholic faith when they were sane.
The council states: "To the mad, everything that is of piety should be given."
This is right because if they suddenly become mute, they can be baptized or receive penance if there are just testimonies of their past will.
As long as life is present in the sick person, they can be commended to all acts of piety, even if testimonies of their will are lacking.
For the faith of their friends, all the aids of the sacraments should be given to them, following the evangelical example where Jesus, not looking at the faith of the paralytic but at those who carried him, said: "Man, your sins are forgiven you."
It should be strictly observed that after death, the communion of the Eucharist should not be placed in the mouth of the corpse out of some notion of mercy, which the canons strongly prohibit.
Only penance can be received by friends for the deceased after their death, if there is such great charity in them.

Anointing is also necessary for children. We read that some holy men anointed the bodies of children with sacred oil and restored them to their former health.
Repentance is so essential for children that we read some children, due to the severity of their sins, were handed over to Satan's servants and perished without repentance.
As we have mentioned, priests are permitted to anoint bishops during illness. The Council of Carthage allows priests to confirm the faithful with chrism, like bishops, if they see someone in danger of death who has already been confirmed with holy chrism by a bishop. Similarly, the reconciliation of penitents is granted to them in danger of death.
Even though priests do not hold the highest rank of the pontificate, they are still second to bishops.
When the sick person is anointed with prayers, as mentioned, the priest should instruct him to recite the Lord's Prayer and the Creed, commend his spirit into God's hands, protect himself with the sign of the cross, and bid farewell to the living.
Then the priest should give him peace and communion, saying, "The body and blood of the Lord be for the remission of all your sins, and may it keep you in eternal life."
After offering a prayer, the priest should say, "Let us bless the Lord," and everyone should respond, "Thanks be to God," completing the rite.
For up to seven days, the priest should visit and offer appropriate prayers over him.
Priests should also be instructed that when they impose penance on penitents, they should say: "Brother, all penance is valuable. Besides repenting of such crimes and abstaining from future ones, strive in labors, in vigils, in prayers, in fasts, in almsgiving, and in forgiving enemies.
God does not require long periods of penance. As said through the prophet: 'When you turn and sigh, then you shall be saved.' And again: 'Return to me, and I will return to you.' The Lord is merciful and does not want the death of a sinner, but that he may turn and live."

And in the Gospel, he says:
There will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents more than over ninety-nine who do not need repentance.
And again: On the day the sinner turns back to me, I will erase all his sins.
So, my brother, see how many testimonies you have learned about the remedies for sins, and know that you cannot earn forgiveness unless you turn back with all your heart.
Therefore, make a single burden of all your sins, which can never leave your sight, because constant prayer and continuous lamentation are more acceptable to God than prolonged and lukewarm repentance.
However, the priest should know that he does not need to investigate each individual sin of those confessing. When he finds the greater one, he will judge based on that reason.
We have endeavored to share these things with you priests about gaining the sheep of Christ, with the help of the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
