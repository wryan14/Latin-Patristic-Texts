## Description

Jonas of Orléans' "De cultu imaginum" (On the Veneration of Images) is a significant Carolingian theological treatise defending the veneration of sacred images against the iconoclastic arguments of Claudius of Turin. Written under the patronage of King Charles the Bald, this work demonstrates the Western Church's defense of sacred imagery during a period of iconoclastic controversy.

Book 1 contains Jonas's extensive defense of venerating the cross and religious images, drawing heavily on quotations from Church Fathers (Augustine, Jerome, Chrysostom) and providing biblical and patristic arguments for honoring sacred representations.
