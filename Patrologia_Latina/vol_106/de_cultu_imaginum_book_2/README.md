# De cultu imaginum - Book 2

**Author:** Jonas of Orléans
**Date:** 9th century
**Source:** Patrologia Latina Volume 106

## Description

Book 2 of Jonas of Orléans' response to Claudius of Turin's iconoclastic arguments. This volume continues the systematic refutation of objections to venerating the cross, employing extended satirical comparisons to demonstrate logical fallacies and providing careful distinctions between worship (latria) and veneration (dulia).

This work represents the sophisticated theological discourse of the Carolingian Renaissance and demonstrates the Western Church's position on sacred imagery during the 9th century.
