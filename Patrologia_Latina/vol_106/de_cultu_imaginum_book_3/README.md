# De cultu imaginum - Book 3

**Author:** Jonas of Orléans
**Date:** 9th century
**Source:** Patrologia Latina Volume 106

## Description

Book 3 completes Jonas of Orléans' comprehensive response to Claudius of Turin's iconoclastic position. This final volume focuses particularly on the veneration of relics, a practice central to medieval Christianity. Jonas demonstrates the continuity between Old Testament reverence for holy objects and Christian practices, providing extensive citations from Hebrews and patristic sources.

This concluding book defends the veneration of saints' relics, their miraculous power, and provides the theological basis for venerating instruments of martyrdom.
