The handing over of sacred books.</p><break time=\"1s\"/>\n\n<p>Africa did not receive Christianity directly from the Apostles but likely received the first seeds of the Gospel from the Romans after a century had already passed. These seeds gradually grew and soon produced a large harvest, even though persecutions occasionally cut down part of it. Yet, from the very torments and killings, it gained strength. Tertullian aptly said, on behalf of the Christians in Africa, to the Pagans, \"We become more numerous every time we are mowed down by you. The blood of Christians is seed.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, the most severe persecution against Christians in Africa occurred during the reign of Diocletian and Maximian, after edicts against Christians were issued worldwide at the beginning of the year 303. In the Proconsular province, Anulinus, and in Numidia, Florus, waged war against Christians. Optatus describes this in Book 3, section 8: \"Everyone knows what their crafty cruelty achieved: a war was declared against Christians; in the temples of demons, the devil triumphed; the altars smoked with impure fumes, and because they could not come to sacrileges, they were forced to place incense wherever they could. Every place was a temple for crime. The old were defiled near death; childhood was polluted in ignorance; infants were carried to evil deeds by their mothers; parents were forced to commit bloodless parricides; some were forced to overturn the temples of the living God; others to deny Christ; others to burn the divine laws; others to place incense.\"</p>\n\n<p>And the same author in Book 1, section 13: \"The storm of this persecution spread throughout all of Africa, making some martyrs, others confessors, and laying some low in a disastrous death, while leaving those who hid unharmed. Why should I mention the laypeople, who then had no dignity in the Church? What about the many ministers? What about the deacons in the third rank? What about the presbyters in the second priesthood?\"</p>\n</speak>",

This was a peculiar evil of Diocletian's persecution, where Christians were forced to surrender their sacred books to be burned. Cunning men believed that the Christian religion could be erased from people's minds if the books containing Christian teachings were removed. Hence, Diocletian and Maximian's edict specifically ordered that sacred books be destroyed by fire. To enforce this, it was assigned to leaders and magistrates in each place to seize the holy books from bishops and priests, as recounted in the acts of Felix, bishop of Thuburbo.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    According to this edict, magistrates in each region ordered readers, priests, and bishops to appear before them, demanding the Scriptures from them. Those who refused to hand them over were tortured and imprisoned. Those who persisted were sent to the proconsul or another higher magistrate and were sentenced to death. Officials and soldiers searched Christians' homes, looking through the most secret areas, not only confiscating sacred books but also gold and silver sacred vessels, chalices, lamps, and other ornaments. They even took clothes prepared for the poor. Eventually, as often happens in such cases, the most unscrupulous people looted both sacred and secular valuables. In Africa, old records, which we attached to Optatus's books, confirm the ferocity of the persecutors' rage. Sadly, we also learn from these records, as Optatus says, that many Christians, not only laypeople but also clerics and even bishops, out of fear of torture and death, handed over sacred books and other holy vessels or instruments. These people were commonly called \"Traditores.\"\n  </p>\n</speak>",

However, Felix participated in the Carthaginian Conference. He claimed to be the Bishop of the city of Rome and signed the Donatists' mandate, as recorded in the acts of the conference on day 1, chapter 149. When his name was read out and he came forward, Aurelius, Bishop of the Catholic Church of Carthage, protested: \"Even though he claims to be the bishop of the city of Rome, why is Innocentius, the true Bishop of Rome, pre-judged in his absence?\" It is likely that he was Roman, for Petilianus immediately said: \"No one is unaware of the reason that brought him here. All nobility here is Roman, and you yourselves know this.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe same storm and necessity, specifically the calamity of the Roman city which Alaric captured on August 24, 410, brought him here.
