Si quando vero, prout cura domestica\nexpetebat, domi residerent, Domino longius\nevangelizante, mittebant qui praeferrent Salvatori,\nsuisque, quidquid noverant expedire; quae etiam\nuni de duodecim, Scarioth, tradebantur; qui loculos\nhabens dominicos, ea quae mittebantur portabat (Joan XII 6), furtimque clanculo exportabat.

Audiens haec Salvator supersedit exire; matrem se\nnosse dissimulans, non quo matrem negaret, sed\nquo responderet insidianti: Quae est, ait, mater\nmea, et qui sunt fratres mei? Et extendens manus\nin discipulos: Ecce, inquit, mater mea et fratres\nmei, per unctionem specialem; quicunque enim, in\n utroque sexu, fecerit voluntatem Patris mei, qui in\ncoelis est, ipse meus frater, et soror et mater est .
