Verum, inter tam celebres glorificationes Christi,\nMaria Magdalena laetabatur quidem propalam ineffabiliter\nde Domini et Redemptoris sui gloria; dolebat\ntamen interius inaestimabiliter de dilecti dilectoris\nsui corporali absentia. Naturale est enim, naturale,\ninquam, et necesse erga amicos affici, cum adsunt,\n delectabiliter et jucunde; cum absunt, lacrymabiliter\net moleste. Immensitatem amoris erga recedentem\nmetiuntur lacrymae remanentis; quantus fuerit\namor praesentium, sentitur ex molestia separatorum. Sola tamen Maria patiebatur quod pati solent amantes,\ncum se amittunt, cum nec amiserit amatorem,\nsed praemiserit, ut sibi praeparet mansionem. Denique\ninter prandendum, inter eundum, inter loquendum,\nquam dulciter, quam delectabiliter Salvatorem\naudierit, quam irreverberatis luminibus filium Virginis\naspexerit cujus vultu exsatiari nequivit, qui\nest speciosus forma prae filiis hominum (Psal XLIV 3),\nquis audeat aestimare? quid, post ultimum vale; post\nbenedictionis verba solemnia, elevatis subito manibus,\nferebatur in aera? quid, cum lactea nube susceptum,\n aetheris interiora penetrantem, irrepercussa\nacie sequeretur oculorum? quid, cum patenti coelo\nreceptus, videri ultra non potuit? (Luc XXIV 50 51) Stetisse eam diutius, vel vix, vel minime credo; defecisse\npotius, et anhelo spiritu concidisse; congelatisque\nmembris, appalluisse; rursumque recalescente\npectore, obortis lacrymis, uberrime flevisse. Possetne, quaeso, Maria meminisse dilecti dilectoris\nsui, Domini Jesu, sine moerore, sine lacrymis? Possetne,\nex tunc, tempus esse sine dolore, momentum\nsine mora, hora sine fletu, quanquam sciret sibi non\nesse dolendum, praesertim cum promissionis ejus\nrecordaretur: iturum se parare suis locum, rediturum\nse ut acciperet eos ad seipsum, ut ubi sit ipse\net ipsi sint secum?
