I present this notable monument from Albinus because Cencius is both older and wrote his codex by hand.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        I must add something that the integrity and chastity of history require: Albinus had another old copy of the document at his disposal, and he included its title with the first one. The title reads: \"And the pact of the constitutions of the Emperors Louis the First, Otto the First, and Henry the First with the Roman Pontiffs.\" After the complete privilege, the codex continues with another privilege of Otto the First and Henry the First. It then lists Otto's privilege, omitting what Otto took from Louis's document and confirmed. Finally, it states: \"From the privilege of Emperor Henry,\" including only what pertains to Henry's donation and omitting the rest.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, unless I am mistaken, a very similar copy was made, which Dominicus Georgius found in Codex Vaticanus 1984, from the time of Gelasius and Callixtus the Second, or the early twelfth century. He published it in the new edition of Baronius' Annals (volume thirteen, page six hundred twenty-seven) and challenged Pagi and Muratori, who questioned the authenticity of the document. I also used it elsewhere (Orsi Dom. Temp. Append.) as a copy older than others I have seen. Since the Albinian codex had not yet been found, I could not examine it. However, when this valuable codex came into my hands, after much handling and careful reading of those mutilated documents attached to the Louisian one, I discovered an important omission in both. Where Otto and Henry each said in their document: \"And also the patrimony of Sicily, if God grants it into our hands,\" both mutilated versions read similarly: \"And also the patrimony of Sicily.\"\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Although they are quite distant from those times (Volturnensis reaches the year 1071, and Cassinensis, although appearing more recent to the Italian annalist, reaches 1115, when Leo Marsicanus, bishop of Ostia, who wrote the Chronicle, had died), no scholar doubts that these chroniclers relied on ancient records when writing about events that occurred before their times.</p>\n</speak>",

Hence the words of the charter: To you blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, and through you to your vicar, the Lord Paschal. He adapts the words of the Monument of Volturno, which he transcribes from 92, saying, Blessed Peter the Apostle and his vicar, the Lord Paschal, and immediately adds, imitating his parents Pipin and Charles because in the charter the donations of Pipin and Charles are distinctly listed. The rest is evident by itself.\n\n    However, Ostiensis is mistaken when he says that Louis imitated his parents. Each of them adhered to the boundaries of their donation. Pipin, the first expander of ecclesiastical authority, donated provinces and cities to blessed Peter and his successors. Charles, the confirmer of his father's donation, added his own extensive donation. Louis, on the contrary, ventured far beyond the donations of the Franks and did not grant any cities or provinces at all. Therefore, the simple tradition of the Volturno chronographer about the agreement of confirmation is to be preferred over Ostiensis, who, according to Pagus's opinion, did not first mention the charter but was the first to disturb the charter with his additions.\n\n    Now, indeed, the charter itself must be examined. We have already said enough about its title. The beginning or invocation of the Trinity, at first glance unique, makes the reason for its uniqueness clear if considered attentively. The most learned Mabillon, in Dipl. Book 2, Chapter 3, against the Propylaeum of Papebrochius, brings forth the invocations of the Carolingian era: In the name of God and our Savior Jesus Christ, In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\n\n    Godefridus, noting this matter in the Chronicles of Gotw.

Hahnius considered suspicious in his History of the Empire, part II, chapter 6, section 10, page 208, letter a. However, this phrase is found in many documents, especially Italian ones, reflecting the style of Italian notaries.\n\n    <p>No one, I think, will disagree with the scholarly observation that imperial documents were usually made in Rome, including those of Charlemagne, who issued his donation in the City. Regarding the invocation in the diploma of Louis, whether arranged by Stephen the Fourth or Paschal and confirmed in France, it might be judged differently. Baronius (811, number 44) mentions Charlemagne's testament, made in France, which also includes the invocation: \"In the name of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\" This phrase is also found in Labbe (Councils, volume VII, page 1202) and in Bolland (Acts of the Saints, volume II, page 887), who presents the Life of Saint Charlemagne from two high-quality manuscripts of Eginhard, compared with five other manuscripts and editions.

A few years earlier, Stephen the Third had praised Itherius, the envoy of Bertrada and Charlemagne, for immediately going to the Duchy of Benevento to reclaim the patrimony in those regions (Codex Carolinus, letter 46, or 44).\n    </p>\n\n    <break time=\"1s\"/>\n\n    <p>\n    Charlemagne then mentions Calabria, without adding Sicily, because he had confirmed the entire island in an earlier donation. Regarding this patrimony, it is important to note that since 756, Stephen the Second, while thanking Pippin (Codex Carolinus, letter 11, or 8), had earnestly discussed with the king the possession of the exarchate obtained through Fulrad. Inspired by God and by the blessed Peter, the prince of his apostles, he urged that the part of the Greeks be arranged in such a way that the holy Catholic and apostolic faith remains whole and unshaken, and that the holy Church of God be freed and secured from others and their malicious intentions. This would ensure that the preparation of lights for the Churches of God continues for the salvation of souls, and that the hunger of the poor, needy, and pilgrims be alleviated.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

We hold this opinion to be completely false, as we know for certain that twenty-five years before Pippin, who was the first to expand the pontifical domain, granted the provinces of Emilia and Pentapolis to the exarchate, Gregory the Third, Zacharias, and for some time Stephen the Second, ruled Rome and its duchy. \n\n  Other writers, however, having absorbed the same false opinion, and seeing that the praised pontiffs did not abandon the hope of converting the Greeks before the year 753, when Stephen the Second sought protection from them in France, and knowing that the exarchate alone was donated by Pippin and nothing else was added to Pippin's donation until the first arrival of Charles in Rome in the year 774, attribute the donation of the City to Charles in an uncertain year, with uncertain dominion and an uncertain author. \n\n  The misconceptions of both kinds of writers are dispelled by the letters of Adrian's predecessors, and there is no reason to tackle them again. However, I will briefly demonstrate the significant difference that intervenes between the dominion of the City and its duchy and the rest of the apostolic see's domains, for greater clarity of the Ludovician diploma.\n\n\n  Although the supreme pontifical dominion of the City, and therefore its duchy, is confirmed by several letters of the Codex Carolinus, none proves it better than the one (97, also 85) in which the patrician status of Peter is compared with the patrician status of Charles. From this, Eccard and the Italian annalist are compelled to admit the same supreme dominion in the exarchate, as we said.\n</speak>",

Otto, Henry, the papal archive, and the Pontifical Book bear witness, and thus the voluntary promise should be delayed until the consecration of Leo the Fourth in 847, after the privilege granted three years earlier by Sergius the Second. Leo is said to have made this promise voluntarily because of the fear of the Saracens, as neither an order nor an envoy from the emperor had been expected.
