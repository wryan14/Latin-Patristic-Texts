Dissertation on the Charter of Louis the Pious

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,008
Among the ancient documents, none has surfaced more often than the charter of Louis the Pious.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:21,944
Notably, Baronius, using the best Vatican manuscripts, and in our time, the most eminent Antonellus, who was the superintendent of the archive of the Mausoleum of Hadrian, published it very accurately from a copy of that same archive, since the original has been lost.

4
00:00:21,944 --> 00:00:26,156
The nature of my work requires that I also bring this precious document to light.

5
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:36,817
Therefore, since I have a very old example from the Albinian manuscript, which does not differ much from the copy of the Mausoleum of Hadrian, I will present it with the varying readings of that same copy.

6
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:54,394
I believe that both were similarly recorded by Cencio in the Book of Taxes, as Panvinius, in whose time this genuine book existed in the Vatican library, mentions in the catalog of privileges of the Holy See (Vatican Codex 3924), where he lists the Louis charter (page 45): Extracted from the Book of Taxes of the Roman Church, folio 110.

7
00:00:54,394 --> 00:01:00,530
He then provides the beginning of the Charter: Privilege of Emperor Louis confirming the regal rights to Pope Paschal.

8
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,014
In the name of the Lord God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

9
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:04,482
I, Louis.

10
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:32,875
This is the exact wording of the Albinian manuscript, except that the name Louis is expressed with a double "w," which, along with other words in the charter, reflects the style of the ninth century when the document was created.
From this, we can infer that Albinus took great care in copying ancient documents, and that the Louis privilege was taken from the original document, from the authentic codex of the Lateran archive.
The author of the codex is the same witness to the matter, as I noted in the preface to the first volume (number 25).

11
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:38,699
Indeed, no one should be given more credence than Albinus and Cencio, each of whom examined the Lateran archive.

12
00:01:39,168 --> 00:01:49,219
When the genuine Codex of Cencius was stolen from the Vatican Library after Panvinius's time, I am certain of this because no codex at the Holy See matches the number of pages cited by Panvinius.

13
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:54,529
I present this notable monument from Albinus because Cencius is both older and wrote his codex by hand.

14
00:01:54,529 --> 00:02:03,807
I must add something that the integrity and chastity of history require: Albinus had another old copy of the document at his disposal, and he included its title with the first one.

15
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:48,653
The title reads: "And the pact of the constitutions of the Emperors Louis the First, Otto the First, and Henry the First with the Roman Pontiffs." After the complete privilege, the codex continues with another privilege of Otto the First and Henry the First. It then lists Otto's privilege, omitting what Otto took from Louis's document and confirmed. Finally, it states: "From the privilege of Emperor Henry," including only what pertains to Henry's donation and omitting the rest.
Therefore, unless I am mistaken, a very similar copy was made, which Dominicus Georgius found in Codex Vaticanus 1984, from the time of Gelasius and Callixtus the Second, or the early twelfth century. He published it in the new edition of Baronius' Annals (volume thirteen, page six hundred twenty-seven) and challenged Pagi and Muratori, who questioned the authenticity of the document.

16
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:53,344
I also used it elsewhere (Orsi Dom. Temp. Append.) as a copy older than others I have seen.

17
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:57,055
Since the Albinian codex had not yet been found, I could not examine it.

18
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:07,159
However, when this valuable codex came into my hands, after much handling and careful reading of those mutilated documents attached to the Louisian one, I discovered an important omission in both.

19
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:17,159
Where Otto and Henry each said in their document: "And also the patrimony of Sicily, if God grants it into our hands," both mutilated versions read similarly: "And also the patrimony of Sicily."

20
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,192
Such an omission clearly indicates the era of three charters being joined together, doesn't it?

21
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:30,896
When the Norman leaders had been pacified and absolved of excommunication, Nicholas the Second traveled there to assert the rights of the Holy See in Apulia and other provinces.

22
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:38,519
He held a council there and received an oath of loyalty from those leaders in the year 1059, as recorded in the Book of Taxes and more clearly by Baronius.

23
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,338
Similarly, Nicholas the Third did the same with Rudolph, to whom he sent the same three charters, also incomplete, which will be discussed in its proper place.

24
00:03:46,338 --> 00:04:44,419
Nor should it be thought that those charters were accidentally shortened or that the condition "if God, etc." was omitted by the scribe in both cases.
Since the Normans were no longer hostile to the Apostolic See, it needed to be shown that Sicily was under the jurisdiction of the Roman Church, as it truly was due to the invasion of the patrimonies of Calabria and Sicily.
As we have seen in the previous dissertation, Adrian equated this with the persecution of sacred images.
Since Louis had issued his charter before the arrival of the Saracens and confirmed the grant of the island made by his ancestor Charlemagne, it made sense-as the Greeks had possessed those patrimonies for ninety years to great detriment-and thirty thousand and five hundred thousand gold coins, possibly more than the island was worth at that time, had been taken from the poor and the churches, provoking divine retribution.
Since, I say, Louis had issued his charter before the Saracen invasion, there was no reason for him to include that condition, which had to be included in the charters of Otto and Henry, because the rights of the Holy See had to be asserted by the expulsion of the Saracens.

25
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:52,718
During the time of Pope Nicholas, the island of Sicily suffered under Saracen rule for 230 years, with the Greeks losing all hope of reclaiming it.

26
00:04:52,718 --> 00:05:00,821
Meanwhile, the Normans had taken control of Calabria, Apulia, and Capua, which later came to be known as Sicily cis Pharum, through military force.

27
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:07,159
Pope Leo the Ninth had tried and failed to reclaim these territories by force to assert the rights of the Holy See.

28
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:12,947
Fortunately, Pope Nicholas, guided by divine counsel, managed to reconcile the Normans with the Holy See.

29
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:27,223
Through imperial decrees, he effectively taught them the rights of the Roman Church, achieving more in a concise manner than if he had elaborated on the nearly tripled sums involved in fraud against the poor and churches, which further confirmed these rights.

30
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:38,467
The oaths of fidelity from Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and the mission to reclaim Sicily from Saracen control, achieved through apostolic authority, stand as a testament to this success.

31
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:46,404
These oaths are documented in the Albinian Codex shortly after the decrees and in Baronius's account in the Book of Censuses (1059, n. 70 seq.).

32
00:05:46,404 --> 00:06:00,515
An oath of fidelity to Alexander the Second, granted to Richard of Capua two years later, is also recorded in the Albinian Codex: Acted in the hall of the Lateran Sacred Palace on October 2, in the third year of the 15th indiction, namely in the year 1061.

33
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:12,255
A similar oath was taken by the same Richard to Gregory the Seventh, as recorded by Baronius (1073, n. 63) in the register of the holy pontiff in Labbe's work (Conc. vol. X, p. 23) with some variations at the end.

34
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:35,791
Regarding the fidelity of these oaths, Robert declared, "And to no one will I swear fidelity, except saving the fidelity to the Holy Roman Church." This statement is absent in Baronius's account because it was not found in the Book of Censuses; however, it must be restored. The Normans knew that Apulia and Calabria were Greek territories, and Robert maintained their rule, acknowledging the supreme authority of the Holy See.

35
00:06:36,288 --> 00:08:17,975
Similarly, Richard said: "To King Henry, I will swear loyalty, as I have been advised by you or your successors, but with loyalty to the Holy Roman Church preserved."
But we will discuss these matters in more detail when we talk about Otto's charter.
It's important to note that the Norman princes couldn't have known all these things without examining their charters.
So, without guessing, but firmly arguing from the evidence, I am confident in saying that Nicholas II is the author of the aforementioned mutilation of the charters, and that it happened in the year 1058 or the following year.
However, let no one blame the Pope for this act, as if he had deceitfully removed that condition.
The autographs of both charters are still diligently kept in the archive of Castel Sant'Angelo, where that condition is evident, and nothing obstructs the donation of Sicily made by Charles before the Saracen invasion, and confirmed by Otto and Henry, provided that they restored it to the Holy See after it was taken from their grasp.
Neither Augustus had recovered it, and therefore it was necessary for the successors to rely purely on the donation of Charles, which Nicholas evidently did.
Perhaps the Italian annalist, in the year 1059, sensed something; for he had forgotten himself, as he had depicted the submission of Louis in 817 contrary to the opinions of the most learned men, Baronius, Gretser, Natalis Alexander, Pierre de Marca, Cointius, Claude Fleury, Gootius, Hottoman, and Basnage, not to mention more recent scholars, all of whom acknowledge Louis as legitimate, and imagined that during these times, those three charters with additions according to the wishes of the Roman pontiffs came to light.
But I have shown that something was rather taken away from Otto's and Henry's charters than added.
As for Louis's charter, whose value lies not in its antiquity but in its contents, I trust I will make it clear why those praised most learned men unanimously declared it the legitimate offspring of Augustus.

36
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:28,169
Meanwhile, it's worth noting that the complete privilege of Louis, along with two others, is listed among the first records of the eleventh century in the codex titled: Privilege of Louis, emperor, etc.

37
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:35,738
Conversely, two other complete ones are included in the records of the twelfth century and are titled: Example of the privilege of Otto, emperor, etc.

38
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:38,160
Example of the privilege of Henry, emperor, etc.

39
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:46,436
Thus, it seems we can affirm that the privilege of Louis was transcribed from the original document during the time of Nicholas the Second, just like the other two.

40
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:51,886
Although in the declining twelfth century, when Albinus was flourishing, none of the originals were in Rome.

41
00:08:51,886 --> 00:09:00,616
Whatever reasons I might present for why the others, moved here and there, managed to reach us, but the privilege of Louis could nowhere be found, would be mere speculation.

42
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:06,369
However, it is a minor loss, given that excellent copies exist with Albinus and in the archive of the Adrian Mole.

43
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:14,443
The essence of the matter is to reveal the nature of the document, which, as it seems to have been made by no one else, I willingly and gladly take upon myself.

44
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:21,205
And first, the document itself manifests as a pact of confirmation, repeatedly calling itself a decree of confirmation once and again.

45
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:33,820
The chronographer of Saint Vincent at Volturno (Duchesne, volume three, page six hundred eighty-one) in the Life of Abbot Joshua, who was present at the Aachen assembly where this document was issued, calls it a pact of constitution and confirmation.

46
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:45,679
The same words are used by the chronologist of Monte Cassino, Leo of Ostia, believed by the scholar Fontanini (Dif. one, page one hundred forty-five) to be the introducer of the new term constitution, which the document itself rejects.

47
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,381
However, to state what I think, it seems more like a redundancy of words rather than a new meaning of the matter.

48
00:09:51,381 --> 00:10:02,634
For it can either simply be called a pact according to the custom of that age, or a pact of constitution; it will always be an instrument requested by agreement, or a stipulation, whose nature the word confirmation reveals.

49
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,174
Indeed, in that entire agreement, not even an inch of land was granted to the Roman Church by Louis.

50
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,862
Neither Stephen the Fourth nor Paschal the First, through his legate, asked the emperor for it.

51
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:19,277
They simply wanted the old rights to be confirmed by imperial authority, as was done by the aforementioned confirmation agreement.

52
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:28,703
Therefore, the Astronomer, a contemporary of Louis the Pious and part of his entourage who wrote the Life of the same emperor, says: The carrier of the legation was Theodorus the nomenclator.

53
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:37,092
After completing the task and obtaining the requested items, specifically the confirmation of the agreement and friendship, he returned in the manner of his predecessors.

54
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:52,735
Furthermore, the same chronographer of Volturno, as Mabillon attests (Annals, book twenty-eight, number forty-five), asserts that Abbot Joshua was so favored by Pope Paschal that when he received the confirmation agreement from Louis, he wished to be present among the abbots of France on behalf of the Apostolic See.

55
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:58,311
Here, as you see, he passes over in silence the voice of the constitution, which is less acceptable to Fontanini.

56
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:05,911
In the same place, however, the chronographer seems to testify freely to me that he found the confirmation agreement in the Pontifical Book of the Church.

57
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:14,152
Indeed, you will find donations described there in the most abundant words, but the confirmations of the same, unless joined with a new donation, you will hardly find.

58
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:18,396
Thus, the silence of this agreement in the Pontifical Book supports my interpretation.

59
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:27,920
The same Albinus, or rather Nicholas the Second, and Cencius do not attribute any other title to Louis than the privilege of Louis, the emperor, for confirming the royal rights to Pope Paschal.

60
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,717
In contrast, they inscribe the title in the privileges of Otto and Henry as concerning the royal rights granted to Saint Peter, for each added a new donation.

61
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:42,576
If Pagius had understood this, he would not have wrongly asserted (787, number eight) when he acknowledged the legitimate diploma of Louis.

62
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:53,038
Regarding the other Tuscany, always possessed by the emperors, it included other places that Louis the emperor granted to the same see in parts of Tuscany, as we will show in the year eight hundred and seventeen.

63
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:58,565
This does not appeal to the most learned and venerable cardinal's critic, but rather to a man of great delusion.

64
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:07,943
When the reader examines the previously mentioned year (817, n. 7), they will find Pagium siding with Molinaeus and Goldastus, and doing so with no small admiration.

65
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:20,843
Pagium asserts that the donation claimed to have been made by Louis the Pious to the Roman Church, as noted by Gratian, is just as fictitious as the one attributed to Constantine the Great, a point already recognized by some learned individuals.

66
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:33,059
This opinion resonated so strongly with the Italian annalist that he not only embraced it wholeheartedly but also scrutinized the ancient document for all the formalities of legal documents, arguing its falsity due to their absence.

67
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:39,851
This view gained traction among certain foreign writers, who were equally hostile towards the Catholic religion and the Holy See.

68
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:48,749
One writer, almost as if this diploma had been widely proclaimed, dedicated his writings-essentially mockeries-against the apostolic see's dominion to the same annalist.

69
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:55,962
In many parts, he professed that he owed to this annalist whatever he produced by dismantling that principal monument of papal authority.

70
00:12:55,962 --> 00:13:10,442
The diploma itself, considered insignificant, was not sourced from any reputable copy nor from any of its many editions known to scholars, but was instead composed based on the commentaries of Urban Volaterranus, who was almost unknown to everyone (Geography, book 3, p. 41).

71
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:14,286
Utilizing his creativity, he relegated it to the end of his small volume.

72
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:27,607
I will present its title to demonstrate how highly the opinions of a Catholic writer on the temporal dominion of the Roman Church are valued among people of his sect, who are not without erudition, rather than to waste time refuting numerous falsehoods.

73
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:27,817
VII.

74
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:35,715
The critique of the diploma by Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch, which is said to have been granted by Emperor Louis the Pious to Pope Paschal the First.

75
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:42,507
Dedicated to the esteemed Ludovico Antonio Muratori, and in opposition to the renowned historian of the Paduans, Antonio Sandino.

76
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:45,983
The diploma itself is included, with noted variations in readings.

77
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:46,667
Leipzig, etc.

78
00:13:47,351 --> 00:14:05,316
If you want to understand the writer's thoughts briefly, consider these words from the dedication:
He praises the Italian Annals highly because they are very useful in defending and maintaining the most august right of our German Empire to Italy, a right confirmed by the constant usage of eighteen hundred years, and suppressing the impudence of the adversaries.

79
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:21,896
And further down:
Regarding the Louis Document, the investigation, which the great man Hermann Conring adorned with the example and imitation of the historians of our nation with the title of eighty-nine, consecrated to your famous name in the ancient manner, I offer it to you, and I earnestly beg and beseech you to accept it kindly.

80
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:24,717
It is unjust to brand a Catholic writer with such a mark.

81
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:31,942
He does not speak with the sectarians about all of Italy, but about Italy properly so-called, or the Kingdom of Italy, or if you prefer, Lombardy.

82
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:41,741
Although he did not achieve participation in the supreme power by Roman coronation, he wrote about the same to the detriment of the pontifical power, which we discussed in the previous dissertation.

83
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:51,887
Thinking the Louis Document to be forged, because his genius did not grasp it in the same way, he showed himself to be a rather unskilled writer than a supporter of the sectarians, as the censor considers.

84
00:14:51,887 --> 00:15:06,833
However, lest the incautious youth, deceived by a writer of such renown, think that the Louis Document should be dismissed along with the Edict or Donation of Constantine, I have decided to discuss his genius more thoroughly, aiming to serve the truth rather than opposing the false opinions of others.

85
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,693
I will start with the very causes that gave rise to this pact of confirmation.

86
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:21,284
The Annals of Lorsch, erroneously attributed to Einhard, and the Fulda Annals, according to Baronius and Pagus (eight fifteen, number one), report how certain Roman nobles conspiring to kill Pope Leo were executed.

87
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:33,706
The Astronomer narrates the matter more fully (chapter thirty-eight) for the aforementioned year:
This year, he says, as the course turned, it was reported to the emperor that some powerful Romans had entered into wicked conspiracies against Pope Leo.

88
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:40,113
Those whom the apostolic leader condemned to capital punishment, according to Roman law, were convicted and punished.

89
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:47,296
However, the Emperor was greatly troubled upon hearing this, as he was disturbed by such severe actions from the highest priest of the world.

90
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:52,340
Therefore, he sent Bernard, King of Italy, to investigate the truth and report back through Gerold.

91
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,537
King Bernard himself went to Rome and reported back what he had seen through the aforementioned envoy.

92
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:05,740
But soon after, envoys of the same apostolic leader Leo-Bishop John of Silva Candida, Theodorus the nomenclator, and Duke Sergius-cleared Leo of the accusations.

93
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:23,878
Note that it was Louis, not the Emperor as the Astronomer calls him (writing almost 30 years later and prematurely giving him this title), but the king, as Theganus rightly calls him, who, entrusted by his father with the care of the Roman Church, sent to inquire whether the Pope had indeed punished the guilty, and upon learning the facts, remained calm.

94
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:42,372
For the popes conducted themselves in such cases, as the Liber Pontificalis recounts about Adrian:
The most holy bishop, at the request of the judges and the entire Roman populace, ordered the chamberlain Calvulus and the aforementioned Campanians to be handed over to the prefect of the city, to be examined before the entire populace in the manner of murderers.

95
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:46,957
Taken to the public prison on the Elephant, they were examined before the entire populace.

96
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:50,524
Thus, the Campanians confessed in this examination as they had before.

97
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:56,485
However, Calvulus, hardening his heart, barely confessed to everything, and he died a cruel death in the same prison.

98
00:16:56,485 --> 00:17:02,293
But after the aforementioned conspiracy against the holy pontiff, he fell gravely ill and died the following year.

99
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:18,087
Wherefore the Astronomer continues: When Pope Leo was weighed down by illness, all the estates called "domocultae," which had been newly established by the same apostolic leader, as well as those that were unlawfully taken from him, were looted and efforts were made to restore them without awaiting any judge.

100
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,604
Similar accounts are found in the Annales Laureshamenses.

101
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:33,277
So, it's not surprising that Leo's successor, Stephen the Fourth, shortly after his consecration, went to France to discuss confirming various rights with the pious prince who had been crowned with the imperial diadem by him.

102
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:44,015
After Stephen returned, his death shortly thereafter prevented him from retrieving all the documents of donations from the Lateran archives, organizing them, and completing a pact or diploma in every detail.

103
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:55,428
This pact was supposed to cover all rights, including the most ancient ones, starting from the city of Rome and its duchy, which had been under the Holy See for 25 years before the first donation from the Frankish kings.

104
00:17:55,428 --> 00:18:00,512
It was also supposed to include the discipline of the election and consecration of Roman pontiffs.

105
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:05,959
What Stephen couldn't accomplish in a span of two months and a few days, his successor Paschal completed.

106
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:14,156
Paschal then sent a delegation to the prince to confirm everything, as affirmed by the cited writers, especially the Astronomer (chapter 40) for the year 817.

107
00:18:14,156 --> 00:19:04,580
Theganus, who thoroughly describes the character of the pious Augustus, is silent on this matter but had mentioned in chapter 18 about Stephen: "As long as the most blessed pope was there, they had daily discussions about the benefit of God's holy Church."
And when the Astronomer adds in chapter 39 for the year 816: "The apostolic lord, having obtained all he requested, returned to Rome," it seems to me there is no doubt that Stephen reached an agreement with Louis about the confirmation pact, which Paschal later secured. This is corroborated by two chroniclers, Volturnensis and Cassinensis. Although they are quite distant from those times (Volturnensis reaches the year 1071, and Cassinensis, although appearing more recent to the Italian annalist, reaches 1115, when Leo Marsicanus, bishop of Ostia, who wrote the Chronicle, had died), no scholar doubts that these chroniclers relied on ancient records when writing about events that occurred before their times.

108
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:25,951
So, from the records of the Life of Abbot Joshua of Volturno, who was present at the council in Aachen, he gathered this:
Then, after making an agreement of constitution and confirmation with the most blessed Pope Paschal, and sealing it with his own hand and that of his three sons, he sent it through the emissary Theodore, the nomenclator of the Holy Roman Church, to the aforementioned Pope.

109
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:31,801
In this agreement, ten bishops, eight abbots, fifteen counts, a librarian, a steward, and a doorkeeper signed.

110
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:46,374
However, Leo of Ostia reports the same event with slightly different words in Book One, Chapter Sixteen:
Here, Louis made an agreement of constitution and confirmation for the blessed Peter the apostle and his vicar Lord Paschal, just like his parents Pepin and Charles did.

111
00:19:46,374 --> 00:20:00,149
Sealing it with his own hand and that of his sons, he had ten bishops, eight abbots, fifteen counts, a librarian, a steward, and one doorkeeper sign it, and sent it through the emissary Theodore, the nomenclator of the Holy Roman Church, to Lord Pope Paschal.

112
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:05,573
The testimony of the Cassinese Chronicle, or Leo of Ostia, may seem superfluous to some; but it's not.

113
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:17,540
Indeed, the first mention of this document is wrongly attributed to Leo by Pagi (817, number 7):
Leo of Ostia, who died at the beginning of the twelfth century, was the first to mention it, so it wasn't conceived long before.

114
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,976
What confidence in the man!

115
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:34,612
So what does Du Cange (Glossary, under the word Seal) say about a charter of Charlemagne, two royal decrees of Charlemagne and his son Louis; and from the chronicle of Saint Vincent of Volturno (Book Two, page 681) he quotes these words:
Sealing it with his own hand and that of his three sons?

116
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:38,760
Indeed, Leo of Ostia says, with the seal of his own hand and that of his sons.

117
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,887
Therefore, the first mention of the document should not be attributed to Leo, but to the ancient records of the Monastery of Volturno.

118
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:52,748
While working on the Cassinese chronicle, he shows that he had both the Volturno record and the diploma of Louis in front of him.

119
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,712
From that place, he seeks the essence of the matter and compiles the varying readings from the charter.

120
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:05,358
Hence the words of the charter: To you blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, and through you to your vicar, the Lord Paschal.

121
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:20,547
He adapts the words of the Monument of Volturno, which he transcribes from 92, saying, Blessed Peter the Apostle and his vicar, the Lord Paschal, and immediately adds, imitating his parents Pipin and Charles because in the charter the donations of Pipin and Charles are distinctly listed.

122
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,130
The rest is evident by itself.

123
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,138
However, Ostiensis is mistaken when he says that Louis imitated his parents.

124
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:29,144
Each of them adhered to the boundaries of their donation.

125
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:35,473
Pipin, the first expander of ecclesiastical authority, donated provinces and cities to blessed Peter and his successors.

126
00:21:35,473 --> 00:21:39,798
Charles, the confirmer of his father's donation, added his own extensive donation.

127
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:46,180
Louis, on the contrary, ventured far beyond the donations of the Franks and did not grant any cities or provinces at all.

128
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:59,999
Therefore, the simple tradition of the Volturno chronographer about the agreement of confirmation is to be preferred over Ostiensis, who, according to Pagus's opinion, did not first mention the charter but was the first to disturb the charter with his additions.

129
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,583
Now, indeed, the charter itself must be examined.

130
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,904
We have already said enough about its title.

131
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:12,077
The beginning or invocation of the Trinity, at first glance unique, makes the reason for its uniqueness clear if considered attentively.

132
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:13,923
The most learned Mabillon, in Dipl.

133
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:27,741
Book 2, Chapter 3, against the Propylaeum of Papebrochius, brings forth the invocations of the Carolingian era: In the name of God and our Savior Jesus Christ, In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

134
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:30,747
Godefridus, noting this matter in the Chronicles of Gotw.

135
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:36,866
Volume 1, Book 2, Chapter 1, Page 117, and following, notes that the style of the notaries varied in these formulas.

136
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:40,874
Especially in Chapter 6, Page 231, about the various invocations of Henry I.

137
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:46,570
"I do not see," he says, "why it should be rejected in the Henrician charter granted to the Roman Church..."

138
00:22:47,519 --> 00:23:50,071
In the year 1014, the invocation "In the name of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" was produced, which D. Frider. Hahnius considered suspicious in his History of the Empire, part II, chapter 6, section 10, page 208, letter a. However, this phrase is found in many documents, especially Italian ones, reflecting the style of Italian notaries.
No one, I think, will disagree with the scholarly observation that imperial documents were usually made in Rome, including those of Charlemagne, who issued his donation in the City. Regarding the invocation in the diploma of Louis, whether arranged by Stephen the Fourth or Paschal and confirmed in France, it might be judged differently. Baronius (811, number 44) mentions Charlemagne's testament, made in France, which also includes the invocation: "In the name of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit." This phrase is also found in Labbe (Councils, volume VII, page 1202) and in Bolland (Acts of the Saints, volume II, page 887), who presents the Life of Saint Charlemagne from two high-quality manuscripts of Eginhard, compared with five other manuscripts and editions.

139
00:23:50,071 --> 00:24:39,137
The only difference is that in all of them it reads: "In the name of the Lord God Almighty," etc., as seen in the Ludovician copy of Adrian Mole, and in the diplomas of Otto and Henry from the Albinian codex according to their autographs.
From this, it can be safely inferred that all the privileges granted by the Carolingians to Saint Peter and his successors preferred this invocation, which Otto and Henry also imitated, clearly in the style of the scribes of the Holy See, whose job it was to produce these from the archive records. I do not doubt that if the donation of Pippin existed, it would bear the exact same invocation that all successors embraced.
That holy republic, namely Rome and its duchy, which existed even before the donations of the Frankish kings, was confirmed by Louis as belonging to the apostolic see, following the surrender of the people who defected from the impious Greeks.

140
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:48,928
Because Emperor Stephen IV had agreed, with the authority of the emperor, to prevent lootings, he also wished to protect all ecclesiastical domains with strong fortifications.

141
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:56,773
The emperor himself explains the matter clearly: Just as you have held and managed in your power and domain from your predecessors until now.

142
00:24:56,773 --> 00:25:05,786
Then he lists each city, both of Roman Tuscany and Campania; for the duchy was divided into two parts, as all scholars know, into Cistiberinum and Transtiberinum.

143
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:16,468
We see clearly in the letters of the Codex Carolinus that these cities were under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic See before any donation, making it unnecessary to demonstrate it again here.

144
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:29,320
It suffices to recall that Stephen II told Pippin, who had returned to France (Codex Carolinus, letters 6, 7, others 7, 9), that the Lombards had nullified the donation and had not given even a palm's width of land to the holy see.

145
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,663
On the contrary, they had conducted raids, plundering, and devastations in the cities and places of blessed Peter.

146
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:49,016
Again urging him to undertake a new expedition (Codex Carolinus, letters 8, 9, others 4, 6), while Rome was besieged by the Lombards: No improvement has been made for us, he said, but rather after the desolation of our entire province, etc.

147
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:56,805
What is desired more clearly to hold, that the city of Rome and its duchy were of the jurisdiction of the Apostolic See before any donation?

148
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:09,156
From the same source, there is even more ample testimony: for the same pontiff says below, The city of Narni, which your Christianity granted to blessed Peter, they have taken away, and they have seized some of our cities.

149
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:27,795
He distinguishes the city of Narni of the Roman duchy from the others, and reports to Pippin that it was taken because it had been previously invaded by the Duke of Spoleto (Book of the Pontiffs, section 254) and was restored by Aistulph, frightened by Pippin's royal emissaries upon his first arrival (Codex Regius, Mazarin, Thu.) 13.

150
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:46,223
But because Pagius and others argue that this part of the papal territory was owed to royal generosity, they are not afraid to claim that the words of Louis refer to your predecessors against the consistent faith of all the manuscripts, substituting ours, so that Pepin and Charles seem to have given Rome and its duchy to Saint Peter and his successors.

151
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:53,617
It will be worthwhile to show the opposite, not by reasoning, which I did in the illustration of the Codex Carolinus, but by their own confession.

152
00:26:53,617 --> 00:27:00,656
They do not count Charles Martel among the predecessors of Louis, although they dispute so much about his patriciate with empty contention.

153
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:05,264
They say that in the year 741, he was prevented by death from aiding the endangered Church.

154
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:12,152
Moreover, they admit that the Roman pontiffs did not abandon their obedience to the Greek Emperors, however impious, until the year 753.

155
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:20,001
In the following year, during Pepin's first expedition, they say that Narnia, one of the cities of the Roman duchy, was restored out of fear of the Franks.

156
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:30,383
Therefore, whatever they imagine the lord of the Roman duchy, whose capital is Rome, to have been, this territory, by their own confession, was subject to its own ruler before Pepin's donation took effect.

157
00:27:30,383 --> 00:28:13,733
However, who this ruler was, Pepin himself testified to the Romans one year after his donation, as the Romans themselves teach us in the letters they sent to the king: "Concerning your most blessed and co-angelic spiritual father, our lord decreed by God, Pope Paul."
Therefore, the predecessors mentioned in your Louisian document were Gregory the Third, Zacharias, Stephen the Second for 25 years before the donation, and after the donation, Paul the First, Stephen the Third, and Adrian.
They themselves, admitting what they cannot deny, state that Pepin's donation was confined within the borders of the exarchate and Pentapolis. They do not even dare to speak about Adrian and his successor Leo the Third, although some of them might try to evade this authority in another way, which I have abundantly demonstrated in the notes to the Codex Carolinus.

158
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:26,922
Why, then, would they prefer to adhere to Gratian, who was the first to place our matters, rather than to the consistent testimony of the codices and their own confession, is not difficult to understand: they do not know what they are saying.

159
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:39,651
The second chapter of Louis' diploma shows the very donation of Pepin-not as we said, made at Carisiacum in the year 754 and confirmed by Pepin's two sons, Charles and Carloman, but as Charles the Great confirmed it in Rome in the year 774.

160
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:51,319
The former was indeed very diligently kept in the archive of the Lateran Church; when twenty years later, in 774, Charles came to Rome and had the promise made in Francia at the place called Carisiacum read to him again.

161
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:58,373
He was pleased with it, and with his judges, added everything that was attached to it, as it is in the Pontifical book (section 318).

162
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:05,533
The Most Christian king of the Franks himself, corroborating it with his own hand, made all bishops, abbots, dukes, and counts sign it.

163
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:26,164
Then, placing it first on the altar of Saint Peter, and later inside his holy confession, both the king of the Franks and his judges, promising by oath to the blessed Peter and his most holy vicar Pope Adrian to preserve everything contained in that donation, handed it over, as Albinus read in his time, and with little difference, all the codices, both published and manuscript, have it.

164
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:38,097
A donation so solemnly and so sacredly confirmed by Charles, which Adrian not once, nor without reason calls an offering and holocaust in his letters, is sought in vain elsewhere; it exists complete in the one Louis' diploma.

165
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:48,492
The most diligent collector of ancient monuments, Francesco Bianchini, thinks he has published it from the most famous Farnese Codex for the benefit of the public (Anastasius, volume II, page 57).

166
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:57,667
As a fair evaluator of that precious manuscript, when he was transferred to Parma along with the Farnese library, he went there repeatedly, taking a sample of the uncial script.

167
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:04,482
He indicated that the manuscript was from the time of Charlemagne, which Holstenius and Schelstratius had neglected while it was in Rome.

168
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:10,998
He described the entire passage I referred to when discussing the letters of Stephen the Second as a monument of Pippin's donation.

169
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:14,778
But the very learned man was deceived by the account in the Pontifical book.

170
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:28,904
Although it mentions how Pippin, confirming with a new diploma everything he had granted to Saint Peter and his successors with his diploma at Carisiacum, also added Comaclum, the cities listed are only those whose possession Fulrad, Pippin's envoy, took and brought the keys to Rome.

171
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:37,808
Therefore, it will be found that ten cities are missing in the Pontifical book, all of which are found in the diploma of Louis, except for the city of Narnia in the Duchy of Rome.

172
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:44,622
Fulrad had also taken possession of Narnia, even though it was later separated from the old jurisdiction of the Holy See by the donation.

173
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:48,353
Therefore, Louis rightly includes it among the cities of the Duchy of Rome.

174
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:58,151
Pippin's donation, complete and with such precision and distinction, is listed in the diploma, so it is surprising why the two more recent scholars did not refrain from suspecting its authenticity.

175
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:04,767
Indeed, although it mentions only Pippin's donation, it does not attribute it solely to Pippin but makes Charles a participant in it.

176
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:15,162
In the twenty years that followed Pippin's donation and preceded Charles's first arrival in the city, the ten cities, whose possession the Lombards refused to hand over, were often promised but never returned.

177
00:31:15,162 --> 00:31:21,927
Charles, after capturing Desiderius, the king of the Lombards, and subduing their kingdom, claimed the entire donation for the Holy See.

178
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,315
This is evidenced by the two letters of Charles.

179
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:38,596
A few months after Charles's departure, Adrian informed the king about the invasion by Archbishop Leo of Ravenna into Faenza, Imola, Ferrara, Bologna, and Adria, also known as Gabellum, where he had appointed a count recommended by Charles in the church of Saint Peter.

180
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:43,327
This makes it clear that all the cities of Emilia were under the control of the Roman Church.

181
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:50,601
Regarding the four cities of the Pentapolis, letters confirm that both Pentapoles, from Rimini to Gubbio, remain faithful to the apostolic see.

182
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:59,300
Additionally, other letters, ninety or ninety-two, reveal that the territory or town of Valva served as a refuge for five of Charles's envoys during the Beneventan unrest.

183
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:05,863
You might wonder why Emilia is not mentioned among the other cities in the Codex Carolinus, which follows Ravenna in the diploma.

184
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:09,424
However, it is mentioned in other letters and documents as a province.

185
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:15,477
Therefore, I believe the medieval Italian geographer made a significant mistake by converting the province into a city.

186
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:20,514
And you are not alone in this confusion: I too was once misled and embraced that erroneous opinion.

187
00:32:20,514 --> 00:32:20,717
Why?

188
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:34,147
Because I saw that the Exarchate had narrower boundaries during the Lombard period than during the Roman Republic, and that Emilia was divided into two parts up to the territory of Bologna, making it part of the Italian kingdom, and from there the Exarchate began.

189
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:41,320
Nevertheless, I discovered that Emilia was indeed granted to the apostolic see in this diploma, which many learned men considered legitimate.

190
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,355
In these complexities, what was I to do?

191
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:53,173
A unique and previously unheard-of doctrine emerged from the geographer, who seemed to have strong reasons for removing Emilia's name as a province in the Exarchate, and I followed his opinion.

192
00:32:53,784 --> 00:33:02,275
Afterwards, I turned my serious attention to defending the rights of the Holy See, refusing to accept any opinions that contradicted the clear records of the annals.

193
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:11,230
I discovered that this chronicler, highly regarded by the Italian annalist in many other matters, was greatly mistaken in detracting from the honor of the province of Emilia.

194
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:19,311
The province did not lose its status, as evident from the division of ecclesiastical provinces; instead, it began to be more limited in civil administration.

195
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:26,207
Since it retained the name Emilia in the exarchate, in the Kingdom of Italy, that prominent kingdom name absorbed the provincial name.

196
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:30,788
Furthermore, the formation of the dual Pentapolis within the exarchate restricted Emilia.

197
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:36,243
Thus, three provinces began to exist in the exarchate: Emilia, Maritime Pentapolis, and Inland Pentapolis.

198
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:49,058
When Fulrad was about to take possession of the cities of Pentapolis and Emilia, as stated in the Farnesian Code, he advanced into the exarchate and brought the keys of both the city of Ravenna and various cities of the exarchate of Ravenna to Rome.

199
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:53,999
The cities are listed in the code without distinguishing between the provinces of the exarchate.

200
00:33:53,999 --> 00:34:04,292
Adrian, announcing to Charles the invasion by Archbishop Leo (Code of Charles, letter 51, also 54), said that he invaded the cities of Emilia and then tried to incite the Pentapolensians to rebellion.

201
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:17,982
However, they remained steadfast in their obedience to the Holy See, just as they had under our predecessor, Lord Pope Stephen, to whom your late father and your own distinguished excellence entrusted the exarchate to remain under the authority of the Blessed Peter.

202
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:28,430
Similarly, in another letter (letter 53, also 52), he lists the provinces separately, clearly showing that the people of Ravenna and those in the province of Emilia are distinct from the Pentapolensians.

203
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:33,473
None of the Ravennates or people of Emilia; hence, he commends the loyalty of the Pentapolensians.

204
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:37,076
Therefore, I am ashamed to have trusted the chronicler in this matter.

205
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:41,450
Restoring the former honor of Emilia, I confirm it with the authority of the diploma.

206
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:49,407
Louis confirms the donation made by his grandfather Pepin, which was restored by his father Charles, by reciting it exactly as it was.

207
00:34:49,407 --> 00:35:01,754
This includes Ravenna, the head and metropolis of the entire exarchate, and Emilia, one of the provinces of the exarchate, listing each city individually to prevent any extension of this province beyond its original boundaries.

208
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:07,736
He then adds another province, including Pentapolis, which during Pepin's time was divided into two provinces.

209
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:10,619
This further validates the sincerity of the donation.

210
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,003
He lists the cities of that province, along with their territories, 98 towns, and their boundaries.

211
00:35:16,003 --> 00:35:25,847
This is described so clearly and distinctly that the same boundaries, which the ecclesiastical domain holds today and by which Emilia is divided from the Duchy of Modena, are noted.

212
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:35,093
Indeed, more famous writers of the sixteenth century, contrary to all ancient records and in line with the times of the Roman Republic, extend this province very broadly.

213
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:42,980
However, because they considered the ecclesiastical provinces and given that their era was somewhat less illustrious, some leniency is warranted.

214
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:54,183
It is different for the writers of our time, who should have referred to the Carolingian Code and the diploma of Louis, instead of asserting the validity of both monuments by following the previous writers.

215
00:35:54,183 --> 00:36:01,254
The expansion of the exarchate, or the cities they add to the donation of the Frankish kings, will have to be discussed elsewhere.

216
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:05,659
However, it should be noted that they remove one of these from the same donation.

217
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:11,316
This is Bobium, today known as Sassina, located somewhat south of Cesena, which the diploma lists first.

218
00:36:11,316 --> 00:36:19,583
The Carolingian Code (letters 51, 53, or 54, 52) names it next to Cesena, and the Farnesian Code lists it between the Castle of Saint Marino and Urbino.

219
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:28,230
It is an ancient city of Emilia, whose bishop attended the councils of Symmachus at the end of the fifth century (Labbe, Councils, volume IV, pages 1367-1376).

220
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:36,606
In the census book of the Albinian Code of Bobium's bishopric, it is found situated with three monasteries between the territories of Forli and Populonia.

221
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:54,874
Besides the fact that out of the fifty districts subject to Sassina, four make up the county of Bobium, as Ughellus pointed out in Italia Sacra, Volume 2, page 652, this noble and ancient city of Aemilia was taken from the donation of Pippin and replaced by the town of Bobium, famous for the monastery of Saint Columban in Insubria.

222
00:36:54,874 --> 00:37:04,548
It was granted an episcopal see by Benedict the Eighth at the beginning of the 11th century, as noted by Ditmar in Baronius, 1014, number 4, and by Ughellus, Mabillon, and many others.

223
00:37:04,548 --> 00:37:10,488
Whether this city should be sought outside the extensive limits of Aemilia is left to the judgment of the reader.

224
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:14,274
Indeed, I see that it is impossible to narrate the fervor of the debate.

225
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:21,371
For Fulrad, sent by Pippin, who took possession of Bobium as well as other cities, certainly did not venture into such distant regions.

226
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:30,466
And since I am certain that all the successors of Saint Peter protested according to the words of Adrian, in Codex Carolinus, letter 71, or 56, I call upon God as a witness.

227
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:37,090
For I irrationally seek the boundaries of no one; I confidently say Bobium never belonged to the jurisdiction of the Holy See.

228
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:41,612
Regarding the other cities, which they join to the exarchate, I admit it is otherwise.

229
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:59,329
Not because they were included in the donation of Pippin or Charlemagne, which is equally false to affirm, as it is to transfer Bobium from Insubria to Flaminia and claim it for the Holy See without any authority; but because from another source they altogether pertain to the dominion of the Apostolic See, as I will show in due course.

230
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:09,633
Meanwhile, to more firmly establish the boundaries of ecclesiastical dominion, I will briefly add some points from Charlemagne's division of the kingdoms among his sons Louis, Pippin, and Charles.

231
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:15,258
For he gave Italy, also called Lombardy, to Pippin to be divided among the brothers if he predeceased them.

232
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:20,516
Although elsewhere in Volume 1, page 298 and following, the same has been brought to another matter.

233
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:34,553
From the entrance of Italy through the city of Augusta, Charles shall receive Eboracum, Vercelli, Pavia, and then along the Po River as the boundary to the borders of Regenses, and Regium itself, and the city of Novara, and Modena up to the boundaries of Saint Peter.

234
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:47,447
These cities, along with their suburbs, territories, and counties, and everything on the left side as one travels to Rome from the kingdom that Pippin ruled, together with the Duchy of Spoleto, will be received by Charles, as we mentioned earlier.

235
00:38:47,447 --> 00:39:03,236
However, everything on the right side as one travels to Rome from those cities or counties, from the aforementioned kingdom, that is the portion that remained from the region beyond the Po River, along with the Duchy of Tuscany, up to the southern sea and the province, will be assigned to Louis to expand his kingdom.

236
00:39:03,236 --> 00:39:09,988
You see the kingdom of Italy ending with the territory of Modena, because the territory of Bologna, as of today, was adjacent to Modena.

237
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:33,323
Moreover, you see this division marked by boundaries from the entrance of Italy up to Modena: and from there, a considerable part of Italy or Lombardy, which extends to the left as one travels to Rome, where the vast dominion of the Venetian Republic is now, together with the Duchy of Spoleto, which, though offered to blessed Peter and his successors, belonged to the supreme right of the emperor, as will be explained below, will be an expansion of Charles's kingdom.

238
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:41,367
The other part assigned to Louis is best explained by another designation through the boundaries of ecclesiastical dominion, which is contained in Otto's diploma.

239
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:57,602
It is granted to Charles both in the same diploma and in the Pontifical Book, and it is as follows:
From Lunis with the island of Corsica, then in Suriano, then in the mountain of Bardonis, then in Berceto, from there in Parma, then in Reggio, from there in Mantua, and in Monte Silicis, and the province of Venetia and Istria.

240
00:39:57,602 --> 00:40:00,681
This will be discussed further in the notes on Otto's diploma.

241
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:10,859
Meanwhile, Louis's portion of the Italian kingdom beyond the Po is acquired; do not understand the designated boundaries as the walls of the named cities themselves, but as the extremity of each territory.

242
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:23,122
Additionally, you will receive the Duchy of Tuscany, just like the Duchy of Spoleto, under the supreme right of the emperor, although it was offered to the apostolic see; therefore, it is included in this jurisdiction and added to Louis's portion.

243
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:34,255
So far, we've talked about the complete donation of Pepin, confirmed by his son Charlemagne in Rome, before the most sacred body of the prince of the apostles, in the year 774.

244
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:38,464
Now, we need to move on to the donations made by Charlemagne himself.

245
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:50,419
This great prince, with his piety towards God, and his devotion, love, and generosity towards Peter, came to Rome four times, as stated in the Codex Carolinus, in the years 774, 781, 787, and 800.

246
00:40:50,419 --> 00:41:00,606
During his first visit, aside from confirming his father's donation before the blessed ashes of that apostle, he granted Tuscia Langobardica, or at least a part of it.

247
00:41:00,606 --> 00:41:09,328
The whole region was once called Langobardica, though it was later named Regalis by more recent people (Codex Carolinus, Vol. I, pp. 297, 321).

248
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:14,940
On his second visit, he granted the entire Sabine territory (Codex Carolinus, pp. 383, 415).

249
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:21,833
During his third visit, he granted six cities of the Duchy of Benevento (Codex Carolinus, pp. 475 and following).

250
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:38,302
What he granted on his fourth visit for the remission of sins and for the merit of his soul, as both he and his father had always done (Codex Carolinus, pp. 228, 325, 330, 333, 341, 384), is not contained in the Codex Carolinus, since it was compiled nine years earlier.

251
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:42,206
However, he seems to have donated Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily.

252
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:53,429
Corsica is mentioned in the letters of Pope Leo the Third to Emperor Charlemagne, and Einhard attests that Charlemagne did not leave the city without bestowing gifts upon the holy see.

253
00:41:53,429 --> 00:42:00,627
Finally, because the Codex Carolinus, a witness of donations beyond any exception, remains silent about these islands.

254
00:42:00,627 --> 00:42:06,178
Therefore, it is certain that none of them was donated to the holy see before the year 791.

255
00:42:06,178 --> 00:42:14,595
Why not then in the year 800, when he was made a partner in the supreme pontifical power by Pope Leo the Third through the imperial crown?

256
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:28,991
However, I admit that this is confirmed by no old monument, except for a diploma of Louis; so I long adhered to the opinion of Balutius, Mabillon, and Leblanc, who believed that some privilege or diploma had been interpolated somewhere.

257
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:35,180
However, upon closer examination, I realized that the donation of Sardinia and Sicily was uncertain.

258
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:45,380
I immediately decided to set aside the opinion of those who thought otherwise and follow the views of Baronius and other very learned men, which Grotius, Hotman, and Basnage also supported.

259
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,748
Indeed, the rights of the Holy See to Sicily were less doubtful, as we discussed extensively in the previous treatise.

260
00:42:51,748 --> 00:43:03,567
Otto the Great claimed this right for the Holy See, as we will see in the next section; and Saint Henry not only followed Otto's example but also confirmed Louis's diploma, despite the objections of those who disagreed.

261
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:06,967
But regarding these islands, nothing should be affirmed rashly.

262
00:43:06,967 --> 00:43:12,796
Therefore, I assert that their donation is not at all doubtful, but the timing of the donation is uncertain.

263
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:21,431
As for the other donations of Charlemagne, I believe there is nothing to add to what has been thoroughly covered in the previous commentary on Adrian's letters.

264
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:33,681
However, I should mention that the Sabine patrimony or territory is listed immediately after the Pippinian donation in Louis's diploma because the geographical locations of the regions were prioritized over chronological order.

265
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:44,421
Moreover, the letters of the Codex Carolinus, all dated before the year 781, provide evidence that the Lombard cities of Tuscany, along with the duchies of Tuscany and Spoleto, were given by Charles.

266
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:57,535
The second donation, namely the Sabine territory, was certainly not made before the year 781 when Carloman was baptized in Rome and was given the auspicious name of Pippin by Adrian, thereby acquiring the name of his godfather for his parents.

267
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:15,291
This unique aspect of the diploma is evident in that Itherius and Maginarius, the abbots, resolved all disputes between the Holy See and the people of Rieti by establishing boundaries between them and the Sabine territory after the year 784, for in that year Maginarius succeeded Fulrad as abbot of Dionysius's monastery in July.

268
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:20,094
This could not be found in the letters of the Codex Carolinus (67, 68, 71, 72, 73, etc.).

269
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:25,904
were all given before Maginarius became abbot, during the lifetime of Ildegarde, who died in 783.

270
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:29,991
However, the third donation of six cities in Campania should be listed last.

271
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:43,758
This is because it pertains to the year 787, when Charlemagne, after subduing the Beneventans and taking Grimoald along with twelve other hostages, brought Arichis, Grimoald's father and the Duke of the Beneventans, and the entire region under his control.

272
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:52,631
After reviewing the ancestral and paternal donation, Charlemagne confirms both patrimonies as belonging to the Holy See, even though they were not in its possession.

273
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:58,170
He lists Benevento first, which Adrian (in Codex Carolinus, letter 59, or 49) mentioned to Charlemagne.

274
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:09,570
Adrian stated that various emperors, patricians, and other God-fearing individuals had donated parts of Tuscany, Spoleto, or Benevento to the apostolic see for the sake of their souls and the forgiveness of sins.

275
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:21,724
A few years earlier, Stephen the Third had praised Itherius, the envoy of Bertrada and Charlemagne, for immediately going to the Duchy of Benevento to reclaim the patrimony in those regions (Codex Carolinus, letter 46, or 44).

276
00:45:21,724 --> 00:45:28,446
Charlemagne then mentions Calabria, without adding Sicily, because he had confirmed the entire island in an earlier donation.

277
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:41,245
Regarding this patrimony, it is important to note that since 756, Stephen the Second, while thanking Pippin (Codex Carolinus, letter 11, or 8), had earnestly discussed with the king the possession of the exarchate obtained through Fulrad.

278
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:57,378
Inspired by God and by the blessed Peter, the prince of his apostles, he urged that the part of the Greeks be arranged in such a way that the holy Catholic and apostolic faith remains whole and unshaken, and that the holy Church of God be freed and secured from others and their malicious intentions.

279
00:45:57,378 --> 00:46:06,950
This would ensure that the preparation of lights for the Churches of God continues for the salvation of souls, and that the hunger of the poor, needy, and pilgrims be alleviated.

280
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,282
In third place, the Neapolitan patrimony is confirmed.

281
00:46:10,282 --> 00:46:20,942
Like the Calabrian patrimony, it was unjustly held by the Greeks, similar to how the Beneventan patrimony was held by the Beneventans, who at that time were more friendly to the Greeks than to the Holy See.

282
00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:27,670
It would take too long to go through the entire history of this patrimony, but you can review it in the Codex Carolinus, page 495.

283
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,569
It is sufficient to point out that Adrian subdued Terracina with papal soldiers, which represented that patrimony.

284
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:43,816
Gaeta was also captured for the same reason, and after Charles gave six cities in Campania, the territory of the Holy See expanded in that region, highlighting the value of the Neapolitan patrimony.

285
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:47,645
However, the history of the three great patrimonies is not the focus here.

286
00:46:47,645 --> 00:46:53,234
But the donation of Sicily, whenever it was made by Charles and confirmed by Louis, makes it more plausible.

287
00:46:53,234 --> 00:46:57,840
Moreover, the Italian annalists highlight an inconvenient, if not audacious, observation.

288
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:12,692
In the year 1059, this ancient rival of papal domination claims a diploma with additions emerged in the 11th century, discussing Benevento, Calabria, Sicily, and other regions, concerning matters of great interest to the Holy See at that time, not for their status in previous centuries.

289
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:23,611
This will convince the ignorant public and Walch and his followers, as stated in the Preface, page IV, that the Italian annalist is a treasure of antiquity and historical events, and a chief ornament of our age.

290
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:29,821
But to men of true learning and those knowledgeable in papal history, all historical rules seem to be suddenly violated.

291
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:32,771
Doesn't falseness, audacity, and hostility shine through?

292
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:36,756
The monuments of the Codex Carolinus clearly show that the annalist is lying.

293
00:47:36,756 --> 00:47:42,707
Nicholas the Second, following in the footsteps of his predecessors, repels the injury recklessly inflicted on him.

294
00:47:42,707 --> 00:47:48,451
The annals themselves, repeatedly sprinkled with such matters, manifest the hostility towards papal domination.

295
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:58,521
It's worth noting that in the confirmation pact or privilege, Sicily was included by Stephen the Fourth or his successor, Saint Paschal the First, in the Donation of Charlemagne.

296
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:02,511
This donation was made multiple times, each instance specifying new regions.

297
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:11,542
Sicily had to be included in that confirmation pact: were the ancient rights of the Sicilian patrimony any less certain than those of Benevento, both Calabrias, and Naples?

298
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:14,220
So, what did Stephen the Second do in the year 756?

299
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:27,241
In the same letters where he thanks Pippin for gaining possession of the cities of the exarchate, as I mentioned earlier, he persuaded the same king that the Calabrian and Sicilian patrimonies should be claimed by the apostolic see as his property.

300
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:41,206
What does Adrian testify to Charles in the year 794 (Council, volume eight, page 963) that he would consider the Eastern Emperor heretical unless he restored the patrimonies with the consecration of bishops, as stated earlier in the previous dissertation, number 10?

301
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:49,817
Or, reminding about the patrimonies, if the emperor refuses to restore them to our holy Roman Church, we will declare him a heretic for persisting in such an error.

302
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:52,285
I will address the lesser matters in the notes.

303
00:48:52,285 --> 00:49:03,258
Given this context, it should be noted that the authenticity of this document is so strong that the same annalist who depicted it as fabricated in the year 817 claims it was only interpolated in the year 1059.

304
00:49:03,258 --> 00:49:08,141
However, unless I am mistaken, I demonstrated that this second opinion should be disregarded.

305
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:19,586
Now, let's briefly consider the main reasons why the patrimonies of both Sicilies are specifically confirmed, aside from the other matters, so that the legitimate authority of the document becomes increasingly evident.

306
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:28,905
The vast estates in Syracuse and Palermo, celebrated in the letters of Gregory the Great, were once called by the name of Sicily and later by the name of a single Sicilian.

307
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:35,500
These estates are confirmed for all of Sicily, similar to the patrimony of Sardinia mentioned in the confirmation of this island.

308
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:42,147
They are not listed among the remaining patrimonies because the rights of the Roman Church were abundantly secured in that review.

309
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:48,589
It is different with both Calabrias and Naples, which are located in regions still under the power of the Greeks, like Sicily.

310
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:54,264
The Calabrians, being too remote, were treated in the same way as Sicily by both Stephen the Second and Adrian.

311
00:49:54,264 --> 00:50:03,517
However, about Naples, which could have been taken from the Greeks by the Lombard king through the Beneventans under his rule, Pippin had already dealt with the matter much earlier.

312
00:50:03,517 --> 00:50:15,737
Therefore, in the year 766, Paul the First thanked him for ordering King Desiderius to compel the Neapolitans and Gaetans to return the patrimonies to your protector, the blessed Peter, located there in Naples (Codex Carolinus, letter 40).

313
00:50:15,737 --> 00:50:29,234
And in the year 780, Adrian (Codex Carolinus, letter 65) reminded Charles of the unreliable faith of the Neapolitans because they did not want to keep the agreed pacts and refused to return the patrimony of the blessed apostle Peter, who is placed there in Naples.

314
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:38,488
The Beneventans, although not under Greek power, still showed difficult conditions even in the year 788, as clearly shown by three letters in the Codex Carolinus (89 and following).

315
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:50,962
Therefore, the confirmation of the Ludovician pact was necessary for this patrimony and those under Greek power, so that the rights of the holy see, which the grandfather and father had unsuccessfully tried to assert, would not suffer any loss.

316
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:55,052
These rights would be restored when it seemed good to God the best and greatest.

317
00:50:55,052 --> 00:51:07,885
And we finally saw this happen in the 11th century, when the Italian annalist, completely ignorant of antiquity, dared to brand Nicholas the Second with the mark of an impostor without any monument, any little history, or any even condemnable witness.

318
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:15,714
There are two titles, or rather, two types of rights, on which papal dominion relies, that have been clearly and distinctly demonstrated.

319
00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:23,033
First, the voluntary submission of the people, after their separation from the Greeks, subjected Rome and its duchy to the Roman pontiffs.

320
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:29,821
Additionally, through the generosity of the Frankish kings Pippin and Charles, they acquired the remaining provinces and cities.

321
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:37,088
All of this was perpetually confirmed by Louis for Paschal and his successors, allowing them to maintain their right, rule, and dominion.

322
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:47,377
Another type of generosity or donation from the aforementioned kings followed, which was not agreed upon with the kings, but voluntarily granted to the prince of the apostles and his successors.

323
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:55,757
We will discuss these types of donations, which are not expressly mentioned in the diploma, when the order of events leads us to the privilege of Saint Henry.

324
00:51:55,757 --> 00:52:00,265
There, we will talk about the voluntary donations of all this emperor's predecessors.

325
00:52:00,265 --> 00:52:08,910
One must consider here the Carolingian, which dismisses and indeed discredits some recent questions about the type of dominion by which the pontiffs obtained them.

326
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:35,959
Therefore, in the year 774, when Charles first came to the City, he not only restored and confirmed his father's donation, adding a significant part of Lombard Tuscany, but also offered another part of Tuscany, distinct by the name of duchy from the former (which recent scholars have named Regal), containing the cities of Luna, Pisa, Lucca, Volterra, Siena, Pistoia, Florence, Arezzo, and new Chiusi, along with the Duchy of Spoleto, separated from Italy properly so-called, or from Lombardy, to Saint Peter.

327
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:40,149
This matter is evidenced by Adrian 105 (Codex Carolinus, letter 56, others 58).

328
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:50,438
Indeed, in the year 776, he says, you also presently offered the Duchy of Spoleto to your protector, blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, through our lowliness, for the salvation of your soul.

329
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:56,166
However, a similar thing concerning the Duchy of Tuscany is not found in the letters of the Codex Carolinus.

330
00:52:56,166 --> 00:53:00,515
Its condition is found to be very different from that of Spoleto in these letters.

331
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:06,150
Several leaders from other cities were found, including those from Clusium, Florence, and Lucca.

332
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,326
Codex Carolinus, epistle 55, also 60, 80, and 64; 50, and 55.

333
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:17,552
These leaders provided both credibility to the matter and thwarted the trivial attempts of those trying to investigate the metropolis of Tuscany at that time.

334
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:27,861
However, both the Duchy of Spoleto, which was entrusted to one person, and the Duchy of Tuscany, which was administered by several leaders, were offered by Charles to Saint Peter and his successors.

335
00:53:27,861 --> 00:53:37,650
These offers are uniquely documented in a charter by Louis, which not only declares this matter genuine but also abundantly testifies to the papal supremacy over the remaining territories.

336
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:52,853
Indeed, the grant of such useful dominion, the decree or papal charter by which both duchies are restored to Charles, the donor, and the clear declaration of the supreme right reserved for the same Charles, are such evident indications of sincerity that they make any other proof unnecessary.

337
00:53:52,853 --> 00:54:42,263
Furthermore, the inclusion of these in the document, or that final clause: "Always safeguarding our dominion over these same duchies in all things, and their subjection to our part," provides two less doubtful arguments:
First, all revenues of these duchies are confirmed for Saint Peter and his successors, which were previously individually specified through taxes, pensions, and gifts, as the accurate transcript of the Adriatic records, not donations, as the erroneous script of the code suggests.
Second, in the entire ecclesiastical domain, these duchies alone were not under the supreme power of the Roman pontiff during the time of Louis. For the emperor, to comply with the pope, had confirmed the remaining rights with imperial authority, so that they would remain under the jurisdiction, dominion, and authority of the Holy See until the end of the century; which he indicates in the following with the same words and other stronger ones.

338
00:54:42,576 --> 00:54:52,227
The reason for this was so that in the regions granted by the kings of the Franks, and in Rome and its duchy, the popes would seem to rule with supreme authority by imperial power.

339
00:54:52,227 --> 00:55:05,096
This was intended to curb the audacity of subjects who, restored by imperial majesty for the same purpose, could not be restrained from seeking the life of the supreme ruler through treachery, and from invading the properties of the Church.

340
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:09,064
As I mentioned earlier, anyone who thinks otherwise is far from the truth.

341
00:55:09,064 --> 00:55:15,552
The many arguments for dominion, evident before the donations of the kings, are demonstrated in the Codex Carolinus, 106.

342
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:29,333
After the donations, when there was no longer any fear from the Lombards, and the patriciate of the Franks served as a great defense against Greek threats, almost as many arguments can be found in the same Codex as there are letters from the Roman pontiffs.

343
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:38,610
More certain and evident arguments can be found for brevity's sake from the previous commentary on the letters of Adrian and from letters 63, 65, 76, 75, 81, 67, 97, and 85.

344
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:43,704
I cannot be convinced that the often-praised two men, or their attendants, did not notice this.

345
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:53,838
The inconsistency of both, since they called the diploma of Louis sometimes legitimate, sometimes forged, and sometimes interpolated, clearly shows that each one was aware of his own error.

346
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:55,232
How could it be otherwise?

347
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:59,200
A single interpolation at first glance seems to confirm the three islands.

348
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:29,871
But what follows removes suspicion:
"And to the territories, maritime coasts, and ports pertaining to the aforementioned cities and islands."
And again below, where all the rights of the holy see are gathered in one:
Namely, concerning the aforementioned provinces, cities, towns, fortresses, villages, islands, territories, and properties, as well as pensions and taxes.
And finally, thirdly, where he promises to defend the islands together with all the aforementioned things, so that all these may firmly remain under his control for use, enjoyment, and disposal.
What?

349
00:56:30,407 --> 00:56:42,213
No matter which city they come from, those who seek refuge with the Holy See-whether to escape papal authority out of a desire for independence, to incite rebellion, or out of fear of punishment-he promises to take them in.

350
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:44,966
If their offense is minor, he seeks pardon for them.

351
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:49,307
If their offense is serious, he sends them back to their own ruler for punishment.

352
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:58,360
The only exceptions are those who have suffered violence or have been oppressed by the overwhelming power of other citizens and need imperial intervention before the pope.

353
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:06,301
And don't think these measures are random: Archbishop Leo of Ravenna's audacious act had not been forgotten (Code of Charlemagne, letter 52, also 53).

354
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:11,806
Without the pope's knowledge, he went to Charlemagne in the year 775 to plot rebellion in the Exarchate.

355
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:16,836
The example of Adrian had not been erased from memory (Code of Charlemagne, letter 61, also 1).

356
00:57:16,836 --> 00:57:26,365
He demanded the return of certain offenders under his authority from Charlemagne, just as he had sent back a subject of Charlemagne to France two years earlier for the same reason.

357
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:30,706
A more recent example was also retained (Code of Charlemagne, letter 97, also 85).

358
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:37,800
In the year 790, he requested Charlemagne to return some people from Ravenna and Pentapolis who wished to withdraw from his obedience.

359
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:49,023
Inspired by this example, Eccard (History of the Franks, book 25, chapter 38) and an Italian annalist (Annals 789) openly admitted that the Roman pontiff at that time had dominion in the Exarchate and Pentapolis.

360
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:53,840
Indeed, I see evidence of dominion in the city of Rome just as clearly as in the Exarchate.

361
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:02,046
In the praised letter (Code of Charlemagne, letter 61, also 50), Adrian not only demands the return of his subjects but also demands that they be punished.

362
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:28,039
After exaggerating their heinous crimes to Charlemagne, he pleads with him in these words:
"That you rise up manfully, inspired by God, and as a pious king, order lawful vengeance to be executed upon them for their miserable and disgraceful presumption, or deign to send them to us so that Almighty God, looking down from on high, may grant you, etc., for the just punishment we inflict upon them."
Yet, I am not surprised that they acknowledge dominion in the Exarchate but deny it in Rome.

363
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:42,295
Since some people expect the donation of the City to occur in a different year, with an uncertain type of dominion, it is deeply seated in the minds of French writers that the Roman pontiffs refer their indirect or temporal power to the donations of the Frankish kings.

364
00:58:42,295 --> 00:58:58,183
We hold this opinion to be completely false, as we know for certain that twenty-five years before Pippin, who was the first to expand the pontifical domain, granted the provinces of Emilia and Pentapolis to the exarchate, Gregory the Third, Zacharias, and for some time Stephen the Second, ruled Rome and its duchy.

365
00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:24,310
Other writers, however, having absorbed the same false opinion, and seeing that the praised pontiffs did not abandon the hope of converting the Greeks before the year 753, when Stephen the Second sought protection from them in France, and knowing that the exarchate alone was donated by Pippin and nothing else was added to Pippin's donation until the first arrival of Charles in Rome in the year 774, attribute the donation of the City to Charles in an uncertain year, with uncertain dominion and an uncertain author.

366
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:31,522
The misconceptions of both kinds of writers are dispelled by the letters of Adrian's predecessors, and there is no reason to tackle them again.

367
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:42,467
However, I will briefly demonstrate the significant difference that intervenes between the dominion of the City and its duchy and the rest of the apostolic see's domains, for greater clarity of the Ludovician diploma.

368
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:56,186
Although the supreme pontifical dominion of the City, and therefore its duchy, is confirmed by several letters of the Codex Carolinus, none proves it better than the one (97, also 85) in which the patrician status of Peter is compared with the patrician status of Charles.

369
00:59:56,186 --> 01:00:02,289
From this, Eccard and the Italian annalist are compelled to admit the same supreme dominion in the exarchate, as we said.

370
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:09,129
Before Charles became emperor, his role in the City was primarily its defense, and later, he shared supreme power with the popes.

371
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:22,406
When he was designated as patrician in France alongside his father Pippin and his brother Carloman by Stephen the Second in 754, Stephen was the ruler of Rome, just like his predecessors Gregory the Third, Zacharias, and his successor and brother Paul the First.

372
01:00:22,406 --> 01:01:35,226
Paul the First was referred to as "Our Lord decreed by God" in letters to King Pippin and the Roman patrician.
However, this rule did not exclude the involvement of the Roman Senate and the people, who swore an oath of loyalty to the pope as their highest leader while maintaining Roman civil law.
Thus, the Roman pontiff was indeed the highest leader at that time but did not hold absolute power in governing the republic.
Neither Stephen the Fourth nor Saint Paschal tried to introduce anything new to the Senate and people when they later sought support from imperial authority for their supreme power in the City.
The Roman pontiffs traditionally did not change the administration established by their predecessors, ensuring the Senate and People of Rome's role remained intact, reinforced by Louis.
The document's words are clear and need no commentary:
"Just as you have held and managed in your power and authority from your predecessors until now.
Therefore, I wish this to be ratified and confirmed, not to start a new rule under Paschal, but to be reinforced by Emperor Louis.
For almost ninety years, the Senate and People of Rome, breaking away from the impious Greeks, willingly embraced this under Gregory the Third as head of the holy republic, and acknowledged in letters to King Pippin, without any reduction in their own authority, as subsequent times have clearly shown, as I made clear in the preceding dissertation."

373
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:44,794
In other territories, ruled by the generosity of their leaders, only the Roman pontiff governed as the absolute prince, without any intervention from the senate or the people.

374
01:01:44,794 --> 01:01:48,959
This authority over these lands had been granted to Peter and his successors.

375
01:01:48,959 --> 01:02:23,039
The letters of the Codex Carolinus, which are beyond all dispute, attest to this in many ways:
"What you have bestowed upon blessed Peter for the great reward of your soul," said Paul about the cities of Pentapolis (letter 18, also 15);
and elsewhere (letter 40, also 26) regarding the entire exarchate:
"Those things," he said, "which you promised to blessed Peter and sought to grant for the pardon of your sins, you strive to preserve forever with his inviolate right."
Likewise (letter 42, also 19), he mentions that a donation was made to Blessed Peter and his vicar, our predecessor, my brother of holy memory, Pope Stephen.

376
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:43,054
In the same context, Adrian (letter 52, also 53) addresses Charlemagne:
"What you have given to blessed Peter for the great reward of your soul and for the stability of the kingdom protected by God."
He accuses Leo, archbishop of Ravenna (letter 53, also 52), of saying about the cities of Emilia, that your excellency did not grant those cities to blessed Peter and us.

377
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:50,194
Moreover, he recalls in the following letter how you personally offered that same promise to the apostle of God with your own hands.

378
01:02:50,194 --> 01:03:25,193
Finally (letter 59, also 49), speaking of all the patrimonies:
"Which," he said, "through various emperors, patricians, and even other God-fearing people, have been granted for the reward of their souls and the pardon of sins in the regions of Tuscany, Spoleto, Benevento, and Corsica, as well as the Sabina patrimony to blessed Peter the apostle, and to the holy and apostolic Roman Church of God."
I omit many other details which, along with these, have been appropriately repeated here from previous writings; for these few demonstrate the great distinction that exists between the donations of kings and the dominion of the City and its duchy.

379
01:03:25,463 --> 01:03:30,144
Because of this, not even the Suevi, considered the greatest invaders, imitated the Romans.

380
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:38,271
The Romans, leaving only the title of prince to the pontiffs, usurped the temporal administration of the republic for a long time with stubborn determination.

381
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:41,871
The defense of the apostles' leader far surpassed that of the Augusti!

382
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:46,552
The archbishops of Ravenna also dared to challenge this absolute dominion in the exarchate.

383
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:47,477
But what happened?

384
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:52,724
Adrian reported to Charles how Stephen the Second overthrew Sergius, who had become too self-assuming.

385
01:03:52,724 --> 01:04:56,091
"We, most excellent son," he says, "just as during the time of Lord Pope Stephen, who went to France and to whom the exarchate was handed over, so in our time, we want to manage and order it under our power. Everyone can recognize the kind of power his thrice-blessedness had over the city of Ravenna and the entire exarchate, as he also removed Archbishop Sergius, who acted with a spirit of pride against his will."
However, Leo's stubbornness was curtailed by a short life; for in the year 777, he passed away, having troubled Adrian for barely three years. After that, no similar example of such audacity is found.
Furthermore, in the year 790, the same pontiff held a similar view regarding the Franks subject to Charles and the people of Ravenna and Pentapolis subject to Blessed Peter and himself:
"Just as your men do not come to the thresholds of the apostles nor to us without your absolution, so our men who wish to come to you must come with our absolution and letter. For just as we always receive your men, urging them to remain in your service with true faith and purity of heart, so we also ask your royal prudence to similarly exhort and admonish any of our men who come to you, as your father of blessed memory..."

386
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,768
Lord Pippin the Great, King, granted them to Saint Peter and his vicar, and later your excellency confirmed it.

387
01:05:01,768 --> 01:05:12,410
Therefore, you should be instructed and urged that they should in no way dare to become proud and arrogant when they come to you, but rather remain humble and submissive in the service of Saint Peter and our commandment.

388
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:22,519
Encourage them because we will never withdraw from serving and ruling under Saint Peter and his vicar, but will remain in the faith and purity we promised to Saint Peter the apostle until the end of the world.

389
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:33,982
Now I believe I have clearly explained why Louis, confirming the rule of the Roman pontiffs in the City and its duchy, uses that condition: Just as you have held and disposed of it in your power and rule from your predecessors until now.

390
01:05:33,982 --> 01:05:48,735
Conversely, he clearly confirms the domains granted to the seat through the document of donation, without omitting any condition, to Paschal the supreme pontiff and universal pope and his successors until the end of the world, in such a way that they hold them in their own right of principality and rule.

391
01:05:48,735 --> 01:05:54,055
This was indeed of great importance to validate the sincerity of Louis's document and to reveal his intention.

392
01:05:54,055 --> 01:06:08,760
However, since most of what I have discussed so far is established from the ninety-nine letters of the Codex Carolinus and ten of Leo, edited by Conring, I have rightly called this document the summary of this epistolary history, since it briefly collects and strengthens all the rights of the holy seat.

393
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:24,528
After this, the discipline of the election and consecration of the Roman pontiff is confirmed: which matter, concerning the predecessors of Stephen the Fourth, can be sought both from the preliminary commentary on the letters of Adrian (number 2 and following) and from the notice to the letters of the false pope Constantine.

394
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:29,607
The summary is that the election and ordination, or consecration, of the Roman pontiff was entirely free.

395
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:36,620
This is more and more confirmed by the presence of the legate of King Pippin at the consecration of Paul the First (Cod. Car. epistle 12, or 13).

396
01:06:37,056 --> 01:07:36,752
When he arrived in Rome during the election of the pope, Paul, along with our noblemen, spoke with him and said, "We saw it fit for him to stay here until, by God's providence, we received the sacred apostolic blessing."
Then, fully satisfied with our own purity and that of all the people, and with the love we bear towards your most gracious excellence and all the Frankish people, we would send him back to you with our apostolic envoys.
These envoys would testify to the king that the pope would remain in the same faith, love, and unity of charity and peace, which our most blessed lord and my brother, the most holy pope, confirmed with you.
The discipline of electing and consecrating the pope, and then sending envoys to the king of France to renew the aforementioned concord between the kingdom and the priesthood, is so firm and constant that no example contrary to it can be found.
The usurper Constantine, only after his detestable election and ordination (Codex Carolinus, epistle 43, also 98), sent envoys to the king, promising to remain in your love and faithful affection, following the example of Stephen and Paul, and in sincere friendship.

397
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,431
He repeated and urged this again in the next letter.

398
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:49,526
The missions and letters of Stephen the Third and Adrian sent to the kings after their consecration do not exist, but the same sentiment is found in other letters from both popes (Epistle 47, 62).

399
01:07:49,526 --> 01:08:13,477
Stephen wrote to Charles and Carloman, the brothers: "In your love and affectionate charity, we firmly remain and will remain with all the people, even to the point of soul and bloodshed."
And Adrian wrote to Charlemagne: "We trust that you will remain in the same faith, love, and promise, in which we also firmly and steadfastly remain, as we promised face to face, with the Lord presiding and blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, mediating, until the end."

400
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:24,919
The letters of King Charles, sent through Angilbert and found in Labbe's collection (Council, volume seven, page 1128), confirm that Leo the Third, after his consecration, announced Adrian's death and his own exaltation.

401
01:08:24,919 --> 01:09:57,836
In these letters, Charles expresses his desire to restore the harmony between the priesthood and the kingdom that flourished under Adrian:
"Just as I made a pact with the most blessed predecessor of your holy fatherhood, I wish to establish an unbreakable bond of the same faith and charity with your blessedness."
Given this, I would gladly hear from Pagius and the Italian annalist about the differences they perceive in the words of Louis's diplomas.
They claim that the one whom all Romans, by divine inspiration and the intercession of blessed Peter, elected to the pontificate with one mind and harmony, without any promise, should be consecrated according to canonical custom without any ambiguity or contradiction.
Once consecrated, envoys should be sent to us or our successors, the kings of the Franks, to establish friendship, charity, and peace between us and them.
However, these two men confidently declare the diploma to be a forgery, as they infer from the legation of Leo's successors and the letters to Louis the Pious, Charlemagne's son, mentioned by the Astronomer in the year 816 and following.
Regarding Stephen traveling to France, it is stated that he first sent a legation to satisfy the emperor about his ordination.
And about Paschal: After completing the solemn consecration, he sent envoys with an apologetic letter and great gifts to the emperor, indicating that he had been compelled to this dignity by election and the people's acclamation, rather than by ambition or will.
They claim these letters are less doubtful signs of imperial confirmation.
Indeed, what was decreed in the Lateran Council of 769, to prevent any detriment to the supreme election and consecration of the pontiff, is reaffirmed here: without any promise.
This further confirms the integrity of the diploma.

402
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:17,861
Because what had once been established to avert the heresy of Simony
(Council of Chalcedon, chapter 2; Symmachus to Caesar, letter 5, title 2; Hormisdas to the bishops of Spain, letter 25, chapter 2),
is now found to be renewed by new decrees and sanctions for Italy, the Kingdom of Lombardy, Tuscany, the Exarchate, and even for the Kingdom of the Franks.

403
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:21,228
For that pestilence was spreading far and wide at that time.

404
01:10:21,228 --> 01:12:00,703
Therefore, in the year 790
(Codex Carolinus, letter 97, or 84),
Adrian wrote to Charles:
"Many funds are seen to have been alienated through such wicked payments, so that not having gold and silver anymore, even the properties of the Churches are found to be alienated through written leases."
And a little below, regarding the ordination of bishops and their examination:
"We solemnly ask,
inquire: See that you have made no promise or payment to anyone, because it is Simoniacal and against the canons."
Charles himself, in the year 795, in a memorandum
(Council, volume VII, page 1129),
especially wanted to remind Leo the Pontiff through Angilbert:
"You should most diligently persuade him to abolish the Simoniacal heresy, which stains the holy body of the Church badly in many places."
What more? In the year 816, when Stephen the Fourth, who was imitated the following year by Paschal, announced his election to Emperor Louis the Pious as free from any stain after his consecration, the same emperor issued a capitulary
(book I, chapter 84)
also reported by Labbeus
(Council, volume VII, page 1479),
in which these things are read:
"Not ignorant of the sacred canons, so that in God's name the holy Church might more freely enjoy its honor, we have given assent to the ecclesiastical order, that bishops should be elected according to the statutes of the canons by the choice of the clergy and people from their own diocese, with the exclusion of persons and rewards, on account of their merit of life and gift of wisdom."
Considering these facts, it is astonishing to read in Pagi
(817, number 7)
after that part of the diploma about sending a legation to us, or to our successors, kings of the Franks, that this inference, full of falsehood and audacity, was made.

405
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:02,472
That is a complete fabrication.

406
01:12:02,472 --> 01:12:14,016
While Louis the Pious was alive, Pope Eugene the Second, at the request of Lothair, co-ruler of his father's empire, decreed that the Roman pontiff should not be consecrated unless in the presence of imperial envoys.

407
01:12:14,016 --> 01:12:22,514
This proposition does not make sense to a rational person:
The rule for creating the Roman pontiff, confirmed in Louis' diploma in the year 817, is fictitious.

408
01:12:22,514 --> 01:12:32,615
In the year 825, Lothair, son of Louis, obtained a privilege from Eugene the Second stating that henceforth Roman pontiffs should not be consecrated without the presence of imperial envoys.

409
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:39,937
Additionally, the falsity of that privilege has been observed by Baronius, Cointius, Natalis, Papebrochius, and various Catholic authors.

410
01:12:39,937 --> 01:12:48,862
Even Italian annalists find that privilege from the year 825 very suspicious, although Eccard embraces it with open arms by altering the chronology to fit his opinion.

411
01:12:48,862 --> 01:12:53,511
But neither Eccard nor the annalists remove the falsehood of the time with this remedy.

412
01:12:53,511 --> 01:13:05,376
The privilege does not rest on any serious authority;
Rather, its mention exists in a supplement to the Lombard history, which is falsely attributed to Paul Warnefrid by an imposter, according to the custom of such people.

413
01:13:05,376 --> 01:13:10,079
To give credence to their compilations, they borrow the name of some illustrious writer.

414
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,607
Thus, after the booklet about the bishops of Metz, it reads:
Year.

415
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:19,139
In the year 825, Emperor Lotharius returned to Italy and celebrated Mass for Saint Martin in Rome.

416
01:13:19,139 --> 01:14:23,931
This is the oath he ordered the Roman clergy and people, along with Pope Eugene, to take:
"I therefore promise by Almighty God, and by these sacred four Gospels, and by this cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the body of the most blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, that from this day forward I will be faithful to our lords, Emperors Louis and Lotharius, as long as I live, to the best of my ability and understanding, without deceit or evil intent, while maintaining the faith I promised to the lord apostolic.
I also promise that I will not consent to any election of a pope in this Roman seat that is not conducted canonically and justly, according to my ability and understanding.
And the elected person shall not be consecrated as pope with my consent until he makes such an oath in the presence of the emperor's envoy and the people, with an oath similar to the one Pope Eugene made in writing for the preservation of all."
To address the misconception held by Pagii and his followers, I believe the true constitution of Eugene and Lotharius, given in the atrium of Saint Peter the Apostle in the year 824, should be referenced here (Coll. Rom. part II, p. 207), which we will see almost entirely confirmed in the privileges of Otto and Henry.

417
01:14:23,931 --> 01:15:01,816
Regarding the election of the pope, the pope and the emperor established in chapter 111:
"In the election of the Roman pontiff, no one, whether free or slave, should presume to cause any impediment.
But only those Romans, to whom it was anciently granted by the constitution of the holy Fathers, should elect the pope.
If anyone presumes to act against this constitution of ours, they shall be exiled."
Indeed, I dare not deny that the consecration of the pope has again succumbed to the yoke of imperial confirmation. However, the age of this new subjection is certain, the causes are certain, and the condition is certain, which demonstrate that it was far different from the old usurpation by the Goths and the emperors of the East.

418
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:10,615
The annals of Bertiniani describe the year 844 like this: Pope Gregory the Fourth of the Roman Church passed away, and Sergius the Second succeeded him, taking his place.

419
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:21,509
When Sergius was ordained to the apostolic seat, Lothair sent his son Louis, along with Drogo, the bishop of Metz, to ensure that no one would be ordained bishop without his command and the presence of his envoys.

420
01:15:21,509 --> 01:15:24,373
When they arrived in Rome, they were honorably received.

421
01:15:24,373 --> 01:15:30,409
After completing their mission, the Roman pope consecrated Louis as king with anointing and decorated him with a belt.

422
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:34,603
Drogo, the bishop, was appointed as his vicar for the regions of Gaul and Germany.

423
01:15:34,603 --> 01:15:44,372
If such a privilege isn't older than the year 844, then it wasn't Eugene the Second who granted it to Lothair's son Louis twenty years earlier, but Sergius the Second who granted it to Louis.

424
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:51,380
However, the fabricator, a false deacon, distorted names and years, and from a genuine privilege, he forged the false one we heard about.

425
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:58,591
But the fabricator, Pagus, and all those hostile to the apostolic seat in their own destruction, are accused by the false fabrication itself.

426
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:45,238
For they constantly read the privileges of Otto and Henry, which confirm the credibility of the false matter: "What kind of promise our lord and venerable spiritual father Leo is known to have made willingly." This more and more confirms the age of the privilege; for Leo the Fourth, succeeding Sergius the Second, although consecrated without the command of the prince due to fear of Saracen invasions, still affirmed the privilege granted by his predecessor through a promise made willingly.
And the Liber Pontificalis, a witness above all exception, will support the true and false privilege. Behold the entire ceremony of the election and consecration of Valentine, who succeeded Eugene the Second in the year 827, without the presence of an imperial envoy, and without any promise or oath: elected by the voices of the noble populace and the joyful soldiers of both Roman armies to the seat of the pontiffs.

427
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:52,155
With appropriate praises of glory and grandeur, he was led to the Lateran Patriarchate and placed on the pontifical throne.

428
01:16:52,155 --> 01:16:54,748
The entire Roman senate joyfully kissed his feet.

429
01:16:54,748 --> 01:17:03,054
After all the necessary rites and ceremonies were performed reverently and properly, there was great sobriety and joy among the people of all ages and sexes.

430
01:17:03,054 --> 01:17:10,832
On the day of his consecration, at the break of dawn, they led the bishop from the Palace to the church of Saint Peter, the prince of the apostles.

431
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:15,805
With the help of divine majesty, they consecrated him as the supreme pontiff on a high throne.

432
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:25,805
In contrast, regarding the successor of Sergius the Second, Leo the Fourth, section 497: Terrified by fear and future events, they consecrated him as bishop without the prince's permission.

433
01:17:25,805 --> 01:17:38,132
About the successor of the same Leo, Benedict the Third, section 558: The clergy and all the nobles fortified the decree with their own hands and, as ancient custom demands, sent it to the most invincible emperors, Lothair and Louis.

434
01:17:38,132 --> 01:17:44,376
After Gregory the Third in the year 107, the ancient custom of sending the election decree to the prince was restored.

435
01:17:44,376 --> 01:17:51,994
In the year 847, during the election of Leo the Fourth, imminent danger to the city prevented the imperial orders and envoys from being awaited.

436
01:17:51,994 --> 01:17:58,396
Therefore, the age of this kind of restoration is so certain that it should not be doubted based on unreliable documents.

437
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:01,835
A specific cause preceded this restoration of ancient subjection.

438
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:11,200
Sergius allowed the apostolic see to again bear the yoke that had been cast off long ago because Louis had approved the canonical election of Gregory the Fourth in the year 827.

439
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:16,808
Upon the death of Valentine, after a brief pontificate of forty days, Gregory the Fourth was duly elected.

440
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:22,999
He firmly refused the supreme honor, and Louis's authority intervened before the consecration of the elected pontiff.

441
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:28,131
This is testified by the Astronomer in the Life of Louis the Pious: Gregory, priest of the title.

442
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:33,288
Saint Mark was chosen, but his consecration was delayed until the emperor was consulted.

443
01:18:33,288 --> 01:18:39,160
With the emperor's approval and the agreement of the clergy and people, he was ordained in place of the previous one.

444
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:48,042
This event is confirmed by the annals of Eginhard and the words of the Bertiniani:
He was not ordained until the emperor's envoy came to Rome and examined the people's election.

445
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:54,266
Pagius and others use these testimonies to support the supposed constitution of Eugene and Lothair, which we have mentioned.

446
01:18:54,266 --> 01:19:09,773
However, as these same annals report the election and consecration of Valentine without any mention of imperial consent, they show that the emperor's authority was invoked because Gregory refused, to ensure a canonical and just election, rather than attributing such an unjust usurpation to the pious emperor.

447
01:19:09,773 --> 01:19:21,617
Besides, if they try to weaken the discipline confirmed by Louis the Pious in the year 817 in the diploma we are discussing with these later arguments, I have already mentioned how significant this type of argument should be considered.

448
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:31,202
Moreover, the certain cause of the renewed subjection was the invocation of the aforementioned imperial authority: the restorer was Sergius the Second at the request of Lothair, son of Louis.

449
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:50,022
While his pious father lived, he did not attempt anything new, but after Louis died in the year 840, and Gregory the Fourth also died at the beginning of 844, when the Romans, for the sake of that period's discipline, elected and ordained Sergius without consulting the emperor, he sent Louis the son to the city to obtain the aforementioned privilege from the apostolic see.

450
01:19:50,022 --> 01:20:08,992
Indeed, I would not dare to define whether Lothair, due to the animosities that had arisen between him and Gregory, because Gregory had refused to abandon the friendship of his father Louis and adhere to him, or for some other secret reason, following the example of Gregory who had taken on the pontificate with imperial authority, sought that privilege from the apostolic see.

451
01:20:08,992 --> 01:20:17,524
This I know for certain: neither Lothair nor his son Louis from the Carolingian emperors, nor any of the Goths or Eastern emperors from Germany, imitated this in any way.

452
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:30,092
It was not by a privilege attached to the imperial dignity, but by an apostolic concession, that they considered the elections of the Roman pontiffs valid during their lifetime, as will be evident from the elections of these pontiffs.

453
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:39,049
During the times of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, Leo the Third, Stephen the Fourth, Paschal the First, Eugene the Second, Valentine, and Gregory the Fourth were elected.

454
01:20:39,049 --> 01:20:48,110
For Gregory the Fourth alone, the necessary confirmation of the election was requested by the clergy and people, due to chance and necessity, from the reluctantly elected one.

455
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:55,981
An irrefutable argument is the election of Sergius the Second, who succeeded Gregory the Fourth, and his consecration without consulting Lothair at all.

456
01:20:55,981 --> 01:21:09,754
Another argument comes from Gregory the Fourth himself: unlike Saint Gregory the Great, his predecessor, or Saint Gregory the Seventh, during whose time imperial confirmation was required, he did not write supplicating letters to the Emperor to confirm his election.

457
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:16,433
Aware of the discipline of his time, he first hid and then firmly testified through his constancy that he rejected such a burden.

458
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:32,070
However, after Louis the Second obtained the apostolic privilege by order of his father Lothair, Leo the Fourth, Benedict the Third, Nicholas the First, Adrian the Second, and John the Eighth were inaugurated over a span of twenty-five years according to this discipline established by papal authority.

459
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:45,791
It was different for the nine successors of John the Eighth elected over sixteen years from 882 to 898, namely Martin the Second, Adrian the Third, Stephen the Fifth, Formosus, Boniface the Sixth, Stephen the Sixth, Romanus, Theodore the Second, and John the Ninth.

460
01:21:45,791 --> 01:21:54,956
All of them were ordained without the order of the prince or the presence of his envoys, showing that this personal privilege was lacking for Charles the Fat and his successors.

461
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:59,409
Forty-three pontiffs were elected and consecrated during the reign of Charles the Fat.

462
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:05,778
The last one, Stephen the Fifth, displeased the emperor for reasons unknown to us, as he was created without his knowledge.

463
01:22:05,778 --> 01:22:13,182
The Fulda Annals (in Freher, vol. 1, p. 60) also report this and illustrate how futile the emperor's complaint was regarding his Roman pontiff.

464
01:22:13,752 --> 01:22:17,145
Upon the death of Stephen, they appointed someone else in his place.

465
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:21,437
This angered the emperor because they made such an appointment without consulting him.

466
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:26,628
He sent Liutward and some bishops of the Roman See to remove the new appointee, but they couldn't do it.

467
01:22:26,628 --> 01:22:35,761
The pope, through his envoys, sent the names of more than 30 bishops, all the priests and deacons of the cardinals, as well as lower-ranking individuals and lay leaders of the region.

468
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:39,404
They had all unanimously elected him and supported his ordination of 118.

469
01:22:39,404 --> 01:22:48,387
I will skip discussing the opinions of others, especially those who attribute to Adrian III the decree concerning the freedom of consecration from then on, for the sake of brevity.

470
01:22:48,387 --> 01:22:53,278
However, I firmly believe that only these two among the Carolingians used this personal privilege.

471
01:22:53,278 --> 01:23:01,712
In the sixteen years following the death of John VIII until the creation of John IX in 898, many evils occurred, and John's election was disrupted by the Sergian schism.

472
01:23:01,712 --> 01:23:06,853
This pope realized that handling such a significant matter with imperial authority would be beneficial.

473
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:14,888
Therefore, in the same year, he convened a council, as mentioned in volume IX, page 502, and, due to other serious causes, decreed the renewal of this privilege.

474
01:23:14,888 --> 01:23:43,684
He stated in chapter 10: "Because the holy Roman Church, which we preside over by the grace of God, suffers many abuses when the pope passes away, these abuses occur because the consecration of the pope happens without the knowledge of the emperor and without the presence of his envoys. Thus, we want this to be abolished, and the pope to be elected in the presence of the gathered bishops and all the clergy, requested by the senate and the people. Then, having been most famously elected in the sight of all, he should be consecrated in the presence of the imperial envoys."

475
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:55,001
No one should be forced to swear an oath or make promises through new inventions, except those required by ancient customs, so that the Church is not scandalized, and the emperor's honor remains intact.

476
01:23:55,001 --> 01:24:00,678
If you look into the history of that time, you'll see how pointless the restoration of this privilege was.

477
01:24:00,678 --> 01:24:06,461
At the end of the year 899, Arnulf, the last of the Carolingians, died while John the Ninth was still alive.

478
01:24:06,461 --> 01:24:17,707
Around that time, Emperor Arnulf passed away on November 29 and was honorably buried in Regensburg, where his father, Carloman, the brother of Charles the Fat, is also buried, as recorded in the Annals of Metz.

479
01:24:17,707 --> 01:24:23,491
The Annals of Fulda, according to Freher, mark the year as 900, with a slight difference of about one month.

480
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:29,275
In the same declining year, John died, and with no emperor, Benedict the Fourth was elected and consecrated.

481
01:24:29,275 --> 01:24:38,754
Pope Benedict crowned Louis the Third as emperor in 902, but Louis was captured and blinded by his rival Berengar, leading to a miserable and uncertain life under Pope Benedict.

482
01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:49,571
Therefore, it's clear that his six successors-Leo the Fifth, Christopher, Sergius the Third, Anastasius the Third, Landus, and John the Tenth-were elected and consecrated without any emperor's approval.

483
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:55,141
However, John the Tenth crowned Berengar as emperor in 916, but Berengar died while John was still pope.

484
01:24:55,141 --> 01:24:59,907
Even if Berengar had obtained a privilege, which no one claims, he couldn't have used it.

485
01:24:59,907 --> 01:25:08,689
Later, Marozia and the counts of Tusculum usurped control of the City and its duchy for thirty-eight years, refusing to be subject to both papal and imperial power.

486
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:10,671
You can read about this in Liudprand.

487
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:14,741
The venerable Cardinal Baronius rightly condemns the perversity of that age.

488
01:25:15,384 --> 01:25:24,787
Indeed, in Rome, both sacred and secular matters were entangled with factions, making the promotion to the apostolic see of the Roman pontiff dependent on whichever party seemed more powerful.

489
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:35,169
As a result, sometimes the leaders of the Romans and sometimes the princes of Etruria would use their secular power to install their chosen candidate and depose any Roman pontiff promoted by the opposing faction.

490
01:25:35,169 --> 01:25:44,621
These actions continued throughout much of this century until the German emperors, particularly the Ottos, intervened, arrogantly claiming for themselves the right to elect and depose the pope.

491
01:25:44,621 --> 01:25:54,220
It's clear that this invasion by the princes was more a sign of the corrupted discipline of that iron tenth century than a continuation of a privilege granted by the apostolic see to the emperors.

492
01:25:54,220 --> 01:26:05,631
Moreover, from the following privileges, it is evident that Otto and Henry ignored the decree of John the Ninth, as it was never implemented, instead confirming the discipline from the times of Eugenius the Second and Leo the Fourth.

493
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:13,957
Hence, the mention of the privilege granted only to Louis, at the request of Sergius the Second, to his father Lothair, which Louis also used, is well known and verified.

494
01:26:13,957 --> 01:26:25,857
However, from the decree of Nicholas the Second in the council held in Rome in 1059 regarding the election of the Roman pontiff, it is clear that this was a personal privilege for the German emperors, if any of them were found to have used it.

495
01:26:25,857 --> 01:26:55,193
"Let him be chosen," he says, "from the clergy of that Church if a suitable one is found; or if not, let him be taken from another, with due honor and reverence to our beloved son Henry, who is currently considered king and hoped to be the future emperor, God permitting, as we have already granted him, and to his successors who have personally obtained this right from the apostolic see."
This monument could not be more appropriate to refute the opinions of Pagi and the Italian annalist, who confidently, yet recklessly, assert that the imperial right was the confirmation of the papal election.

496
01:26:55,536 --> 01:27:10,329
Nicholas clearly stated that he had granted that privilege to King Henry IV in 120, and it could be used by anyone who personally obtained it from the Apostolic See, as shown in the acts of the Vatican regarding the creation of Saint Gregory the Seventh, as attested by Baronius (1073, no. 27).

497
01:27:10,329 --> 01:27:19,084
Following the example of Gregory the Great, he quickly sent messengers to King Henry, revealing the election made from above and earnestly begging him not to give his assent.

498
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:26,028
If King Henry did not comply, it was certain to Nicholas that he would not tolerate more serious and manifest excesses without punishment.

499
01:27:26,028 --> 01:27:40,368
However, as soon as the king understood the truth of the election, he gave his assent and sent Gregory, the bishop of Vercelli and chancellor of the kingdom of Italy, to the City to confirm the election with royal authority and attend to his consecration, which was done without delay.

500
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:48,066
This entirely removes the stain from the Carolingians and the German emperors, which the often-praised two men adhering to the sectarians impute to both.

501
01:27:48,066 --> 01:27:56,268
They had not imitated Odoacer and the Eastern emperors by attributing to themselves a matter which, without the authority of the Apostolic See, is mere usurpation.

502
01:27:56,268 --> 01:28:10,206
It was not only the emperors who acquired a share in the supreme pontifical power along with the imperial diadem, but also the kings, who, by the constant confession of all, had nothing to do with the City and urban affairs, obtained such a privilege from the supreme pontiffs.

503
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:20,471
Did it seem to Saint Gregory the Seventh, who was about to decline the pontificate, that he should not follow the examples of his predecessors and should completely free the Holy See from that subjection?

504
01:28:20,471 --> 01:28:39,893
I would be lying, says Baronius (1085, no. 12), if these things could not already be shown by the experience of present matters-namely, that Gregory recovered the investitures of churches from the hands of princes, restored the free election of Roman pontiffs by postliminium, completely repaired the collapsed ecclesiastical discipline, and brought about many other countless benefits.

505
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:46,462
And indeed, nowhere will you find any further need for imperial or royal consent for the ordination of Roman pontiffs.

506
01:28:46,462 --> 01:28:53,256
Therefore, it can safely be said that only two emperors from the Carolingians and King Henry from the Germans used this privilege.

507
01:28:53,256 --> 01:28:57,646
Regarding the six German emperors who preceded that king, we must think differently.

508
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:03,133
The three Ottos, who followed the corrupt practices of the 10th century, should not be considered at all.

509
01:29:03,133 --> 01:29:08,934
Saint Henry, crowned by Pope Benedict the Eighth, never deviated from what was right and just, given his piety.

510
01:29:08,934 --> 01:29:12,696
However, both he and Benedict died within a short span in the year 1024.

511
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:22,364
John the Nineteenth, a layman, was then elevated to the pontificate at the age of 21 through bribery, as Glaber mentions according to Baronius (1024, n. 4), and was confirmed by no one.

512
01:29:22,364 --> 01:29:27,434
It is never found that Benedict the Ninth, elected similarly, was confirmed by Conrad the Second.

513
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:32,294
Only Henry the Second, King of Germany, is noted for using this privilege for the third time.

514
01:29:32,294 --> 01:29:39,035
However, since he did not obtain it through apostolic authority, I do not consider him comparable to the two Carolingians either.

515
01:29:39,035 --> 01:29:46,822
Peter Damian (Disceptationes inter regem adversum et Romanae Ecclesiae defensorem, Conciliorum tomus IX, p. 1159) held the same opinion as me before.

516
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:56,333
I will bring the exact words here; for it is of no small importance to restrict this privilege to one King Henry the Fourth, which the Italian annalists considered an imperial right.

517
01:29:56,333 --> 01:30:35,684
The royal advocate is introduced speaking thus: "The father of my lord, the king of blessed memory, Henry the emperor, was made patrician of the Romans, from whom he received the preeminent role in the election concerning the ordination of the pontiff.
Additionally, what is more outstanding is that Pope Nicholas granted this privilege to my lord the king, which he had already inherited from his father, and confirmed it through a page of synodal decree."
The advocate of the Roman Church, relying on the authority of Emperor Henry, also holds the right of the Roman people; and venerating only the authority of the holy see, he states: "We defend this privilege for our most invincible king as well, and wish that he may possess it fully and intact."

518
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:42,102
Then he shows that the ordination of Alexander the Second was done without his consent because he was still underage.

519
01:30:42,102 --> 01:30:47,100
Indeed, we have recently seen that Gregory, Alexander's successor, was mindful of the same privilege.

520
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:58,136
Anyone who thinks differently about this matter is supporting corrupt practices and mixing usurpation with the tolerance of the popes, attributing more than is due to the emperors, to the great detriment of papal authority.

521
01:30:58,136 --> 01:31:00,412
So much for the privilege of Henry the Fourth.

522
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:21,099
But when Otto and Henry praise the constitution of Eugenius the Second and the voluntary promise of Leo the Fourth in their privileges, from which the patchwork mentioned above (n. 35) originated, it is worth understanding from almost contemporary historians what the true discipline of papal election and consecration should have been during the time of the Germans, and what should be attributed to Eugenius and Leo.

523
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:29,017
The Astronomer narrates in the Life of Louis the Pious (Pithou's edition, p. 222) how Lothair, sent to Rome by his father, was warmly received by Pope Eugenius.

524
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:52,425
When he complained about the events that had taken place, specifically why those who had been loyal to the emperor and the Franks were unjustly killed and those who survived were left to be ridiculed and held in contempt, and why such great complaints against the Roman pontiffs and judges were heard, it was found that, due to either the ignorance or negligence of some pontiffs and the blind and insatiable greed of the judges, many estates had been unjustly confiscated.

525
01:31:52,425 --> 01:31:57,522
Therefore, by restoring what had been unjustly taken, Lothair created great joy among the Roman people.

526
01:31:57,522 --> 01:32:19,644
The annals attributed to Eginhard report the same matter:
When he (Eugenius) revealed the state of the Roman people, long corrupted by the perversity of certain prelates, he corrected it with the benevolent assent of the mentioned pontiff, so that all who had been gravely desolated by the plundering of their possessions were magnificently consoled by the restoration of their goods, which had come about through his arrival, by the grace of God.

527
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:24,930
Eugenius' predecessors were Saint Leo the Third, Stephen the Fourth, and Saint Paschal the First.

528
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:31,635
The Astronomer rightly accuses judges of greed and calls the popes ignorant or lazy, rather than corrupt, as any chronicler might do.

529
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:37,987
Besides, the privileges granted by Otto and Henry are said to cause unreasonable harshness towards the people subject to them.

530
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:45,096
The constitution made by Eugenius and Lothair restrains this chronicler's excessive freedom, as we will see when we discuss these privileges.

531
01:32:45,096 --> 01:32:57,044
But let's set aside these trivial matters: the oath imposed by Lothair and Eugenius on the Romans, as mentioned in the aforementioned compilation about the canonical and just election of the pope, seems very likely to be true if certain.

532
01:32:57,044 --> 01:33:04,153
However, what is claimed there about a voluntary promise made by Eugenius, which is clearly a lie, reveals the deception of pseudo-Warnefrid.

533
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:16,152
Otto, Henry, the papal archive, and the Pontifical Book bear witness, and thus the voluntary promise should be delayed until the consecration of Leo the Fourth in 847, after the privilege granted three years earlier by Sergius the Second.

534
01:33:16,152 --> 01:33:23,966
Leo is said to have made this promise voluntarily because of the fear of the Saracens, as neither an order nor an envoy from the emperor had been expected.

535
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:26,084
Therefore, that promise was not necessary.

536
01:33:26,084 --> 01:33:34,402
In section 46, we saw that this discipline had already been established by Lothair and Louis the Pious, and then was unsuccessfully revived by John the Ninth in 900.

537
01:33:34,402 --> 01:33:40,200
It was confirmed in the great corruption of the 10th century by Otto and Henry, but it was never put into practice.

538
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:44,990
Finally, we find it was only observed in the creation of Gregory the Seventh, who abolished it.

539
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:54,972
Now, let's return to Pagi's objection, who believes the Ludovician diploma is a mere fabrication because it presents a discipline entirely different from the one instituted about thirty years later.

540
01:33:54,972 --> 01:33:57,946
Isn't that passing judgment on entirely unexplored matters?

541
01:33:57,946 --> 01:34:01,022
Any sensible person would disregard the remaining objections.

542
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:12,291
When he claims that none of the Roman popes remember the donation of Louis the Pious, and Otto and Henry mention the donations of Pepin and Charlemagne but are silent about Louis's, he shows his own ignorance.

543
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:20,126
He hasn't understood the nature of the documents that confirm all the rights of the Holy See, without adding even an inch of land to the ancient donations.

544
01:34:20,126 --> 01:34:27,455
Similarly, when he thinks that Sicily and other islands were granted to the Apostolic See by Louis, with all due respect, he is grossly mistaken.

545
01:34:27,455 --> 01:34:35,491
To prove a document false, which learned men recognize as legitimate, you need to uncover words and formulas in it that don't fit the age it claims to be from.

546
01:34:35,491 --> 01:34:56,012
Just as Ludwig (Preface to the collection of manuscripts of all ages, § 22) declared a supposed diploma of Charlemagne for Frisia to be false because it mentioned Feudal Law, always August, Duchy of Saxony, feudal dependencies of the empire, King of Saxony, council of the faithful, consent of the princes of the empire, subscriptions of the King of Bohemia, Marquis of Meissen, and Landgrave of Thuringia.

547
01:34:56,012 --> 01:35:04,200
No matter how much effort the creators of some forgery put into imitating the character of a distant age, they inevitably fall into the customs of their own time.

548
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:12,035
Indeed, if Pagius and the Italian annalist had objected to any of these things, I would be ashamed to argue so vehemently for the validity of the document.

549
01:35:12,035 --> 01:35:18,858
But to the objections of Pagius, which I said should be regarded with contempt rather than refuted, the praised annalist adds one more.

550
01:35:18,858 --> 01:35:31,292
This is more fitting for a current case than for reviewing old monuments (year 817); namely, that the diploma did not originate from the chancellery of Louis because it lacks a date, which is a sign that only an incomplete example of it survives.

551
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:39,278
But who among the learned has ever dared to affirm that the autographs of the diplomas of Pepin, Charlemagne, and Louis have come down to us late descendants?

552
01:35:39,278 --> 01:35:48,022
Nevertheless, they gain such credibility from the Carolingian Code and other annalistic monuments that the lack of autographs is consistently judged to be a very minor loss.

553
01:35:48,528 --> 01:35:52,548
The medieval Italian geographer Pagio and the annalist serve as substitutes.

554
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:56,780
However, whatever truth exists in their table relies heavily on that key source.

555
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:05,086
He would rather be like a person who drills a hole in the ship he himself is sailing on than oppose the aforementioned authorities, whose words he swears by.

556
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:13,445
Despite the given defects, or rather external flaws, common to other monuments not of such great antiquity, they do little harm to the Ludovician manuscripts.

557
01:36:13,445 --> 01:36:21,592
It was given at the Aachen assembly in the year 817, on the sixth day before the Kalends of July, as read at the beginning (Council, volume 7, page 1507).

558
01:36:21,592 --> 01:36:35,400
In the year of the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ 817, in the fourth year of the reign of the most glorious prince Louis, on the sixth day before the Ides of July, several abbots with their monks gathered in the house of the Aachen palace, called Lateran.

559
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:47,356
Among them was Joshua, abbot of the Volturno monastery, very dear to the pope, as taught by Mabillon (Annals, book 28, number 45), who provided the monastery's document to its chronicler, as mentioned (number 9 and following).

560
01:36:47,356 --> 01:36:55,556
What must be particularly noted in the diploma are the ancient subscriptions, said to have been added to the donation first made by King Pepin at Carisiac.

561
01:36:55,556 --> 01:37:12,009
Regarding the Pepinian donation, the Book of the Popes (section 318) relates this in the Life of Adrian: That promise which King Pepin, and the most excellent Charles with his brother Carloman, and all the judges of the Franks made to the blessed Peter and his most saintly memory lord Stephen the younger pope.

562
01:37:12,009 --> 01:37:23,859
And elsewhere (section 253) it was said: Sent to be possessed by the blessed Peter and the holy Roman Church and all the popes of the apostolic see forever, which remains stored in the archive of our holy Church to this day.

563
01:37:24,336 --> 01:37:32,963
I don't see how the end of Louis's diploma differs from the following:
We sent Theodore, the nomenclator, as the legate of the Holy Roman Church to Lord Pope Paschal.

564
01:37:32,963 --> 01:37:42,837
The subscriptions of the emperor, his sons, bishops, abbots, counts, and palatine officials are listed in the diploma itself, as noted by both the Volturnensi and the Cassinensi chroniclers.

565
01:37:42,837 --> 01:37:47,411
This is considered the greatest evidence of antiquity, as gathered from Anselm of Lucca.

566
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:56,921
Unless the author of the collection attributed to him is somewhat more recent, Anselm took up the episcopate of Lucca in the year 1073, when Gregory the Seventh began his pontificate.

567
01:37:56,921 --> 01:38:06,328
In his collection of canons, later expanded by Gratian, Anselm included from the privileges of Otto and Henry the chapter on the election of the pope, Book Six, Chapter Thirty-Five.

568
01:38:06,328 --> 01:38:43,228
He says at the end:
"And both emperors signed in their own time, and twenty-three bishops, six abbots, thirteen counts, and seventeen nobles, whose names we will see below in both privileges; namely, ten bishops in Otto's, and thirteen in Henry's; and so with the others joined together by Anselm."
Therefore, it cannot be denied that a copy of Louis's diploma has reached us. It is a copy of great antiquity, known to Anselm, Book Four, Chapter Thirty-Five, as well as the other two, not from autographs, but from those examples mentioned at the beginning, number two and following. The main part was the complete Louis document, with the other two contracted, as evident from the review of the subscriptions.
