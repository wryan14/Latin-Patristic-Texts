00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,887
On the Prophet Haggai
by Haymo of Halberstadt

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:14,991
The prophet Haggai, whose name means festive or solemn, foretold the restoration of the Lord's temple, the downfall of nations, the shaking of the world, and, using Zerubbabel as a figure, predicted the coming of Christ.

3
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:21,097
He was among those who had recently returned from the Babylonian captivity under Zerubbabel, the priest Joshua, and Ezra.

4
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:24,226
Jerusalem was not yet rebuilt, nor was the temple of the Lord.

5
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:30,081
The people were living in low and humble houses, and because of this, the word of the Lord was not directed to them.

6
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:36,793
They were deemed unworthy to receive it, as they had no concern for rebuilding the temple, being content with their modest dwellings.

7
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:49,763
They were under Darius, king of Persia, whose name means "generation not made," or refers to those who serve the works of the flesh and lust. Such a king was fitting for a people who were without the temple of God and who lived not on Mount Zion, but below.

8
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,359
Chapter One

9
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:59,256
In the second year of Darius, king of Persia, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet.

10
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:02,375
The number two is often associated with negative connotations.

11
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:06,147
It divides the first unity and can signify either marital union or discord.

12
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:13,390
In Genesis, it is mentioned that God saw that it was good at the end of all the other days, but this is not stated at the end of the second day.

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,878
In the sixth month, there is also no legal feast, unlike in other months, because it signifies the works and labors of servitude.

14
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:26,970
Thus, it is fitting that in the second year of Darius and in the sixth month, the word of God comes to Haggai for the aforementioned reasons.

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,201
They did not have a temple and lived in hollow places, and under Darius, they were serving carnal works.

16
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:43,368
However, since the altar was already built and the foundations of the temple laid, the word of the Lord came on the first day of the month, so that they, leaving the second year of Darius, might return to the unity of God.

17
00:01:43,368 --> 00:02:33,917
The phrase "the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai" shows that he had good works and that the word of God rested in these deeds.
Haggai means festive.
This implies that whoever strives to celebrate the feasts of the Lord, not with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, can receive the word of God.
To Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying.
This Shealtiel, whose son Zerubbabel is said to be, was the son of Jeconiah the king, who was taken to Babylon.
Zerubbabel means flowing adjacent, exposed, or born in Babylon, or a prince in Babylon.
He signifies Christ Jesus, who built the temple to God the Father from living stones, that is, the faithful of both Testaments.
He is exposed to us as a very abundant flowing stream for drinking.
But to be able to drink from this, we must ask God, which Shealtiel his father implies, for Shealtiel means the petition of God.

18
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:43,795
Here, he was born in Babylon, and Christ, the Son of God, appeared incarnate in the confusion of this world to rescue us, who were held captive by sin, and to lead us back to the promised land.

19
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:47,526
The word of the Lord came to Zerubbabel and also to Joshua, the high priest.

20
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:53,515
Historically, there were two men: one from the tribe of Judah and of royal lineage, and the other from the priestly tribe.

21
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:58,572
Mystically, however, they both represented the same Christ, who is the true king and great high priest.

22
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:04,267
As king, Zerubbabel was his type; as priest, Joshua, the son of Jozadak, represented him, that is, the Lord is just.

23
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,489
For God the Father is just and holy, and his Son is Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

24
00:03:08,489 --> 00:04:15,209
The Lord of hosts says this: "This people says: 'The time has not yet come to build the house of the Lord.'" It was not Zerubbabel or Joshua, the high priest, who said this, but the people who had returned from captivity and were still under Darius. Similarly, everyone who serves the pleasures of the flesh does not want to build a temple for the Lord of chastity within the seat of their heart. This can also refer to the Jews of this time, who expect the Antichrist instead of Christ and say that it is not yet the time for the Church because Christ has not yet come.
And the word of the Lord came through the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying: "Is it time for you to live in paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?" In response to what the people were saying, "The time has not yet come to build the house of the Lord," the Lord replied: "Then it is not the time for you to live in well-built and decorated houses, which are not only for use but for pleasure. And you say it is not yet time to build my house, in which were the holy of holies and the cherubim, which now lie in desolation, scorched by heat, and drenched by rain."
And now, this is what the Lord of hosts says: "Give careful thought to your ways." Because you say: "The time has not yet come to build the house of the Lord," consider what you have done and what you have suffered.

25
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,973
For all your hard work, you have achieved nothing.

26
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:21,973
You've sown a lot but reaped very little and gathered much less than you planted.

27
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,579
However, you cannot say that hunger followed because the farmer was lazy.

28
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:31,851
You've eaten, but you are not satisfied; you've drunk, but you are not filled; you've clothed yourselves, but you are not warm.

29
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,814
And the one who earned wages put them into a bag with holes.

30
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:39,556
Yet, you cannot say it was voluntary fasting, but because you gathered few fruits in your barns.

31
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:43,062
You drank wine, but not enough to gladden the hearts of those drinking.

32
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:46,025
Even the clothing could not drive away the cold or warm you.

33
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:53,582
If anyone earned wages, whether through trade or as a hired hand, they labored in vain because all the money flowed away as if put into a bag with holes.

34
00:04:53,582 --> 00:05:02,620
Spiritually, those who place their hearts on their ways are the ones who do nothing without the judgment of discretion and always have the lamp of God's word before their mind's eyes.

35
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:13,337
One who sows much but gathers little is one who toils constantly in the work of preaching but receives very little fruit from the faith and actions of the listeners, while showing them scandalized by word and example.

36
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:18,622
He eats and is not satisfied; he drinks and is not filled, who does not practice what he knows to be right.

37
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:23,610
Hence Solomon says: The righteous eats and fills his soul, but the belly of the wicked is insatiable.

38
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:31,315
He puts the gathered wages into a bag with holes, who performs acts of virtue for the sake of empty glory, or who gives alms to the needy from stolen goods.

39
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:41,340
He clothes himself but is not warmed, who receives divine wisdom to adorn himself and be defended from the cold of wickedness, but by executing it lukewarmly and slothfully, he is deprived of its warmth.

40
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,205
This says the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts on your ways.

41
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:46,921
Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build the house.

42
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:51,205
Consider everything you do, and leave behind the concern for your homes.

43
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:54,505
Go up to the mountain of Lebanon, cut down wood, and build my house.

44
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,999
And it will be acceptable to me, and I will be glorified, says the Lord.

45
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,619
Why does He command to bring wood only and not stones?

46
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:06,297
The Hebrews say it's because after the temple was burned, the walls remained, so only wood was needed for rebuilding.

47
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:17,409
Mystically, to ascend the mountain is to rise to the height of divine contemplation through the progress of virtues and to search the testimonies of the Scriptures so that the temple acceptable to the Lord may be built from them.

48
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:22,213
You looked for more, and behold, it became less; you brought it into the house, and I blew it away.

49
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,979
I will say (He says) something else that happened to you.

50
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:32,937
When the time for harvesting was near, and you thought you were about to hold the grain in your hands, you harvested empty stalks and gathered straw without grains.

51
00:06:32,937 --> 00:06:41,332
But even the small amount that was selected from large heaps, when you brought it into your houses, I blew it away, and by my power, it was scattered and reduced to nothing.

52
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:48,077
Spiritually, they look for more and receive less, who, boasting about their works, falsely promise themselves eternal reward from the Lord.

53
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:53,269
For this reason, says the Lord of hosts, because my house is deserted, and you hurry each to his own house.

54
00:06:53,269 --> 00:07:01,858
Mystically, they hurry to their own house, leaving God's house deserted, who, caught by worldly desires and occupied with earthly activities, neglect to build the temple of God.

55
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:06,517
Because of this, the heavens have withheld dew over you, and the earth has withheld its produce.

56
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:13,990
Not only (He says) did the heavens not give rain, but not even the morning dew, so that the drying fields might at least be tempered by a little moisture.

57
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,813
Typically, the heavens are the apostles, pouring the dew and rain of heavenly doctrine into the hearts of the listeners.

58
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:28,887
The heavens were forbidden to give dew when the word of salvation was spurned by the faithless Jews, and the apostles were commanded to go into the entire world and preach to the nations.

59
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:35,903
And I called for a drought upon the land, the mountains, the wheat, the wine, the oil, and everything the ground produces.

60
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:39,893
This drought was also called upon humans, animals, and all the labor of hands.

61
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:45,263
The drought first affects the land and everything it produces, and ultimately impacts humans and animals.

62
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:51,145
With famine comes death for humans and animals, and the same sword consumes all that human hands have labored over.

63
00:07:51,145 --> 00:08:02,091
Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, Joshua, son of Jehozadak the high priest, and all the remnant of the people heard the voice of the Lord their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the Lord had sent him to them.

64
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,830
The people feared before the Lord.

65
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,660
It's important to note that neither Zerubbabel nor Joshua the priest are said to have feared, only the people did.

66
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,542
This is because each signifies Christ, who is both king and priest in the two natures of God and man in one person.

67
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:23,930
Therefore, when Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest heard the words of the Lord, only the multitude, who had not yet become a perfect man, feared before the Lord.

68
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,687
This means they feared His indignation, as the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.

69
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:40,911
Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord among the messengers of the Lord, spoke to the people:
Some have mistakenly believed that Haggai was an angel who had assumed a human body because it is said: Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke.

70
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,571
They think the same of Malachi and John the Baptist.

71
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:50,680
However, it should be known that they were human by nature but angels by office, meaning messengers who announced God's will to the people.

72
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,352
Thus, this prophet is called a messenger, or an angel, because he bore the type of the Lord the Savior, who is also called the angel of great counsel.

73
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:03,774
As it says: The messenger of the Lord among the messengers of the Lord, it means a prophet among prophets.

74
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,257
I am with you, says the Lord.

75
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:10,269
This message is not directed to Zerubbabel or Joshua but to the people who feared before the Lord.

76
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:16,324
They are received in the person of Christ, as it has been said, and the Lord was always with them and in them.

77
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:20,561
Therefore, the Lord strengthens the people, saying: I am with you, I will be your helper.

78
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:29,510
And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel the governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, son of Jozadak the high priest, and the spirit of the rest of the people.

79
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,604
The spirit of Zerubbabel and the spirit of Joshua were stirred up so that the kingdom and the priesthood might build the temple.

80
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:41,745
The spirit of the rest of the people was stirred up, that is, their devotion of mind and will, to do what the Lord had commanded.

81
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,315
They entered and did the work in the house of the Lord of Hosts, their God.

82
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:54,122
They entered because they had gone out, meaning they had forgotten themselves, like the prodigal son, of whom it is said that he came to himself when he decided to return to his father.

83
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:55,752
Chapter Two

84
00:09:55,752 --> 00:10:00,543
On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of King Darius, they began to build.

85
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:04,076
This was the same year and month mentioned earlier, but not the same day.

86
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:07,513
The first day was mentioned earlier; here, it is the twenty-fourth day.

87
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:15,160
From this, we see that between the first day when the Lord spoke through Haggai and the twenty-fourth day when they began to work, there were twenty-two days.

88
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,402
Interestingly, there are twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

89
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:22,710
This indicates that the people needed to be taught and to learn the basics of God's word.

90
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:29,631
Mystically, as long as we are in this life, we live as if under Darius, because the flesh opposes the spirit, and the spirit opposes the flesh.

91
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:37,956
In the sixth month, when God completed His creation, and in the second year, when the restoration of offspring is confirmed, we must fear the Lord, and engage in His works.

92
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:41,441
This means building a temple for the Lord within ourselves from virtues.

93
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:49,330
The twenty-fourth day, which doubles the number twelve, represents the faithful gathered from both Jewish and Gentile peoples, who will build the spiritual temple.

94
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:59,058
Additionally, a tripled eight makes twenty-four: because circumcision, which was performed on the eighth day, and the construction of the spiritual temple, are founded in the faith of the Holy Trinity.

95
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:11,981
In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day, the word of the Lord came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
Speak to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the rest of the people, saying.

96
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:20,257
In the same year as mentioned earlier, the second year of Darius, but now in the seventh month and on the twenty-first day, the word of the Lord again came through Haggai.

97
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:22,677
The seventh month was entirely festive and solemn.

98
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:32,163
Thus, it is fitting that the word of the Lord comes to Haggai in this festive seventh month, and on the twenty-first day, with the completion of three weeks, fulfilling the mystery of the Trinity.

99
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,906
For three times seven is twenty-one.

100
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:37,743
Who among you remembers seeing this house in its former glory?

101
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,854
And how do you see it now? Isn't it like nothing in your eyes?

102
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:43,162
But now, be strong, Zerubbabel, says the Lord.

103
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,722
Be strong, Joshua, son of Jozadak, the high priest.

104
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:51,844
Be strong, all you people of the land, says the Lord of hosts, and do the work, for I am with you, says the Lord of hosts.

105
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,805
This is the word I promised you when you came out of Egypt.

106
00:11:54,805 --> 00:12:01,730
The Lord very kindly comforts the people who had seen the former house in its glory, which makes this one seem like nothing in comparison.

107
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,544
Do not despair, He says, do not let your hands fall limp, for I am with you.

108
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:06,999
I, the Almighty, have spoken.

109
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,967
My word is as good as done, and I will fulfill what I promised you when I brought you out of Egypt.

110
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:19,243
And my Spirit, that is, the divinity of my majesty, or the Holy Spirit, who is all consolation and hence called the Comforter, will be among you.

111
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,150
Here, the entire Trinity is mentioned.

112
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,458
The Father is the one who says: I am with you.

113
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,566
The Son is the word I covenanted with you.

114
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,326
The Holy Spirit: My Spirit, He says, will be among you.

115
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:37,509
Do not be afraid, for this is what the Lord of hosts says:
In a little while, I will once more shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all nations.

116
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:50,406
When the Covenant was first given on Mount Sinai, I shook the heavens; when I spoke to you from heaven, I shook the earth; when my presence was seen in a cloud, darkness, and storm, as the Psalmist says: God, when you went out before your people, and so on.

117
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:54,521
I shook the Red Sea when I divided it and provided a path for the people to cross.

118
00:12:54,521 --> 00:13:00,091
I also shook the dry land when I led the people for forty years through a desolate and uncultivated wilderness.

119
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:06,414
Therefore, I, who did those things then, will once more shake these elements, which indeed happened at the coming of the Lord.

120
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:13,547
At the time of His Passion, the sky changed as the sun darkened, and darkness fell from the sixth hour to the ninth hour.

121
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:17,378
The earth shook, rocks split, tombs opened, and the ground itself trembled.

122
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:26,214
The sea of this present age was also stirred, agitated by the winds of demons into rebellion, and the dragon-that is, the devil-was defeated, who lay in the sea of this age.

123
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:29,840
He also moved the dry, barren, and unproductive hearts of the Gentiles.

124
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:37,195
Therefore, with the whole universe moved, all nations were stirred by the preaching of the apostles, as their voice went out into all the earth.

125
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:42,711
And the desired one of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says the Lord of Hosts.

126
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:50,934
It is clear that the coming of Christ is foretold, who was desired and awaited to redeem the nations, about whom the Apostle says: Into whom angels long to look.

127
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:57,676
After He came, the house of the Lord was filled with glory, that is, the Church, which is the house of God built from living stones.

128
00:13:57,676 --> 00:14:07,635
For if the house built by the servant was glorious, as much as a servant differs from the Lord, so much better is the house over which the Lord presides than that over which the servant presided.

129
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,955
The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says the Lord of Hosts.

130
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:15,807
The glory of this latter house will be greater than that of the former, says the Lord of Hosts.

131
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,923
As if to say: Do not doubt that I can fulfill what I promise.

132
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:27,043
For I am the one who created everything, in My hand are silver and gold and all wealth; I will give everything necessary for building or decorating the temple.

133
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:36,901
According to the mystical sense, gold is the spiritual sense and understanding that lies hidden in the Scriptures, about which Solomon says: A desirable treasure rests in the mouth of the wise.

134
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:44,102
Silver, however, is the clear words of the Scriptures, from which the Psalmist says: The words of the Lord are pure words, silver, and so on.

135
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:48,699
With these metals, the Church is adorned and becomes brighter than the Synagogue once was.

136
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,814
And in this place, I will give peace, says the Lord of Hosts.

137
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:57,725
Because we know there's nothing more beneficial for building a renowned house than peace, He promises it.

138
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:00,636
When peace is granted, other good things follow more easily.

139
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:07,670
In an allegorical sense, the Lord gives peace to the present Church, with the enemy's malicious plots suppressed and the wars of vices mitigated.

140
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,193
In the future, He will grant true and eternal peace.

141
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:27,899
On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Haggai, saying: This is what the Lord of hosts says: Ask the priests about the law, saying: If a man carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and with the fold touches bread or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy?

142
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,866
Note that it is often said: The word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai, but here: The word of the Lord came to Haggai.

143
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,553
Previously, he had pure works but hadn't fully received wisdom in his heart.

144
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:43,811
Among them were those who didn't want to build the temple for the Lord, so it is said that the word of the Lord came by his hand.

145
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:53,125
Now, because the foundations of the temple have been laid and the people, along with their leaders, are working on the temple of the Lord, the word of the Lord comes to Haggai for that reason.

146
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:58,267
The word is given in the ninth month because he is about to speak about the impurity of the sinful people.

147
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:01,760
The number nine is never taken in a good sense in the divine Scriptures.

148
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:11,851
But since they were still given time to do penance, the word of the Lord comes to the prophet on the twenty-fourth day of the same month, a date where the number twelve is doubled, a number sacred everywhere.

149
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:17,284
Ask the priests about the law, for it is their role to know the law, and they should answer when asked about it.

150
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:22,572
Therefore, Haggai the prophet asks them in the person of the Lord, saying: If a man carries consecrated meat.

151
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:30,673
Consecrated meat referred to the meat of a sacrifice offered on the altar, although there was a great diversity among the consecrated meats, as explained in Leviticus.

152
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:34,360
However, a person was considered impure in soul if they touched a dead body.

153
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:41,657
For as long as the soul is in the body, the human body is not impure, because it has a soul made in the image and likeness of God.

154
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:47,164
But as soon as the soul leaves the body, it becomes impure, as it is earthly and formed from carnal pleasure.

155
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:54,188
This applies to nature; however, the bodies of saints, whose death is precious, are holy due to the merit of the holy soul inhabiting them.

156
00:16:54,188 --> 00:17:04,850
The prophet asks: if a man takes sanctified meat and ties it to the hem of his garment, and that hem touches bread or any other food, can it be sanctified by the touch of the garment where the holy meat is tied?

157
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,114
The priests answered: No.

158
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:16,119
Another question is posed, and the prophet asks: If someone who is unclean in soul, that is, made impure by contact with a dead body, touches any of these good things, will they become contaminated?

159
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,201
The priests answered and said: They will become contaminated.

160
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:24,153
And Haggai responded and said: So it is with this people and this nation before me, says the Lord.

161
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:26,326
Everything they offer will be contaminated.

162
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:32,592
Regarding the first question, the prophet is silent, but he responds to the second, showing why he proposed these questions.

163
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:38,150
For anyone who is unclean in soul and has touched a dead body, everything they touch or offer will be unclean.

164
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:50,480
The meaning is: O people, who offer sacrifices on an altar that is merely built, while my house lies in ruins, and you think you are sanctified by these sacrifices, know that you are not sanctified by the offerings you make in my ruined temple.

165
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,190
Rather, everything you do is contaminated because you neglect my house while diligently building your own houses.

166
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,565
And now, set your hearts from this day forward.

167
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:09,681
Before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, when you would come to a pile of twenty measures, and it would become ten; when you would go to the winepress to draw fifty vessels, it would become twenty.

168
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:10,642
O people of Israel.

169
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,799
Look back at the past days, and from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of Darius, consider everything that has happened before.

170
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,093
Ponder how much you have endured when the temple was not yet built, and how much good has come to you since its construction began.

171
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,775
He specifically lists these things.

172
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:33,982
Before you started building the Lord's temple, when you went to the heap of barley or wheat, expecting twenty measures, you barely found half of that.

173
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:39,219
Similarly, when you went to the winepress, estimating you would have fifty amphoras, you barely found twenty.

174
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,661
He explains why this happened.

175
00:18:40,661 --> 00:19:46,919
"I struck you with scorching wind, mildew, and hail-all the work of your hands-and there was no one among you who returned to me," says the Lord. The blight of the crops is named for their golden color. He says, "I did this so that at least in your affliction, you might return to me, but no one among you returned to me."
Therefore, as long as the Lord's temple was in ruins and its construction delayed, everything went against them. But after they started rebuilding the temple, everything prospered.
From this, it is understood that it is futile to offer gifts to the Lord and seek to appease God with alms or offerings as long as they do not build the Lord's temple within themselves. One must first make oneself a temple of God by advancing, and then be able to offer gifts to God on the altar of faith.
Set your hearts from this day forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundations of the Lord's temple were laid. Set it upon your heart. Is the seed already in the sprout, yet the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not blossomed?
The ninth month for us is November, for we begin the year in March. But for the Hebrews, whose first month is Nisan, which is April, December is considered the ninth month, when seeds lie hidden in the ground, and it cannot be guessed whether barrenness or fertility will follow.

176
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,073
Because it was the ninth month, the prophet asks: Is the seed now sprouting?

177
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:56,363
Or, as another translation more clearly says, is it still in the pod, that is, in the husk of the grain?

178
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:01,653
Or have the fig tree and other trees blossomed, so that from the flower the abundance can be recognized?

179
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:10,096
But I predict to you the abundance of all things, not by mere speculation of flowers, but by prophetic spirit, because you have begun to build the temple of the Lord.

180
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:14,420
Mystically, the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month signifies the end of evil deeds.

181
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:21,693
The number nine, as mentioned above, is always associated with evil, because it lacks unity, which when added completes the perfect number ten.

182
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:33,392
Whoever ends evil within himself, as if at the end of the ninth month, begins to build the house of the Lord (that is, dedicates himself to the divine service), will be filled with the fruits of the vine, fig tree, and olive tree.

183
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:42,802
That is, he will be filled with the grace and blessing of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, having attained the spiritual joy, refreshment, and illumination of the Holy Trinity.

184
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:53,941
But these, that is, the vine, fig tree, and olive tree, will be found where the pomegranate tree was, called thus because its fruit is full of many seeds, having various small chambers contained within one crimson skin.

185
00:20:53,941 --> 00:21:03,859
Hence, it is also called Punic apple, and therefore it signifies the innumerable multitude of holy peoples united under the fellowship of one faith, as if gathered within the embrace of one skin.

186
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,334
And on this day I will bless.

187
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:17,796
And the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth of the month, saying:
It should be noted very carefully that the word of the Lord is said to have come a second time on the same day as above, that is, the twenty-fourth.

188
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:25,883
But the ninth month is not mentioned, because the prophet is to speak of all things prosperous and full of joy concerning the coming of Christ and His kingdom.

189
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:38,650
Nor does it say: In the hand of Haggai, as at first; nor To Haggai the prophet, as in the fourth vision, but rather, To Haggai, that is, to the one celebrating the feast, who now does not announce the coming, but shows the one who has come to be seen.

190
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,735
Speak to Zerubbabel, the leader of Judah.

191
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:49,195
The prophet is commanded to speak to Zorobabel alone, who carries the image of Christ, because what is said is symbolic and pertains to the end of the world.

192
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:54,031
Here's how these things are shown in the order of history:
I will shake heaven and earth together.

193
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:59,953
To Zorobabel alone, who we said bears the person of Christ in human form, these things are spoken about what is to come.

194
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:06,368
I will shake (he says) heaven and earth, meaning I will change them for the better, so there will be a new heaven and a new earth.

195
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,020
For thus the figure of this world passes away while the substance remains.

196
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:26,404
Then follows:
I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdom of the nations, meaning I will destroy all principality, power, and might, whether they are opposing spiritual wickednesses, so the destruction of their kingdom benefits not only the nations but also the kings who ruled over them.

197
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:35,533
I will overthrow the chariot and its rider, and the horses and their riders will come down, meaning all the efforts of waging war will cease, and when that is taken away, peace follows.

198
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:48,611
This is clearly shown to be fulfilled in Christ by the prophet Zechariah, who says of Christ: Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey's colt; and immediately adds: And he will destroy the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem.

199
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,029
A man will rise against his brother with a sword.

200
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:56,062
The Apostle says:
Take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.

201
00:22:56,062 --> 00:23:01,194
Therefore, the sword is the word of heavenly doctrine, cutting and tearing apart all perverse teachings.

202
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:10,521
With this sword, a man is separated from his brother, a son from his father, a daughter from her mother, a daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law, and a man's enemies are his own household.

203
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:20,193
On that day, says the Lord of Hosts, I will take you, Zorobabel, son of Salathiel, my servant, says the Lord, and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, says the Lord of Hosts.

204
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:23,352
It was previously said that Zorobabel holds the image of Christ.

205
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:26,757
The Father calls him a servant because he took the form of a servant.

206
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:35,097
And the Apostle says of the same:
When God the Father has subjected all things to the Son, then the Son himself will be subjected to Him who subjected all things to Him.

207
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:39,242
For in all things being subjected to Him, He Himself will also be seen as subjected.

208
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,923
When this has been fulfilled, God the Father will take him and place him as a seal in His hand.

209
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,578
For he is the image of the invisible God and the form of His substance.

210
00:23:48,578 --> 00:24:09,689
Therefore, the Son himself says: "For this one the Father, God, has sealed."
We seal things that we want to be specially cherished and kept safe.
So, the Father specially sealed this one, meaning He chose and gifted him with special grace, so that just as he was a true man, he would also be true God.
Whoever believes in him and strives to please him through good works is sealed with this seal or ring.
Amen.
