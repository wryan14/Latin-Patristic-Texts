This was done to secure his support and ensure peace, providing assistance against the Egyptians.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Among these gifts, they also included two calves made of bronze and gilded to resemble the golden ones created by Jeroboam. The priests had secretly kept the gold for themselves and replaced it with bronze. The Prophet previously referred to these calves, saying: \"And it (the calf) was brought to Assyria as a gift to the avenging king,\" using the singular to refer to the plural.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Therefore, speaking on behalf of the people, the Prophet said: \"Assyria will not save us.\" He implied that while they hoped for the Assyrians' protection, true safety did not come from them. He emphasized that they should no longer trust in man but in God, as it is written: \"Cursed is the man who trusts in man and whose heart turns away from the Lord.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    He further added: \"We will no longer ride on horses,\" indicating their previous reliance on the swift horses of the Egyptians. The meaning is: \"We will no longer place our hope in the Egyptians; instead, you will be our refuge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Allegorically, if we interpret this, Assyria can be seen as representing the devil and the horse as his pride. So, if anyone has placed their trust in Assyria, appeasing him with giftsâ€”namely evil deeds he delights inâ€”to ride the horse, that is, to rise with arrogance, it will happen as the Lord says in the Gospel: \"Everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled.\" We will no longer declare, \"The work of our hands are our gods,\" referring to the golden calves we made. We will no longer consider them gods or seek help from them, for you will have mercy on those who are in you, your people.
