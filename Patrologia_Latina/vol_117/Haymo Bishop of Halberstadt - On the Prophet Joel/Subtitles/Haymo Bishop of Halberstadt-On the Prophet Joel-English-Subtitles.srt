00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,887
On the Prophet Joel
by Haymo of Halberstadt

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:19,560
Joel's name means "beginning." He delivers a prophecy to Judea and Jerusalem.
At the start of his book, he describes sorrowful feasts and calls Jerusalem to mourning, foretelling its destruction.
Joel also prophesies the calling of the nations and the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the gathered believers.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,904
Chapter One

4
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:23,766
The word of the Lord came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.

5
00:00:23,766 --> 00:02:12,575
Joel means "the strength of God," and Pethuel means "the opening" or "the word of the Lord." The word of God, which always was with the Father, came to Joel.
Listen to this, elders, and hear, all inhabitants of the earth. Elders not by age, but by merit; and inhabitants of the earth, who are weighed down by earthly works. There is a great difference between listening and hearing. Elders, that is, the spiritual ones, listen more reverently; but those who dwell on the earth hear, but more humbly. If this has happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers, tell it to your children; and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation. What I am about to say is known by memory: a new thing desires new listeners. For new wine is put into new wineskins. In this brief sentence, he included all of humanity.
What the caterpillar left, the locust has eaten; what the locust left, the cankerworm has eaten; and what the cankerworm left, the palmerworm has eaten. For what does the caterpillar, which crawls entirely on the ground, signify if not luxury? What does the locust, which flies by leaping, signify if not vain glory? What does the cankerworm, whose whole body is almost entirely in its belly, signify if not gluttony? And what does the palmerworm, which ignites when it touches, signify if not anger? Therefore, what the caterpillar left, the locust has eaten, because often, when the vice of luxury has departed from the mind, vain glory follows, as one boasts of sanctity through chastity. Thus, while vices succeed vices, another pestilence devours the field of the mind, leaving another behind. Alternatively: The Assyrians under Shalmaneser, the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus of Syria, and the Roman Emperor Vespasian ravaged Judea. Alternatively: These four pests signify the four kinds of vices by which human souls are corrupted; for they fear, desire, grieve, and rejoice.
Wake up, drunkards, and weep, and wail, all you drinkers of wine, because it has been cut off from your mouth.

6
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:18,678
Those who are confident in the love of this world are called drunkards because they do not feel the evils they suffer.

7
00:02:18,678 --> 00:04:00,092
What does it mean to say, "Wake up, drunkards, and weep," except: Shake off the dream of your insensitivity, and with lamentations, confront the devastation of the heart caused by so many vices following one after another? For a strong and countless nation has come up against my land; its teeth are like the teeth of a lion, and its molars like those of a young lion. The strong and countless nation signifies demons, which ascend not over heaven, that is, the spiritual, but over the earth, that is, the carnal.
He has made my vineyard a desert and stripped my fig tree: laying it bare, he has thrown it away, and its branches have become white. The vineyard is called the people of the Lord, and the fig tree signifies the Israelite people. The devil has stripped the fig tree because he has stripped the Jewish people of all glory. Its branches have become white because its priests and teachers appear outwardly white through hypocrisy.
Mourn like a virgin clothed in sackcloth for the husband of your youth. O wretched people, or soul, who were joined to your spouse, that is, Christ, as to a husband, and defiled by demons, you have become an adulteress. Mourn like a virgin, that is, do penance. The sacrifice and the drink offering have perished from the house of the Lord; the priests, the ministers of the Lord, mourn. The house of the Lord refers to the Jewish people or the soul, which, stripped by adversary powers, is deprived of all sacrifice of justice.
The land is desolated, the ground mourns, for the grain is destroyed, the wine is confounded, and the oil languishes. This is what David says: "There is no one who does good, not even one." Grain, wine, and oil signify the gifts of the charisms, which in the Jewish people, or in other souls, have been dissipated by the devil through a degenerate life.
The farmers are ashamed, the vine dressers wail over the wheat, the wine, and the barley, because the harvest of the field has perished.

8
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:07,774
Farmers or vine growers are like angels, or rather teachers and scholars, who lament when they see the souls entrusted to them falling to carnal passions.

9
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:09,607
The harvest signifies the human race.

10
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:19,814
The vineyard is in disarray, and the fig tree has withered; the pomegranate, the palm tree, the apple tree, and all the trees of the field have dried up because joy has disappeared from the children of men.

11
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:23,381
The vineyard or fig tree represents the Jewish people mentioned earlier.

12
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:29,971
The pomegranate and other trees signify the different gifts of grace, which are taken away from humanity by evil powers through vice.

13
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:33,241
Gird yourselves and lament, priests; wail, ministers of the altar.

14
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:39,484
Come in and lie in sackcloth, ministers of my God, because the sacrifice and libation have perished from the house of our God.

15
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:45,826
This is an exhortation to the leaders of the Church to mourn for their people, through the education of those entrusted to them.

16
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:51,822
The house of God refers to the Church, or the soul from which the gifts of God have been lost through negligence of life.

17
00:04:51,822 --> 00:05:00,047
Sanctify a fast, call an assembly, gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of our God, and cry out to the Lord:
Alas, alas for the day!

18
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:04,159
For the day of the Lord is near, and it will come as devastation from the Almighty.

19
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,132
This means: sanctify your fast, combined with other virtues.

20
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:14,812
Elders and inhabitants of the land refer to teachers and listeners gathered in the Church through faith; the day of the Lord refers to the day of judgment.

21
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:19,172
Has not the food perished before your eyes, joy and gladness from the house of your God?

22
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:24,523
For as sins and vices grow, mourning replaces joy; the house of God is understood as the Church or the soul.

23
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,406
The animals have rotted in their dung.

24
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:30,518
To rot in their dung means that carnal men end their lives in the stench of luxury.

25
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:35,077
The granaries are destroyed, the storehouses are broken down, because the wheat is confused.

26
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:41,518
Granaries or storehouses signify the minds of the faithful, where the grain of justice and the wine of wisdom were usually stored.

27
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,243
Why has the animal groaned, the herds of cattle moaned?

28
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,257
Because there is no pasture for them, and even the flocks of sheep have perished.

29
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:54,100
What he meant by animals and herds was that people are knowledgeable but ignorant of God's teachings.

30
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,685
The cattle represent the nations.

31
00:05:55,685 --> 00:06:01,883
The pastures failed because the dryness of God's word has taken over everything, and with the rain stopping, everything dried up.

32
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:05,727
The flocks were scattered because there are no shepherds to teach them properly.

33
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:11,828
To you, Lord, I cry out because fire has consumed the beauty of the desert, and flames have burned all the trees of the region.

34
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:19,804
Even the wild animals look up to you as if they were a thirsty land needing rain, for the water sources have dried up, and fire has devoured the beauty of the desert.

35
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:35,514
Fire represents the devil, the desert represents this world, the beauty of the desert represents people or the glory of this age, the trees of the region represent the nations consumed by the devil, and the wild animals of the field represent the nations who, after committing evil deeds, have turned to God and seek His mercy.

36
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:40,943
The water sources symbolize the knowledge of the law, which has dried up among the Jewish people due to unbelief.

37
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,623
Chapter Two

38
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:52,830
Blow the trumpet in Zion, cry out on my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, because the day of the Lord is coming, it is near - a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and whirlwind.

39
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:01,924
The clear voice is the proclamation of the Gospel, and Zion represents the Church or the soul; the inhabitants of the land are the carnal people, whom it terrifies and calls to repentance.

40
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:10,631
The day of judgment will be like a day of darkness and gloom for those who are to suffer punishment, similar to the day of darkness and gloom due to the condemnation of the wicked.

41
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:16,484
But, because all past deeds will be revealed by the justice of the judgment, it is also compared to the light of the sun.

42
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:25,723
Like the dawn spreading over the mountains, a large and powerful people, such as has never been from the beginning, and after them, there will be none for generations and generations to come.

43
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:40,766
The large and powerful people symbolize the multitude of demons and the impious, which from the beginning, that is from Adam until the end of the world, will be destroyed in judgment and will not exist forever, because after that day of judgment, there will be no more ascension or descent, as Origen suggested.

44
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:44,007
In front of them, a consuming fire and behind them a burning flame.

45
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:49,328
Wherever they enter, the army of demons immediately makes it a desert and burns up the flowers of all virtues.

46
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:54,939
The land before them is like the Garden of Eden, and behind them, a desolate wilderness, and no one can escape them.

47
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:06,742
Before a person sins by their persuasion and is without sin, they are like the Garden of Eden; but once they are caught and led into sin, it makes them a desolate wilderness, so that there is no one, or rarely anyone, who can escape their trap.

48
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:10,563
Their appearance is like the appearance of horses, and like horsemen, they run.

49
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:13,030
The horse is the person, the horseman is the devil.

50
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,447
Like the appearance of horses is the appearance of the impious, through whom the devil persecutes the righteous.

51
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:24,059
The devil's chariot consists of the four passions described under the name of plagues at the beginning of this book.

52
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:31,314
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains, they leap, like the noise of a flame devouring stubble, like a strong people prepared for battle.

53
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:35,242
Straw, light, and unproductive people, consumed by the devil's fire.

54
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:38,444
In his presence, nations will suffer, and all faces will turn pale.

55
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:46,234
When the nations start to be dragged with him into punishment, and the devil gains control over them, they will run like strong men, like warriors climbing a wall.

56
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,010
Unfortunate is that city, which represents the soul, captured by such an enemy.

57
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,595
When anyone enters it, running eagerly over the wall of virtues, they mock.

58
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:58,087
And when they enter the house of conscience, if they find any good there, they destroy it all.

59
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,194
A man will walk in his own ways and will not turn from his paths.

60
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,106
Each one will not constrain his brother.

61
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:04,874
Everyone will walk in their own path.

62
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:07,646
But they will also fall through windows and not be broken.

63
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:10,514
They will enter the city, run on the wall, and climb houses.

64
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:17,874
For those in whom the devil has taken power, entering through the senses of the flesh like through windows, he plunders, taking away what he finds inside.

65
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:22,223
But if anyone forbids him from entering, the building of good works will not be demolished.

66
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:27,624
They will enter through windows like a thief, meaning demons will secretly enter through our senses like thieves.

67
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:33,694
The earth trembled before him, the heavens were moved, the sun and moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their brightness.

68
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:41,246
At the face of this demonic people, or even the Antichrist, the earth trembled, representing sinners; the heavens were moved, representing the spiritual ones.

69
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:47,315
The sun and moon were darkened because the faith of Christ and the Church will fail in the hearts of some under the Antichrist.

70
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:52,716
And the Lord gave his voice before his army because his camps are very many, and they are strong and do his word.

71
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,536
Divine preaching will precede the advent of the Antichrist.

72
00:09:55,536 --> 00:10:04,426
The camps of demons are therefore called the camps of the Lord because in every necessity they serve his law both for the testing of the righteous and for the condemnation of the wicked.

73
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:07,963
For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible, and who can endure it?

74
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:11,404
This is understood in two ways in Scriptures: either no one or very few.

75
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:17,401
Now therefore, says the Lord: Turn to me with all your heart, with fasting, weeping, and mourning.

76
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:23,312
The Lord's call to humanity for repentance begins with fasting because fasting is the foundation of true repentance.

77
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,656
Accompanying fasting are weeping and mourning.

78
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:34,065
Tear your hearts, not your clothes, and turn to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and rich in love, ready to relent from punishment.

79
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:38,141
This message is for those who show repentance outwardly but not in their hearts.

80
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:46,855
Let not the sinner despair because of the magnitude of their sins; the Lord's kindness and mercy promise that He does not punish immediately but gives room for repentance.

81
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,218
Who knows if He will turn and forgive and leave a blessing behind?

82
00:10:50,218 --> 00:10:52,817
A sacrifice and drink offering to the Lord our God.

83
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:59,951
He promises forgiveness for each sin, but without certainty, so as not to encourage negligence in the penitent, and leave a blessing behind.

84
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:05,862
First, a blessing that dispels the curse, then a sacrifice and drink offering, which are good works that please God.

85
00:11:05,862 --> 00:11:15,034
Blow the trumpet in Zion, declare a holy fast, call a sacred assembly, gather the people: sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, even nursing infants.

86
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:19,468
He repeats this again so that by frequently hearing the teaching, they may turn to God.

87
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:27,010
The gathering of the people is the assembly of the faithful in the Church through Christ; the diversity of ages signifies the distinction of merits.

88
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,067
Let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber.

89
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:34,653
Between the porch and the altar, let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep and say.

90
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:41,176
The bridegroom is Christ, coming forth from His chamber, that is, from the bosom of the Father, to the public of the human race.

91
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:45,915
The bride is His flesh, coming forth from the womb of the Virgin Mary as if from her chamber.

92
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:49,278
The bridegroom is the divine word, the bride is the faithful soul.

93
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,966
The priests, the ministers of the Lord, are the apostles, interceding for the people's sins.

94
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:59,775
Spare, Lord, spare your people, and do not give your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them.

95
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:04,419
This means that He sent someone to deliver them, and He spared His people.

96
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:10,131
With the coming of Christ, He granted forgiveness of sins so that the nations, or demons, would not rule over them.

97
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,061
Therefore, among the peoples, they say: Where is their God?

98
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,842
The Lord was zealous for His land and spared His people.

99
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,624
He is said to be zealous because zeal is a sign of love.

100
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:26,769
The response of the Lord, His promise through the books of the law and the prophets: Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be filled with them.

101
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,501
I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations.

102
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:42,564
The grain is Christ, who in Zechariah is called the grain of the chosen ones; the wine represents the grace of the Holy Spirit; and the oil signifies the charisms, which are poured out from Christ by the gift of the Holy Spirit into the hearts of the chosen ones.

103
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:45,494
This means: by my blessing, I will wipe away the old curse.

104
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:51,206
And him who is from the north, I will cast far away from you, and I will drive him into a barren and desolate land.

105
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:56,620
The north refers to the devil; the barren and desolate land refers to all the reprobates over whom he reigns.

106
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,345
His face turned toward the eastern sea, and its end toward the western sea.

107
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:05,808
The devil does not face the sun of righteousness, but wherever he looks, he always sees the sea of this world.

108
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:09,235
The eastern and western seas symbolize the beginning of his downfall.

109
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:13,705
And his stench will rise up, and his corruption will rise up, because he acted arrogantly.

110
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:19,814
When this same devil is slain at the end of the world, then his stench, that is, what he truly is, will be apparent to all.

111
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:23,986
Do not be afraid, land; rejoice and be glad, because the Lord has done great things.

112
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:29,003
Do not be afraid, animals of the field, because the beautiful places of the wilderness have sprouted.

113
00:13:29,003 --> 00:13:35,062
This signifies His plan for the salvation of the human race, that from their substance the Son of God would take on flesh.

114
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:38,638
What was previously cursed, He now says is restored with God's blessing.

115
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:44,698
The animals of the field are the nations to whom the word of power, that is, Christ, was brought forth through the Virgin.

116
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,068
Because the tree brought forth its fruit, the fig tree and the vine gave their strength.

117
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:58,067
And you, children of Zion, rejoice and be glad in the Lord your God, who has given you a teacher of righteousness, and He will make the early rain come down to you.

118
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:17,375
The tree, Christ, is truly understood as the Holy Spirit in the form of a fig tree; the vineyard is also Christ among the faithful people; the children of Zion are called the children of the Church established in the vision of faith; the teacher of righteousness, Christ, chosen by God the Father for His Church; the early and late rain, the blessing of both Testaments divinely bestowed in Christ.

119
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:22,469
And the threshing floors will be filled with grain, and the wine presses will overflow with wine and oil.

120
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:34,985
That is, in Christ, or in the beginning of the spiritual kingdom, the threshing floors of the Church are filled with the believing people, or the hearts of the chosen ones are overflowing with various virtues through the rain of the grace of the Holy Spirit.

121
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:40,564
And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the palmerworm.

122
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,601
My great strength, which I sent among you.

123
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:49,199
These four pests signify the four disturbances through which the devil devours the human race, that is: desire and fear, joy and sorrow.

124
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,389
And you will eat and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has done wonders with you.

125
00:14:54,389 --> 00:15:01,909
For all who read the Scriptures carnally, like the Jews, and do not reach spiritual understanding, these are the ones who eat and never reach satisfaction.

126
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:08,215
And you will praise the name of the Lord your God, that is: if you have attained the mercy of God through spiritual understanding.

127
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:15,540
And my people will not be put to shame forever, and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, that is, in the midst of those seeing God by faith.

128
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,294
And I am the Lord your God, and there is no other, and my people will not be put to shame forever.

129
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,369
I am Christ, and I am your Lord, the same Christ, and there is no one beyond Christ.

130
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:30,336
And it will come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh, and your sons and daughters will prophesy.

131
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,635
Your old men will dream dreams, and your young men will see visions.

132
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,352
The old men, He calls prophets, the young men, apostles.

133
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,785
But I will pour out my spirit on my servants and maidservants in those days.

134
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:43,662
This was clearly stated and fulfilled according to history.

135
00:15:43,662 --> 00:16:51,286
By "my servants," he means spiritual men and teachers; by "maidservants," he refers to churches or the souls of believers.
And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth: blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
The wonders in the heavens refer to the saints, and on the earth, they refer to sinners, which the Lord promises to reveal. And what are these wonders but signs and the destruction of sinners, revealed with the coming of the Holy Spirit? Blood signifies the killing of souls; fire signifies the heat of the body or the anger of the heart; columns of smoke signify harmful thoughts that boil in the hearts of men.
According to history and prophecy, all these were fulfilled during the time of Christ's passion.
The sun will be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.
This means the brightness of some of the faithful will fail in the final tribulation and the Church will be stained with the blood of martyrs.
And it will be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. To call on and declare the Lord's name must be proven not only by voice but by action and result.
For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be salvation, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors whom the Lord calls. We understand Mount Zion and Jerusalem to mean the Church, in which there will be salvation, as he said.

136
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,727
Chapter Three

137
00:16:52,727 --> 00:17:03,315
In those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
the first will be the holy apostles, or others who believed from among the circumcised, while the rest will come from the Gentiles.

138
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:08,239
I will gather all nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where I will judge them.

139
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:10,357
Jehoshaphat means the Judgment of the Lord.

140
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:17,103
So this is what He says: When I have shown mercy to those who confess my name, I will bring all my adversaries to the valley of judgment.

141
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,043
All nations could mean all unbelieving nations, or it could refer to all demons.

142
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:26,213
Against my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations and divided my land.

143
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:34,782
This means, I will not oppress them on the day of judgment, but by reason of justice, or even by their own confession, they will recognize themselves as worthy of punishment.

144
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:36,407
And they cast lots for my people.

145
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:39,411
This means, they eagerly wanted to rule over each individual.

146
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:42,464
They put a boy in a brothel and sold a girl for wine to drink.

147
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:52,411
Here, He complains about their actions, that even the strongest, those who could grow into virtues, have been emasculated with injustices, and the strong souls have been subjected to lust and pleasures.

148
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:56,745
But what have you to do with me, Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of the Philistines?

149
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,321
Will you repay me for something?

150
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:03,590
Tyre means trouble or distress, Sidon means hunting, that is, demons: Philistines, those who fall by drink.

151
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:18,018
All these must be understood as referring to heretics, through whom the devil has separated the people of God from the Church, and through their eloquence, like gold and silver, leading the simple ones out of the Church, selling them under sin to the sons of the Greeks, that is, the Gentiles.

152
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:23,189
And if you seek revenge against me, swiftly and quickly I will return the recompense upon your own heads.

153
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:28,409
You took my silver and gold, and brought my precious and beautiful things into your temples.

154
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:36,251
You sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the sons of Greece, sending them far from their borders and leading them into sin, away from the faith of the Church.

155
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:42,095
Behold, I will raise them from the place where you sold them, and I will turn your retribution back upon your own heads.

156
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:51,399
I will restore those who were torn from the foundation of the Church to their former state of faith, and I will bring vengeance upon your heads, the heads of the heretics who led them astray.

157
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:58,364
I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the sons of Judah, meaning those you have taken from the Church will rise up against you.

158
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:03,819
Your sons and daughters, meaning your disciples, will be brought into subjection by the preachers of the Church.

159
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:07,813
They will sell them to the Sabeans, a distant nation, because the Lord has spoken.

160
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,346
Saba means conversion, while Judah means confession.

161
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:15,411
The Sabeans are called a distant nation because the saints who rule over the heretics will live forever.

162
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,675
Proclaim this among the nations, prepare for war, rouse the strong.

163
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:23,789
O leaders, meaning teachers, call out to those who are subject to you, for the day of judgment is coming.

164
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,591
Let all the warriors come and ascend.

165
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,124
Let the foot soldiers come, let the horsemen ascend.

166
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,631
The horses are the wicked men, and the horsemen are the devil or demons.

167
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:35,187
These are called warriors who usually subdue the human race through vice.

168
00:19:35,187 --> 00:20:02,317
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, "I am strong."
Remove, says the Lord, O you demons, all peace into sedition, and let all rise to war.
Let the weak say, "I am strong."
To say in Scriptures means to complete by action.
And when you have done all these evils, and come with all your strength to fight against my chosen ones, then on the day of judgment, I will lay low all your strength.
Burst forth and come, all nations; gather together from all around.
There the Lord will bring down your strong ones.

169
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:12,984
This means that when the day of the Lord comes and the end of the world approaches, Satan will unleash all his power during the times of the Antichrist and will fight more fiercely to tempt and overthrow souls.

170
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:15,539
Nations will rise and go to the valley of Jehoshaphat.

171
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:22,447
But they are not judged on the mountains or plains, but in the depths below, so that the place of judgment itself becomes the place of punishment.

172
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:25,238
For there, I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.

173
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:28,030
God's sitting signifies the habit and authority of judging.

174
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,112
Put in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe.

175
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:34,323
This speaks to the angels, for the reapers are the angels, and the harvest is the people.

176
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:38,676
In a way, the angels descend from their high place when they take on the roles of torturers.

177
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:43,550
Come and descend, for the winepress is full; the vats overflow because their wickedness has multiplied.

178
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,748
The world, or the winepress, is already overflowing with iniquities, and it can no longer contain the wickedness of the human race.

179
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,479
People, people in the valley of decision, for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

180
00:20:54,479 --> 00:21:00,063
He did not say judgment to avoid giving the impression of doubt, but he used decision, from which nothing can be left.

181
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:03,895
The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their brightness.

182
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,882
The sun is Christ; the moon is the Church.

183
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:10,094
And the stars of Christ have withdrawn their brightness from those who will be tormented.

184
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:13,784
For those who go into punishment will not deserve to see the light of justice.

185
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:22,301
And the Lord will roar from Zion and give his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth will shake, that is, from the Church of the saints or from the heavenly Jerusalem.

186
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:26,843
For just as all animals are terrified at the roar of a lion, so will all be afraid of his voice.

187
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:30,723
And the Lord is the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel.

188
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:35,597
And you will know that I am the Lord your God, that is, of those who believe and see God through faith.

189
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,347
Dwelling in Zion on my holy mountain.

190
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:41,984
The holy mountain can be understood as either the heavenly Jerusalem or certainly the Son himself.

191
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:45,486
And Jerusalem will be holy, and foreigners will no longer pass through it.

192
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:49,791
Whether it is the heavenly Jerusalem or the Church, they will no longer have power over it.

193
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,517
They are recognized as strangers.

194
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:58,818
On that day, the mountains will drip with sweetness, the hills will flow with milk, and water will stream through all of Judah.

195
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,738
The mountains and hills, representing the diversity of merits, are called holy.

196
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:07,848
The sweetness represents the words of Scripture, and the streams signify the hearts of the chosen ones.

197
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:10,131
Water symbolizes the grace of the Holy Spirit.

198
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:14,150
A fountain will emerge from the house of the Lord, watering the valley of thorns.

199
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:22,684
This fountain represents the divinity of the Son of God or the Holy Spirit, and the valley of thorns symbolizes the sins of humanity, which will be purified by their grace.

200
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:30,870
Egypt will be desolate, and Edom will become a desert of destruction because they acted unjustly against the children of Judah and shed innocent blood in their land.

201
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,351
Egypt represents darkness, meaning demons or sins.

202
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:39,851
Edom signifies blood or earthly pleasures, which will be desolated on the day of judgment for deceiving the children of the Church.

203
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,374
Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem for generations to come.

204
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:47,988
I will cleanse their blood, which I had not cleansed before, and the Lord will dwell in Zion.

205
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:51,263
Judah, meaning the house of confession, will be inhabited forever.

206
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,431
Even though it is not entirely innocent in this life, it is tainted with minor sins.

207
00:22:55,431 --> 00:23:00,789
I will cleanse everything through my abundant mercy, which they could not achieve through their own virtues.

208
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,575
Zion is interpreted as a watchtower.

209
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:06,694
Therefore, the Lord will dwell on high, in the Church, where He will reign forever.
