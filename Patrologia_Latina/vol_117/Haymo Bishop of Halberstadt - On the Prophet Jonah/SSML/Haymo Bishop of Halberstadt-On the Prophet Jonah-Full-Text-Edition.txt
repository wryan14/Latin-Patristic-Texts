On the Prophet Jonah
by
Haymo Bishop of Halberstadt

The Hebrews say that Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath, whom Elijah resurrected from the dead. When Elijah returned him to his mother, she worshiped and said, "Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is true." Because of this, Jonah was called the son of Amittai. Amittai means truth, and since Elijah spoke the truth, Jonah was called the son of truth. Some believe his tomb is in Gath, which is in Ophir, while others say he was born and buried in Lydda, also known as Diospolis.
The Book of Tobit mentions this prophet, where the father speaks to his son before dying. The destruction of Nineveh is near, for the word of the Lord does not fail. Initially, the people of Nineveh repented and received mercy from the Lord at Jonah's preaching. However, they later reverted to their old ways and were overthrown as foretold, during the reign of Josiah among the Hebrews and Astyages among the Medes.

Chapter One

The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amittai, saying:
Arise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach in it, because its wickedness has come up before me.
The phrase "its wickedness has come up before me," or as the Septuagint puts it, "the cry of its wickedness is shown before me," means that they sinned shamelessly, without any reverence or fear.
This is similar to what is said about the Sodomites: "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has come to me."
A sin with a voice is hidden; a sin with a cry is evident and public.
Mystically, Jonah, which means dove, signifies Christ, who is simple and meek, upon whom the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.
Jonah also means sorrowful, because he grieved over the impending destruction of Jerusalem.
That he signifies Christ, the Lord himself testifies in the Gospel, saying: "Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights."
He is the son of Amittai, meaning God, because God is truth.
He is sent to Nineveh, which means beautiful, representing the world, the most beautiful thing visible to carnal eyes.
Hence, it received its name from adornment in Greek.
For the Jews had despised God's commandments, Jonah, meaning Christ, is sent to Nineveh, meaning the nations, so that the whole world believing in him might be saved.
The wickedness of Nineveh that came up to the Lord is the will always inclined to evil, and especially the worship of idols, to which, forsaking the Creator, the world devoted itself most eagerly.
And Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.
He fled not out of envy for the salvation of the Ninevites, but unwilling for the Jews, his people, to perish.
For he knew that the repentance of the Gentiles would be the downfall of the Jews.
Besides, he saw other prophets sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel to provoke the people to repentance, and therefore he grieved that he was chosen to be sent to the Assyrians, enemies of Israel.
He also knew by prophetic spirit that when the Gentiles received the knowledge of God, Israel would be rejected.

So, knowing it would happen someday, he feared it might happen in his time. He wanted to flee to Tarshish, just as Cain fled from the presence of the Lord. Josephus believes Tarshish is the city of Tarsus in Cilicia, where the Apostle Paul was from, which is why Paul was called a Tarsian. However, the Hebrews generally refer to the sea as Tarshish.
Therefore, the prophet did not aim to flee to a specific place. By boarding a ship, he wanted to escape wherever he could, not caring where fate would take him. A fugitive does not choose his destination. Since it is written in the Psalm: "God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel," he thought he could flee from God, who was only known in Judah. But when he recognized God through the storm, he confessed: "I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
Mystically: Our Jonah, that is Christ, fled to Tarshish by leaving his homeland, which is heaven. Taking on flesh, he entered the sea of this world and loved the people from whom he took flesh so much that he did not refuse to suffer, so that Nineveh, representing the Gentile people, might be saved, and the Synagogue would not perish. Hence, he also said to the Father: "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me;" and, while on the cross, he prayed for those who cried out: "Crucify, crucify," saying: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
And he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. Joppa is a port in Judea, where Hiram, king of Tyre, used to transport wood from Lebanon on rafts, which was then carried by land to Jerusalem. So Jonah, coming from the mountains of Judea to the coastal and flat areas, is rightly said to have gone down. He paid the fare and went down into the ship, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. The fare represents the passage. It is said that he went down into the ship to show that, like a fugitive, he penetrated into the depths of the ship, seeking hiding places. Tarshish is interpreted as contemplation of joy, Joppa as beautiful.

Mystically, however, Jonah—that is, Christ—left the mountains and descended to Joppa. When he was being persecuted in Judea, as we read in the Gospel, he passed into the regions of Tyre and Sidon, which are cities of the Gentiles. These cities, allotted to Israel, are rightly represented by Joppa, which means "beautiful."
The Lord came to Tarshish, meaning contemplation of joy, because he was contemplating the salvation of the world, which he had predestined before the ages. The salvation of the world is his joy. He descended to Joppa because, near his passion, he was working on the salvation of the beautiful Gentile people.
But because he came for the lost sheep of the house of Israel, he did not want to give the children's bread to the dogs. Therefore, he gave a fare to the sailors, whom we believe signify the Gentiles—a pledge of hoped-for salvation—so that he might first save the Jews to whom he came, and then save the Gentiles, as if they were inhabitants of the sea.
Thus, he is said to have descended to the interior and slept while the sea was raging, as if neglecting them. He seemed to neglect the Gentiles, whose salvation he was perfecting while sleeping on the cross and descending to the depths, as if to the lowest part of the ship. The Lord, however, sent a great wind on the sea, and there was a great storm, putting the ship in danger of being broken.
Jonah thought it would benefit him to board the ship and flee; but instead, both he and the ship were in danger of being broken because of him. For what is considered prosperous against God's will turns into destruction, and nothing is secure when God opposes it.
Mystically, that storm signifies the fury of the Jews, who were expecting him to die, shouting: "Crucify, crucify." The sailors feared and cried out to their god, and they threw the cargo from the ship into the sea to lighten it. The sailors, ignorant of the one true God, called upon their gods, knowing that nothing happens without God's providence.
From this, we understand that every human fears and feels God, even if they are led away from the one true God to many gods by false religions. They throw the cargo into the sea, done in extreme danger, so that the ship, made lighter, may more easily ride above the waves.

Jonah went down into the inner part of the ship and was sleeping deeply. While the sailors were troubled and calling upon their gods, Jonah remained calm and at ease, even to the point of sleeping. This shows the patience of a strong man who stands firm both in good times and in bad. It can also be said that knowing he was running away, he did not dare to see the waves that were punishing his escape. Or he was sleeping out of weariness, just as we read that the apostles were overwhelmed with sleep from sorrow during the Lord's passion.
The captain approached him and said: Why are you sleeping so soundly? Get up, call on your God. Maybe God will consider us, and we won't perish. It is natural for everyone in danger to hope for help from another. Thus, the captain, who should have been comforting others, woke up the sleeping Jonah to call upon God. Since the danger was shared, the prayer should be shared as well. In a metaphorical sense, before Christ suffered, many gods were worshiped by the nations. But after Christ died and the storm of the world was calmed, one God is worshiped, and spiritual sacrifices are offered to Him.
A man said to his companion: Come, let us cast lots. Because they saw a storm greater than usual, they understood it didn't happen naturally. They couldn't ignore the reasons for the winds and waves, having sailed for so long. Therefore, by casting lots, they sought the cause of the shipwreck. When they said: Let us know why this evil has come upon us, we should understand "evil" as affliction and calamity, as it is said in the Gospel: Each day has enough trouble of its own; and by the Prophet: If there is calamity in a city, has not the Lord caused it? For "evil" is also said to be contrary to virtue.
They cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. They said to him: Tell us why this evil has come upon us. What is your work? Where are you from and where are you going? Or from what people are you? They compelled him, whom the lot had revealed, to confess with his own voice. They asked about his identity, his region, his journey, and his city to understand the cause of their plight.

And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord God of heaven. Hebrew means passer-by. He does not say Jew, a name they began to be called after the ten tribes were divided from the two tribes. Instead, he says, I am a Hebrew, a foreigner and stranger, as the Psalmist mentions: They passed from nation to nation.
I fear the God of heaven, not the gods you invoke, who cannot save. He made the sea, in which I flee, and the dry land, from which I flee. I fear Him, the creator of the universe. However, he feared God with a servile fear, from whom he wanted to flee. This fear can also be understood as worship. I fear the God of heaven, that is, I worship Him.
And the men were greatly afraid, and said to him: What is this you have done? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because Jonah had told them. If you fear God, why do you flee, knowing you cannot escape His power? They do not scold him but ask, because they heard he was a Hebrew, and worshiped the God of heaven. Therefore, they seek from him, as from a holy man, the remedy for such a great evil.
And they said to him: What shall we do to you, that the sea may cease from us? For the sea was growing more tempestuous. Because of you, they said, the sea rises against us, because we received you as a fugitive. What then shall we do to you? Shall we kill you? But it is evil to kill a worshiper of God. What then do you command to be done? Tell us what we should do to appease God, whose anger we recognize through the storm.
The sea, he said, was seeking vengeance, pursuing the fugitive prophet. It was swelling, rising into greater waves, as if not delaying the Creator's vengeance. And he said to them: Take me and throw me into the sea, and the sea will cease for you. For I know that because of me this great storm has come upon you. Against me, he said, the storm rises. Throw me into the sea, that by my death you may live. Note the magnanimity of the fugitive: he does not dissemble, does not deny, but embraces the punishment so that the others might not perish because of him.

Let's interpret all of this symbolically as referring to the Lord Christ, against whom a storm from the Jews rose up during His passion. The sailors who asked what to do with Him are the apostles, who, abandoning Him during His passion, in some way left Him amidst the waves.
And the Lord speaks as if to say, because the world sees me sailing with you to Tarshish, which means towards the joy of contemplation, so that I may lead you to the joy where I am. Therefore, death rages and desires to devour me, not knowing that, just as a fish is caught on a hook, so shall death be defeated by my death. So, lift me up and throw me into the sea. You throw me. For we must not bring death upon ourselves, but endure it willingly when inflicted by others.
And the men rowed hard to return to dry land, but they could not, because the sea grew even stormier against them. Even though the prophet commanded them to throw him into the sea, they did not dare to lay hands on a servant of God. But symbolically, the Jews, who were the people of God, desired Christ's death, while the Gentiles did not want Him to die. They wanted to row to dry land, thinking the world could be saved without the sacrament of passion, even though Jonah’s submersion, which is Christ's passion, was the liberation of the ship (that is, the world).
And they cried out to the Lord, saying: We beseech you, Lord, let us not perish for this man's life, and do not lay innocent blood upon us, for you, Lord, have done as you pleased. As though saying: We do not want, Lord, to kill your prophet, but you, Lord, have done as you pleased. Your will is fulfilled through our hands. Therefore, do not lay innocent blood upon us.
This voice of the sailors seems to be Pilate's confession, who, having taken water, washed his hands and said: I am innocent of this man's blood. All of this was done by the Father's will, as it is said in the Psalm: I desire to do your will, my God. And they took Jonah and threw him into the sea. They took him, it says, with a certain respect and honor, not hurling him, and threw him into the sea. And the sea ceased from its raging.

It's like finding the one you've been searching for, chasing them with all your might, and when you finally catch up, you hold onto them tightly.
Mystically, before the Lord's passion, the world was threatened by waves of various errors. But after His death, we see everything calm, and the whole world rejoices in the secure unity of faith and the knowledge of truth. Just as Jonah was thrown into the sea, calming its turmoil, the world finds peace.
The men feared the Lord greatly; they offered sacrifices to the Lord and made vows. Before the Lord's passion, people cried out to their gods. After the passion, they fear the Lord, honoring Him not with small fear, but with great fear, as the law commands, to fear and love Him with all their heart and soul.
They offered sacrifices, not of animals, which they didn't have in the waves, but spiritual sacrifices—thanksgivings and praises. "Offer to God a sacrifice of praise," says the Psalmist, and the prophet: "Take away all iniquity, and receive good, and we will render the calves of our lips."

Chapter Two

And the Lord prepared a large fish to swallow Jonah.
In the Gospel, the Lord referred to the large fish as a whale, explaining the matter more briefly.
Regarding the preparation, it could mean that from the beginning, when He created it, as the Psalmist says: "This dragon that You formed"; or it could mean that He made it come near the ship to receive the cast-down Jonah into its belly.
Similarly, the Lord God the Father commanded hell, a very great dragon, to receive Jonah, that is, Christ, unaware of the hook of divinity hidden in the bait of flesh.
Thus, while it rejoiced in devouring, it lamented in regurgitating, according to the prophecy of Hosea: "I will be your death, O death; I will be your plague, O hell."
And Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.
The Lord Himself explained that this was fulfilled in Him.
It raises the question of how He was in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
We must understand this synecdochically, meaning taking the part for the whole, a common figure of speech in the divine Scriptures.
The Lord was crucified at the sixth hour of the preparation day, gave up His spirit at the ninth hour, and His body was taken down from the cross in the evening and placed in the tomb.
He lay there that night, the following Sabbath day, and the night after the Sabbath, rising on the morning of the first day of the week, as Mark testifies.
Thus, He lay in the tomb for thirty-six hours.
However, three days complete seventy-two hours.
If you count the preparation day, that is, Friday on which He died, as one day and night, the Sabbath with its night, and the night belonging to the Lord's day, referring to the beginning of the Lord’s day, it somehow appears to be three days.
This must be believed to hold great mystery.
For thirty-six is to seventy-two as simple is to double.
Our death is double because we die in the soul through sin and in the body through punishment.
But Christ's death was simple because He could only die in the body and never admitted death in the soul, as He never sinned.

And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish, and said:
The prophet, having been swallowed by the whale, felt safe and did not despair of God's mercy. He turned entirely to prayer, knowing that the Lord is especially present in times of trouble, as He promises to the righteous man, "I am with him in trouble; I will rescue him."
The same prophet says: "I cried out to the Lord in my distress, and He heard me." When he says, "I cried out," he is referring to when he saw the whale and its massive body. He cried out as the waters receded and gave way to his voice. Or he cried out with his whole heart's affection, as the Apostle says: "You have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry: Abba, Father."
He called the belly of the whale the "womb of the underworld," which was so large it was like the underworld itself. These words can be allegorically referred to Christ, who says through David: "You have delivered my soul from the lowest hell." For He was in hell alive, free among the dead. "I cried out from the belly of the underworld, and You heard my voice: and You cast me into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and the river surrounded me."
According to the literal sense, he was enclosed in the belly of the whale in the middle of the sea, and surrounded by rivers. But in the mystical sense, he says what has been foretold by the Psalmist: "I am sunk in the deep mire, where there is no standing."
By comparison, the heavenly dwelling, in which supreme peace reigns, is described as: "His place was made in peace." All earthly habitation is full of waves and storms. The heart of the sea designates hell, for which the Lord says: "The heart of the earth," because, just as the animal is in the middle, hell is said to be in the middle of the earth.
Or in the heart of the sea, the Lord complains of being cast out, that is, in the midst of temptations, but He did not feel the bitter waters; because, as the Apostle says: "He was tempted in every way, just as we are, yet was without sin."
For He does not say He was surrounded by seawater, but by a river, that is, fresh water: because He could be tempted outwardly, but the pleasure of sin did not bite His mind.

But he says he is cast down, as mentioned in the psalm, and the Apostle asserts that he was handed over by the Father. "All your waves and breakers have swept over me." The waves and breakers represent temptations and blows, which never occur without God's permission and will. However, these waves and breakers did not overwhelm Christ; they passed over him. He endured and overcame all the storms that tormented humanity, so that we might sail safely after him.
And I said, "I am cast out of your sight." Christ says this in his human nature. For he who took the form of a servant also uses its voice, stating he is cast out from the Father's sight. As if to say: When I was with you, O Father, and in your light, I was light, I did not complain of being cast out. But after I came into the depths and was surrounded by flesh, I suffer human feelings and say I am cast out, to bring justly cast out humans back to you, so that where I am, they also may be with me.
Nevertheless, I will look again toward your holy temple. According to the letter, Jonah says this either hoping or confidently promising himself that he will return to Jerusalem and see the Lord's temple again. According to the allegory, the Son of God, placed in the shame of his passion, promises himself the glory he always had with the Father and in the Father. Hence, in the Gospel, he said to the Father, "Glorify me, Father, with the glory I had with you before the world existed." Or he also longs for the Father's dwelling, because just as the Father is the temple of the Son, so the Son is the temple of the Father. For he says, "I am in the Father, and the Father is in me." And elsewhere, "I came from the Father and have come into the world." And because he is both God and man, he asks as a servant, promises as God.
"The waters surrounded me up to my soul; the deep engulfed me, the sea covered my head." He calls the deep the opposing forces, which are consigned to the deepest places of hell, that is, Tartarus, to which places the demons feared to go, asking the Lord in the Gospel not to send them into the abyss.

Depths surrounded Christ when the rulers of the underworld believed they had captured Him in death. I descended to the bottom of the mountains; the earth's bars closed upon me forever. The "bottom of the mountains" literally refers to the depths of the earth, which, by God's will, sustain the globe of the earth as if by bars, as it is said in the Psalm: "I established its pillars." Mystically, the soul, which rules the body, is the head of the Lord. Therefore, His head was covered by the sea when the soul He took for our salvation was weighed down by the burden of tribulation and death. The "bottom of the mountains" refers to the rulers of the underworld, who, thrown from heaven, were overwhelmed by waves of punishment and surrounded by the abyss, to which the Redeemer's soul descended, not to be held there, but to rescue His own from there. They are also the bars of the earth, like certain locks of the ultimate prison and punishments, always wanting to keep the souls they once accepted. The Lord was enclosed by these bars; but, as He foretold through Isaiah, He broke the bronze gates and shattered the iron bars. What follows: "and You will lift my life from corruption" refers to Jonah, who, though he should have been corrupted and digested in the belly of the whale, and spread through the veins and limbs of the fish, came out safe and whole. Hence, he speaks with a tone of affection: "O Lord my God," calling the common God of all his own God, whom he regarded as his God and Lord due to the greatness of such a benefit. But also mystically, the soul of Christ is lifted from corruption because His flesh did not see corruption, that is, it was not dissolved into decay in the tomb, as He foretold through the Psalmist, "You will not let your Holy One see corruption." Which the blessed Peter interprets about Christ in the Acts of the Apostles, "Who did not see corruption, glorified by the swiftest resurrection." But it can be questioned what he says elsewhere: "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to corruption?"

But here, corruption refers to the wounds and injuries that Christ's flesh endured. It's as if he's saying, "What good is it that I suffer from these nails and wounds if the Jews are not saved?" In this context, corruption means decay and dissolution.
When my soul was in distress, I remembered the Lord. When I had no other hope, remembering the Lord was my salvation. Similarly, the Psalmist says, "I remembered God, and was delighted." This teaches us that when our soul is overwhelmed by tribulation, or when it feels separated from the body, we should keep God in our memory and turn all our thoughts to Him, the God of both body and soul.
May my prayer come to You in Your holy temple. That's why I remembered the Lord, so that my prayer from the farthest mountains might reach Your holy temple, which means heaven. Although God is everywhere, He enjoys eternal happiness there with the angels attending Him. He speaks as a priest, asking that the people's prayers, through him, may reach God's temple. Our Redeemer also prayed during His passion, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew 26:39). And when He was on the cross, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34).
Those who hold onto worthless things forsake Your mercy. The prophet's remarkable magnanimity, even in the belly of a great beast, reflects on human frailty. God, by nature merciful, is ready to show mercy to all. But through our own fault, we lose the mercy that is freely offered to us. Notice he didn't say, "those who do worthless things," because everyone does vain things, which is to say, everyone sins, since "all living humanity is entirely vanity" (Psalm 39:5). Instead, he says "hold onto," meaning they love and cling to these things in their hearts. Such people forsake their mercy, which is God, of whom it is said: "The Lord is compassionate and merciful" (Psalm 103:8) and elsewhere: "My God, my mercy" (Psalm 59:17). He doesn't say, "they are forsaken by their mercy," but that they forsake the mercy that is prepared and freely offered to them.

What is specifically said about the Jews, who, keeping vanities—that is, the very vain precepts of the Pharisees—abandoned God, who has always shown them mercy.
But I, with a voice of praise, will sacrifice to you: whatever I have vowed, I will repay to the Lord for my salvation.
The prophet, encouraged by good hope and already confident in his liberation, promises to offer thanks and fulfill all his vows.
And Christ the Lord, who died for our lives, certain that God would quickly raise him, joyfully promises to sacrifice himself to the Father with a voice of confession.
"Our Passover," says the Apostle, "Christ has been sacrificed."
He himself is both the high priest and the lamb sacrificed for everyone, so that everything the Father has given him will not perish forever.
And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
God the Father commanded the great fish, the inferno, to restore the Savior to the earth, that is, to solid and immortal life, because: rising from the dead, he dies no more; death will no longer have dominion over him.
But that it is said "vomited" shows that from the depths of death’s recesses, as from the innermost parts of the fish, Christ has emerged alive.

Chapter Three

The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying:
Get up, go to the great city of Nineveh, and preach to it the message that I tell you.
He is not reprimanded, nor is he asked, "Why didn't you do what I commanded?"
The harsh correction of the shipwreck and being swallowed was enough. A servant is not blamed after being punished.
Mystically, our Lord, who was sent to save Nineveh, that is, the Gentiles, in a way wanted to flee, refusing the suffering, and saying:
"Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me."
Now, after those for whom He did not want to suffer cried out, "Crucify, crucify," and, "We have no king but Caesar,"
having been returned from the belly of the fish, that is, resurrected from the dead, He is again directed to Nineveh to preach after the resurrection what had been commanded to Him by the Father before the passion.
All this that is commanded to Him, that He obeys, that He does not want, and again is forced to want, is to be referred to the form of a servant.
And Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. He arose, it says, and made no delay, but immediately prepared to obey.
And Nineveh was a great city, a three-day journey in extent. Nineveh, a city founded by Ninus, son of Belus, the first king of the Assyrians, is said to have such a circumference that it takes three days to travel around it.
But Jonah, now corrected and remembering the shipwreck he had endured, completed the journey of three days with the haste of one day.
Some think that he preached only in a third part of the city, and thus the word of the preaching reached everyone.
And the Son of God rose from the dead, and in the apostles went to Nineveh, that is, to all the ends of the world, in a journey of three days, because He commanded that they baptize the nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
But this journey of three days is one way, because there is one God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Hence, not in the names, but in the name of the Trinity, which is one God, the sacrament of baptism is performed, not so much by the apostles as by the Lord, whom Jonah prefigured.

It's important to note that, while three days are mentioned, there's no mention of night because in the Holy Trinity, nothing is obscure or dark.
Jonah began to enter the city, taking a one-day journey, and he cried out, "In forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown."
The number forty is significant for sinners in fasting and affliction. Moses and Elijah fasted for forty days, and the Lord Himself, the true Jonah, was sent into the world to preach, consecrating this period as a fast.
Notice it was said, "he cried out." We also read about the Lord standing in the temple, crying out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink."
Every word of Christ is a great cry because it announces great things.
The men of Nineveh believed in the Lord, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.
The older people believed in the Lord, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth.
What's hidden, like fasting, comes before what's visible, like sackcloth.
Such a diet and clothing are fitting for those doing penance. It's right that those who offended God with luxury and the ambition of precious garments now please Him with fasting and sackcloth.
The older generation begins, followed by the younger, because no one is without sin, not even a one-day-old infant.
The word reached the king of Nineveh. He arose from his throne, took off his garments, put on sackcloth, sat in ashes, and cried out, declaring in Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, "Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; and let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry out mightily to God. Let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence in his hands. Who knows if God will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we may not perish?"
We should understand the king of Nineveh as the philosophers of the Gentiles: Plato, Aristotle, and others, who are like kings among men, and whose teachings are observed as if they were divine oracles.

The word finally reached these people because they were the last to believe and found it harder to do so. They thought it foolish that God could become a man and die. Yet, even these people, though late, accepted the Lord's faith. They put aside the adornments of words and the pomp of secular teachings, and began to follow the simple and rustic teachings of the fishermen.
The phrase “men and animals” means both rational and irrational beings, because all kinds of people, both those who used reason and those who lived like brute animals, turned to repentance and faith in Christ. They wore sackcloth, which represents mourning and sorrow, taken by those grieving the losses of their past lives.
The psalmist shows that sackcloth signifies mourning by saying, "You removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy." Indeed, according to the letter, those who doubted said, "Who knows if God will turn and relent?" They spoke ambiguously to act more fervently in repentance, uncertain about salvation, and to provoke God more towards mercy.
And God saw their deeds, that they turned from their evil ways, and God relented concerning the disaster which He had declared He would bring upon them, and He did not do it. Just as He did for the city of Assyria, that is Nineveh, so God threatens destruction to the whole world daily, so that they may repent. If the world turns, the Lord turns; and if sinners change their lives, He will change His judgment. Here, as above, malice should be understood as affliction and punishment.

Chapter Four

Jonah was deeply distressed and angry.
Seeing many Gentiles entering and realizing the prophecy in Deuteronomy was being fulfilled, "They provoked me with what was not God, and I will provoke them with what is not a people," he despaired over Israel's salvation and grieved, not because he envied the Gentiles' salvation, but because Israel was perishing.
Our Lord also wept over the perishing Jerusalem and did not want to give the children's bread to the dogs, and the apostles were commanded to preach first to Israel.
Therefore, Jonah grieved deeply, lamenting the loss of the people for whom he suffered.
He prayed to the Lord, saying, "Please, Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my own land?
This is why I tried to flee to Tarshish.
For I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, slow to anger, abundant in loving-kindness, and relenting from disaster."
Jonah's prayer was partly a plea and partly a complaint, expressing his reluctance to flee.
But starting with a plea, he tempered his complaint.
"Please, Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my own land?
I knew," he said, "that you were merciful; I did not want to announce you as harsh and cruel, and that is why I wanted to flee."
Even the Lord Christ, when he saw the Jews obstinate in their own destruction, seemed to say to God the Father, "Did I not know what would come, that Israel would perish, when I was still with you, Father?
And through Isaiah, I said, 'I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity.'"
And now, Lord, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.
Because I could not save one nation, Israel, let me die, and the whole world will be saved.
And the Lord said, "Do you have good reason to be angry?"
Jonah was angry either because he felt he had lied to the Ninevites or because he understood that Israel would perish.
The Lord does not say, "You are wrong to be angry," so as not to seem to reproach the sorrowful; nor does he say, "You are right to be angry," so as not to contradict his own judgment.

He then asks him the reasons for his sorrow, so he may answer, or if he remains silent, that he may confirm God's judgment with his silence.
Jonah went out of the city, sat to the east, made himself a shelter, and sat under it in the shade to see what would happen to the city.
When a city is in distress, it symbolizes trust in earthly hope and worldly desires.
Cain, who stained the world with fratricide, is said to be the first to have built a city.
Therefore, Jonah leaves the city. He is called a dove or one who grieves because everyone who is simple and sorrowful for their sins distances themselves from worldly desires, places no hope in worldly vanities, but lives facing the east, waiting for the rising of the true sun and its regard.
He lives in a shelter, that is, in the guarding of his mind, as if resting in a tent, contemplating and waiting to see what would happen to the city of Nineveh (that is, what will happen to the world).
About this city, the Lord says through Hosea: "I am the Holy One among you, and I will not enter the city."
In Deuteronomy, one of the cities of refuge is called Ramoth, which means vision of death.
For he who is cast out of Jerusalem, which means vision of peace, dwells in Ramoth, that is, in the vision of death.
Mystically, before the sun arose and the vine withered—that is, before the world was redeemed by the shining Gospel and the Jewish people were rejected—our Jonah, that is, Christ, was in the shade because the truth had not yet appeared, but everything was done in types and figures.
It is said that he sat in the posture of a judge, either because he was sitting as a judge, or because he had humbled himself and contracted the majesty of his divinity into a certain brevity.
For one who sits appears shorter than one who stands.
But when it is said that he sat to see, let us refer this to the human aspect. For he sees everything before it happens.
The Lord God prepared a vine, and it grew over Jonah's head to be a shade over him and to protect him because he had labored.
And Jonah was very glad about the vine.

Ivy naturally creeps along the ground with a wandering twist, and it cannot climb to higher places without support or stakes. This weak ivy, lacking strength on its own, can represent the Jewish people. They grow quickly and promise to do everything God commands, but soon wither and fail to fulfill the commandments.
This ivy once protected Jonah, representing Christ, with the hope of its salvation and brought him joy, but it quickly withered when struck because it did not have a firm root of faith. It's like a tent that looks like a house but has no foundation, as Isaiah says: The daughter of Zion will be left like a shelter in a vineyard.
This idea is well represented by locusts in the Gospel—small creatures that rise from the earth but cannot fly high. Similarly, the Jews, upon hearing the law, said: We will do everything the Lord God commands us, and we will obey Him. But they soon turned into a crooked bow and did not keep God's covenant. God then prepared a worm at dawn the next day, and it struck the ivy, causing it to wither.
In the psalm titled "For the Ascension of the Morning," the Lord calls himself a worm, saying: But I am a worm and not a man. A worm, indeed, arises from the earth without seed; it crawls humbly and moves silently. Likewise, Christ was born from the virgin earth, humble among insults, and did not protest in his suffering.
Thus, before the sun rose, or before Christ resurrected, the ivy thrived, and Judea flourished. But after he rose, and Nineveh, representing the world of error, cast away the shadow and received the light of truth, the prepared worm struck the ivy of the Jewish people, and it withered, deprived of God's help. This happened at dawn’s ascension because Christ rose early on the first day of the week. And when the sun had risen, the Lord commanded a scorching hot wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head, causing him to grow faint.

Even after Christ's resurrection and the rejection by the Jews, the Lord's desire for their salvation remained strong. He commanded the apostles, saying, "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria." Thus, he instructed them to begin their preaching in Jerusalem, saying, "It was necessary for Christ to suffer and rise from the dead, and for repentance and forgiveness of sins to be preached in his name to all nations, starting from Jerusalem."
Jonah asked for his soul to die, saying, "It is better for me to die than to live." Similarly, in baptism with Israel, they could receive the renewal they had lost by denying Christ. Hence, Peter said to those who asked what they should do, "Repent, and let each of you be baptized." The idea of wanting to die in baptism aligns with the Apostle's view, who said, "For all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death."
Some interpret the worm and the scorching wind as symbolizing the Romans, who, after Christ's resurrection and ascension, destroyed Israel. The Lord asked Jonah, "Do you do well to be angry about the plant?" And Jonah replied, "I do well to be angry, even to death." Earlier, when the people of Nineveh were saved through repentance, Jonah was asked the same question and remained silent, knowing the Lord was merciful and compassionate. But now, understanding the rejection of Israel through the withering plant, he boldly responded, "I do well to be angry, even to death." He did not wish to save the Ninevites at the expense of the Jews nor gain outsiders at the loss of his own people.
According to the allegory in Jonah, we see Christ mourning the perishing Jerusalem. He mourns not for his own death but for that of the Jews, who were blinded so that the Gentiles might see, and they died so that the Gentiles might live, believing in the Son of God.

And the Lord said: "You feel sorry for the ivy, which you did not work for, nor did you make it grow. It came up in one night and perished in one night."
Jonah did not work for the ivy, just as the Savior did not work as much among the Jews as he did among the Gentiles. As soon as the Jews were led out of Egypt, they rejected idols and partly served the Lord. But he worked very hard among the Gentiles. For them, he became a man, though he was God. For them, he endured slaps, spitting, a crown of thorns, and death. He descended to the underworld so that they could ascend to heaven.
Hence, when the prodigal brother returned to the father, the older brother was indignant and complained to the father, saying: "Look, I have served you all these years, and you never gave me a goat to feast with my friends." Israel was very upset that the Gentiles, having squandered their wealth with prostitutes, received back their original grace.
As for what God said, the ivy grew up in one night; night signifies the time before the coming of Christ. And when it is said it perished in one night, night again represents the time when they denied Christ, when the true Sun of righteousness set for them. And I, he says, will not spare the great city of Nineveh. The great city of Nineveh is the Church, gathered from all the nations. Truly great, because the multitude of the faithful from all nations is much greater than the twelve tribes of Israel.
As for what he says, in which there are more than one hundred twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals, it literally shows the innocent and simple age of infants and nursing babies, so that from this we can infer how large the number of adults must have been if there were so many children. Or certainly, in that city, there was an immense multitude who, before repentance, did not know the difference between good and evil. For the good are signified by the right hand, the evil by the left.

In the Church, just like in a large house, there are vessels for honor and for dishonor. There are both the carnal and the spiritual, and an infinite number of beasts, meaning irrational beings who serve their bellies and look to the earth.
Do they look to heaven? About such people, the Psalmist says, "Man, though honored, did not understand; he was compared to senseless beasts and became like them."
It should not be overlooked that in Nineveh, there were said to be more than 120,000 people. This number holds a great mystery: for 120 is reached if you add the following natural numbers from one to fifteen. For example, add two to one, and it becomes three; add three, and it becomes six; add four, and it becomes ten. If this is done up to fifteen, while keeping the natural number sequence, 120 will be found.
The Holy Spirit came upon many believers on the day of Pentecost. The number fifteen is made up of seven and eight. Seven and eight make fifteen; there were that many steps in the temple of the Lord, and there are that many psalms with the title "Song of Ascents." It is written that Paul spent that many days with the apostles and discussed the Gospel with them.
Therefore, the multitude of the Church is well-represented by such a number, in which the mysteries of the New and Old Testaments, the hundredfold square, and the thousandfold cube, meaning solid perfection, are declared.
