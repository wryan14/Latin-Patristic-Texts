Or he cried out with his whole heart's affection, as the Apostle says: \"You have received the spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry: Abba, Father.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>He called the belly of the whale the \"womb of the underworld,\" which was so large it was like the underworld itself. These words can be allegorically referred to Christ, who says through David: \"You have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.\" For He was in hell alive, free among the dead. \"I cried out from the belly of the underworld, and You heard my voice: and You cast me into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and the river surrounded me.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>According to the literal sense, he was enclosed in the belly of the whale in the middle of the sea, and surrounded by rivers.

Et idem Propheta dicit:\nClamavi de tribulatione mea ad Dominum, et\nexaudivit me.

He endured and overcame all the storms that tormented humanity, so that we might sail safely after him. \n\n    <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n\n    And I said, \"I am cast out of your sight.\" Christ says this in his human nature.

As if to say: When I was with you, O Father, and in your light, I was light, I did not complain of being cast out.

Hence, in the Gospel, he said to the Father, \"Glorify me, Father, with the glory I had with you before the world existed.\" Or he also longs for the Father's dwelling, because just as the Father is the temple of the Son, so the Son is the temple of the Father.

When I had no other hope, remembering the Lord was my salvation.

That's why I remembered the Lord, so that my prayer from the farthest mountains might reach Your holy temple, which means heaven. Although God is everywhere, He enjoys eternal happiness there with the angels attending Him. He speaks as a priest, asking that the people's prayers, through him, may reach God's temple. Our Redeemer also prayed during His passion, saying, \"Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me\" (Matthew 26:39). And when He was on the cross, He said, \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\" (Luke 23:34).</p>\n  \n  <p>Those who hold onto worthless things forsake Your mercy. The prophet's remarkable magnanimity, even in the belly of a great beast, reflects on human frailty. God, by nature merciful, is ready to show mercy to all. But through our own fault, we lose the mercy that is freely offered to us. Notice he didn't say, \"those who do worthless things,\" because everyone does vain things, which is to say, everyone sins, since \"all living humanity is entirely vanity\" (Psalm 39:5). Instead, he says \"hold onto,\" meaning they love and cling to these things in their hearts. Such people forsake their mercy, which is God, of whom it is said: \"The Lord is compassionate and merciful\" (Psalm 103:8) and elsewhere: \"My God, my mercy\" (Psalm 59:17).
