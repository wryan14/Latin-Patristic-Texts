00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,383
Dubious Works of Saint Hilary, Bishop of Arles

2
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:07,272
Sermon on the Miracle of Saint Genesius, Martyr of Arles

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:14,350
Sharing the stories of God's works is honorable; therefore, it's worthwhile to recount the miracles associated with Saint Genesius the martyr.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,531
On his birthday, a frequent event in the city of Arles, the danger of a broken bridge shook the entire city with great fear.

5
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:27,460
Hearts struck by sudden fear, the joy of the celebration was made even greater by the grace of received safety, bringing doubled happiness.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,943
When the people of Arles gathered for this celebration, the city itself became too small to contain their joy.

7
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:40,869
The paths and open fields, filled with the rising procession and everyone struggling with the crowd, moved to the far bank of the river in honor of the martyr.

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:46,103
A devoted army to Christ, with dear spouses and sweet children, rushed to receive many blessings at once.

9
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:52,383
Not content with offering prayers in one place, they kept vigil in the church, hurrying before dawn to the place of martyrdom.

10
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:56,471
They offered sacrifices at the tomb, as if to capture the attention of the martyr.

11
00:00:56,471 --> 00:01:00,159
Neither the solemn duties of the clergy nor the time of day deterred them.

12
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,344
The splendor of the festival, with the whole city shining, had driven away all the horrors of the night.

13
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:15,712
Meanwhile, the naval route, by which the terrifying waters of the Rhone are crossed between allied cities, suddenly collapsed, either under an unjust load, excessive weight, or the slanting flow of the river.

14
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:23,588
It is uncertain by what accident; however, it is certain that the precious load, the crowd of faithful, was precariously deposited in the middle of the waves.

15
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:27,625
I was standing by, and barely took a step back from the very bridge, so to speak.

16
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:33,270
Immediately, a great noise erupted from the crowd, both from those rushing and those standing around.

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,219
Fear spread throughout the entire city.

18
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,966
Some ran to their spouses, others to their children, relatives, or friends.

19
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,214
Everyone was simultaneously afraid in different ways, some for their fellow citizens.

20
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:51,508
Amidst all this, the weight of the disaster fell entirely on Honoratus, the bishop of holy memory, who was then the beloved shepherd, as he alone feared for everyone.

21
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:53,707
What emotions of piety he felt at that time!

22
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:57,254
How quickly he, distressed in his soul, was present for the distressed!

23
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:11,495
Raising his eyes to heaven, with the intensity of his heart matched by the light in his eyes, he departed from us standing around him in a complete trance of the mind, so that no one doubted he stood before the tribunals of Christ with Saint Genesius to seek help for the present evil.

24
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:14,593
Meanwhile, amidst great turmoil, pitiable shipwrecks occurred.

25
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:20,040
Horses adorned with finery were mixed with people, struggling to swim, their legs surfacing with high chests.

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,086
They trampled over anything in their way, either warned by danger or driven by panicked instinct, with a fearful courage.

27
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:35,479
Clinging to their beloved burdens, the arms of mothers, and servants pressed by the burdens of their mistresses, the entire solemn procession became mixed with the debris of their journey.

28
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,178
Let no bad interpreter arise here.

29
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:43,324
Let no one obscure the great glory of the martyr with malicious slander, and let no one claim the crowd near the riverbank.

30
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:47,771
Let no one assert those caught in the shallows, whom the divine right hand clearly saved.

31
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:52,818
Laden with the goods of travelers, ships of inestimable burdens are daily joined to these same banks.

32
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:59,114
An ancient ordinance established a ship there for bearing bridges, as if to give up on laying the foundation with embankments.

33
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:06,509
The weight of the crowded people exposed to this vast whirlpool was as much as the beams, long and strong, could bear, even though they were broken.

34
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:18,001
Let those recalling these events bring them to their minds and eyes now: the entire Rhone, the ruin, the shipwreck, the diverse crowd of the miserable, entangled together, all conglomerated into one disaster by the devilâ€™s snares.

35
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:22,449
Nothing was lacking in the danger so that nothing was lacking in the glory of the martyr.

36
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,045
For when would the river have drowned his disciples, whom he had consecrated the same day with devout birthdays?

37
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,094
O great glory of God!

38
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,471
A glorious army emerged from the vast whirlpool.

39
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:44,207
You might have thought the Jordan River had once again, by divine intervention, opened up; or that the seas had once more provided a solid path for the people of God, as they had in the past under Moses' leadership, by the command of his rod.

40
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:49,299
No one was shaken by the collapse, no one was soaked by the river, and no one was swept away by its flow.

41
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,306
Everyone was safely welcomed by the familiar and homely shore.

42
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,828
The entire procession exited just as it had entered.

43
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:59,144
The matron's secrets were revealed by the necks of their mobile servants from the depths.

44
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:07,582
The virgins, adorned in honor of God, did not lose any of their floating jewelry; even the pins remained as securely attached to their maternal hands as they had been before.

45
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,783
No one suffered any loss of property, and no one faced any danger.

46
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:16,457
Beloved children rushed to meet their loved ones: each person joyfully embraced the one they had feared for the most.

47
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:20,918
Whose power but Christ's, through the intercession of His martyr, accomplished this miracle?

48
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,973
Surely, the bishop met the martyr, and the lord met the martyr.

49
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:27,174
The faithful people's service was shown to be worthy of salvation.

50
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:37,261
And indeed, many immediately, so that the holy devotion might not be easily disturbed by the enemy, boarded boats with their clothes still wet and disregarded the morning chill of the river with fervent hope.

51
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:45,699
They hurried to the place they aimed for, the site of the martyrdom, with a victorious spirit, ready to offer their vows with even greater enthusiasm after the recent danger.

52
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,785
Oh, such prayers are worthy of being heard!

53
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:53,071
They, unbroken by injuries, do not blame the peril they faced: they know how to give thanks for their escape.

54
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:56,368
Everyone dances with joy, happily participating in the solemn rites.

55
00:04:56,368 --> 00:05:00,733
It is a joy to have been in danger because it was a wonder to have witnessed the miracles.

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,583
It was so significant for each to have doubted their safety so that they could miraculously gain it.

57
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,224
With all his flock present, the honored pastor rejoices.

58
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:20,592
He could have entrusted these writings, which will endure through the ages, to a more skillful hand with greater grace, if he had not been aware of the divine gift and designated as a participant in the mission of the holy martyr.

59
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:24,893
Because the Lord had granted him this as a bishop, he feared to rejoice too arrogantly.

60
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,562
Indeed, many blessings reach us through various means.

61
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,885
But how many recognize them in their own lives?

62
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:37,448
We attribute this solely to God, who is worshipped as the creator and knower of all, and lives with the Son and the Holy Spirit for endless ages of ages.

63
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:37,695
Amen.
