Interpretatur angelus Domini, sive angelus\nmeus, quia tantae fuit auctoritatis, ut quidquid dixisset,\nita crederetur velut ab angelo Domini dictum\nfuisset. Unde nonnulli putaverunt eum natura angelum\nde coelo descendisse carne indutum, ad commonefaciendum\npopulum, qui nuper de captivitate\nreversus erat."
