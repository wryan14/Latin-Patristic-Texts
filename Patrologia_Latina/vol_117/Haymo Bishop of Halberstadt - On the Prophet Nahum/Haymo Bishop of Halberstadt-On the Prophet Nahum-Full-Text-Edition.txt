On the Prophet Nahum
by Haymo of Halberstadt

Nahum the prophet, like Jonah, foretold the destruction of the great city Nineveh. True to his name, which means "comforter," he brings comfort to the captives of the ten tribes taken to Nineveh by the Assyrians during the reign of King Hezekiah in Judah.
It was a great comfort to those already serving the Assyrians and to those besieged in Judah under Hezekiah, to hear that their Assyrian enemies would be captured by the Chaldeans.

Chapter One

The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
In prophetic terms, the burden signifies a heavy weight of misery placed upon those it is directed against, indicating that it oppresses them and prevents them from lifting their heads.
Regarding Nahum the Elkoshite, Elkosh was a village in Galilee, now completely destroyed with barely any remnants of buildings. The claim that he had a father named Elkosh is false.
The book is called a vision because Nahum spoke with understanding, not in a trance as heretics claimed, as if unaware of his words like those possessed. He saw and comprehended everything he spoke.
The prophet offers moral consolation to the saints about the destruction and end of the world, which Nineveh, meaning beautiful or splendid, signifies. We see nothing more beautiful than the world, so that all perishable and worldly things are despised, and they prepare themselves for the day of judgment.
God is jealous and avenging. The prophet praises the Lord as the avenger of His people against the Assyrians, or in a higher sense, because He hears the groans of the saints and will inflict appropriate punishments on their adversaries at the end of the age. He is called jealous, meaning zealous.
Zeal is sometimes taken in a good sense, as Paul says: Strive for the greater gifts; and the Lord Himself in the psalm: Zeal for your house consumes me. For God is zealous for the salvation of those He deems worthy, so that those who are not saved by mercy may be corrected by discipline. Hence, to Jerusalem, which remained obstinately in sin, the angry Lord speaks through Ezekiel: My zeal has departed from you; I will not be angry with you anymore.
It follows: Avenging Lord and full of wrath, avenging Lord against His enemies, and He is angry with His adversaries. The Lord can have no emotional disturbance, no rage, for He is in the highest tranquility, mild and serene. But metaphorically, He is said to have wrath when He avenges evil, because it appears so to those enduring it.
Therefore, the Lord is angry to remove from us what is contrary to Him, and by removing those things that displease Him, corrected men return to their former state.

For it is written:
He disciplines every son whom He accepts. The Lord is patient and great in strength. The one He previously called zealous and furious, He now calls patient; for He endured the sins of the Assyrians for a long time and, with His long-suffering, encouraged them to repent. But because they scorned the goodness of God, He does not allow them to go unpunished as if they were innocent. This we can also say concerning ourselves in a moral sense; the kindness of God awaits our repentance. Therefore, let us not scorn the riches of His goodness and long-suffering, lest (God forbid) we store up wrath for ourselves on the day of wrath and the revelation of God's righteous judgment.
And cleansing does not make one innocent. For He mercifully cleanses from sins, but justly punishes the evil deeds committed. Just as He does not neglect any good deed without rewarding it, He does not leave any sin without condemning it. Thus, by cleansing, He makes one innocent because He cleanses through discipline, so that the one being cleansed does not consider himself innocent.
The Lord has His way in the storm and whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of His feet. The Septuagint translators, to make it clearer, used "commotion" instead of "whirlwind" to show that the minds of men were disturbed by unusual and unheard-of miracles. In the feet of the Lord, His coming for judgment: clouds and dust are the hidden and inscrutable judgments of God, by which He will judge the world. Therefore, clouds are the dust of the Lord's feet, because what is now hidden and shrouded in great obscurity will then crumble and dissolve into dust, becoming clear to all.
Rebuking the sea, and drying it up, and leading all the rivers into a desert. Literally, the power of God is described, showing that it is not a great thing for Him to destroy the Assyrians, who can also change the elements. It can also be referred to the end of the world, because when the Lord comes for judgment, He will dry up the sea and rivers, according to the saying: And the sea will be no more. In a deeper sense, the Lord rebukes the sea, and dries it up, or He destroys all the bitterness and salinity of unbelief by His transformation.

He dries up rivers, symbolizing false knowledge that opposes the truth, reducing it to nothing.
Bashan and Carmel are weakened, and the flower of Lebanon withers.
Metaphorically, by the weakening of Bashan and Carmel, two very fertile regions, and Mount Lebanon, known for its tall cedar trees, it is shown that the powerful Assyrian nation, once ruling over many, will be plundered because God is angry.
This can also refer to the last day when the powerful, the noble, and the rich will be weakened and perish.
Bashan means confusion or disgrace, and Carmel means knowledge of circumcision.
This implies that everything worthy of confusion and disgrace will be weakened on the day of judgment.
Even those who seem to have knowledge of true circumcision and claim to understand God's law, boasting of their holiness and virtues, represented by Lebanon (which means whitening), will tremble and wither when the Lord comes to judge.
The mountains were moved by Him, and the hills were desolated.
The earth trembled before Him, as well as the world and all who live in it.
It can be simply understood that at the end of the world, the mountains and hills will be moved when the Lord comes.
If during His passion the sun was darkened and the earth trembled, much more will everything be disturbed and moved when He comes in His majesty.
Figuratively, it announces that all power or heights of mountains, meaning men, will be brought down either here through repentance or in judgment through strict severity.
Who will stand before His indignation?
And who can resist the fury of His anger?
The implied answer is either very few or none.
There will be no soul that does not tremble at God's judgment, since even the stars are not pure in His sight.
His indignation is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by Him.

His indignation was poured out to shatter the hard hearts of the people, leading them to repentance. They would develop a broken and humble heart, becoming a sacrifice to God, because a sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit.
The Lord is good and a comforter in times of trouble, and He knows those who hope in Him. This last part, "from the common," meaning "from the community," connects to the previous statements. The Lord is good to those who hope in Him, a comforter to those who hope in Him, and He knows those who hope in Him.
When He begins to be angry with the nations and destroys the most powerful kingdoms, He will recognize those who are His own and have mercy on them. For God's knowing means to choose or to have mercy. The day of trouble refers to the day of judgment. In the passing flood, He will bring about the end of its place, and His enemies will be pursued by darkness.
God is inherently good and embodies goodness itself; He will not be angry forever. Even if human wickedness increases and all flesh corrupts its way, He will bring a flood, a scourge, to pass through, not to remain. He will bring about the end and completion of this flood, allowing the Lord's anger to pass and only mercy to appear.
This can specifically refer to Israel. When enemies have laid waste and the entire land is inundated like a flood, He will end the captivity and restore them to their own seats, while afflicting the Assyrian enemies with darkness.
This also applies to the saints and their persecutors. After God afflicts the saints in this present time, He will have mercy on them in the future, but the persecutors will be seized by the darkness they have chosen, where there will be perpetual weeping and gnashing of teeth.
What are you plotting against the Lord? He will bring about the end. There will not be a double trouble. The Hebrews interpret this literally: O Jews, what evil are you plotting, thinking that two tribes will be captured in the same way as the ten were captured.

A double trouble will not arise, so these people will be captured just like those were: because the Assyrians, who now embrace each other like thorns, will be struck down by the angel of the Lord. This happened when the angel struck down 185,000 of them in one night.
What follows: From you will come one who plots evil against the Lord, is understood to refer to Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria sent to blaspheme the living God.
Indeed, what is said in the Hebrew truth: A double trouble will not arise, the Septuagint explained more clearly: The Lord will not judge twice in the same matter, and this phrase is commonly used by everyone.
Therefore, the prophet says: What are you plotting against the Lord?
Marcion the heretic invented two gods, one of the Old Testament, evil, cruel, and who delights in human punishment, and another good one of the New Testament, who they say will bring about the end of the world.
Against these, the prophet says: What are you plotting against the Lord?
He who created the world will also bring it to an end.
Nevertheless, know that a double trouble will not arise, nor will they be judged twice, because for those whom the present trouble afflicts, it prevents future damnation from arising.
And therefore God brings punishments upon sinners in the present, so that they do not perish forever.
Just as thorns embrace each other, so does their banquet of drinking together.
They will be consumed like dry straw.
He speaks specifically of the heretics, whose banquet, that is, their community and friendship ties, are like thorns embracing each other.
Or he calls their banquet the altar and the table of the Lord, which they claim to have, but their sacraments tear the soul, like thorns tear the body.
For when they speak against the Lord and intoxicate themselves with the wine of error, they drink together, and therefore they are consumed by the eternal fire of hell, like dry straw.
And from you will come one who plots evil against the Lord, contemplating rebellion in his mind.

All heretics clearly think maliciously against the Lord.
Arius claims the Son of God is a creature, not begotten from the substance of the Father but made. Sabellius asserts there is one person in the Trinity. Manichaeus foolishly argues that Christ did not have a real body, but a phantom one.
The Lord says this: If they are perfect, and thus many in number, they will be shorn and will pass away.
About the Assyrians, He says literally: Even if they are perfect and strong, and increase in number among all nations, they will be shorn by the angel of the Lord, that is, they will be diminished, just as hair is easily cut with scissors. And they will pass away, meaning Assyria will cease to exist or will return to its land after its army is destroyed.
I have afflicted you, and I will not afflict you anymore. This is understood in this time through these enemies by whom you are now besieged. For they have often been afflicted by others afterward. Hence it is further added: And then I will break his rod from your back and will tear your chains apart, meaning all the power he has and boasts of, or the chains he prepared to bind the captives.
In a higher sense, if the wicked are perfect in malice and numerous, they will be shorn by death, and they will pass away and perish so that they no longer exist.
As for what follows: I have afflicted you, this is said to the Church, and it promises that after the affliction of this present life, eternal happiness will follow.
The Lord will command over you, and your name will no longer be sown. O Assyria, do not think what you will suffer is by chance; the Lord will command against you because you will endure the predicted evils by His decree. Your name will no longer be sown, meaning no one will be born from you who will be called by your name and be called your heir.
As the Book of Isaiah declares, immediately after Sennacherib returned to Nineveh, fleeing the plague that the angel of the Lord inflicted around him, he was killed by his sons while worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch. And this is what follows: I will kill from the house of your god, so that you will be punished there where you hoped for help.

I will place your grave as an image and molten idol, because you are dishonored. Just as your wicked blood is spilled among altars, idols, and cushions, let us morally apply this to heretics. It is foretold to them that when they suffer what has been said, the souls of those they deceived will no longer take names from their errors, nor will they spread seeds of falsehood anymore. And from the house of your God, that is, the churches of the wicked, I will destroy the image and molten idol, meaning all idolatry of false doctrine. If money is a god to the greedy, and the stomach is a god to the gluttonous, then to heretics, their own error, which they created from their hearts, can be called an idol and image. Behold, on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news and announces peace: Celebrate your festivals, Judah, and fulfill your vows, because no longer will Belial pass through you; he is completely destroyed.

Chapter Two

The one who scatters rises before you, who guards the siege.
We read in the Book of Chronicles that when Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem, the people of Jerusalem could not celebrate Passover in the first month, which is April.
However, after his army was struck down by an angel and the death of Sennacherib was announced, they celebrated Passover with joy in the second month, which is May.
Therefore, the prophet says:
"O Judah, do not be anxious, and do not fear, because your enemy is dead. Behold, a messenger comes to you, swiftly crossing the mountains and hills, and announces to you peace and the liberation of the city from Sennacherib's rule.
So, celebrate the festivals, fulfill your vows joyfully, because the Lord has saved you, and Belial has completely perished, that is, the entire army along with its king.
Belial means 'without yoke.'
Mystically, it is commanded to the Church, which the devil oppressed with the heavy yoke of idolatry, that, having been freed through the passion of the Lord, it should celebrate the festivals and fulfill vows of praise to the Lord with the angels, since Belial has been slain; for what partnership has Christ with Belial?
The same is to be said whenever the Church is freed from persecutors and adversaries, that it should celebrate festivals of spiritual joy and give thanks to the Lord.
Contemplate the way, strengthen your loins, greatly bolster your courage, because the Lord has restored the pride of Jacob, just as the pride of Israel, for the destroyers have scattered them and corrupted their branches.
Again, the prophet's message is directed to Nineveh, and it is said to them: Surely, Nebuchadnezzar will come to destroy you, O Nineveh, and devastate your fields.
Therefore, since an inevitable war is imminent, I advise you to carefully contemplate the way and the path through which the enemy will come, and to gird your loins, strengthen, and encourage the strength of your army, because just as the Lord avenged Judah, that is, the two tribes from the pride of Sennacherib, so will He avenge Israel, that is, the ten tribes, who are held captive in Nineveh."

This is what it says: Just as the Lord repaid the pride of Jacob, which refers to the pride the Assyrians had against Judah, He will also repay the pride of Israel, meaning the pride the Assyrians had against the ten tribes of Israel.
In a mystical sense, it is commanded that we examine the path we are to walk. This means we should focus our minds on the faithful path that leads us to Him who says: "I am the way." By doing this, we metaphorically gird our loins, mortifying all illicit desires of the flesh within us. Additionally, we are commanded to strengthen our virtue so that we may be able to fight against the devil.
The shields of his strong men are fiery, and the men of his army are dressed in scarlet. The chariot reins are fiery on the day of his preparation, and the drivers are drowsy. They are confused on the roads.
According to history, the army of the Chaldeans is described as coming against Nineveh, and the grandeur of those preparing for war is detailed. The shield of the strong men is fiery, meaning it shines and almost flashes. The men are in scarlet, wearing clothes of scarlet color, which evokes the terror of fire and the appearance of blood. The reins are fiery due to the excessive haste of those preparing for battle.
The drivers are drowsy. It is no wonder they come so quickly, as the drivers, meaning the leaders of either Israel or the Assyrians, are drowsy. The narration is mixed: sometimes it describes what Israel has suffered, other times what the Assyrians have done, and then what the Babylonians intend to do against the Assyrians.
Their chariots are colliding in the streets. The multitude of the mixed army is so great that the chariots, unable to find a way through the crowded streets, collide with each other. Their appearance, meaning the Babylonians, is like torches, like lightning flashing, terrifying their enemies by sight alone before striking with the sword.
He will remember his strong ones, and they will stumble on their paths. They will quickly ascend his walls, and the shelter will be prepared.

Then he says, the people of Assyria will remember their warriors and seek those who have already fallen on the roads. Quickly, they will ascend the wall of Nineveh to defend it. Due to the long siege, they will prepare a shelter for themselves to ward off the heat.
The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is destroyed to the ground. The soldier is taken captive and led away, and their maidservants mourn, groaning like doves, murmuring in their hearts.
What the prophet says happened, they did this because no one can resist God's plan. With Nineveh captured, the gates of the rivers were opened, meaning many peoples, as the city had a multitude of citizens like rivers. The temple symbolizes the kingdom, which is to be destroyed.
The captive soldier refers to those who were generally taken to Babylon, and the maidservants are the smaller cities, fortresses, villages, or the women who were led away captive.
When he says, "Groaning like doves," it shows that the terror was so great that pain did not even break into sobs or groans, but they mourned silently among themselves, imitating the cooing of doves.
All these things can be related to the end of the world when all the armor of the devil will perish. Then the chariots will clash in the streets, which means in the wide paths of the world, constrained by the narrowness of time and the imminent judgment.
The gates that were closed will be opened, meaning all things that were hidden will be revealed. Then the soldier, that is, the devil, the prince of this world, along with the maidservants, meaning the souls subjected to him through sin, will be driven captive to hell.
The maidservants can also be understood in a good sense as simple and faithful souls, who will be led rejoicing, and praising God with dove-like murmurs of confession.
And Nineveh is like a pool of water, but its waters have fled. Stand, stand, and there is no one who turns back.

He shows that after capturing the smaller cities, which he previously called daughters, the metropolis of Nineveh itself, with its vast population comparable to the waters of a pool, remained to be conquered. Despite its large population, it was defenseless because no one resisted the enemies. When the city cried out, "Stand, stand, close the gates, climb the wall," no one listened; everyone turned their backs and abandoned the city to be plundered.
Thus, it is said to the Babylonians, because they fled, "Plunder the silver, plunder the gold," and there is no end to the wealth and treasures from all the desirable vessels that have been gathered for so long. It wasn't enough for them to take as much as the plunder offered itself to the plunderers. Mystically, we said that Nineveh represents the world, whose waters are likened not to the sea, rivers, or springs, but to the waters of a pool, which do not flow continuously but are rainwater and enclosed with a short end. This is because the doctrines of heretics are like rainwater, fallen from heaven, and are outside the fountain of the Church, even though they seem to promise great and heavenly things.
They fled, departing from the Lord, and were unwilling to return through repentance, even though the Lord urges them to repent, saying: "Return, children, returning, and I will heal your wounds." Their riches, their boasting of knowledge, will be plundered and reduced to nothing. Dissipated and torn, with melting hearts, loosened knees, and failing strength, their faces became like the blackness of a pot. Under the figure of a dissipated and lacerated woman, it describes what Nineveh was like at the time of captivity, with melting hearts, loosened knees, and faces deformed by terror, they looked like burned pots. All these things, although they happened in Nineveh when it was captured by Nebuchadnezzar, are believed to come upon the wicked in the future judgment. Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions?

Nineveh, once a royal palace, was the dwelling place of lions-the most powerful and cruel. The lion, or the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, went there, allowing his deputy, the lion cub, to enter. There was no one to terrify or resist him.
Nebuchadnezzar, the victor, took enough for his cubs and rightfully possessed everything. He killed for his cities or handed over captive wives into slavery. He filled his dens and lairs with plunder, amassing gold, silver, and precious furnishings.
According to the allegory, when Nineveh is destroyed-when the world of evil passes away-the saints will rejoice and say: "Where is the dwelling of the lions, the demons, and the pastures of malevolent spirits who roar and seek food from God?" To which Nineveh, the lion (the devil), and the lion cub (the Antichrist) went. As the Apostle says: "Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion" First Peter five verse eight.
No one could terrify this lion before the advent of Christ. But when the stronger one came, he bound the strong one, searched his dens (the hidden places of the underworld), and seized his plunder (the men he held) from his power.
"Behold, I am against you," says the Lord of hosts, "and I will burn your chariots to smoke. The sword will devour your young lions, and I will cut off your prey from the earth. The voice of your messengers will no longer be heard. O Nineveh, all these things that have been foretold will happen not by another, but by me."
"Behold, I am against you, the actor of all these things. I will burn you to smoke, that is, to completion. When the fire fails and the wood is consumed, smoke remains. Your cubs, that is, your nobles and deputies, will be devoured by the sword. I will cut off your prey from the earth so that you will no longer devastate it or demand tributes."

Everything said about Nineveh will come true in the judgment upon the devil and his accomplices.

Chapter Three

Woe to the city of blood, full of lies and violence, where robbery never ceases. The power of the city of Nineveh is depicted, and under a certain lamentation, her cruelty is highlighted.
Woe to the city of blood and murder, where there is no truth, only lies, filled with robbery and violence, from which robbery never departs.
The sound of the whip, the rushing wheel, the neighing horse, the burning chariot, the ascending rider, the flashing sword, the glittering spear, the multitude of the slain, and the heavy ruin.
He substituted voice for sound. A beautiful description of an army preparing for battle. There is no end to their corpses, as they will be laid low in the city. They will fall among their own bodies, either in their multitude while crowded together, or among the corpses of the slain.
Because of the multitude of the harlot's whoredoms, beautiful and pleasing, and practicing witchcraft, who sold nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.
The harlot Nineveh, either due to idolatry or because it was the market of all nations, accepted their dealings or merchandise. Thus, they fornicated with all nations and served the idols of all nations. Hence, she is called a beautiful and pleasing harlot practicing witchcraft. They practiced magical arts and held many nations under their power.
In a higher sense, Nineveh represents the world, where much of the blood of the just is shed, and heretics kill with the sword of their tongue. The voices of whips are heard there, because there are many tribulations of the just.
Therefore, they will fall among their own bodies, when through excessive lust they weaken themselves, or even fall in their own bodies, because, as the Apostle says: Those who fornicate, sin against their own body. There they fall, there they acquire the condemnation of eternal death.

Behold, I am against you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will lift your skirts over your face, showing the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame.
I will throw filth on you, treat you with contempt, and make you a spectacle.
God still threatens Nineveh, saying He will expose its shame to the nations so that those who have sinned with it will despise and insult it, making it an example for all.
This is like an adulterous woman who, when caught, is brought into the public eye, condemned before everyone, and made an example for others.
These things can also be understood metaphorically about the world, whose shame the Lord will reveal when He makes it see its errors.
He will show its nakedness to the nations so they understand that this world is to be condemned; it escapes grasp while being thought held and keeps faith with none of its lovers.
Instead, after deceiving miserable people, it delivers them to eternal destruction.
Everyone who sees you will recoil from you and say: Nineveh is devastated.
Whoever sees the devastated Nineveh, set as an example to all, will recoil from it, fearing to be involved in similar punishment, and will pity it, saying: Who will pity you? Where shall I find comforters for you?
Who will be your comforter, you who, in your prosperity, had no pity on anyone and did not prepare a companion in grief, as if you could always be happy and always be in command?
But when we consider the fleeting nature of the world and all its glory passing by so quickly, then we recoil from it, withdraw from our love of it, hate its desires that lead to destruction, and begin to desire eternal things.
Are you better than Alexandria of the peoples, which dwells by the rivers?
Its riches are the sea, its walls the waters.
Ammon is interpreted as the people of Alexandria, and the location of Alexandria is described.
For in Hebrew, Alexandria is called Noma.

The prophet speaks to Nineveh:
Are you better or stronger than the people of Alexandria, which is situated on the Nile and the sea, surrounded on all sides by rivers? Water surrounds it. On one side, it is encircled by the Nile, on another by Lake Mareotis, and on a third by the sea. Ethiopia is its strength, and Egypt, without limit. Africa and the Libyans were your allies, but they too were led into exile and captivity.
Just as Ethiopia, Egypt, and the other nations served as a defense for Alexandria, the location of these provinces shows their strength. But Alexandria, he says, will also be led into exile. Its children were dashed to pieces at the head of every street, and lots were cast for its nobles. All its great men were bound in chains. You too will be drunk, and you will be despised, and you will seek help from the enemy.
The prophet describes these events to show the cruel actions victors inflict on the vanquished: they spare no age, no sex, no condition. Since this will happen to the mighty city of Alexandria, why are you surprised, O Nineveh, if the same happens to you? You too will drink from the same cup, and you will come to such disgrace and need that you will even ask for help from your enemies.
All your fortresses will be like fig trees with ripe figs; if shaken, they will fall into the mouth of the eater. All your strongholds, that is, your warriors, will be like early figs, which fall easily from the tree when lightly shaken, and fall into the mouth of the eater. Similarly, you will be easily captured, and it will take little effort for soldiers to capture you.
This is the literal sense. According to the allegory, considering the people of Ammon, it can be interpreted as: Think of the people of the Church, who are situated by prophetic rivers and have rivers of teachers around them. Their beginning is from the sea, that is, from the bitter law of the Old Testament, which no one could fulfill without the law of Christ. They have Ethiopia in their defense: Ethiopia will stretch out its hands to God (Psalms).

This is also symbolized by Egypt, which was in darkness before the knowledge of Christ. It includes the people of Libya, a land that is sandy and barren, scorched by the sun. These are the same Gentiles who were initially without the moisture of spiritual grace and the cleansing of baptism.
Although they possess all these qualities, unless they diligently guard their own hearts, they too will be led into captivity. Their children, unskilled in faith, will be dashed to pieces; they will fall into sin, and spiritual adversaries will destroy their eminent virtues.
Behold, your people are like women in your midst. The gates of your land will be opened to your enemies, and fire will consume your bars. Because of the siege, draw water for yourself, build up your defenses, enter the mud and trample it to force bricks into place. There, fire will consume you, and you will perish by the sword. It will devour you like a locust. Gather yourselves like locusts, multiply like grasshoppers.
You have made your traders more numerous than the stars of the heavens. The locust has spread out and flown away; your guards are like locusts, and your children like swarms of locusts sitting on the fences on a cold day. The sun has risen, and they have flown away, and their place is not known.
The message is still directed to Nineveh. It says it is not surprising if your downfall is so easy, like shaking off the first figs, since all your people are weak and cannot resist. Therefore, the gates will be opened, not to friends, but to enemies. The bars that closed them will be consumed by fire.
Because the siege will be long, draw water for yourself, and ensure the besieged do not lack drink. Fortify your towers, enter the mud with bare feet, and trample it to soften and compress. When you have made bricks from it, use them to block the breaches in the walls. The siege is near. But when you have done all this, rejoice in your works, as quickly as the locust devours the vegetation of the earth.

But even if you gather an immense multitude of warriors, so numerous that they could be compared to a dense swarm of grasshoppers and locusts, and even if you collect all the treasures and riches that cannot be counted, like the stars in the sky, you will lose all of these in a moment. Just as locusts, grasshoppers, or cicadas fly away when the sun heats up and are not found again.
There are three types of locusts: the larger flying locust, the grasshopper which is a locust without wings, and the smallest and shrillest kind, the cicada, which crawls rather than flies with its small wings. The nature of all locusts is to be sluggish in the cold and to fly in the heat.
Tropologically, the people of Nineveh represent worldly people, so enfeebled by the passions and temptations of the flesh that they are compared to women and possess nothing manly. Therefore, their gates, that is, their bodily senses, will be opened to their enemies, that is, demons. They have, however, very strong bars, which are their reason and intellect, by which they could block their senses. But these bars will be consumed by fire because they are overcome by the fiery darts of the devil. Hence, it is commanded that such people draw the water of the divine word. Solomon says, deep water flows from the mouth of a man, and there they will find some remedy for salvation.
They are also commanded to take mud, knead it, and make bricks, to remember that they were made from mud and took on a mortal condition. But let this mud be tempered with the water of God's word, so that bricks may be made with which a fortification can be built. This way, the enemy cannot enter through the gates again. Let them be instructed by the examples of Scriptures, so that they may know how to resist the temptations of the devil. Then they are commanded to multiply like grasshoppers, that is, to grow and increase in the number of virtues. Just as they once multiplied worldly dealings, they may now match the multitude of sins with a multitude of virtues.
Your shepherds have dozed off, king of Assyria, your nobles will be buried. Your people have hidden in the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.

When he says, "Your people were weak and as fragile as women," it's no surprise that your shepherds-your leaders and sub-rulers-fell asleep. If those who should have been on the front lines were either tamed or killed, your people were scattered out of fear of Nebuchadnezzar's coming.
When the leaders were killed, the remaining unarmed multitude scattered into the mountains, and there was no one to gather the fugitives and form an army to resist. Your destruction is evident; your wound is severe, meaning it's not minor and cannot be hidden, and no doctor can heal it. Everyone who heard about you clapped their hands over you.
It's clear that whoever heard of Nineveh's downfall and the overthrow of its once mighty king would be astonished by the magnitude of such an event. They would clap their hands, amazed or rejoicing at your ruin.
He explains why this happens by adding: "Because your evil did not pass over anyone. Therefore," he says, "no one can mourn for you or shed tears for your wound because there is no one your evil did not touch."
He does not say it stood still but passed over, because the malice and pride of the Assyrians were transient and fleeting and could not last forever.
Tropologically, these words can be referred to the prince of the world. He once boasted: "I will ascend to heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven," to whom the prophet, reproaching, says: "How you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who rose in the morning."
So it is said to him through an apostrophe: "O Assyria, your shepherds have slept at the coming of Christ the Lord, because they fed men not for salvation but to devour them more eagerly, fattened with all impurity and iniquity."
Your people, who once worshiped you, have left you and fled to the mountains, to the protection of the apostles and teachers. And now all who were deceived by you mock you, for there is almost no one whom you have not deceived at some point and over whom your malice has not passed.

Those who stand against evil cannot be insulted by it.
But when evil is defeated and goodness prevails, they will mock the devil, and with good deeds, they will applaud his downfall.
