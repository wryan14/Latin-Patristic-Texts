Where had he gone who was speaking in the prophet? It should be understood that when human frailty is left to its own weakness, God is absent from man with the help of angels. Therefore, the prophet, astonished by the great vision, was dazed and, as if in a mental stupor, could not see the true light. Hence, the angel who had left him for a moment and seemed to have departed from him, returned and woke him up so he could see what he could not see before with the eyes of his heart closed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            We can also take the prophetâ€™s sleep in a good sense, according to what Solomon says: If you sleep, you will not be afraid; you will rest, and your sleep will be sweet. Therefore, he who sleeps from the cares and disruptions of the world and can say with the bridegroom: I sleep, but my heart is awake, deserves to be awakened by the angel and to enjoy an angelic vision and conversation.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And he said to me: What do you see? And I said: I saw, and behold, a whole golden lampstand, and its lamp on top of it, and its seven lamps on it, and seven pipes to the lamps, which were on top of it, and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the lamp and one on the left side of it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And I answered and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \"What are these, my lord?\" And the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me: Do you not know what these are? And I said: \"No, my lord.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And he answered and said to me: In this place, the Hebrew tradition is as follows: The whole lampstand made of solid gold represents the law; the lamp, that is, the flame shining at the top of the lampstand, represents Christ, who is the head of the law, and who enlightens the whole world; the seven lamps on the lampstand represent the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit as previously listed.\n        </p>\n    \n</speak>",

Quo enim abierat qui in propheta loquebatur? Sed\nsciendum quod quando humana fragilitas suae relinquitur\nimbecillitati, Deus angelorum auxilio abest\nab homine. Propheta itaque magnae visionis\nstupore attonitus, torpebat, et velut mente sopitus,\n verum lumen videre non poterat. Quapropter angelus\nqui eum parumper sibi dimiserat, et quasi ab\neo recesserat, reversus suscitavit eum, ut videret\nquod antea clausis cordis oculis videre non poterat. Possumus quoque somnium prophetae in bonam partem\naccipere, juxta quod Salomon ait: Si dormieris,\nnon timebis: quiesces, et suavis erit somnus\ntuus. Qui ergo a saeculi curis et perturbationibus\ndormit, et potest dicere cum sponso: Ego dormio,\net cor meum vigilat, meretur ab angelo\nsuscitari, et angelica visione atque allocutione\nperfrui. Et dixit ad me: Quid tu vides? et dixi: Vidi, et\necce candelabrum aureum totum, et lampas ejus super\n caput ipsius, et septem lucernae ejus super illud,\net septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput\nillius, et duae olivae super illud, una a dextris lampadis,\net una a sinistris ejus. Et respondi, et aio ad\nangelum, qui loquebatur in me, dicens: Quid sunt\nhaec, domine mi? Et respondit angelus qui loquebatur\nin me, et dixit ad me: Nunquid nescis quid sunt\nhaec? Et dixi: Non, domine mi. Et respondit et ait\nad me, dicens: In hoc loco Hebraeorum traditio\ntalis est: Candelabrum totum solidum ex auro, legem\ndicunt; lampadem vero, id est flammam in\nvertice candelabri lucentem, Christum, qui est caput\nlegis, quique omnem mundum illuminat; septem\nlucernae super candelabrum, septem dona Spiritus\nsancti superius enumerata.",

The seven reservoirs, which are the small vessels containing the oil that is poured into the lamps, shine on the candlestick. They signify that these seven graces come down to humans from heaven through the law.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The two olive trees on the candlestick, one on the right and one on the left, with the middle lamp shining between them, represent the law and the prophecy. When the prophet described the vision to the angel, he asked the angel what the vision meant. The angel responded: Do you not know what these are? When he replied, I do not know, the angel explained: This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the Lord of hosts. The people were brought back from captivity and will be brought back more fully, and their adversaries will be devastated.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel, you will become a plain. The people of the Jews, who did not want them to prosper and rebuild the temple, will be leveled, and their pride will be brought down, humbled under the feet of Israel. He will bring forth the cornerstone, that is Christ, who has always been a help to the people of Israel from ages past. He will match grace with grace, that is the stone. This clearly means: He brought out his grace from captivity and will match this grace with the grace he showed to their fathers, extending similar mercy to these. This is the tradition of the Hebrews.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        But the church doctors explain this passage in this way: The entirely golden candlestick is the holy Church, which in the divine Scriptures seeks the sense more than the words. The lamp on the candlestick designates the Lord Christ, who illuminates the Church, and who says of himself: No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel basket, that is, under the measure of the law, but on a candlestick, that is, in the freedom of the Gospel, by which the Church is enlightened.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

This can be understood as: It is rare for someone to despise the short days of this age because many people delight in this world so much that, if they could, they would always want to live here. Therefore, when we see the lovers of this world shining in gold, adorned with purple and gems, surrounded by the services of attendants, we can take this and say: Who has despised the small days? For all the days of the present life are short, no matter how long they may extend. Hence, Jacob said: My days are few and evil.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    And they will see the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which range throughout the whole earth, that is, the help of the Savior, who is born from the lineage of Zerubbabel. The stone is called so because of its unsurpassable strength. But why is it called the stone of tin? They say the nature of tin is to protect other metals from fire. For although copper, iron, and other metals are naturally harder, if they are put into the furnace without tin, they burn. Similarly, the strength of angels and humans is fragile and weak if it does not have divine help. Therefore, the stone of tin is called Christ because just as tin separates mixed and adulterated metals, so does the Lord Savior, of whom the prophet says, He will sit refining and purifying silver, separating the silver and gold of good works from the bronze and lead of vices, so that pure gold and silver remain.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    And I answered and said to him: What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand? And I answered again and said to him: What are these two olive branches beside the two gold spouts from which the golden oil pours? And he said to me: Do you not know what these are?
