On the Prophet Zephaniah
by
Haymo Bishop of Halberstadt

Zephaniah, the ninth prophet among the twelve, is known as "watchtower" or "the secret of the Lord." He witnessed the impending destruction of Jerusalem during the reign of Josiah, the just king, and prophesied during this time. He spoke of the devastation of other nations and warned about the day of judgment.

Chapter One

This is the word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, during the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah.
The Hebrews say that whenever a father or grandfather is mentioned in the title, they were also prophets.
Therefore, Zephaniah was born from a prophetic lineage.
Zephaniah's father was Cushi, his grandfather was Gedaliah, his great-grandfather was Amariah, and his great-great-grandfather was Hezekiah.
Zephaniah means "watchtower" or "secret."
Prophets were indeed watchmen, as it is said to Ezekiel: "I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel."
The secrets of the Lord were also revealed to them, as it is said in Amos: "Surely the Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets."
This watchman was the son of Cushi, which means humility or my Ethiopian.
His grandfather was Gedaliah, which means greatness of the Lord; his great-grandfather was Amariah, which means word of the Lord; and his great-great-grandfather was Hezekiah, which means strength of the Lord.
Thus, from the strength of the Lord comes the word of the Lord, from the word of the Lord comes the greatness of the Lord, and from the greatness of the Lord comes humility.
The more someone ascends to the perfection of virtue, the more they will humble themselves, saying with the prophet: "I am deeply humbled, Lord," and so on.
They will also acknowledge themselves as God's Ethiopian, meaning they will recognize themselves as sinners, and will say with the apostle John: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves," and so on.
Such a significant person is said to have lived in the days of the most holy King Josiah, whose name means elevation of the Lord.
Therefore, during the time of elevation, the son of humility was present, because through humility we are elevated to heavenly heights.
"I will utterly sweep away everything from the face of the earth," says the Lord, "sweeping away man and beast, sweeping away the birds of the air and the fish of the sea."
The Lord had long waited for sinful Judah under evil kings, and as if they could have some excuse, they could say: "We want to serve the Lord, but we are prevented by our kings."

He gave them the most righteous king, Josiah, who aimed to bring them back to the worship of God through examples and warnings. However, they persisted in idolatry. Therefore, the destruction of Jerusalem, the captivity of the people, and the victory of Nebuchadnezzar were justly prophesied. "Gathering, I will gather everything," He said. "I will no longer wait for repentance, but I will consume everything by gathering it all. Neither man, nor beast, nor birds, nor fish will remain; even the animals will feel my wrath. Because everything was created for man, it is right that, with people killed, there follows desolation and scarcity of animals. And the ruins of the wicked will be."
This prophecy can also be referred to the first advent of the Lord when people from the Jews and the Gentiles were gathered through faith. Some, like humans using reason, others simple and unlearned like beasts, light as birds, or curious as fish exploring the depths of the sea. And the ruins of the wicked will be. There will be ruins of the wicked not only at the final judgment when they hear, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire," but also at the first advent when the Lord came to bring about the fall of those who stood badly and for those who lived in sin to die and begin living in righteousness. Or simply, at Christ's first advent, there were ruins of the wicked who denied Christ and refused to accept His faith.
"I will destroy men from the face of the earth," says the Lord, "and I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem." The stretching of the hands shows the gesture of striking. "And I will destroy from this place the remnants of Baal," that is, his worshipers, who remained few in Judah after the slaughter by enemies. For they had come to such great impiety that they placed a statue of Baal in the temple of God, which image Ezekiel calls the "idol of jealousy,” and in the same sanctuary, they worshipped both God and idols. "And the names of the temple keepers with the priests." Temple keepers are janitors, that is, guardians of the buildings; in Hebrew, they are called Nathinim. Here, however, he disparagingly calls the priests "temple keepers," whom we call fanatics from the temple, that is, temple fanatics.

And so, he threatens to destroy both the caretakers and the priests of God. Those who worship the host of heaven on rooftops, and worship and swear by the Lord, and swear by Melcho. On the rooftops, standing in the upper rooms, they worship the sun, the moon, and other stars, and equally swear in the name of the Lord and Melcho, which means king.
Those who turn away from following the Lord, and those who have not sought or investigated Him, are implied to be destroyed. Specifically, those who turn away from worshipping the Lord, worship the host of heaven, swear by the names of idols, and worship Baal and the idol of the Sidonians.
Tropologically, Jerusalem signifies the Church of the Lord. At His coming, He will destroy all idolatry and the remnants of Baalim, which means "in the heights," referring to vain glory and the pomp of false admiration. This includes those who swear by the Lord and Melcho, meaning those who think they can serve both God and the world. But the Lord says: No one can serve two masters.
Those who turn away from following the Lord are those who turn to evil deeds and abandon the path they should have followed. This can also be understood by the back of the Lord, His physical coming, in which He was visible. Just as by His face, the divinity cannot be seen by any creature as it is.
Hence it was also said to Moses: There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back.
They turn away from following the Lord, those who either do not believe in Him incarnate or despise His commandments. Be silent before the face of the Lord God, for the day of the Lord is near. Be silent, revere, and tremble.
The day of the Lord, according to the letter, can be understood as the time of captivity and vengeance upon the people of Judah. Spiritually, it can also be seen as the day of final judgment. For the Lord has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His invited ones. The prepared sacrifice refers to the people who, in the time of vengeance, were to be slaughtered like a sacrifice. He has consecrated His invited ones, as if invited to a grand feast.

They used to be sanctified, meaning they were washed and dressed in more elegant clothes for feasts. Therefore, we should understand the call of Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, whom he summoned to punish sinners. Through his servant Jeremiah, he says, "I have called (saying) Nebuchadnezzar my servant." Some interpret the day of the Lord, when He prepared His sacrifice, as His first coming, when the unique sacrifice, the true lamb Christ, was sacrificed. They see those called and sanctified as the apostles and those who came to faith through them. And on the day of the Lord's sacrifice, judgment will be upon the princes and the sons of the king. The day of the Lord's sacrifice refers to the time of Jewish captivity, when the entire people were to be sacrificed by enemies. The Lord then judged the princes and the sons of King Josiah, all of whom were either captured or killed. Alternatively, this may refer to the royal lineage in general. And upon all who are dressed in foreign, meaning exotic and expensive clothes, or those who worshiped idols instead of God. Judgment will also be upon all who arrogantly step over the threshold on that day; those who, with pride and arrogance, ascended the steps or threshold of the temple. In the Hebrew truth, it is written: Those who cross the threshold; this refers to worshippers dressed in the clothing of demons, who do not step on the temple threshold but cross over it. Those who fill the house of the Lord their God with iniquity and deceit; meaning with wealth prepared through iniquity. Tropologically, heretics are clothed in foreign garments, having abandoned the garment of Christ received in baptism and assuming impiety for piety, and falsehood for truth. They also arrogantly step over the threshold, rejecting the simplicity of faith and filling the church with iniquity and deceit through their erroneous preaching. And on that day, says the Lord, there will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills. He literally refers to the Fish Gate, which was closer to the sea and led to Diospolis and Joppa.

The wailing from the second gate refers to the gate of the second wall on the same road to the sea. We also read about a second Jerusalem in the book of Kings: He sent to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, who lived in Jerusalem in the second district.
The destruction from the hills signifies the disturbance from Mount Zion. Once the higher part of the city was captured, descending to the lower parts became easier. Tropologically, through the Fish Gate, the sense of sight is expressed, and through the second gate, the sense of hearing. These two senses—hearing and seeing—are primarily how sinners are judged, as the delight of sin extends to the other senses through them.
There will be great destruction from the hills because everything high will be crushed. The voice of the Lord is against all the proud and arrogant, and they will be humbled. Some understand the two gates as baptism and penance. From the first gate, the outcry will be from those who did not keep their baptismal promises. The wailing from the second gate will be from those who did not do penance for their sins after baptism.
Wail, inhabitants of the Mortar, for all the people of Canaan are silenced. Here, the mortar is understood as a vessel in which grains are pounded, with "pi" pronounced long. "Pila" with a short "pi" means something else—a ball, with which children play.
Therefore, Jerusalem is called a mortar, as if it were being pounded with force and impact from above. From the Fish Gate, the second gate, and the hills, the Chaldean or Roman army will rush down and crush everything. The people of Canaan are referred to as the Jews because they were committing the impieties of the Canaanites. Daniel also calls an impudent old man the seed of Canaan.
When the enemies come, they will be silenced by great fear. Tormented by the conscience of their own crimes, they will not even dare to invoke the God they offended. All those covered in silver have perished; those who trusted in riches and thought themselves protected by excessive wealth, despising the poor.

And it should be noted that he did not speak in the future tense, saying "Canaan will be silent" or "they will perish." Instead, he spoke from the past, "it has been silent and they have perished," because what was certainly going to happen, he foresaw as if it had already occurred.
However, not only will those who take pride in their riches perish, but also those who are inflated by worldly dignities, vain nobility, beauty, or bodily strength, and those who are exalted by other vanities of the world.
And in that time, I will search Jerusalem with lamps and visit upon the men settled in their dregs. When, it says, the Chaldeans or Romans come and capture Jerusalem, then I will search with a lamp all the places in the city where they could hide, even the sewers and dark caves, so that no one can escape. Anyone who reads about the overthrow done by the Romans will find it happened this way.
He will also visit upon the men settled in their dregs, that is, those who trust in their bodies. For dismissively, he calls the strength of the body "dregs." Or he refers to those settled in their dregs as sinners who are fixed in their pleasures by the habit of sinning and do not wish to be cleansed by repentance.
Such people say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, nor will He do evil, meaning He will neither reward the good with good nor repay the evil with evil. In a figurative sense, however, on that day, at the end of the world, God will search Jerusalem, that is, the Church, with a lamp, which is the judgment of Christ, who consists of humanity and divinity, like a lamp consists of clay and light, through whom God the Father will carry out all judgment; and He will visit upon the men settled in their dregs, that is, He will take vengeance on those who were pleased with their sins, defending their evils, blaspheming God as if He had made them such, and denying God's providence, so that doing good would not benefit them, nor would doing evil harm them.
Therefore, the Lord will search Jerusalem with a lamp, meaning He will bring all hidden things to light. Not only about deeds but also about idle words and the most subtle thoughts, there will be an account and retribution.

And their strength will become spoils, and their houses will turn into desolation. They will build houses but not live in them; they will plant vineyards but not drink their wine. Clearly, this speaks about the Jews, whose strength and entire army were given up for plunder during the time of captivity, their houses destroyed, and their fields and vineyards laid waste.
God's vengeance was not delayed, nor did His patience wait any longer. He quickly repaid them what they deserved.
Also, according to the interpretation, on the Day of Judgment, all the strength of the wicked will be given over to plunder. Those who built houses not on rock but on sand, and did not plant a chosen vineyard but a vineyard of Sodom and Gomorrah, such a plantation will perish. The great day of the Lord is near, it is very near and comes quickly. The voice of the Lord's day is bitter; the mighty will be troubled there. That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery.
According to the literal sense, all these things are said either about the Babylonian or the Roman captivity. Then they experienced the bitter day, those who had provoked God to bitterness. The mighty and powerful were troubled there; that day was a day of wrath because indeed they had often endured God's wrath before, but not to the end. This wrath, however, was their end because they lost their place, kingdom, and nation, and were scattered to all the ends of the world.
These things can also be interpreted to refer to the end of the world, when there will be a bitter voice directed at those who are on the left, "Go into the eternal fire," etc. The mighty will be troubled there because even the saints will be dissolved with fear, and the powers of heaven will be moved. It will also be a day of wrath, tribulation, and distress, when all nations will mourn, and there will be no place of escape, no one will help another. It will be a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and whirlwind, for it is necessary that darkness pursues those who, while doing evil, hated the light. It will be a day of trumpet and alarm, because (as the Apostle says) the judgment will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet.

These things will happen to fortified cities, which represent the world's confidence and presumption.
And to the high angels, meaning perverse works that stray from the Lord's righteous path.
I will trouble people, and they will walk like the blind because they have sinned against the Lord.
Their blood will be poured out like dust, and their bodies like dung.
But their silver and gold will not be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath.
In the fire of His jealousy, the whole earth will be devoured.
He will make a complete end, indeed a swift end, for all the inhabitants of the earth.
It is clear that Jerusalem endured all these things because they sinned against the Lord Christ by handing Him over to death.
They walked like the blind, not knowing what they were doing.
Because they shed the blood of the prophets and the blood of Him who is the Lord of the prophets, their blood was poured out like dust, and their bodies lay unburied like dung.
Their wealth, acquired through wickedness and excessive worry, will not be able to save them.
The fire of the Lord's wrath will devour them and all the land of their kingdom.
The Lord will make a complete end swiftly.
For in the forty-second year after the Lord's passion, Jerusalem was taken by the Romans, and the end came swiftly.
But at the end of the world, wicked people, those who lived carnally and followed human ways, will be troubled and will walk like the blind because they have lost the true light.
As for "Their blood will be poured out like dust," on the day of judgment, blood cannot be poured out since bodies will be immortal.
Therefore, by the name of blood, we should understand that which animates and gives life to the soul, namely faith, hope, and charity, and the other virtues in which the life of the soul consists.
So whoever sheds this blood of the soul, that is, kills a person by bad example or perverse teaching, on the day of judgment, his blood will be poured out.
That is, if he appeared to have anything vital in good works, he will be forced to lose it.

Chapter Two

Gather together, assemble, you unlovable nation.
After the aforementioned evils they were to endure, the prophet calls the people to repentance:
Gather together, assemble in the unity of love, you who were scattered by sins.
An unlovable nation, that is, unworthy of God's love.
Before the vision comes to pass like dust passing through the day, before the wrath of the Lord's fury comes upon you, that is, before the foretold events are fulfilled, which will come easily unless you prevent them by repenting, like dust is quickly carried away by the wind.
In this, we should consider how great God's mercy is.
He calls for mercy, so He doesn't do what He has threatened.
Tropologically, this is a general exhortation to everyone to gather into the society of the Church and to prevent God's wrath through repentance, so that the day of judgment does not find them unprepared.
Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth, who have carried out His judgment.
The prophet's voice is directed to the holy:
O saints and chosen ones, who fulfill the Lord's commandments, and positioned on earth you heard the voice saying:
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth, and you have imitated His meekness, and carried out justice, seek the Lord by loving and worshipping Him.
And as if to ask, who is this Lord, it is answered.
Seek the just, seek the meek, so that you may be hidden on the day of the Lord's wrath, that is, Christ, to whom the Father has given all judgment.
Therefore, the meek are commanded to seek the meek, so that what is lacking in them may be perfected by Him who is the end of all virtues.
But it should also be said that when speaking to the just and the meek, he says somewhat doubtfully: If perhaps you may be hidden on the day of the Lord's wrath, what will happen to the sinners?
Because Gaza will be destroyed, and Ashkelon will become a desert.
Ashdod will be driven out at noon, and Ekron will be uprooted.
Such, he says, will be the strength of the Chaldean army, that even the mightiest cities of the Philistines, which always resisted us with equal struggle, will be taken captive in the same way.

Mystically, Gaza, which means "his strength," symbolizes those who rely on their physical strength and worldly power. These individuals will be destroyed and reduced to nothing.
Ascalon, meaning "weighed" or "murderous fire," represents sinners who will be judged according to their crimes. The same measure they used will be measured back to them. Those who burned with the desire to shed blood and cause scandal will be led into the desert and handed over to the fires of hell.
Azotus, meaning "fire of generation," represents those who burn freely in this fire. They will be cast into outer darkness in broad daylight, while the saints receive full clarity.
Acaron, meaning "barrenness" or "uprooting," symbolizes those who have no fruit of good works and who, through perverse doctrine, turn many away from the love of God. These individuals will be uprooted from the land of the living.
Woe to you who live by the seacoast, people of destruction. With the four major cities of Palestine named, the prophetic word now addresses the whole province, predicting that those living by the sea will also be devastated.
The word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines, and I will destroy you so that there will be no inhabitant. This shows that the Philistines are Canaanites, and the prophet threatens them with such destruction that their fortified cities will become sheepfolds.
The seacoast will become a resting place for shepherds and folds for flocks. It will be for the remnant of the house of Judah, which includes Canaan or the Philistines. They will graze in the houses of Ascalon and rest in the evening.
When the sons of Judah return from captivity under Zerubbabel, Joshua, and Nehemiah, all the land of the Philistines, who were held in captivity, will become their possession. It will be so desolate that shepherds from the remnants of the Jews will make their flocks lie down in the once noble city of Ascalon in the afternoon.
This will happen because the Lord their God will visit them and restore their captivity.

According to history, in a spiritual sense, the cities of the Philistines, whose destruction is foretold, represent the pride of the Gentiles, based on the interpretation of their names. These are the inhabitants along the seacoast, as they are buffeted by various waves of errors.
With their pride destroyed, the house of Judah, representing the true confession of the Church, begins to inhabit their places. Here, piety succeeds impiety, justice drives out injustice, and humility subdues pride.
I have heard the reproach of Moab and the blasphemies of the children of Ammon, who have reproached my people. After the predicted disaster of the Philistines and the destruction of their cities, the prophet turns against Moab and the children of Ammon, foretelling the evils to come upon them because they helped the Babylonians against the people of God, overthrowing the city and the temple, and blaspheming God while mocking the captured Jews.
I have heard the reproach of Moab. This city is in Arabia and now called Areopolis, meaning the city of Mars. And the blasphemies of the children of Ammon, which is also a city in Arabia, now called Philadelphia. However, the same name is used for both the region and the city. They have expanded their territory by driving out the former inhabitants.
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah. This did not happen literally, for these cities were not overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah, nor was their land burned with sulfuric clouds and turned into ashes and cinders. The cities are still inhabited, although with changed names, and the region is cultivated.
Therefore, we must resort to the spiritual sense. Moab and Ammon were sons of Lot, born from incestuous unions. Lot means "declining," Moab means "from the father," and Ammon means "my people."

Through these, the heretics and all creators of false teachings are identified. They have turned away from the true Father God and become children of the devil. They hear from the Lord: "You are from your father, the devil," and are no longer the people of God, born in a dark cave.
These people insult the simplicity of the Church and exalt themselves beyond its boundaries, acting against what Solomon says: "Do not transgress the boundaries set by your fathers."
Therefore, under a certain admonition, it threatens them that just as those cities were physically destroyed, so will they be overthrown with eternal damnation. Fire, sulfur, and stormy wind will be their portion, a dryness of thorns and heaps of salt, and a desert forever.
Rightly, heretics are called the dryness of thorns because, like thorns, they always tear and divide the unity of the Church, withering through their impiety, and fit for nothing but to be thrown into eternal fire. They are also heaps of salt because, like salt that has lost its flavor, they are cast out from the Church and trampled by everyone.
Therefore, the remnants of my people will plunder them, and the survivors of my nation will possess them. This will happen to them because of their pride, for they blasphemed and exalted themselves over the people of the Lord of Hosts.
The Lord is terrible over them, and he will diminish all the gods of the earth, and men will worship him from their place, all the islands of the nations. This means the teachers and preachers of truth, who destroy the false knowledge of heretics and tear apart impious doctrines.
But you Ethiopians will also be killed by my sword, and he will extend his hand over the north and destroy Assyria. He will make Nineveh a desolation, dry like a desert, and flocks will lie down in its midst, all the wild animals of the nations; both the pelican and the hedgehog will lodge in its thresholds.

The Jews believe that all these prophecies about the Philistines, Moab, and the children of Ammon relate to the coming of their Christ. They expect him to arrive at the end of the world, rebuild Jerusalem, and free them from the power of all nations. According to their belief, everyone will worship him, as it is written: "And men will worship him, each from his own place, and all the islands of the nations."
Not just the nearby nations mentioned, but also the Ethiopians and Assyrians will be subdued by him. Even Nineveh will turn into a desolate place, inhabited by wild animals. This is what is meant by "The beautiful city will be turned into a desolation," as Nineveh is often understood to symbolize Babylon, especially with the similarity of creatures like the pelican and the hedgehog, which the prophet Isaiah describes as inhabiting Babylon after its destruction.
It's important to note that there are two kinds of pelicans: one aquatic and one from the wilderness. The bird is called a pelican because the Greeks call a rattle a "crotalon," and since this bird lacks a voice, it strikes its beak like cymbals, producing a sound similar to a voice.
The phrase "The voice of the singer at the window, the raven on the threshold" could refer to demons or the various bird calls often heard in deserted cities, such as those of owls, bats, and other creatures, symbolizing desolation. "I will diminish its strength" means reducing the power of Nineveh or Babylon.
In describing the downfall, the prophet almost mocks the once-glorious city, saying: "This is the glorious city, living in confidence, which said in its heart, 'I am, and there is no one else besides me.' It not only spoke this but also believed it. How has it become a desolation, a dwelling place for wild animals? Everyone who passes by will hiss and shake their hand."
Therefore, the wild animals said to inhabit the deserted city either literally lived there or symbolize the changes of nations depicted as animals.

Tropologically, Ethiopians are seen as unbelievers who have not yet shed the corruption of their old ways, symbolized by a stain of blackness. Therefore, it is warned that those who do not wish to convert to better ways and cleanse the blackness of their sins will be killed by the sword, specifically by the sharp sword of the word of God.
By repenting like the Ninevites, sin will die within them, and righteousness will live. The Lord Himself threatened this, but now the prophet speaks of God in the third person:
"And He will stretch out His hand over the north and destroy Assyria."
The north wind, the coldest wind, also called the right wind, signifies the devil, who resides in the hearts of those where charity has grown cold. The bride wants him to leave the garden of the Church, saying,
"Arise, north wind, and come, south wind."
However, he is called right by those who delight in his coldness, but in reality, he is left-handed in action.
After God stretches out His hand over the north, He will destroy Assyria, which means "leader" or rather "corrector," designating the same devil who leads all his followers to death and later rebukes those to whom he suggested sins, demanding penalties from them. The Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath of His mouth. Then beautiful Nineveh, that is, the world with its prince, will perish, so that no one will pity it.
It is not inappropriate to call the Church beautiful, which at the end of the world, under the persecution of the Antichrist, when iniquity abounds, and charity has grown cold, will be placed in desolation, with very few remaining who truly and not falsely confess to be Christians. It will be handed over to beasts and filled with monsters of vice.
The pelican, which loves solitude, designates those who separate themselves from the Church and prefer their own gatherings to it, producing the screech or crash of false doctrines rather than a true voice.
The Septuagint used the chameleon instead of the pelican, which is an animal that changes colors at different moments, designating those who are changed through various vices: now by lust, now by greed, now by cruelty, sometimes by sadness, sometimes by useless exultation.

The hedgehog, a prickly and timid animal, curls into a ball to avoid being caught.
It symbolizes those who are trapped in the thorns of sin and defend their wrongdoings, unwilling to confess to anyone.
The raven, an unclean and tearing bird, represents those who, despite their vices, slander others and speak peace to their neighbors, but harbor evil in their hearts.

Chapter Three

Woe to the defiant and redeemed city, the dove that did not listen to the voice and did not accept discipline. She did not trust in the Lord, nor did she draw near to her God.
After the captivity of various nations, the prophet turns back to the Jews, and all his speech is directed against Jerusalem. "Woe," he says, "O city, once a dove, born by the law to maintain innocence, often sinning, captured and then redeemed again."
Woe to the provoking city that leads God to bitterness with its crimes, or the provoking city that, after receiving the knowledge of piety, turned to impiety. To provoke God is to sin knowingly.
She did not listen to the Lord's command and, when corrected, refused to accept discipline. Nor did she trust in the Lord when troubled by evils. And although the Lord says, 'I am a God who is near, not a God far off,' she still did not want to draw near to Him.
Her leaders in her midst are like roaring lions. The prophet describes the kind of leaders and judges or priests they had. "Her leaders," he says, "were like lions always prowling for prey and eager to spill the blood of their subjects."
Her judges are evening wolves, leaving nothing for the morning, not leaving anything for others to snatch. Her prophets are insane, that is, raving. Unfaithful men, because they spoke as if from the mouth of the Lord, but they uttered all foolish and false things.
Her priests have polluted the holy, acted unjustly against the law, committing sacrilege in the sanctuary, claiming to act according to the law while doing everything against it. Because they acted unjustly, the Lord who is just in her midst will not do iniquity, but will give her what she deserves.
Morning by morning, that is, clearly, He will give His judgment in the light, and it will not be hidden. But the wicked did not know shame. And He did this so that the corrected city might turn for the better, but Israel did not know shame.
I have destroyed nations, and their corners are devastated. I have made their streets desolate, with no one passing through.

Their cities are desolate, with no one remaining, nor any inhabitants.
I said: Yet you will fear me, you will accept discipline, and your dwelling will not perish—because of all in which I have visited her.
Nevertheless, rising early, they corrupted all their thoughts.
For He says, through plagues I could not correct them; I hoped at least that through benefits they might be converted and repent.
Therefore, I destroyed the nations that were against you, O Judah. I desolated cities for you and made their paths impassable, so that no one would pass through them.
And after this, I sent prophets to warn and provoke you to repentance.
I did all these things so that you would fear me and accept discipline.
If you had done this, your dwelling, that is the temple, would not have perished because of the crimes you committed.
Despite the Lord doing these things, they rose early, as if by design and out of contention, to fulfill their thoughts.
They should have hurried to return to God, but instead, they hurried to carry out the evil they conceived in their minds.
These things can be applied metaphorically to the Church, which is rightly called a dove, because it has faithful people who are simple and without malice.
But within it are those who profess to know God but deny Him by their deeds, such as heretics and bad Christians; hence, it is said: She did not hear the voice of the Lord.
Their evil leaders and judges, that is, teachers and masters, are likened to lions and evening wolves.
The Lord scatters their ways, that is, their wicked actions, and will destroy the cities, that is, the confidence they have in their wicked doctrines.
He will also bring His judgment to light when the night of this age is over.
And it will not be hidden when He begins to demand the money entrusted to His servants. Then their corners, that is, their wicked pleasures that deviate from the right path, will be scattered.
But although they do these things, the Lord does not depart from her but warns that they should fear Him and accept discipline.
However, because He is just, He does not spare the sinners but restores what they deserve.

Therefore, wait for me, says the Lord, on the day of my resurrection in the future, because my judgment is to gather nations and collect kingdoms.
The Jews and our Judaizers refer to this as the times of the Antichrist. They believe that all the kingdoms of the world will be united by him under his rule, and then everyone will speak one language, that is, Hebrew, just as it was before the flood.
But we, following the blessed Jerome, refer to this as the current times of the Church. Wait for me (he says) on the day of my resurrection, meaning, prepare yourself for the time of my resurrection.
For when we prepare for a good life after sins and vices, which are the death of the soul, Christ rises in us. Because he is the head, and all the elect are his members, it is rightly said that he dies and rises with his members, just as it is said that they sit with him on his throne, as promised in the Book of Revelation: The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne.
And the Apostle: He made us alive together and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places.
It can also be understood this way. Wait for me on the day of my resurrection, that is, at the time of the final judgment, when everyone will rise, and I will rise with my rising members. Then nations will be gathered, and kingdoms will be collected, meaning the powers of the world, or the teachers of false doctrines.
And I will pour out my indignation upon them, and all the wrath of my fury. Upon those who have sinned less, the indignation of the Lord is poured out, who are designated by the nations. But upon those who are powerful in evil and heresiarchs, all the wrath of the Lord's fury is poured out.
For in the fire of my zeal, the whole earth will be devoured, meaning whatever is earthly and pertains to the works of the flesh. Therefore, what was threatened above is not of cruelty, but of mercy, with the indignation and fury poured out so that the earth, that is, the rust of sins, may be burned away.
Because then I will restore to the peoples a pure speech, so that all may call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one shoulder. Then, he says, that is, when they have cast away their errors, I will restore to them a pure speech, meaning the ancient eloquence of my confession.

This will happen when, as the Apostle says, every knee will bow in the name of Jesus in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord, bringing glory to God the Father.
This means they will serve Him with one accord, with equal devotion, accepting His gentle yoke and light burden.
Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my worshippers, the children of my dispersed people, will bring me a gift. The order of the words is: O daughter of my dispersed people, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, they will bring a gift.
He refers to the Synagogue as the daughter of the dispersed, once a daughter, now almost entirely scattered throughout the world.
The meaning is: O Israel, O Synagogue once a daughter, now dispersed and captive, even though you are tormented by jealousy and envy the salvation of the nations, yet, unwillingly, from Ethiopia (that is, from the Gentiles, black with sins and dark with unbelief), they will bring me gifts.
And now the Queen of Sheba, representing the Church of the Gentiles, will come to hear the wisdom of the true Solomon. Hence the Psalmist says: Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God.
The rivers of Ethiopia literally refer to the Nile, which is divided into seven rivers. Spiritually, the rivers of Ethiopia are the peoples of the nations who have brought offerings of gratitude and sacrifices of faith and devoted hearts to the Lord.
On that day, he says, when a multitude of nations will believe, you will not be ashamed, O daughter of my dispersed people. For all your inventions, by which you have transgressed against me, choosing Barabbas and crucifying the Son of God: Because then I will remove from among you the arrogant boasters, that is, the Pharisees and scribes, or priests, who speak great things against the Lord. And you will no longer be exalted on my holy mountain, that is, in the Church of the faithful, boasting of your noble lineage and the election of the fathers.
This happened when, after the resurrection of the Lord, as the apostles preached, one day three thousand believed, another day five thousand, and thereafter many thousands, and even many of the priests were obedient to the faith.

And I will leave among you a poor and needy people, and the remnants of Israel will trust in the name of the Lord. When the Lord removes the arrogant and proud from among His people, the poor and needy will remain—namely, the unlearned apostles, who are not supported by any worldly riches, and they will trust in the name of the Lord. For they are the remnants of Israel, of whom Isaiah spoke: "The remnants will be saved." These remnants will not commit injustice, nor will they speak lies against the Lord, and no deceitful tongue will be found in their mouths. They will not say one thing with words and plot another in their hearts. For they will be nourished by the food of the divine word, and they will be able to say with the Psalmist: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." They will safely lie down, rest in the pastures of the Church, and there will be no one to terrify them, as the faith of the believers will surpass all the cruelty of the persecutors.
These words can also refer to the second coming of the Lord, when He will have abolished all authority and power, and when finally the enemy death will be destroyed. Then the chosen ones, free from all corruption and fear of death, will safely lie down in the pastures of the blessed vision of God.
Rejoice, daughter of Zion, shout for joy, Israel. Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem. The daughter of Zion is the holy Church of the chosen ones, which stands on a watchtower, that is, in contemplation of the Lord. The Holy Spirit addresses this Church, so that it may praise and give thanks to the King of Israel, Christ the Lord, who has redeemed it and has become its righteousness, sanctification, and redemption from God. She is also the daughter of Jerusalem, who sees true peace, because Jerusalem means "vision of peace." The present Church is the daughter of the one above, Jerusalem, which is our mother. Therefore, it urges her to exult, not with any kind of exultation, but with all her heart. And the reason is given why she should rejoice and exult: The Lord has taken away your judgment, He has turned aside your enemies, the King of Israel. This means condemnation, when He forgave the iniquity of His people, having redeemed them with His precious blood.

At the end of the world, He will fully take away His judgment, redeeming her from destruction and strengthening her with mercy.
He will also turn away enemies, including all persecutors, hordes of demons, and everything contrary to eternal peace and rest.
The Lord is in your midst; you will not fear evil anymore.
For He has said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them."
And the Son Himself promises, saying, "We will come and make our home with him."
Therefore, with Him living with us and in our midst, we will not fear evil anymore. On that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, "Do not fear."
On that day, which is the end of the world, it will be said to Jerusalem, the free mother of the saints, either by angels or by the Holy Spirit, "Do not fear."
It will also be said to Zion, which means the Church itself, happily beholding God, "Do not let your hands be weak," because you will no longer do anything that you regret.
And He shows why there is such great security by adding: "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save you.
He will rejoice over you with gladness; He will be silent, not counting your sins against you.
In His love, that is, in the charity with which He loved you freely. And He will exult over you with praise, either because He made you worthy of praise or because you will praise Him with exultation."
I will gather those who strayed from the law, that is, the useless and the frivolous, who by breaking the law strayed from your bosom.
I will gather them, for they are from you, so that you no longer have shame over them, and according to the Apostle, God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew.
I will therefore gather them and bring them back to you, freeing them from the power of demons, so that you will no longer bear shame over their destruction.
It should be known that "nugas" is a Hebrew word, commonly used among the Latins.
From this, we can understand that the Hebrew language is the mother of all languages.
Behold, I will destroy all who have afflicted you at that time, and I will save the lame and gather the outcast.
This is the open consolation of the Holy Spirit to the Church in general, or specifically to each faithful soul.

There are many who criticize and mock the Church or any holy person when they see someone despising worldly things and longing for heavenly ones.
They often say:
"He is insane, he does not live like us, he avoids gatherings, he despises worldly pleasures," and other such things.
Unbelievers reproach him regarding the cross of Christ, and if they see him facing trials, it is said that even the relatives of the holy Tobit would say to him:
"Where are the acts of justice and charity that you used to do?"
Therefore, the Lord promises to take vengeance on such people, saying:
"Look, I will kill all who afflicted you at that time, and I will save the limping one,"
whether it be the afflicted Church or a faithful soul, which in this life, pressed by the persecution of the devil or his members, wavers among the storms of the world, though it walks with a firm step and solid faith.
He will save this limping and afflicted one and will gather the outcast.
The Church is indeed an outcast, and every faithful soul is an outcast among the lovers of the world, as the saints often complain and say in the Psalms:
"But now you have rejected and humiliated us."
And it is no wonder, since even the Son of God himself says to the Father from the human side:
"But you have rejected and despised, you have delayed your Christ."
"And I will make them a praise and a name in all the land of their shame, at that time when I bring you, and at the time when I gather you.
For I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes," says the Lord.
Whom will he make a praise and a name, if not the children of the outcast and the limping: namely Peter, Paul, and the other saints, whose names are gloriously magnified through the churches spread throughout the world.
This will happen when he brings and receives the children of the afflicted, when they are placed in glory, and when the Lord will boast of their victory and triumphs, just as he boasted of Job's patience against the devil.
Then they will see as blessed those whom they thought were miserable in the present.

Then they will witness their captivity being returned to the heavenly Jerusalem in eternal glory, while they themselves rise to eternal shame.
