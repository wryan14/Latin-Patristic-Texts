They will build houses but not live in them; they will plant vineyards but not drink their wine. Clearly, this speaks about the Jews, whose strength and entire army were given up for plunder during the time of captivity, their houses destroyed, and their fields and vineyards laid waste. \n    <break time=\"500ms\"/> \n    God's vengeance was not delayed, nor did His patience wait any longer. He quickly repaid them what they deserved.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Also, according to the interpretation, on the Day of Judgment, all the strength of the wicked will be given over to plunder. Those who built houses not on rock but on sand, and did not plant a chosen vineyard but a vineyard of Sodom and Gomorrah, such a plantation will perish. The great day of the Lord is near, it is very near and comes quickly. The voice of the Lord's day is bitter; the mighty will be troubled there. That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    According to the literal sense, all these things are said either about the Babylonian or the Roman captivity. Then they experienced the bitter day, those who had provoked God to bitterness. The mighty and powerful were troubled there; that day was a day of wrath because indeed they had often endured God's wrath before, but not to the end. This wrath, however, was their end because they lost their place, kingdom, and nation, and were scattered to all the ends of the world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These things can also be interpreted to refer to the end of the world, when there will be a bitter voice directed at those who are on the left, \"Go into the eternal fire,\" etc. The mighty will be troubled there because even the saints will be dissolved with fear, and the powers of heaven will be moved. It will also be a day of wrath, tribulation, and distress, when all nations will mourn, and there will be no place of escape, no one will help another. It will be a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and whirlwind, for it is necessary that darkness pursues those who, while doing evil, hated the light. It will be a day of trumpet and alarm, because (as the Apostle says) the judgment will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Et erit fortitudo eorum in direptionem, et domus\neorum in desertum, et aedificabunt domos, et\nnon habitabunt: et plantabunt vineas, et non bibent\nvinum earum. Manifeste de Judaeis dicitur,\nquorum fortitudo et omnis exercitus captivitatis\ntempore in direptionem data est, et domus destructae,\net agri et vineae vastatae. Nec prolongata est\nultio, nec ultra exspectavit patientia Dei, sed velociter\nrestituit eis quod merebantur. Sed et juxta\ntropologiam in die judicii omnis malorum fortitudo\ndabitur in direptionem. Qui aedificaverunt domos\nnon super petram, sed super arenam, nec plantaverunt\nvineam electam, sed vineam Sodomorum et\nGomorrhae. Talis ergo plantatio peribit. Juxta est dies Domini magnus, juxta et velox\n nimis. Vox diei Domini amara, tribulabitur ibi fortis. Dies irae dies illa, dies tribulationis et angustiae,\ndies calamitatis et miseriae. Juxta litteram omnia\nhaec vel de Babylonica, vel de Romana captivitate\ndicuntur. Tunc enim experti sunt diem amaram,\nqui Deum ad amaritudinem provocaverant. Tribulati\nsunt ibi fortes et potentes, fuit dies illa dies\nirae, quia saepe quidem antea sustinuerant iram\nDei, sed non in consummatione. Haec autem ira finis\neorum fuit, quia perdiderunt locum, regnum,\net gentem, et in omnes mundi terminos dispersi\nsunt. Possunt haec tropologice referri ad consummationem\nsaeculi, quando erit vox amara, quae dirigetur\nad eos qui in sinistris erunt, Ite in ignem\naeternum, etc. Tribulabitur ibi fortis, quia etiam\n sancti pavore solventur, et virtutes coelorum movebantur. Erit quoque dies irae, tribulationis et angustiae,\nquando plangent omnes gentes, et nullus\nerit effugii locus, nullus alteri auxiliabitur. Erit\ndies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nebulae et turbinis,\nquod necesse est ut eos persequantur tenebrae,\nqui dum male agerent, odio habebant lucem. Erit dies tubae et clangoris, quod (ut Apostolus\nait) fiet judicium in momento, in ictu oculi, in novissima\ntuba."

      "original_latin": "Haec autem omnia erunt super civitates\nmunitas, id est super omnem mundi confidentiam\net praesumptionem. Et super angelos\nexcelsos, opera videlicet perversa, et rectam Domini\nviam declinantia. Et tribulabo homines, et ambulabunt ut caeci,\n quia Domino peccaverunt, et effundetur sanguis\neorum sicut humus, et corpus, sicut stercora, sed\net argentum eorum et aurum eorum non poterit liberare\neos in die irae furoris Domini.

Tunc ambulaverunt,\nut caeci, ignorantes quid agerent; et quia fuderant\nsanguinem prophetarum, et sanguinem ejus qui est\nDominus prophetarum, idcirco effusus est sanguis\neorum sicut humus, et corpora eorum jacuerunt\ninsepalta velut stercora. Divitiae quoque eorum iniquitate\n et nimia sollicitudine quaesitae, non poterunt\nliberare dominos et possessores suos, quia ignis\nirae Domini devorabit eos et omnem terram regni\nillorum.

Qui ergo hunc animae sanguinem\nfuderit, id est qui hominem malo exemplo\nvel perversa doctrina necaverit fundetur, in die\njudicii sanguis ejus, id est si quid vitale in bonis\noperibus videbatur habere, cogetur amittere."
