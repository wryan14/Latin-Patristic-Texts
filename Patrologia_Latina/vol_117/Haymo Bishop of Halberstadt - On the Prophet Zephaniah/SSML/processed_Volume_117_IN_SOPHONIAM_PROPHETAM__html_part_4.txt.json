Quia ex te erant,\nut ultra non habeas super eis opprobrium, et secundum\nApostolum non repulit Deus plebem suam\nquam praescivit. Hos ergo congregabo et reducam\nad te, liberans eos de potestate daemonum, ut non\namplius de eorum perditione sustineas opprobrium. Sciendum nugas Hebraeum esse verbum, apud\nLatinos usitatum. Unde scire possumus Hebraeam\nlinguam matrem esse omnium linguarum. Ecce ego interficiam omnes qui afflixerunt te in\n tempore illo, et salvabo claudicantem, et eam quae\nejecta fuerat, congregabo. Aperta Spiritus sancti\nconsolatio ad Ecclesiam generaliter, vel specialiter ad\nunam quamque fidelem animam."

Solent enim dicere: Insanus est, non sic\nvivit ut nos, conventus hominum fugit, delicias\nmundi spernit, et caetera hujusmodi. Qui vero infideles\nsunt, exprobrant illi crucem Christi, et si in aliqua\neum viderint tentatione, dicitur quod et Tobiae\nsancto propinqui dicebant: Ubi sunt justitiae et\neleemosynae quas faciebas? Pollicetur ergo Dominus\nde talibus se facturum vindictam: Ecce, inquiens,\n interficiam omnes qui afflixerunt te in tempore\nillo, et salvabo claudicantem, sive afflictam\nEcclesiam, vel fidelem animam, quae in praesenti\nvita, diaboli vel membrorum ejus persecutione pressa,\nnutat inter procellas saeculi, cum tamen fixo\ngradu et solido gressu fidei ambulet. Hanc ergo\nclaudicantem et afflictam salvabit, et abjectam congregabit. Abjecta quippe est Ecclesia, abjecta omnis\nfidelis anima apud saeculi amatores, ut saepissime\nin psalmis sancti queruntur et dicunt: Nunc autem\nrepulisti et confudisti nos. Nec mirum, cum ipse\nquoque Dei Filius ex parte humanitatis dicat Patri:\nTu vero repulisti et despexisti, distulisti Christum\ntuum. Et ponam eos in laudem, et in nomen in\n omni terra confusionis eorum, in tempore illo quo\nadducam vos, et in tempore quo congregabo vos. Dabo enim vos in nomen et in laudem omnibus populis\nterrae, cum convertero captivitatem vestram\ncoram oculis vestris, dicit Dominus. Quos ponet\nin laudem et nomen, nisi filios abjectae et claudicantis:\nPetrum videlicet, Paulum, et reliquos sanctos,\nquorum nomina cum gloria magnificantur per\necclesias toto orbe diffusas. Hoc autem fiet, cum ad\n ducet et suscipiet filios afflictae, cum fuerint positi in\ngloriam, et cum de eorum victoria et triumphis fuerit\ngloriatus Dominus, sicut et de patientia Job gloriabatur\ncontra diabolum. Tunc videbunt esse felices,\nquos in praesenti putabant miseros."
