00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,192
Book Against the Erroneous Definitions of John Scotus Eriugena
by Florus of Lyon

2
00:00:06,192 --> 00:00:08,613
From the Great Library of the Fathers.

3
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:22,632
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we begin the little book by FLORI against the nonsense and errors of a very vain man named John, concerning predestination, divine foreknowledge, and the true freedom of human will.

4
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:23,712
Preface

5
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:28,596
Some writings have come to the Church of Lyon from a certain conceited and talkative individual.

6
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:38,211
While discussing divine foreknowledge and predestination using human and, as he boasts, philosophical arguments, he offers no reasoning or authority from the Scriptures or the holy Fathers.

7
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:43,706
He dares to define these matters as if they should be accepted and followed based solely on his presumption.

8
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:53,779
These writings are easily judged and rejected by faithful readers well-versed in sacred doctrine because they are extremely vain, full of lies, and contain errors against the faith and truth of God.

9
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:56,882
With God's help, they are even held in contempt and ridicule.

10
00:00:56,882 --> 00:01:01,766
However, as we have heard, this same man is admired by many as if he were scholarly and learned.

11
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:09,805
By chattering or writing such things, he leads some into hesitation and others, as if he were saying something profound, into becoming followers of his error.

12
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:15,045
He occupies all his listeners and admirers with his vain verbosity and windy chatter most perniciously.

13
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:22,218
As a result, they do not humbly submit to the divine Scriptures or the authorities of the Fathers, but rather follow his fantastical ravings.

14
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:30,613
Therefore, we deemed it absolutely necessary, with the zeal of charity and the duty of our place and order, to respond to his insolence, with the Lord as our author.

15
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:42,263
Whoever wishes to read this faithfully, with the fear of God and care for their salvation, may truly recognize how essential it is in these perilous and extreme times to cling firmly to the unchanging truth of the holy Scripture.

16
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:59,968
They should humbly obey the most established authority of the holy orthodox Fathers, close and block their ears to undisciplined and most vain verbosity, and fear that saying of the Lord with full intention, which we almost see being fulfilled now, where He says: "Do you think, when the Son of Man comes, He will find faith on earth?" (Luke 18:8).

17
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:53,328
And what the Apostle, in whom the same Lord spoke, sternly warns, saying:
"For there will be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, they will heap up teachers for themselves, having itching ears;
and they will turn their ears away from the truth and be turned aside to fables"
Second Timothy 4:4-5
Therefore, elsewhere, under the persona of the beloved and chosen disciple, he most diligently admonishes every faithful person, and especially the pastoral order, saying:
"O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding profane and idle babblings and the contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.
By professing it, some have strayed concerning the faith"
First Timothy 6:20-21
Therefore, with the words set forth, which he arranged in nineteen chapters of his work, as the Lord deigns to grant, we undertake to respond not with our own understanding, but in accordance with the Holy Scriptures and the most blessed Catholic Fathers.

18
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:58,442
He claimed that all questions of philosophy could be resolved through four fundamental principles.

19
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:01,000
He argued that there are not two predestinations.

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,743
However, the faith of the Church responds by affirming that the truth of God's eternal judgment and ordination-expressed by the term predestination-should be sought not from philosophers, but from God's apostles and prophets.

21
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:21,459
This truth is not found in the fourfold paths of worldly doctrine but in the one true way, which speaks of itself: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).

22
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:32,785
Blessed Jeremiah the prophet urges and invites us to this way, saying: "Stand by the roads and look, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in it, and find rest for your souls" (Jeremiah 6:16).

23
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:46,824
Concerning this way, the prophet Isaiah promises the Church, saying: "And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness.
The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way.
Wicked fools will not go about on it" (Isaiah 35:8).

24
00:03:46,824 --> 00:04:06,031
Therefore, whoever chooses to be foolish in this age for Christ's sake and strives to obey the Apostle, who says: "If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise" (First Corinthians 3:18), should steadfastly and unwaveringly hold to this true way, the good way, the straight way, which is the Lord Christ himself.

25
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:20,279
They should shun the cunning and deception of human wisdom, about which the same Apostle says: "For it is written: 'He catches the wise in their craftiness'" (First Corinthians 3:19); and again: "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile" (Psalm 94:11).

26
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:29,726
Therefore, the question of divine predestination is not resolved through such philosophy and empty deceit but rather confused and entangled, compounded with various lies and errors.

27
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:42,224
The predestination of God's eternal counsel and judgment, whether in rewarding the just or condemning the wicked, is based on His simple and divine knowledge, where everything is simultaneously and eternally preordained and predetermined.

28
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:43,392
We truly call this one.

29
00:04:43,392 --> 00:06:15,570
And because of its double effect, by which some are mercifully saved and others justly condemned, we do not hesitate to call it two; faithfully saying with the Psalmist to the judge of all:
"I will sing of mercy and judgment to you, O Lord"
Psalm 101:1.
And faithfully listening to the same judge declaring in the Gospel that this mystery of predestination was eternally arranged with the Father, and wonderfully fulfilled in the blindness of some and the enlightenment of others, when rejoicing in the Holy Spirit, He says:
"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for it was pleasing in your sight"
Matthew 11:25, 27.
For what could be said more clearly about both sides than that by His coming He declares that the proud are blinded and the humble are enlightened; this is indeed:
"Because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to little children."
And what could be firmer and stronger about the just and merciful predestination of both things, than what He immediately added in agreement, saying:
"Yes, Father, for it was pleasing in your sight."
And because the Father has given all judgment to the Son: and He, together with the Father, in eternal counsel established and predetermined all these things, which He distinguishes and judges in the world in their own times, He immediately adds about Himself:
"All things have been delivered to me by my Father"
Matthew 11:27.
All things, specifically both to be saved and to be condemned, and justly to be blinded and mercifully to be enlightened, as He says elsewhere:
"For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind"
John 9:39.

30
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:23,519
This is the righteous judgment of God, as the Lord and Savior Himself praises and refers to it with thanksgiving to the glory of the Father.

31
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:39,437
Similarly, all divine Scripture and the entire holy Catholic Church, in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs that it customarily offers to God, faithfully celebrate by praising and giving thanks, saying with the Psalmist:
The Lord is righteous in all His ways and holy in all His works.

32
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:44,986
(Psalm 145:17)
And what the lawgiver says in the song of Deuteronomy:
Ascribe greatness to our God.

33
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:51,825
The works of God are perfect, and all His ways are just: a faithful God who does no wrong; righteous and holy is the Lord.

34
00:06:51,825 --> 00:07:02,082
(Deuteronomy 32:3-4)
Similarly, in the psalm, when it was said generally about the elect being saved and the reprobates being damned:
The Lord is near to all who call on Him in truth.

35
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:06,622
He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them.

36
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:10,826
The Lord watches over all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.

37
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:20,523
(Psalm 145:18-20)
The righteous judgment of both parties is commended with abundant and general praise, as it immediately follows:
My mouth will speak in praise of the Lord.

38
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,718
Let every creature praise His holy name forever and ever.

39
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:34,087
(Psalm 145:21)
Similarly, in another psalm, after setting forth the praise of God, immediately recalling the righteous judgment of God in His praises, he says:
Praise the Lord, my soul.

40
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:38,740
I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.

41
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,345
(Psalm 146:1)
And shortly after:
He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry.

42
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:52,080
The Lord sets prisoners free, the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous.

43
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,806
The Lord watches over the foreigner and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but He frustrates the ways of the wicked.

44
00:07:58,806 --> 00:07:59,647
(Psalm 146:7-9)

45
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:09,708
In the book of Revelation, after the final judgment and the reward of the righteous and the damnation of the wicked, the saints offer praise and thanksgiving to God for both outcomes.

46
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:22,483
It is written in the same book:
The twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying:
We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and reigned.

47
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:36,424
The nations were angry, but your wrath has come, and the time has come for the dead to be judged: to reward your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who have corrupted the earth (Revelation 11:16-18).

48
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:50,263
Many such things are found in the Holy Scriptures in various ways, so there is nothing better for a faithful person than to recognize and faithfully praise the just judgment of God in both aspects, by saying:
You are just, Lord, and your judgment is right (Psalms 119:137).

49
00:08:50,263 --> 00:09:14,747
The holy Fathers and doctors of the Church also diligently advise that this should be done, as the blessed Pope Leo exhorts in a certain place, saying:
And the blessed Augustine, when he was explaining the words of the psalm to the people, where it is written:
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish before God (Psalms 68:2):
Who, he says, will boast that he has a pure heart, or who will boast that he is clean from sins?

50
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:22,351
Therefore, when Scripture says: As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish before God, who does not tremble, who does not leap up in fear?

51
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:24,785
What then shall we do, and what hope do we have?

52
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,711
For these things are not sung in vain.

53
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:32,439
Or indeed, when the Prophet says these things, does he wish them for men, and not rather foresee what is to come?

54
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:38,370
In these words, there appears the figure of one wishing, but it is understood as the foreknowledge of one announcing.

55
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:52,869
Just as some things in the Scripture of the prophets are narrated as if they happened in the past when they are foretold for the future, some things are said as if by the wish of one desiring: but those who rightly understand what they hear, recognize the vision of the one foretelling.

56
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,884
As in ancient words, future events are signified.

57
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:59,827
So, in the figure of one wishing or foretelling, the mind must be understood.

58
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:05,613
Similarly, regarding Judas, the Lord's betrayer, the Prophet seems to wish upon him what he predicted would come.

59
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:18,823
And about the Jews themselves: "Let their table become a snare and a trap and a stumbling block" (Psalm 69:23); which the Apostle explains as being predicted about them (Romans 11:9); just as Peter recalls what was foretold about Judas under the same figure.

60
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:26,401
It is not without reason that things to come are spoken of as if they were past: for to God, if they are certain, they are regarded as already done.

61
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:38,383
The Prophet seems to speak as one wishing what he foresees to be certain to come: indicating nothing else, in my view, except that we should not be displeased with God's known judgment, which He has established as fixed and immovable.

62
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:49,442
Therefore, in the Acts of the Apostles, when a prophet named Agabus predicted that Paul would suffer many things from the Jews in Jerusalem and even face imprisonment, the brothers tried to stop him from going there.

63
00:10:49,442 --> 00:11:04,650
Paul said, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 21:10 and following); and when the brothers saw his unwavering determination, they said: "May the will of the Lord be done" (Acts 21:14).

64
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:26,206
So, because they said, "May the will of the Lord be done," did the apostles wish that he would suffer such things? Or did they rather devoutly submit their minds to the sublime and divine decree?
Similarly, when the Prophet says, "As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish before God," he sees this certainly impending upon sinners; and he is pleased with what God has decreed, lest he himself displease God.

65
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:35,311
After these words, the most blessed doctor wanted to make sure that the fixed and unchangeable divine judgment of predestination didn't seem to force anyone to act wrongly.

66
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:42,136
Instead, he wanted to instill a healthy fear, encouraging those who hear it to repent and correct themselves to avoid the coming wrath.

67
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:49,265
He exhorts by saying:
The most faithful doctor affirmed the unchangeable truth of divine predestination, even in the condemnation of sinners.

68
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:54,927
Yet, he sincerely taught that if they correct themselves and change for the better, they will escape punishment.

69
00:11:54,927 --> 00:12:01,955
Divine predestination exercises just judgment in punishing sinners but does not take away the remedy of salvation from anyone who converts.

70
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:14,291
His promise is true and faithful, as He declares through the prophet, not only promising but also swearing:
"As I live, says the Lord God, I do not desire the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live" (Ezekiel 33:11).

71
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:19,727
Chapter Two
In this second chapter, we encounter eight definitions:

72
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:19,836
1.

73
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:25,393
Predestination and God's foreknowledge are part of His essence, just like His will, wisdom, and truth.

74
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:25,502
2.

75
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:28,008
Foreknowledge and predestination are the same.

76
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:28,117
3.

77
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:33,837
One cannot reach God, whom they abandoned by free will, without the gift of cooperating grace and effort.

78
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:33,946
4.

79
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:38,140
Predestination exists in God by substance, but relatively, it cannot be done.

80
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,249
5.

81
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:47,237
Just as it is impious to duplicate, triplicate, or multiply God's essence, wisdom, knowledge, and virtues, anyone asserting two predestinations is guilty of impiety.

82
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:47,346
6.

83
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:52,358
There is one divine predestination, just as there is one divine operation, wisdom, and will.

84
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:52,467
7.

85
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:56,389
Predestination is not compelled by necessity, just as it is not by will.

86
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,498
8.

87
00:12:56,498 --> 00:13:01,238
Whatever is understood about the divine will should also apply to God's predestination.

88
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:11,261
Notice how much he has laid out, as if to be followed by everyone and judged by no one, without any testimony from divine Scripture or any attestation from the doctrine of the fathers.

89
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,677
He defined so many things.

90
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:19,650
But with the Lord's help, we will carefully examine each one and discern what should be believed according to the rule of faith.

91
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:25,697
He says: Predestination and God's foreknowledge are part of His essence, just like His will, wisdom, and truth.

92
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:33,977
But we assert that His will is essentially part of the Lord because in His supreme and simple essence, there is no difference between willing and being.

93
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:39,207
What it is to be is to will, and therefore His will is in Him in such a way that He is His will.

94
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:46,942
Similarly, regarding wisdom and truth: He possesses wisdom in such a way that He is wisdom; He possesses truth in such a way that He is truth.

95
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:54,787
In the simple nature of Divinity, there is no difference between having and being; what it is to have is to be, and what it is to be is to have.

96
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:09,462
Therefore, if we say, as the blessed Augustine says: eternal, immortal, incorruptible, unchangeable, living, wise, powerful, beautiful, just, good, blessed, spirit; out of all these, the last one mentioned, spirit, seems to signify the substance alone.

97
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,711
The others, however, signify the qualities of this substance.

98
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:15,534
But it is not so in that ineffable and simple nature.

99
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:21,553
For whatever seems to be said there according to qualities, must be understood according to substance or essence.

100
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:27,040
However, let it not be that God is called spirit according to substance, and good according to quality.

101
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,407
Instead, both are according to substance; as are all the others we have mentioned.

102
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:51,914
Therefore, since this is the case, and these three-that is, will, wisdom, and truth-are in God in such a way as to absolutely show the nature of God, who is the highest will, the highest wisdom, and truth, having all power, surpassing all understanding, and remaining unchangeable above all, it is clear that the rule of God is that they are understood to be said of God substantially.

103
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:58,519
It is also clear that knowledge in God must be understood essentially, because for Him, being is not different from knowing.

104
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,756
What it is for Him to be, this is to know.

105
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:07,681
Nor is it different for Him to have knowledge than to be knowledge, just as it is the same for Him to have wisdom as to be wisdom.

106
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:17,109
However, whether God can be said to be foreknowledge substantially, as He is said to be knowledge substantially, let him judge according to reason and the rule of faith who can.

107
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:29,839
Yet, it seems to us that, just as it is truly said of God: There is no difference for Him between being and knowing, it cannot be said of Him without falsehood or excessive use: There is no difference for Him between being and foreknowing.

108
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,923
For it can rightly and commonly be said: God is knowledge, just as it is rightly and commonly said: God is wisdom, there is no doubt.

109
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:41,877
But to say: God is foreknowledge, as we have already said, is either not true or too unusual.

110
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:47,470
A similar or even harsher reasoning applies to what he defined, that God is substantially predestination.

111
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:52,688
Who has ever heard it said that God's being and His predestining are different things?

112
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:58,462
It is truly said about Him: His being and His knowing are not different; for Him, to be is the same as to know.

113
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:03,663
Therefore, we must say that just as God is knowledge, wisdom, and truth, God is also predestination.

114
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:16,301
However, for us, it seems better and more fitting to true faith and church teachings to view these concepts differently: although knowledge, foreknowledge, and predestination appear different to us, we distinguish them with certain properties.

115
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:22,230
Knowledge is spoken of absolutely, while foreknowledge and predestination refer to the provision of future events.

116
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,576
Foreknowledge concerns knowing good and evil beforehand, while predestination is about establishing and ordering the good.

117
00:16:28,576 --> 00:16:40,226
This distinction is necessary so that for us, who are temporal and mortal, both God's complete knowledge and His governance of creatures are more distinctly conveyed and understood through such a distinction or distribution.

118
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:52,188
However, it is more convenient to understand these three in God under one name: knowledge, because whatever we understand and know distinctly in these three is simultaneously present in His supreme, singular, and simple knowledge.

119
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:58,534
His knowing is perfect and complete; it cannot be diminished or increased, nor can it be altered by any variety of things.

120
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:07,427
Therefore, what we attempt to distinguish about His knowledge, foreknowledge, and predestination is, in His perfect and unchangeable knowledge, eternally one and the same.

121
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:19,570
Therefore, we believe it has been correctly observed by ecclesiastical discipline that it is proper and customary to speak of God's foreknowledge and predestination, as the Creator and Judge of all, in relation to His works.

122
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:32,235
It is also proper and customary to say that foreknowledge and predestination exist in God, that is, in His eternal, perfect, and unchangeable knowledge; but it is neither customary nor proper to say that God is foreknowledge or predestination.

123
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:37,395
For His knowledge refers to Himself; foreknowledge and predestination, however, refer to creatures.

124
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:44,327
Hence, in these, His operation, which is performed in or towards these creatures, is demonstrated more than His essence or substance.

125
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:54,022
Thus, we speak of God's foreknowledge and predestination or of foreknowledge and predestination in God, just as we speak of God's order or arrangement or of order and arrangement in God.

126
00:17:54,022 --> 00:18:06,322
However, we have never heard anyone speak so absurdly or contentiously as to say that, just as we speak of God's order and arrangement, we should say that God Himself is order and arrangement, or should be described and defined as such.

127
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:09,449
The reason for this new and contentious definition is clear.

128
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:21,384
There is a fear that if foreknowledge and predestination, like God's governance, are not understood substantially in relation to God, but are referred to the ordering of His creatures, then it cannot be said to be dual or plural.

129
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:43,952
Therefore, among us, there is no contention about whether predestinations can be spoken of in the plural or not, as long as we faithfully and firmly hold that, by one and the same judgment and council of divine foreknowledge and predestination, two things are certain to be fulfilled: that the just are preordained to eternal glory, and that the wicked, persisting in their impieties until death, are destined for eternal punishment.

130
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:57,034
For the Scripture clearly says both: about the just, "And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48); and about the wicked justly condemned, "God endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" (Romans 9:22).

131
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:14,059
This is how both of these things are accomplished in the elect and the reprobate by one and the same effect of divine predestination and judgment: just as by one and the same ray of the sun, healthy eyes are invigorated and weak eyes are irritated; just as also by one and the same fire, mud placed near it hardens, and wax melts.

132
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,177
We should also acknowledge that we must think of God's predestination just as we think of His justice.

133
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:27,254
Although it is one and remains the same, it clearly receives a double distribution: through it, rewards are given to the worthy, and punishments to the unworthy.

134
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:33,375
Surely, he asserts that the will of God, as well as wisdom and truth in God, are said essentially, which is truly correct.

135
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:37,840
For if he were to say that God is substantially justice, he would be speaking very truly.

136
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:46,218
Why then are these two things, which are said to be substantial in God, or even God substantially, namely His will and His truth, read in the Scriptures in the plural?

137
00:19:46,218 --> 00:20:45,418
As it is held in the Psalms, where the Lord Himself says: "He made all my wills wonderful in them;" and elsewhere: "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will do all my wills."
Likewise, we read in the Psalms: "The Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness." And again: "For truths are diminished among the sons of men." And in another place: "For the Lord requires truths."
Although the light of God and the truth of God are not different, but are simply one and truly believed in God, so that what is the light of God is the truth of God, and what is truth is light. However, when the Psalmist said: "Send out Your light and Your truth," he immediately added in the plural: "They have led me, and brought me to Your holy mountain and to Your tabernacles."
Why this? Because the will, justice, and truth of God, although they are one and simple in His nature, yet in the distribution of His gifts, or in the disposition of His creatures, they become manifold to us. In the same way, the Holy Spirit, who is one and simple in person in the Trinity, is called the manifold grace of God and the seven Spirits because of this same distribution of gifts.

138
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:51,136
We repeat these points so that readers understand there should be no dispute or contention about the number.

139
00:20:51,136 --> 00:21:03,875
Whether the predestination of God can be referred to in the plural, or for any valid reason cannot be, as long as it is clear that there are two effects: mercifully preordained to life for the elect, or justly preordained to punishment for the reprobate.

140
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:15,611
Blessed Augustine teaches that just as we can speak of wisdom, we can also speak of prudence or the knowledge of the Lord, with these words: "Your knowledge from me has grown strong, and I will not be able to attain it" (Psalm 139:6).

141
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:23,886
Observe how the distinguished teacher, thinking and speaking excellently about God, confidently said that God is prudence, and openly declared that God is knowledge.

142
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:34,017
However, when considering whether God should also be called providence, which certainly belongs to God and is in God, referring to the governance of creation, he refrained from making a rash definition.

143
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:40,738
Instead, faced with great difficulty and distress, he chose to end the discussion with an exclamation of admiration and prayer to God.

144
00:21:40,738 --> 00:21:47,810
By this example, we should all reflect and speak reverently about God: think moderately and disciplined, and define cautiously and fearfully.

145
00:21:47,810 --> 00:22:14,240
Following these points, the aforementioned disputant, in his usual manner, adds: "And foreknowledge and predestination are one and the same."
But we, rejecting this novel error, should adhere to the most certain and firm rule of faith. With God's help, we should discern that foreknowledge is sometimes spoken of, which cannot be predestination. This is because Almighty God foreknew future good and evil, including the sins of men or angels.
However, He, being just and holy, could not have predestined that they should occur.

146
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:27,937
However, His predestination pertains either to the creation and governance of creatures, which is certainly good and just, or especially and chiefly to His works or judgments, which He performs or will perform in rational creatures, namely, angels and humans.

147
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:33,399
Among them, He justifies and blesses some through grace, and abandons and condemns others through justice.

148
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:44,065
The good things of the saints, including holy humans and holy angels, are His gifts or rewards, while the evils of others, such as eternal punishments, are His just retribution, dispensing all things justly.

149
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:50,970
Therefore, His predestination is always to be understood in the good things and in His works, which He exercises mercifully or justly.

150
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,040
What He both foreknew by predestining and eternally predestined by foreknowing.

151
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,420
Hence, it is clear that the predestination of God cannot exist without foreknowledge.

152
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:07,149
Indeed, foreknowledge accompanies predestination in the good and just works of God, but it stands alone in the evil works of wicked humans and angels.

153
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:59,759
The aforementioned Father, the blessed Augustine, illustrates this most concisely in "On the Predestination of the Saints," chapter 10. Also, in "On the Gift of Perseverance," chapter 14, he states that from all the words of the holy doctor, it is evident that foreknowledge and predestination must be distinctly and properly understood in the holy books. They should not be viewed as one and the same, as some might define them, despite their significant differences. However, sometimes the same doctor shows that predestination, which is never without foreknowledge, is also referred to by the name of foreknowledge, as he mentions in chapter 18: Behold what one must follow, who desires to think sanely, purely, and sincerely about divine foreknowledge and predestination according to the pious understanding of the holy Father. However, the new disputant's definition, which treats these two as one and the same with such great distinction and diligence, should rightly be utterly rejected for its falsity and deceit.

154
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:08,222
Whether he intended to define this to show that these things-as he previously mentioned-are fundamentally one in God, his assertion is empty and meaningless.

155
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:15,137
Or if he meant to teach that these things in the Scriptures should be understood without distinction, it is a clear and obvious error.

156
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:23,239
The same debater adds: A person who abandoned God by free will without effort cannot reach God without the effort of study and the gift of cooperating grace.

157
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,006
In these words, he first says that the person abandoned God by free will.

158
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:37,276
Certainly, in the one abandoning God and abandoned by God, there was no free will towards good-that blessed freedom commended by the Apostle saying: Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

159
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,856
Second Corinthians chapter three, verse seventeen.

160
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:43,417
But there was only free will towards evil, captive to dominating sin.

161
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:51,210
About this miserable freedom and servitude, the Apostle says to converted believers: For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.

162
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,913
Romans chapter six, verse twenty.

163
00:24:52,913 --> 00:25:03,853
And again: Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?

164
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,608
Romans chapter six, verse sixteen.

165
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:09,168
Hence the Lord also says: Everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.

166
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:11,181
John chapter eight, verse thirty-three.

167
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:15,929
And the blessed apostle Peter says: For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.

168
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,045
Second Peter chapter two, verse nineteen.

169
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:28,882
The blessed Paul also speaks about the captivity of sin, saying: I see another law at work in my members, waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.

170
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:30,998
Romans chapter seven, verse twenty-three.

171
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:45,070
Therefore, as it has been said, when man abandoned God and was abandoned by God, he became free from righteousness, which he did not want to serve, and a slave to sin leading to death, because he did not want to be a servant of obedience to righteousness.

172
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:51,252
And by this, he began to have in his members a law opposing the law of his mind, and capturing him into the law of sin.

173
00:25:51,252 --> 00:27:25,432
Thus, losing the grace of true freedom, by which he could cling to God and say:
"But for me, it is good to cling to God" Psalm seventy-two, twenty-eight. He adhered to sin with the unfortunate freedom of his will and became a slave and captive of sin. From this slavery and captivity, he cannot escape or be freed except through Him who said:
"If the Son sets you free, you will be truly free" John eight, thirty-six.
And so, when man deserted God, he clearly lost the freedom to do good and remained free only to do evil. Hence, we do not understand why such a freedom should be praised in him, rather than being erased and avoided.
Moreover, what is said, that without the effort of work and the gift of cooperating grace, man cannot reach God, the Catholic faith holds otherwise, which most certainly believes, according to the gospel and apostolic truth, that no good work, no preceding merit, but only by the benefit of divine grace, man is saved and comes to God.
As the Lord Himself says:
"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" John six, forty-four. And the Apostle diligently emphasizes to the faithful, saying:
"To the one who does not work but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness" Romans four, five.
And again:
"We conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law" Romans three, twenty-eight.
And lest they should attribute even that faith to themselves, those who come to God and thus think they are saved by their own merit and not by the free gift of God, he shows elsewhere that even faith itself is a gift of God, when he says:
"You have been saved by grace through faith; and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast" Ephesians two, eight through nine.

174
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:34,058
God, as the Apostle recalls, speaks through the prophet, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me" (Isaiah 65:1).

175
00:27:34,058 --> 00:28:18,165
Or as it is read in our edition, "Those who did not ask for me sought me, and those who did not seek me found me." This is clear evidence of grace without works, where people who weren't seeking God not only find Him but also reach Him. This is similar to countless little children who, without performing any good deeds, are brought to God through the faith of the Church and the grace of regeneration. When reborn from water and the Spirit at such a young age, they are absolved from original sin and reach God without a doubt. To think otherwise, believing that one cannot reach God without their own effort, is not Catholic but Pelagian. In a little book titled "Ecclesiastical Dogmas" by Gennadius of Marseilles, chapter 21, there is a definition. However, as we mentioned (and some other things in the same book), it contains errors of Pelagianism.

176
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:26,326
So, anyone reading it for other useful insights should remember the Apostle's advice: "Test everything; hold fast to what is good" (First Thessalonians 5:21).

177
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:31,336
He adds that predestination in God is according to substance but cannot be considered relatively.

178
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:35,416
On this, our better or more suitable interpretation has already been mentioned.

179
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:46,882
Since he added that predestination cannot be relative to God, it clearly does not refer to predestination to God as it does within the Holy Trinity-the Father to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both.

180
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:51,892
Nor does it relate to the Word of God, where the Son is referred to the Father, whose Word He is.

181
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:56,695
Similarly, when the Son is called the image, He is referred to the Father, whose image He is.

182
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:03,306
And when He is called the brightness of glory, He is referred to the eternal light, from which He is and whose brightness He is.

183
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:08,050
For the radiance is the eternal light, Wisdom of Solomon 7:26, as Scripture attests.

184
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:14,648
Unlike the gift of God, when properly understood as the Holy Spirit, it is referred to the Father and the Son, whose gift it is.

185
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:21,040
In the holy and supreme Trinity, these things are uniquely related to each other, and no one can be said to be of the other.

186
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:33,256
There is one Father who begets, one Son who is begotten, and one Holy Spirit who proceeds: one Word, one image, and splendor of the Father, which is the only-begotten Son: one gift of God the Father and the Son, which is the Holy Spirit.

187
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:38,360
Each person is understood in such a way that the property of each cannot be transferred to another.

188
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:46,246
For example, the Father can never be called the Son, nor can the Son be naturally understood as the Father, nor the Holy Spirit as the Father or the Son.

189
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:56,917
It is clear, therefore, as we have said, that predestination is not related to God in the same way that the Father is related to the Son, the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to the Father and the Son.

190
00:29:56,917 --> 00:30:02,278
There is no predestination within the Trinity of persons, such that it would naturally refer to another.

191
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,721
However, predestination is entirely related to God, that is, to the whole Trinity, which predestines whatever is predestined.

192
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:16,711
Without a doubt, predestination is related to the predestiner, just as governance is to the governor, planning to the planner, and ordering to the orderer.

193
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:27,742
Nor has anyone ever been so absurd and inappropriately contentious as to say that God, who arranges everything, is the arrangement; who governs everything, is the governance; who orders everything, is the ordering.

194
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:42,536
We believe that no one has ever said that the one who predestines everything to be predestined is the predestination, since all these things, as we have already said-planning, governance, ordering, predestination-are more understood to refer to the works or the operation of the Creator.

195
00:30:43,103 --> 00:31:00,383
But this person, even if he tries to argue that God is essentially predestination, just as He is truth, goodness, and justice-implying that predestination should be spoken of in the singular just like God, truth, goodness, and justice-cannot make it so that the predestination of God can also be substantially called God.

196
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:09,750
Nor does it have a dual effect and distribution of works, namely either in the preparation of the righteous for life or in the predetermination of the wicked for destruction.

197
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:17,394
Because even though justice is truly called God, God is not understood substantially with it, and it is rightly pronounced in the plural form.

198
00:31:17,394 --> 00:31:25,415
Yet, the justice of God, which is also God, without a doubt has a dual effect: either in the reward of the good or in the condemnation of the wicked.

199
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:49,800
Therefore, when predestination is rightly referred to in relation to God who predestines, just as disposition is to the one who arranges, governance to the one who governs, ordination to the one who ordains, operation to the one who works, and creation to the one who creates, even if it can be reasoned that predestination of God should be said substantially, the dual effect declared by the unchanging truth of the Holy Scriptures cannot be nullified.

200
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,137
What does this excessive or even deceitful argumentation mean?

201
00:31:53,137 --> 00:32:05,034
However, he continues and says: Just as it is impious to duplicate, triple, or multiply essences, wisdoms, knowledges, virtues, and all other things that are said about God, so it is impious to assert two predestinations.

202
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:15,531
To these words, we respond that this is indeed true because essence, wisdom, knowledge, and virtue, when said about God, or God Himself is understood to be essence, wisdom, knowledge, and virtue.

203
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:17,900
These are not to be spoken of in the plural.

204
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:27,643
Because the Trinity itself is not three essences, but one essence; not three wisdoms, but one wisdom; not three knowledges, but one knowledge; and not three virtues, but one virtue.

205
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:40,776
However, when referring to God's different arrangements or actions towards His creatures, it's clear that some of these are described in plural and multiple forms, as in this verse:
"For the Lord is the God of knowledge"
(First Samuel 2:3).

206
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:45,625
And if He is the Lord of knowledge, it is certainly not of another's knowledge, but His own.

207
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:56,219
How should this be understood, except that the knowledge, which in Him is naturally one and simple, becomes multiple for us when related to the disposition or ordering of creation, as mentioned before?

208
00:32:56,219 --> 00:33:03,861
Similarly, God is said to be strength, and yet for the same reason we read:
"Recounting the praises of the Lord, and His strength"
(Psalm 148:2).

209
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:12,873
And just as rightly God is called strength, so rightly the same God is called power, and yet in the psalm we sing:
"Who can declare the powers of the Lord?"
(Psalm 106:2).

210
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:30,529
Therefore, if God is one knowledge, one strength, one power; yet according to the truth and authority of Scripture, we rightly say of God in the plural and multiple form-the Lord of knowledge, the powers of the Lord, and His strengths-why does this disputant say that it is impious, when it proceeds from the source of truth and piety?

211
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:43,757
If those things which truly and substantially exist in God are not impiously but piously spoken of in the plural form about God, how is he guilty of impiety who wishes to speak of God's predestination in the same way, because of its double efficiency?

212
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:57,197
Although we neither reject this because of the truly double efficiency of predestination, nor do we necessarily think it must be said in this way: just as one justice of God, one predestination of God must certainly be understood to have multiple effects.

213
00:33:57,197 --> 00:34:03,363
He adds and says: There is one divine predestination, just as there is one divine operation, wisdom, substance, will.

214
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:15,221
In these words, he tries to achieve what he did above, namely that just as God is substantially wisdom, substantially will, and He is the highest substance, so it is believed that the same God is predestination and operation.

215
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:20,069
But regarding predestination, we have already explained our beliefs in various ways.

216
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:28,557
Now, concerning the single operation of God, which He mentions here, we need to carefully consider what should be thought about this matter according to our faith.

217
00:34:28,557 --> 00:35:04,953
We rightly speak of the operation of God in the creatures He has made, and we can also rightly speak of an operation from God, because, as the Apostle says: "From Him, and through Him, and for Him are all things."
But can we rightly say there is an operation in God, when God does not operate within Himself? All creatures He has made and in which He still operates exist outside of Him, that is, outside of His nature.
However, in another sense, we can say that the creature exists in Him, because it subsists in His power and virtue. Hence, the Apostle says, as already mentioned, that "in Him all things exist"; and in another place: "For in Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28).

218
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:16,408
Since God does not operate within His own substance, but His operation is understood to be in creatures, which are not of the same nature or substance as Him, how can it be rightly said that there is an operation in God?

219
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:23,073
And if it is not rightly said that there is an operation in God, how much less can it be said that God Himself is the operation?

220
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:29,998
Although the omnipotent God organizes all things within Himself and in Himself, He operates all things within Himself and in Himself.

221
00:35:29,998 --> 00:35:35,309
To perform these actions, He does not go outside Himself nor exceeds Himself, as His willing is doing.

222
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:42,443
Rather, He calls to Himself the things He operates, so that each may receive being from Him, who supremely is, according to its own mode.

223
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:49,056
This fulfills what the Apostle says: "Who calls into existence the things that do not exist as though they were" (Romans 4:17).

224
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:52,128
Therefore, He does not operate anything outside of Himself.

225
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:57,074
With His sole and eternal will, without any effort, labor, or artifice, He operates all things.

226
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:06,291
Nor does He operate anything within Himself, as in the perfection and eternity of His substance, He achieves nothing, increases nothing, diminishes nothing, and changes nothing.

227
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:12,192
However, this does not mean that because His will is done, His will and the act of doing are the same.

228
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:17,521
This does not signify a unity between Creator and creature, but rather the power of the Creator alone.

229
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:23,633
So, how can an operation in God, or God Himself, be substantially understood as an operation, as this person asserts?

230
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:31,208
Unless perhaps it is said that God is an operation, not because someone or something operates in Him, but because He Himself operates everything.

231
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:55,761
But because this is too unusual, not taken from the authority of sacred Scripture, and very dangerous to faith, lest, when God is said to be an operation, according to the impious error of the Arians, who believed this about the Son and the Holy Spirit, it might be believed that He was made by someone: surely the presumption of such verbosity should be restrained and curbed, and like other novelties of words, as the Apostle very attentively warns, should be avoided.

232
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:56,753
First Timothy 6:20.

233
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:57,718
And yet we, who simply understand the divine operation in His works and creatures, read that His operation is placed in plural form in the Scriptures, with the Apostle clearly saying: "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are different kinds of service, but the same Lord; and there are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men." First Corinthians 12:4-6.
Therefore, since the operation of God is so openly said in the plural and is understood in various ways in God's creatures, what utility does such an argument have? It is useless for anything, as the Apostle says, except for the ruin of those who listen. Second Timothy 2:14.
And yet he adds and says: Nothing is compelled by the necessity of predestination, just as neither is the will. Both of these, that is, nothing is compelled by either God's predestination or will, are most clearly false: because by the goodness of God's predestination, the elect are frequently compelled by various scourges, labors, and tribulations, whether to turn to God or to live according to God. Just as the Apostle Paul was compelled when he was still Saul. Acts.

234
00:37:58,032 --> 00:38:07,323
Struck down by the terror of the heavenly voice and blinded by divine intervention, he was restrained from his error and cruelty by such terror, surely to convert him to God.

235
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:18,164
And yet, already converted, already an apostle, already made a teacher of the nations, he is still chastised, still battered, so that he does not become proud because of the greatness of his revelations.

236
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:19,445
Second Corinthians 12:7.

237
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:30,179
By the judgment and fairness of the same divine predestination, the wicked are compelled; and if not to live wickedly and impiously, at least to pay eternal punishment for their wickedness and impiety.

238
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:44,010
Similarly, by the goodness of God's will, in which there is surely the eternal predestination of God, the chosen are scourged temporarily for correction or testing, and by the severity of the same divine will, the wicked are scourged eternally for punishment.

239
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:51,380
As the omnipotent God, as the Apostle says, with manifest mercy and hidden judgment, has mercy on whom He wills and hardens whom He wills.

240
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,020
Romans 9:18.

241
00:38:52,020 --> 00:39:50,602
For both are in God's predestination, both are in God's will, namely goodness and severity, about which the same Apostle says: "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but on you, goodness, if you continue in goodness."
Romans 11:22.
Section 8:
He follows and says: And whatever is understood about the divine will should be felt about the predestination of God.
This definition pleases us because it states that the will of God is the predestination of God.
For what else is God's predestination than the eternal and unchangeable will of God for His works?
For God did not predestine by necessity but by will whatever He predestined.
And just as He has done all things that He willed.
Psalm 113:3.
So He has fulfilled all things that He predestined, indeed has already done them: as the prophet says of Him: "Who made the things that are to come."
Isaiah 45:11 according to the Septuagint.
Therefore, it is entirely consistent with what the Apostle says about God, who wills all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
First Timothy 2:4.

242
00:39:50,976 --> 00:39:56,333
As it is in the predestination of God, it should be most accurately understood as the will of God.

243
00:39:56,333 --> 00:40:05,245
That is, those whom God has predestined by His eternal will, chosen from all humankind, He wills all of them to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

244
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:09,072
Namely because the predestination of God is certainly the will of God.

245
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:31,378
Just as it has been truly said about the will of God by the apostle, "He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills" (Romans 9:18), so it should also be most certainly held about the predestination of God:
Namely that by eternal predestination, just as by His eternal will, He loved Jacob and hated Esau, and from the same lump made one vessel for honor and another for dishonor (Romans 13:21).

246
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:40,235
But He did this by His goodness for one, and by His just judgment for the other, so that some are vessels of wrath and others are vessels of mercy (Romans 22:23).

247
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:54,778
Therefore, if this disputant, according to the truth of apostolic doctrine, and as he himself has concluded by his argumentation, holds these things with us faithfully and simply, there will be no need for questioning, no effort required for syllogistic disputation.

248
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:57,511
Only the tranquility of peace will reign among us.

249
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,760
Chapter Three
In this chapter, he introduces these definitions.

250
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:02,980
One.

251
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,343
God's predestination, like His essence, forces no one and imposes no necessity.

252
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,883
Two. There are not two predestinations. Three.

253
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,092
Death, sin, and misery are not from God.

254
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:12,368
Four.

255
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:16,841
Predestination, like love, is not dual, double, or multiple, and lacks plurality.

256
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,761
We've already discussed these four propositions as allowed by the Lord.

257
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:26,339
The first states that God's predestination, like His essence, forces no one and imposes no necessity.

258
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:29,486
The second states that there are not two predestinations.

259
00:41:29,486 --> 00:41:35,229
The fourth states that predestination, like love, is not dual, double, or multiple, and lacks plurality.

260
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:41,414
However, above, he did not mention love among the examples he wanted to be understood from the substance of God.

261
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:53,673
And clearly, as the blessed Apostle John teaches: God is love First John 4:16;
so that according to the rule of true faith, we rightly say that there is the love of God, and that there is love in God, and that God is love.

262
00:41:53,673 --> 00:42:13,773
This love, since it is substance in God, like truth, justice, and goodness, when understood about God,
is not said to be dual, because it is substantially one and simple in Him;
and therefore it cannot be called double or triple, because the divine substance is not doubled or tripled; it is the deity itself, the truth itself, the love itself, the Trinity of God.

263
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:18,246
For it is not less in one than in three; nor greater in two or three than in one.

264
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:27,412
But as great as deity, truth, and love is in one person of the Holy Trinity, so great it is in two, so great it is in three, that is, perfect in each, perfect in all.

265
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:34,867
Because the Father is perfect God, and the Son is perfect God, and the Holy Spirit is perfect God, and these three are one perfect God.

266
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:46,132
In us, however, this love is not substance, but a gift of God, as the Apostle says:
Because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us Romans 5:5.

267
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:53,447
And so, it can exist within us both twin and double, due to the two commandments of love: love of God and love of neighbor.

268
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:58,728
This creates in us a dual affection, so we love God with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves.

269
00:42:58,728 --> 00:42:59,774
(Matthew 22:37, 39).

270
00:42:59,774 --> 00:43:07,042
And because through this gift of love, God works many and countless good deeds in His saints, it is also called manifold in the Scriptures.

271
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:18,703
For it is the grace of God, about which the blessed apostle Peter says:
"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms."
(First Peter 4:10).

272
00:43:18,703 --> 00:43:24,873
But who does not know that love lacks plurality and is not found in plural form in either God or us in the Scriptures?

273
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:34,180
Regarding the statement that predestination does not receive a plural number just like love, it has been sufficiently discussed above and does not need to be repeated constantly.

274
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:42,912
For even the proposition that compares God's predestination to God's substance, or rather says it is the substance of God, has already been discussed as best we could.

275
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:54,991
And when he affirms that God's predestination forces no one and imposes no necessity, if he means that by His predestination, the omnipotent God compels no one to do evil, to be evil, and to be nothing else, he is absolutely right.

276
00:43:54,991 --> 00:44:14,704
But if he left this vague and unexplained, to say that predestination forces no one and imposes no necessity, and did not add what it compels or what necessity it imposes, so as to deny that those who persist in their wickedness to the end are to be punished by the just judgment of divine predestination, he clearly accepts divine predestination in part and denies it in part.

277
00:44:14,704 --> 00:44:21,711
By the same predestination of God, He has prepared the righteous for the kingdom but has not preordained the reprobate for punishment.

278
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:27,096
The third proposition that remains here and is defined is that death, sin, and misery are not from God.

279
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:33,506
Indeed, regarding sin, as the universal Catholic faith holds, it is rightly said that sin is not from God.

280
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:36,368
God neither willed, commanded, nor drove man to sin.

281
00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:43,194
In fact, before man sinned, God forbade him from sinning and warned him with the penalty of death to deter him from sinning.

282
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:47,487
After the sin, God justly punished man as rebellious and contrary to His will.

283
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,451
Therefore, sin is not from God, who created man upright and without sin.

284
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:59,157
As Ecclesiasticus says, "This only have I found: that God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions" (Ecclesiasticus 7:30).

285
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:05,982
The origin of sin is from the one who first sinned in heaven and later deceived man to sin, thereby killing him in paradise.

286
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:10,936
As the Apostle John testifies, "the devil has sinned from the beginning" (First John 3:8).

287
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:19,248
The Lord Himself teaches, saying, "He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not abide in the truth, because there is no truth in him" (John 8:44).

288
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:22,385
In not abiding in the truth, the devil destroyed himself.

289
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,477
By offering sin to man, he killed man.

290
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:31,192
Just as he was the first sinner, he also became the first murderer, because "the soul that sins shall die" (Ezekiel 18:4).

291
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:34,825
Thus, the Scriptures say he has the power of death (Hebrews 2:14).

292
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:39,339
Not by his own power, but because his malicious envy brought death to all mankind.

293
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:46,825
Hence, the Scripture says, "By the envy of the devil, death entered the world: and they who are of his party imitate him" (Wisdom 2:24).

294
00:45:46,825 --> 00:45:57,393
This impious dominion of his, the Lord destroyed by His own death, as the Apostle says: "That through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil" (Hebrews 2:14).

295
00:45:57,393 --> 00:46:01,246
He is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

296
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:04,384
So, this disputant rightly said that sin is not from God.

297
00:46:04,384 --> 00:46:11,705
However, he unnecessarily mentioned this when defining divine predestination, because no believer says that God has predestined sins.

298
00:46:12,695 --> 00:48:03,335
However, the statement that death and misery are not from God contradicts Scripture, which says: "Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth are from God"
Ecclesiasticus 11:14.
But since Scripture also says: "God did not make death, nor does He delight in the destruction of the living"
Wisdom 1:13, we must carefully inquire how both statements can be faithfully understood: namely, that God did not make death, and that both death and life are from God.
Thus, both can be rightly understood in this way: God did not make death, as He created man immortal if he had not sinned.
And again, death is from God, because He justly condemned the sinning man to death; thus, death is not from Him by creation, but it is truly from Him as a punishment.
Just as this physical death, which is primarily understood, is from God because it was justly inflicted by Him on sinning man; so also the second death in hell is justly to be inflicted on man remaining in sin by Him.
Therefore, both this first death, which separates the soul from the body, and the second death, through which both soul and body are lost in hell, because they are just and are inflicted or to be inflicted on man by the just judgment of God, are from God.
Thus, elsewhere the same Scripture speaks of the present physical death: "Do not fear the judgment of death: remember those who were before you and those who are to come after you"
Ecclesiasticus 41:5.
This judgment is from the Lord upon all flesh.
And again: "Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance"
Ecclesiasticus 39:29.
And how were famine and death created? Not, of course, by any form or formation that they might exist as created things, but they were prepared in the hidden plan of God for His vengeance; so that their coming into the open may seem like a creation of sorts.
And again the same Scripture says: "Death, bloodshed, strife, and the sword, calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge: these were all created for the wicked, and for their sake, the flood was made"
Ecclesiasticus 40:9-10.

299
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:11,881
Since human death, which comes from just and divine retribution, is so clearly stated and truthfully understood in the Scriptures to be from God, it is evident.

300
00:48:11,881 --> 00:49:50,586
Thus, the blessed Elijah, praying for the son of the widow with whom he was staying, said to God: "Lord, have you also afflicted this widow with whom I am barely sustained, to kill her son?" First Kings Seventeen Twenty.
And the Lord openly says in the Gospel: "Fear him who, after he has killed, has the power to cast into hell" Luke Twelve Five.
The clear truth of Scripture should be understood, and vanity should be silenced.
Just as death, which is indeed the punishment for sin, so too all the misery of toil, tribulations, and calamities that have followed humanity after sin, because they were inflicted and are inflicted by divine disposition and judgment, Scripture rightly says they are from God, as the testimonies we have cited clearly show.
Therefore, just as sin, which is contrary to the righteousness of God, is truly not from God, so too the punishment for sin, that is death, and all the calamity and misery that followed, because they are deserved by God's just judgment and are inflicted by His just retribution, are rightly understood to be from God, as Scripture attests.
Even if the devil and other evil angels act in some way, they are ministers of divine retribution and vengeance, not judges or authors, as the history in the books of the blessed Job clearly shows.
It is fully shown there that not only did he dare to wound Job with a grievous sore from the sole of his foot to the top of his head, or kill his children by the collapse of the house, or destroy his abundant family by the sword of invading robbers or by fire from heaven, but he did not even dare to touch his livestock and animals unless the Lord first permitted him, saying: "Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only against him do not stretch out your hand" Job One Twelve.
And again: "Behold, he is in your hand; but spare his life" Job Two Six.

301
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:57,621
The holy man, filled with divine wisdom, did not attribute his calamities to the devil, even though the devil was the executor.

302
00:49:57,621 --> 00:51:21,785
Instead, he humbly and faithfully referred everything to God and His just judgment, with thanksgiving, saying:
"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; as it has pleased the Lord, so it has been done. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
Job 1:12.
Similarly, in the Gospel, when a legion of demons was cast out from a possessed man, they couldn't enter and destroy the herd of pigs without permission. They said, trembling and sorrowful:
"If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
And he said to them:
"Go."
Matthew 8:32.
In the psalm recounting the plagues and calamities that befell Egypt for their impiety, with God justly avenging and Moses mediating, Scripture refers everything to God, even if some were inflicted through evil angels. It says:
"He turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so they could not drink. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. He gave their crops to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. He gave their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. He sent upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, a band of destroying angels."
Psalm 78:44-49.
In another psalm, recounting the onslaught of fire, hail, storms, and tempests, which cause shipwreck, destruction, and devastation, it similarly refers everything to God, saying:
"Fire, hail, snow, frost, stormy wind, fulfilling His word."
Psalm 148:8.

303
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:27,791
Chapter Four
In this chapter, five definitions are presented in the following order.

304
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:27,898
1.

305
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:33,139
Three heresies: The first is from the Pelagians, who promote free will without the need for grace.

306
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,957
The second argues for grace alone.

307
00:51:34,957 --> 00:51:39,341
The third, associated with Gottschalk, introduces the necessity of predestination.

308
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:39,448
2.

309
00:51:39,448 --> 00:51:43,726
The substance of humanity consists of three things: being, willing, and knowing.

310
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,025
This substance is not lost through sinning.

311
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:46,132
3.

312
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:49,180
No nature can perish, nor can free will lose its essence.

313
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,287
4.

314
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:53,298
Freedom remained in humans after sin, though its vigor and power were lost.

315
00:51:53,298 --> 00:51:53,405
5.

316
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,720
This nature can only begin and complete actions through grace.

317
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:04,473
Regarding the three heresies mentioned, the first from the Pelagians posits that free will without God's grace is sufficient for human salvation.

318
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:07,307
This has been well known and condemned by the Church.

319
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:17,627
The Church follows the voice of the Lord, who commends His grace in all things, and says:
"Whoever remains in me, and I in him, bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).

320
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:50,192
In saying, "Whoever remains in me, and I in him, bears much fruit," He declares the benefit of grace, which those who remain in Him receive, enabling them to bear fruit for God, just as a branch receives sustenance from the root of the vine. But by adding, "For without me you can do nothing," He clearly shows that human free will, without the help of His grace, can achieve nothing in terms of good works.
The second heresy concerns grace alone: what this is or was in the Church, which preached that only God's grace saves humans to the extent that it denied or destroyed human free will, is unknown to us.

321
00:52:51,047 --> 00:53:01,492
The very ancient and impious heretics Marcion, Valentinus, and Manichaeus introduced two or three principles and therefore asserted two natures for either angels or humans - one good and the other evil.

322
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:09,920
They claimed that the good nature is so good that it cannot be anything else, and conversely, the evil nature is so evil that it similarly cannot be anything else.

323
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,641
They said nothing at all about the grace of God, but foolishly tried to defend that nature is either good or evil by nature alone.

324
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:36,083
However, the Catholic Church, instructed and fortified by the faithful teachings of the Law and the Gospel, recognizes and preaches only one principle of all creatures, heavenly and earthly, visible and invisible, namely the Holy Trinity - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, one God, from whom all things come, through whom all things exist, and in whom all things are.

325
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:47,147
The Church asserts that no nature exists except from Him, the best Creator, and therefore every nature, insofar as it is nature, is good, and that the evil in nature is not the nature itself but a defect of nature.

326
00:53:47,147 --> 00:53:55,265
This nature in created beings, both angelic and human, has been made mutable and, by its own fault, could fall from the good in which it was created to evil.

327
00:53:55,265 --> 00:54:02,814
From the evil into which it has fallen, as far as it pertains to the human race that is saved by God's mercy, it can rise and be reformed to good.

328
00:54:02,814 --> 00:54:21,118
In the case of the part of the evil angels who are damned by perpetual judgment, they have fallen from God through pride in such a way that they no longer deserve any remedy to be restored, not only having lost the good will in which they were created, but also being deprived of the possibility of that good will by the dreadful judgment of the Creator.

329
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:31,485
So, since those heretics have either defended nature as being immutably good or accused it of being immutably bad, it's unclear how they could preach about grace or free will.

330
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:41,662
On the other hand, the Church of God holds, as we briefly mentioned: what is this second heresy, so unknown, so new and unheard of, that denies free will and preaches only grace?

331
00:54:41,662 --> 00:54:54,869
Unless, as it seems to us, this disputant secretly accuses the blessed Augustine of being a heretic, because he clearly shows and teaches according to the truth of the Scriptures that only by the grace of God can a person be saved.

332
00:54:54,869 --> 00:55:02,817
Human will contributes nothing to this eternal salvation unless it has been reformed, healed, enlightened, and restored by that same grace.

333
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:10,592
Or certainly, he accuses those who, according to Augustine's venerable and catholic doctrine, now feel and teach about the grace of God.

334
00:55:10,592 --> 00:55:14,080
As if they understand his words less, he calls them heretics.

335
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,854
Namely, as if he did not feel the same way about free will, nor do they rightly understand his words.

336
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:26,601
And so, they err due to the occasion of his words, while they understand them differently than the one who wrote them.

337
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:35,463
For this reason, it seems to us that he very cunningly and slyly proposed the heresy of grace alone, yet did not reveal its author or followers in any way.

338
00:55:35,463 --> 00:55:44,497
If this is the case, what else does he do but accuse the Church of our time, together with those who provoke him to such things, with the subtlety of a viper?

339
00:55:44,497 --> 00:56:13,084
And therefore, if there are such people in the regions of his kingdom, where this attacker of truth is not only not rebuked or silenced, but is even held in the highest praise and honor, who support him in such matters, especially ecclesiastical men, who could rightly feel sorrow and horror at this evil of contagion and pestilence, that rises so unrestrainedly and shamelessly from those regions against the other parts of the Church of God, which are peaceful, tranquil, and calm among themselves?

340
00:56:13,655 --> 00:56:21,688
Where such a monster and prodigy has long been kept away from the ears of the faithful, it sits, argues, and spreads numerous lies and insults against the faith.

341
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:26,128
With no vigilance from the shepherds of the Church, it is neither corrected nor expelled.

342
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:34,559
Finally, to clarify that he did not refer to any older heresy that preached grace, he placed this heresy after the Pelagian, from the times of Saint Augustine until now.

343
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:43,289
In all this time, no such heresy existed in the Church, except that he accuses either the blessed Augustine, as we have already mentioned, or us who follow him, of this error.

344
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:47,480
He identifies a third heresy as imposing necessity and force through predestination.

345
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:56,360
Its author, as he believes, he does not remain silent about, calling it the Gotteschalcanan, after a very unfortunate monk named Gotteschalcus, who was imprisoned for many years.

346
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:09,730
If Gotteschalcus taught something so dangerous against the Catholic faith that it deserved such severe condemnation by a synodical decree, it would have been standard practice for the Church to communicate this to other Churches to prevent the spread of such an error.

347
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:17,313
Even if not at the beginning or the end, at least afterward through synodical and ecclesiastical letters, to inform all the brothers and fellow bishops.

348
00:57:17,313 --> 00:57:29,336
If this had been done according to the ecclesiastical custom always observed by the Fathers, as we have said, we would now be better prepared to refute and convince those who propose that he taught necessity and force through predestination.

349
00:57:29,735 --> 00:59:19,487
Therefore, regarding the accusations about predestination being spoken of in the plural, it is clear, as we have demonstrated many times before, that it is not the plural form of the term "predestination" that bothers him, but rather the actual plural nature of predestination itself. This includes its twofold effect: both the preparation of the elect for life and the preordaining of the reprobate for punishment, as we have frequently mentioned and shown from the Holy Scriptures.
To deny this, contrary to the faith of the Church, he has undertaken a great and tedious effort, attempting to persuade us with new arguments that predestination is the essence of God, or even that God Himself is predestination. Therefore, he argues, it should not be understood in the plural sense; that is, predestination should be considered only for the elect and not at all for the reprobate.
From this stance, to nullify the just predestination of the reprobate to eternal punishment, he has ventured into such audacity that he clearly attempts to assert, against the faith and the truth of the Scriptures, that just as sin is not from God, neither is its punishment. In other words, all misery and death that follow a person's sin are not from God.
When, clearly by God's just condemnation and judgment, the misery of labor and toil is inflicted on the sinner, along with the ultimate misery of death itself, as the Lord said about the hardships of a laborious life: "Cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread" Genesis 3:17-19.
Immediately after, He added the ultimate penalty of death: "Until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return" Genesis 3:19.
And to the woman, who sinned before her husband, He imposed the specific penalty of her sin, in addition to the common penalty shared with her husband, saying: "I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children" Genesis 3:16.

350
00:59:19,487 --> 00:59:27,371
By denying the just predestination of divine judgment in the case of the condemned, he asserts that all human miseries and even death are not from God.

351
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:30,190
In other words, they do not pertain to God's judgment.

352
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:38,648
If asked where death and misery come from, if not from God, what remains but to falsely claim either that they come from nowhere or that they come from the devil.

353
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:41,154
Saying they come from nowhere is utterly insane.

354
00:59:41,154 --> 00:59:47,576
However, the devil only suggests causes for sinning; the punishment for sin is not inflicted by him, but by the just judge.

355
00:59:47,576 --> 01:00:01,934
Regarding the aforementioned Gottschalk imposing necessity and force with predestination: if he means that the predestination of the condemned forces them to do evil, making them inevitably evil and unable to be anything else, this is entirely contrary to the Catholic faith.

356
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:14,046
Because it is highly absurd and impious to say that the almighty God (who wants no one to be evil) compels and forces anyone to be evil, and (of whom it is written: The Lord is just and loves just deeds ) forces anyone to be unjust.

357
01:00:14,046 --> 01:00:14,621
Psalm 10:8.

358
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:22,609
This happens with all the condemned, regarding their sins and ultimate punishment, which was enacted in the first man sinning through the first judgment.

359
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:34,617
Just as he was not compelled by any impulse or predestination from God to sin, but sinned of his own accord, yet unwillingly and reluctantly accepted the judgment and condemnation of his sin, which was the first punishment of man.

360
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:43,231
So also the entire multitude of the condemned, descending from that condemnation, is not compelled by God's predestination to sin, since God has predestined no sins.

361
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:55,657
Nevertheless, by the just and eternal judgment of divine predestination, they are compelled to undergo punishment; receiving from God the force and necessity of just condemnation, which had no force or necessity for perpetrating iniquity.

362
01:00:56,231 --> 01:01:02,627
For those who will stand on the left at the judgment and face eternal fire, they will not willingly accept such punishment.

363
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:11,103
They will be unwilling, reluctant, and filled with unending sorrow and trembling as they are cast down by the command of divine majesty and the ministry of angels.

364
01:01:11,103 --> 01:02:40,384
As the Lord clearly says in the Gospel:
"So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous, and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth."
Matthew 13:40-42.
To these reapers, that is, the angelic ministers, when the harvest, which is the end of the age, comes, it will be said by the judge himself:
"Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn."
Matthew 13:30.
Behold the force and necessity of divine predestination towards the reprobate that the Church of God believes according to the gospel truth. This is the force and necessity of judgment, not the force and necessity of sin. Whoever says that God has imposed or imposes the force and necessity of sinning on man clearly blasphemes horribly against God, asserting that by compelling them to sin, He confirms Himself as the author of sin.
Thus, we, according to God's truth, think about the predestination of the reprobate, faithfully confessing Him not as the author of their sin, but of their just punishment. Therefore, what this person raves about, as if the preaching of this predestination is an imposition of the necessity to sin, we consider slanderous and vain, as is evident from what has been said.
After this, he adds:
The substance of man is threefold: being, willing, and knowing; and this, he has not lost by sinning. But we say that the substance of man is nothing other than what the divine Scripture shows at the beginning of human creation, saying:
"Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."
Genesis 2:7.

365
01:02:40,487 --> 01:02:48,471
This is the essence of a human being, through which they live and exist, as both the learned and unlearned know: the soul and the body vitally connected to it.

366
01:02:48,471 --> 01:02:52,538
The body is made from the dust of the earth, and the soul from God's inspiration.

367
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:55,651
With these, a human being is formed and becomes a living soul.

368
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:05,342
Since divine authority teaches this and Catholic truth upholds it, what is the purpose of this excess, claiming that the substance of a human being is three things: being, willing, and knowing?

369
01:03:05,342 --> 01:03:10,313
It is clear that the substance of a human being is not three things but two: the soul and the body.

370
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:22,715
But this person, ignoring the body, which is naturally part of a human being, says that the substance of a human being is being, willing, and knowing, which are attributes of the soul alone, as if the substance of a human being were only the soul.

371
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:39,436
It seems that he took the opportunity to say these things from the disputations of Saint Augustine in the books on the Trinity; but it is far-fetched to think that such a great teacher would ever speak so absurdly and ignorantly as to define the substance of a human being, which is the soul and body, as being, willing, and knowing.

372
01:03:39,436 --> 01:04:01,529
Therefore, he did not say (as can be clearly understood by anyone who has carefully read and considered his words in those same books) that the substance of a human being is these three things: being, knowing, and willing; but he taught that these things exist within the substance of a human being, not externally but internally, that is, in the rational mind, where a human being was created in the image and likeness of God Genesis 1:26.

373
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:07,655
He taught that these things are naturally and substantially implanted by God in the rational and intellectual mind itself.

374
01:04:07,655 --> 01:04:14,584
Hence, he rightly says in those disputations that these three things are of one substance with the mind itself and within the mind itself.

375
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:21,965
Just as the mind substantially has being, it also substantially has willing: that is, it naturally has the ability to know and the ability to will.

376
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:26,735
This is indeed a great good of nature, wonderfully and excellently created by the best Creator.

377
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:41,536
But if the human mind only has the ability to exist, to know, and to will, and does not have the gift from its Creator to exist well and happily, to know rightly about its Creator, and to will to be with Him by loving Him, what benefit is it to have existence, knowledge, and will?

378
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:46,911
When these abilities are to its own detriment without that gift from its Creator, they become meaningless.

379
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:52,083
For without this gift, it will exist unhappily, know deceitfully, and will destructively and wickedly.

380
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:59,790
Just like the angelic nature condemned in the devil and his angels, which certainly possesses existence, knowledge, and will in its spiritual substance.

381
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:05,165
However, its existence is in punishment, and its knowledge and will are entirely turned to error and evil.

382
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:13,835
So why boast that human nature has not lost these abilities through sinning-existence, knowledge, and will-when it has completely lost the good and happiness of all these?

383
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:18,196
It has become miserable from being blessed, losing divine knowledge and heavenly will.

384
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:27,627
Unless it is later assisted and raised by the grace of the Creator, it would not recognize the lost goods, feel sorrow for them, and by feeling sorrow and repenting, implore divine help.

385
01:05:27,627 --> 01:05:31,278
Thus, what it lost by its own fault, it would regain by divine goodness.

386
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:40,557
Therefore, the ineffable mercy of the Creator did not take away even these natural goods-existence, knowledge, and will-even after sin, so that He would have someone to have mercy on.

387
01:05:40,557 --> 01:05:47,098
For if He had not wanted him to exist after sin, then certainly, along with him and in him, knowledge and will would also perish.

388
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:59,166
So He wanted him to exist, so that He would have someone to have mercy on; He wanted him to know, so that He would have someone to illuminate with His knowledge; He wanted him to will, so that He would have someone to bless with His love.

389
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:05,809
Thus, the devil, who wanted to destroy God's creation, remained defeated, and the Creator's goodness and mercy remained undefeated.

390
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:09,764
But why he proposed this will become clearer from his subsequent propositions.

391
01:06:09,764 --> 01:06:17,218
For he immediately added after these two connected propositions and said: No nature can perish, nor did he lose free will, that is, his own nature.

392
01:06:17,927 --> 01:06:23,571
In these words, it was stated that no nature can perish; this was said generally about the nature of all things.

393
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:26,493
Where did he learn this, or how did he show it to be true?

394
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:38,133
Clearly, the entire nature of things could exist from nothing by the will of the Creator, so that it was something that did not exist before; likewise, if He wishes, it can perish and return to nothing, so that it no longer exists.

395
01:06:38,133 --> 01:07:56,436
Scripture shows this by speaking of the greatness and power of the Creator: "He is higher than the heavens, so what can you do? He is deeper than hell, so how will you know? His measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea. If He overturns everything or confines it to one point, who can resist Him? Or who can say to Him: Why do you do this?" Job 11:8-10.
Certainly, the omnipotent Creator, when preparing to destroy the world with a flood because of the extreme wickedness and impiety of humans, said through the testimony of Scripture: "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, from man to animal, from creeping things to the birds of the sky." Genesis 6:7. And again: "The earth is filled with violence because of them, and I will destroy them with the earth." Genesis 6:13.
Therefore, just as with that great and dreadful flood, a large part of the world's nature was destroyed and changed for the worse, as it had been said: "And I will destroy them with the earth." Almost the entire nature of animals, that is, both humans and livestock, was destroyed by water: even the souls of the wicked, who deserved to perish by such a dreadful punishment, were reserved and passed on to greater, that is, infernal punishment; only those who were saved in the ark by the mercy of God, in such a small number, were delivered.
Could He not (if He wished) destroy the entire nature of the world and all worldly or heavenly things with the astonishing power of the Creator, as is clearly shown in the books of the Maccabees?

396
01:07:56,436 --> 01:08:08,630
Certain holy men, preparing to fight against their adversaries, are recorded to have said: "But we trust in the omnipotent God who can destroy both these enemies coming against us and the entire world with one gesture." Second Maccabees 8:18.

397
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:20,324
You should ask him about that final conflagration of the world, which the blessed Apostle Peter talks about:
In which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat
Second Peter 3:10.

398
01:08:20,324 --> 01:08:24,558
What does he think will happen then to the nature of the four elements of the world?

399
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,036
If they remain as they are now, how is that apostolic statement true?

400
01:08:28,036 --> 01:08:33,077
But if they are mostly changed or destroyed, how is this definition true, that no nature can perish?

401
01:08:33,077 --> 01:08:38,218
Certainly, the four seasons-spring, summer, autumn, and winter-each have their own distinct qualities.

402
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:53,592
But when there is a new heaven and a new earth, and the course of the sun, moon, and stars, which now continuously succeed each other for the refreshment and rest of mortals, ceases,
and thus those four seasons, conducted by the sun's course, cannot exist as they do now, how will their nature not perish?

403
01:08:53,592 --> 01:09:03,119
And he should also be asked what he believes will happen when the heaven and earth are renewed by fire and transformed into a different quality that suits the immortal bodies of the saints.

404
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:08,966
What, I ask, does he believe will happen to the entire nature of birds, quadrupeds, reptiles, and aquatic creatures?

405
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:18,896
If it is believed that they will be completely consumed in that immense conflagration because the renewed world will no longer accept anything mortal,
how will it be true that no nature can perish?

406
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:25,046
Especially since it is written about the sea of such vastness in that miraculous change of things:
And the sea is no more.

407
01:09:25,046 --> 01:09:39,311
If he had said that human nature cannot perish, he might be heard to some extent,
not because God cannot dissolve it if He wishes, but because the promise of our Lord cannot be nullified,
as He Himself promised, saying:
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered
Matthew 10:30.

408
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:42,789
And in another place:
Not a hair of your head will perish
Luke 21:18.

409
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:50,068
When he says that no nature can perish, let him consider what has also happened to rational beings like the devil and his angels.

410
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:55,959
By divine and terrible judgment, they not only lost the will to do good but also the ability to desire that good.

411
01:09:55,959 --> 01:10:03,153
After stating that no nature can perish, he immediately includes free will by adding: Man did not lose his free will, that is, his nature.

412
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:12,015
It's as if, by his false and deceptive argument, he has proven to us that man did not lose his free will by sinning; because, according to him, free will is man's nature.

413
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:20,930
However, we say, according to the truth of the Catholic faith, that the nature of the first man was created entirely good and endowed with a good will by the good Creator.

414
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:34,327
As Scripture says in the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter seven, verse twenty-nine, God created man upright, so he not only had a naturally good and free will but also could remain in the state in which he was created, needing and being helped by divine grace.

415
01:10:34,327 --> 01:11:01,175
Hence, from his perspective, the psalm saying is understood: "In my prosperity I said, 'I shall never be moved.'" He immediately adds about his fall and sorrowfully says to God: "You hid your face, and I was troubled." The abundance of good will and blessed freedom before sin was from God; to whom he says: "Lord, by your favor you have made my mountain stand strong." But when God turned his face away, not illuminating him with his countenance, he became troubled, which was both the merit and punishment of sin.

416
01:11:01,487 --> 01:11:13,826
This one, however, who, without the aid of divine grace, praises the good of nature alone so much that he argues free will was not lost by sinning, saying that free will is part of human nature, is clearly involved in the Pelagian error.

417
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:21,480
He claims that humans had free will solely by nature both before and after sinning and did not lose it, and that free will is part of their nature.

418
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:26,113
However, it was not truly free except when it remained piously subjected to God and good.

419
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:31,944
But when it sinned by disobeying God and arrogantly breaking His command, it immediately became enslaved to sin.

420
01:11:31,944 --> 01:11:36,942
Because, as the Lord Himself says:
"Everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin" (John 8:34, 36).

421
01:11:36,942 --> 01:11:42,252
And so, what was once free to do good, after that miserable fall, could not be free except to do evil.

422
01:11:42,252 --> 01:12:37,751
From this deep pit of damnation, it cannot rise to the freedom of good will without being freed by Him who said:
"If the Son makes you free, you will be truly free."
This one, who thinks that free will was not lost by sinning because it was created with a good and free will, and therefore naturally had the affection of good will, should know that almighty God created every rational creature, both humans and angels, endowed with good and upright will.
As long as they maintained their order, piously subjected to God and aided by His grace, their dignity remained in them, that is, both the good of nature and the gift of grace.
But if, by pride against the Creator and presuming on their own strength, they abandoned the order of their subjection and obedience, they would immediately, by the just judgment of their Creator, be deprived of the gift of grace, and their nature would turn for the worse.
Hence it is written in the psalm:
"Man, when he was in honor, did not understand; he was compared to the foolish beasts and became like them" (Psalm 84:13, 21).

423
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:42,087
Before sin, human nature, created by God, was honored by the grace given to it.

424
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:45,805
But Adam did not understand the source of this divine goodness and grace.

425
01:12:45,805 --> 01:12:54,565
When he abandoned the Creator, relied on himself, and, with the serpent's suggestion, desired to be like God without any master, he was deservedly abandoned by the Creator.

426
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:57,824
As a result, he was completely corrupted, both in soul and body.

427
01:12:57,824 --> 01:13:06,024
The soul, having lost the freedom of justice and good will, was oppressed by sin, ceased to seek higher things, and desired lower things like a brute or a beast.

428
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:14,020
The body, condemned to the condition of death, was destined to return to the earth and dust from which it was taken, accepting the sentence of just judgment.

429
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:26,701
Behold the great evil to which human nature has fallen, wholly corrupted by sin, having lost the freedom for good, and free only to desire evil, unless it is healed and restored by the grace of Him who came to seek and save what was lost Luke 19:10.

430
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:33,576
As for the angelic nature, it has been depraved and horrifically corrupted in the devil and his angels, having lost free will for good.

431
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:39,280
They not only cannot rise to it but cannot even desire it, and have turned to unchangeable malice for only evil.

432
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,558
Who can rightfully dread, let alone explain in words, the extent of this corruption?

433
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:53,337
For the nature of the body itself is both healthy and sick: what thrives and flourishes in good health, when lost, is turned into worse, weighed down, and afflicted by the disease of sickness.

434
01:13:53,337 --> 01:14:05,967
But anyone who does not believe that free will and free choice for good are beneficial for the human mind, but that the mind itself is good, seems to misunderstand, as we have already said, some words of Saint Augustine in his books on the Trinity.

435
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:18,171
Chapter 10, verses 11 and 12, truthfully and completely state that both the mind and its knowledge, by which it understands itself, and the will of the mind, by which it desires and loves itself, are naturally one substance.

436
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:23,369
This substance exists as it is, knows itself through understanding, and desires itself through love.

437
01:14:23,369 --> 01:14:26,903
Indeed, the mind, its knowledge, and its love are all one substance.

438
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:36,415
However, it is not claimed that the knowledge and will of the mind, by which it understands and loves itself, are the mind of a person, but rather they reside in the mind of a person.

439
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,651
Thus, the flaw in this argument is evident.

440
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:45,720
When discussing free will, which allows a person to desire either good or evil, it is not about the will by which the mind loves itself.

441
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:52,373
Instead, it refers to the will by which it loves the highest good-God-when righteous, or the lowest good-the world-when corrupt.

442
01:14:52,373 --> 01:15:02,769
This will, though of the same nature as the will by which the mind loves itself, differs greatly in affection-as much as the love of oneself differs from the love of God or from the love of the world.

443
01:15:02,769 --> 01:15:08,487
By this will, the mind loves itself; by that will, it either loves God above itself or the world below itself.

444
01:15:08,487 --> 01:15:11,657
As we have said, it is of one nature but varies in affection.

445
01:15:11,657 --> 01:15:18,467
It is singular in the love of oneself and diverse in the love of good or bad things, by which it is either attracted or distracted.

446
01:15:18,467 --> 01:15:33,437
Therefore, since the will of nature, which Blessed Augustine discusses, by which the mind loves itself, has nothing to do with the free will by which good or bad things are desired, but pertains only to the mind and refers to itself, it is less clever-or too foolish-to call it free will.

447
01:15:33,437 --> 01:15:37,127
Blessed Augustine never says this, and it is unthinkable that he would.

448
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:45,236
After all, who does not know that this will of the mind, by which it desires and loves itself, is naturally common to all people and always operates freely?

449
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:52,162
What human mind, except for those who are insane or mad, does not naturally desire to exist, to live, and to remain unharmed?

450
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:54,312
To this end, the will of all minds is free.

451
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:59,913
What could be freer than a will that loves its own mind, loves to exist, loves to live, and loves not to perish?

452
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:06,563
And what could be more redundant than calling such a will free, when it can never be anything else but a love for itself or its mind?

453
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:14,364
Or calling it free choice when it cannot be considered a choice unless it involves different matters that need to be discerned, judged, chosen, or rejected?

454
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:21,065
The will of the mind finds no diversity within itself but always loves itself equally and clings to itself in natural peace and unity.

455
01:16:21,065 --> 01:16:29,965
Therefore, let us refrain from saying, when discussing human free will-which chooses either good for salvation or evil for destruction-that the will of the mind is simply nature.

456
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:41,416
While it is true that the mind's will loves both itself and other things, it loves itself with an unchanging, natural affection, and it loves other things with a variable affection that can change, turning to either good or evil.

457
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:50,617
If the mind's will, which loves other things, either good or evil, were the nature of humans, as some suggest, it would be only good or evil and could not change from one to the other.

458
01:16:50,617 --> 01:16:59,668
Therefore, this will-such an affection of human will according to the truth of the Scriptures-was implanted in humans by the good Creator as good and upright when they were created.

459
01:16:59,668 --> 01:17:05,318
This will remained good and upright with the cooperation of God's grace as long as it piously obeyed the Creator.

460
01:17:05,318 --> 01:17:17,569
But because human nature itself was created mutable by the unchangeable Creator, and the affection of the human mind is similarly mutable, it stood in good with God's grace and fell to evil by God's hidden judgment when that grace was abandoned.

461
01:17:18,119 --> 01:17:25,257
And, as has often been said, what was once free for good, having lost that happy freedom, fell under the miserable slavery of sin.

462
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:30,748
He adds, as if defining, that freedom remained for man after sin, but its vigor and power were lost.

463
01:17:30,748 --> 01:17:47,219
We need not dwell longer on these words because, as we have frequently mentioned, the one who had free will, good nature, and the gift of grace aimed at the highest and eternal good-created to love, desire, seek, find, and contemplate-fell from such a great good by sinning and became a slave of sin.

464
01:17:47,219 --> 01:18:24,390
As the Lord Himself testifies, saying:
"Everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin"
(John 8:34)
And the blessed Apostle Peter says:
"For by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage"
(Second Peter 2:19)
Thus, having lost the gift of grace and being corrupted and depraved in the good of nature, he fell so miserably from such great happiness that he cannot return to that good, to love and enjoy it, to which he ought to have adhered, unless through the help of the most merciful reconciler and mediator, and the price of His blood, by which we are redeemed from such captivity, so that we can regain our former freedom and be made friends from enemies.

465
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:59,036
Of this mediator, it is written:
"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all"
(First Timothy 2:5)
And again:
"For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son"
(Romans 5:10)
Therefore, whoever says that after the most unfortunate fall of transgression, by which, having lost original freedom, he became a slave of sin, became a slave to the one by whom he was also overcome, became an enemy of God, and needs one mediator and reconciler, through whom he may receive redemption from slavery and reconciliation to God.

466
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:12,750
After such a great and miserable fall, anyone who claims they have the freedom to seek, love, and earn true good without being redeemed, justified, reconciled, and reformed by the grace of the true mediator, is completely going against the faith of the Church.

467
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:18,407
They teach against the truth of the Gospel and apostolic doctrine, and nullify the cross and death of Christ.

468
01:19:18,407 --> 01:20:31,120
If a person could recover true freedom of mind after sin without the redemption of the cross and death of Christ, as the Apostle says to some who thought they could be justified otherwise: "Then Christ died for nothing" Galatians 2:21.
This is the wisdom of words that nullifies the cross of Christ First Corinthians 1:17.
If a person could have true freedom after another sin, then redemption and a redeemer are unnecessary, making the coming and death of Christ superfluous.
The claim that a sinful man loses only the vigor and power of freedom but not freedom itself is incorrect. He did not partially retain and partially lose the good of freedom; he lost both the vigor and power of freedom, as well as freedom itself. Now, he cannot, by himself, attain the true good from which he fell.
He remained free to do evil; just as he deserted the good with free will, he adhered to evil with free will.
After that condemnation, man has free will to incline towards and be inclined by his own will to evil; he has free will to rise to the good. But rising to the good is not due to his own strength, but to the grace of God who has mercy.
He has free will to wish well, live well, and adhere to God; but these abilities are not due to his own strength, but to the grace of God who has mercy.
Even one who is gravely ill can be said to be able to receive health, but to receive health, he needs medicine.

469
01:20:31,223 --> 01:20:36,958
And the one who is dead could be said to rise again, to live again, but not by their own power, but by God's.

470
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:43,745
Similarly, human free will, once wounded, once dead, can be healed, but not by its own power, but by the grace of a merciful God.

471
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:59,265
Therefore, it is right to admonish everyone, it is right to preach the word of God to everyone, because they have the ability to believe, they have the ability to turn to God, so that by the word admonishing from outside, and God awakening them from within, those who hear may come back to life.

472
01:20:59,265 --> 01:21:05,315
It can be rightly said about such a person: Because he was dead, and came back to life; he was lost, and was found.

473
01:21:05,315 --> 01:21:25,254
Concerning this possibility of human nature, which is nevertheless worthless without the generosity of divine grace, blessed Augustine teaches thus, saying (On the Predestination of the Saints, chapter 5): The ability to have faith, like the ability to have love, is a natural trait of humans: but to actually have faith, like to actually have love, is the grace of the faithful.

474
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:33,777
But since the will to believe is prepared for some by the Lord and not for others, we must distinguish what comes from His mercy and what comes from His judgment.

475
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:37,092
For all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth (Psalm 25:10).

476
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:39,459
Yet His ways are unsearchable (Romans 11:33).

477
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:45,141
Therefore, both the mercy by which He freely saves and the truth by which He justly judges are unsearchable.

478
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:55,137
After this person said in vain and deceitfully that freedom remained for humans after sin, he added another conclusion, and said: Nature can always begin, but can only be perfected by grace.

479
01:21:55,137 --> 01:22:17,286
If he says it like this, as if human nature through its own free will can always begin good, but can only be perfected by the grace of God, so that the beginning of all good is always attributed to humans, but its perfection only to God: so that humans claim the first part of doing good for themselves, and God the second part: such a sense is entirely Pelagian, and contrary to the truth of the Gospel and the Apostles.

480
01:22:17,286 --> 01:22:25,125
For the Lord Himself, to show that the beginning of our good is not from us, but from Him, says: You did not choose me, but I chose you (John 15:16).

481
01:22:25,703 --> 01:22:32,914
And the Apostle says to the faithful:
The one who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.

482
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:39,858
(Philippians 1:6)
And again:
It has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.

483
01:22:39,858 --> 01:22:48,235
(Philippians 1:29)
And the blessed Apostle John says:
Not that we loved God, but that he loved us first and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

484
01:22:48,235 --> 01:22:57,671
(First John 4:10)
And again, the blessed Apostle Paul says:
Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith.

485
01:22:57,671 --> 01:23:06,525
(Hebrews 12:1-2)
Therefore, if we truly wish to be Catholics, we must faithfully attribute everything to divine grace, both the beginning of our good work and the end.

486
01:23:06,525 --> 01:23:13,258
As the aforementioned testimonies of Holy Scripture clearly demonstrate, the Lord chooses his saints, not the other way around.

487
01:23:13,258 --> 01:23:22,482
God begins and completes the good work in his faithful:
it is from him that believers receive the ability to suffer for him, the beginning of faith, and the end of martyrdom.

488
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:25,663
He loved his saints first, so that they could also love him.

489
01:23:25,663 --> 01:23:31,707
And our faith has the Lord Jesus as its author, starting it in us; and it has him as its perfecter, completing it.

490
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:38,122
Therefore, let us hold firmly to these truths, so that being grounded in true faith, we may be safe from heretical error.

491
01:23:38,122 --> 01:23:43,317
Or if these words have another correct and acceptable meaning, let the one who wrote them show it.

492
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:49,031
Chapter Five
In the fifth chapter, he presents the following propositions:

493
01:23:49,031 --> 01:23:52,625
1. No one is compelled by God's foreknowledge and predestination. 2.

494
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:58,651
God knows even those things that He would not make happen, but predestines only those things He would make happen.

495
01:23:58,651 --> 01:23:58,756
3.

496
01:23:58,756 --> 01:24:05,257
Just as God's foreknowledge and predestination are not the cause of sin, neither are they the cause of punishment or death.

497
01:24:05,257 --> 01:24:05,363
4.

498
01:24:05,363 --> 01:24:08,481
God does not compel anyone to sin, nor to live righteously.

499
01:24:08,481 --> 01:24:08,587
5.

500
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:13,608
If any cause precedes the will, that is, nature, to think or do good or evil, it is not nature.

501
01:24:13,608 --> 01:24:21,430
Out of these five propositions, three have already been sufficiently discussed above, and do not need to be repeated: the first, second, and fourth.

502
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,231
Therefore, two remain, which are now first presented.

503
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:32,582
In the third proposition, he says: Just as God's foreknowledge and predestination are not the cause of sin, neither are they the cause of punishment or death.

504
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:50,922
To these words, we respond: if God's foreknowledge and predestination are not a cause of sin to anyone, which is entirely true, then the same divine foreknowledge and predestination are not unjust, nor blameworthy in any way, by which He foreknew and predestined the wicked, who persist in their wickedness, to be condemned to eternal punishments.

505
01:24:50,922 --> 01:25:01,228
By His foreknowledge and predestination, Almighty God is not the cause of their sin, but the just avenger of sin, and He does not drive them to sin, but justly delivers them to suffer punishment.

506
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:11,746
Thus, as the true and truthful God, He foreknows the future sins of men; hence the Scripture says: "Eternal God, who is the knower of secrets, who knows all things before they happen" (Daniel 13:42).

507
01:25:11,746 --> 01:25:18,828
Not that by His foreknowledge He compels anyone to sin, but that by His eternal providence He justly orders or condemns those who sin.

508
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:29,663
By His predestination, by which He has decreed to punish the wicked, as already stated, He did not make them wicked, but justly ordained that those who persist in their wickedness should not go unpunished.

509
01:25:30,455 --> 01:25:41,273
What this person explains is that, just as God, through His foreknowledge and predestination, is not the cause of anyone's sin, He is also not the cause of the punishment and death that result from sin.

510
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:47,163
We must faithfully understand this: by sinning, man himself becomes the cause of his own punishment and death.

511
01:25:47,163 --> 01:26:04,192
Yet, because Almighty God is a just judge, even though the cause of punishments and death lies in human actions and not in His foreknowledge and predestination, there is eternal justice in the same foreknowledge and predestination, through which those who remain in their impiety are subjected to punishment and death.

512
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:11,582
Therefore, according to this reasoning, the predestination of God, by which He imposes eternal punishments on the impious, is not negated.

513
01:26:11,582 --> 01:26:18,544
For, even if His predestination does not cause the punishments, there is still justice and the judgment of justly inflicting them.

514
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:25,612
The fifth proposition is as follows: If any cause precedes the will, that is, nature, to think or do good or evil, it is not nature.

515
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,861
Here, he clearly speaks against the truth.

516
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:37,072
For if no cause precedes the will of man to think or do good, where does a good will, that is, pious affection, come from in man, so that he can think or do something good?

517
01:26:37,072 --> 01:26:43,659
For man does not have a good will from himself, about which it is said: "Peace on earth to people of good will (Luke 2:14).

518
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:52,066
" Nor does he have the ability to perform good works from himself, about which it is said: "Glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good (Romans 2:10).

519
01:26:52,066 --> 01:27:01,384
" But he has these from Him, about whom the Apostle says to the faithful: "For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose (Philippians 2:13).

520
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:07,756
"
He precedes the will of man with His mercy, as the Psalmist says: "My God, His mercy will go before me (Psalm 59:10).

521
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:18,574
" He inspires in man the grace to think rightly, as the Apostle says: "Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God (Second Corinthians 3:5).

522
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:18,627
"

523
01:27:19,055 --> 01:27:22,856
He Himself is the reason for our good will, desires, and accomplishments.

524
01:27:22,856 --> 01:27:29,416
He is the source of our mercy and grace, enabling us not only to wish well, act well, and achieve well but also to think well.

525
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:38,422
He does this not only in the present for His chosen ones, but also, before the foundation of the world, He predestined them by His grace to be holy and blameless before Him.

526
01:27:38,422 --> 01:27:46,387
As the Apostle testifies, saying: "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in His sight in love" (Ephesians 1:4).

527
01:27:46,387 --> 01:28:01,641
With such a significant cause, which is undoubtedly the cause of all good things in both creation and reward, being our best and eternal source of good will, preceding us with His grace so that we can wish well and act well, how can anyone claim that no cause precedes our good will and deeds?

528
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:11,533
Or, if there is a preceding cause for these good things, how can it be said it is not nature, when Almighty God, the cause of our good will, is Himself the highest and best nature above all?

529
01:28:11,533 --> 01:28:24,808
Therefore, anyone who does not believe that this highest and most effective cause, which is also the highest and best nature, precedes our will so that we can wish and act rightly, clearly opposes the truth and is proven to be in error like the Pelagians.

530
01:28:24,808 --> 01:28:33,242
For if this blessed cause did not precede human wills, there would be no predestination of the good, no redemption of the miserable, and no reward for good deeds.

531
01:28:33,242 --> 01:28:37,094
But thinking or doing evil is not preceded by this highest and best cause.

532
01:28:37,094 --> 01:28:47,038
Instead, it is preceded by a defective cause-the abandonment of the highest good and the desire for something lower, when the soul turns away from the love of God and longs for lesser things.

533
01:28:47,038 --> 01:28:54,847
Therefore, the will of fallen human nature becomes bad, having no cause for its badness other than, as mentioned, the abandonment of the highest good.

534
01:28:55,367 --> 01:29:00,808
Such a lack of willpower made both the angels who abandoned God and humans who similarly disobeyed Him evil.

535
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:03,982
However, this deficiency is clearly not a part of their nature.

536
01:29:03,982 --> 01:29:10,833
Instead, it is the nature of either humans or angels abandoning their Creator and turning to themselves or even to the lowest creatures.

537
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:14,158
This is the origin of all evil will, corrupt desires, and actions.

538
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:24,737
Although God is not the cause of our evil wills, nor any existing nature, but rather the failing affection of a rational creature from the love of the Creator, He is still the judge and avenger of our thoughts.

539
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:32,042
He is the eternal predestinator of His just revenge and judgment, something which this person tries to invalidate with many convoluted arguments.

540
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:39,699
Regarding the claim that will itself is a nature, we have already warned that this error stems from a misinterpretation of the words of Saint Augustine.

541
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:51,134
When he discusses the will of the human mind that loves itself, which is always good in loving its nature and cannot be otherwise, this person contentiously applies it entirely to the will discussed in the context of free will.

542
01:29:51,134 --> 01:29:59,749
As we said, the same will of the mind is different when it naturally loves itself, when aided by grace it loves God, or when corrupted by its own fault it loves the world.

543
01:29:59,749 --> 01:30:02,419
The difference is not one of nature but of affection.

544
01:30:02,419 --> 01:30:07,104
Therefore, it can be both good and bad, depending on what it loves either rightly or wrongly.

545
01:30:07,607 --> 01:30:12,023
Chapter Six
In this sixth chapter he defines:

546
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:12,125
1.

547
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:18,128
No sin and no punishment for it can arise from anywhere else except from a person's own will, using free will wrongly.

548
01:30:18,128 --> 01:30:18,229
2.

549
01:30:18,229 --> 01:30:22,095
And it is extremely foolish to doubt that human will is according to nature.

550
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:22,197
3.

551
01:30:22,197 --> 01:30:25,402
Nor can it be doubted that this very rational substance exists.

552
01:30:25,402 --> 01:30:30,743
Why he established these three definitions and what he wanted to achieve with them is not entirely clear.

553
01:30:30,743 --> 01:30:42,391
Perhaps his main intention in all these arguments is either to defend free will according to nature, which is certainly Pelagian, or to undermine the predestination of God's just judgment as much as possible, which is Ciceronian.

554
01:30:42,391 --> 01:31:17,541
For Cicero, as the blessed Augustine mentions in his books "The City of God" (Book 5, Chapter 9) and shows from Cicero's own words, tried so hard to nullify the arrangement of divine providence that he not only denied predestination but also entirely denied God's foreknowledge, wanting to defend human free will with this reasoning:
And thus he made his listeners sacrilegious while trying to make them free, causing them to think they were so free in their own will that they were in no way subject to God's providential arrangement or predestination; denying God what is supremely and properly God's, that is, foreknowledge of all future events and the predestination of His arrangements.

555
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:20,033
What else is this but to say that God is not God?

556
01:31:20,033 --> 01:31:23,391
For how is He truly God who has no foreknowledge of future events?

557
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:26,951
This is something that must be greatly feared and avoided now as well.

558
01:31:26,951 --> 01:31:34,836
Lest through such contentions and disputes, while we accept and deny a part of God's predestination, intending to make men free, we make them sacrilegious.

559
01:31:34,836 --> 01:31:41,703
Because it certainly pertains to our faith to believe that God's predestination, which is just, is full and perfect in both directions.

560
01:31:41,703 --> 01:31:44,551
It is sacrilegious to deny this, as it is against faith.

561
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:55,408
Since the main aim here is either to defend free will according to nature or to deny the predestination of God's justice halfway, he could use these three arguments in defense of free will.

562
01:31:55,408 --> 01:32:10,116
When he says that no sin and its punishment come from anywhere else but the person's own will misusing free will, it is true because the sin was committed by the person's own will, and the punishment for sin, which is death, misery, and suffering, followed as a consequence.

563
01:32:10,116 --> 01:32:13,658
However, there is a big difference between sin and its punishment.

564
01:32:13,658 --> 01:32:19,509
The person alone committed the sin, but both the person deserved the punishment, and God justly inflicted it.

565
01:32:19,509 --> 01:32:27,507
This argument does not conclude or show what he wants, namely that no punishment for sin, no misery, no suffering imposed on sinners, comes from God.

566
01:32:27,507 --> 01:32:35,988
Therefore, eternal punishments for the wicked could not have been predestined by God because they are not from Him, just as sin is not, nor is the punishment.

567
01:32:35,988 --> 01:32:39,906
As we have already shown, Scripture clearly cries out against this error.

568
01:32:39,906 --> 01:33:04,812
Sirach 11:14 says, "Good and evil; life and death; poverty and wealth are from God." Certainly not the evils that people commit by sinning and acting unjustly, for which God is not at all the author, but those justly imposed on people by God's judgment because of sins, such as famine, killings, hostilities, devastations, and other calamities and disasters.
The prophet Amos also says, "If there is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it?" (Amos 3:6).

569
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:11,361
And the Lord Himself, through the prophet Isaiah, says, "I am the Lord, making peace and creating calamity" (Isaiah 45:7).

570
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:18,768
Hence, He also threatens with certain evils, saying, "And I will bring calamity upon them, the year of their visitation" (Jeremiah 11:23).

571
01:33:18,768 --> 01:33:24,082
And again, "I will heap calamities upon them and spend My arrows against them" (Deuteronomy 32:23).

572
01:33:24,082 --> 01:33:32,241
All these things God is said to create, not as if He is creating some nature, but by decreeing, instituting, and inflicting them with His just judgment.

573
01:33:32,831 --> 01:33:39,662
How should we correctly distinguish and understand, according to this sense, that God did not create death, as stated in Wisdom 1:13?

574
01:33:39,662 --> 01:33:42,948
Yet, death comes from God, as mentioned in Ecclesiasticus 11:14.

575
01:33:42,948 --> 01:33:49,675
Blessed Augustine clearly explains this by saying:
He adds that it is most foolish to doubt that human will is according to nature.

576
01:33:49,675 --> 01:33:53,630
It is true that the will of a rational soul is in accordance with its nature.

577
01:33:53,630 --> 01:34:06,057
However, this natural will is understood differently when it loves and refers to itself, which is always naturally good, versus when it loves the Lord piously or the world perversely, referring to things it loves either above or below itself.

578
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:09,909
Therefore, such a will is no longer in its own mind when naturally present.

579
01:34:09,909 --> 01:34:15,404
It relates to various things outside its substance and can be good or bad, not by nature, but by affection.

580
01:34:15,404 --> 01:34:20,693
This means it is blessed by rightly loving higher things or corrupted by wrongly desiring lower things.

581
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:28,293
In this matter, it is not just nature, but either the virtue or vice of nature-virtue from divine grace or vice from the corruption of its own will.

582
01:34:28,293 --> 01:34:32,812
This is the free will of the human mind: the inclination to desire one thing or another.

583
01:34:32,812 --> 01:34:37,640
This inclination is not outside of nature, because it moves spontaneously in either direction.

584
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:43,905
However, to move towards good, it is stirred by divine grace, and to move towards evil, it is corrupted by its own desire.

585
01:34:43,905 --> 01:34:56,743
We thought it necessary to briefly and diligently demonstrate this, so it can be understood how absurd and deceitful it is to assert the natural freedom of choice everywhere, solely because of the will of the human mind, which naturally loves itself.

586
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:10,644
He neither notices nor admits, or at least pretends not to notice, that the issue of free will is not about the will itself but rather about how that will, influenced either by divine grace or corrupted by its own faults, inclines towards good or evil.

587
01:35:10,644 --> 01:35:16,180
Therefore, it is evident that his stubborn attempt to defend free will naturally is futile and pointless.

588
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:29,728
Although free will exists in human nature and the human mind has a natural ability to desire good, live rightly, and be happy, the ability to actually want good, live rightly, and achieve happiness comes not from human strength but solely from divine grace.

589
01:35:29,728 --> 01:35:41,853
He tries to force us into a position where we either partially deny divine predestination or, by fully asserting predestination, seem to eliminate free will-similar to Cicero's argument that divine foreknowledge negates free will.

590
01:35:41,853 --> 01:35:47,125
Cicero claimed that if God's foreknowledge were true, human free will couldn't exist, or vice versa.

591
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:52,607
Consequently, that blasphemer chose to defend human free will by completely denying God's foreknowledge.

592
01:35:52,607 --> 01:35:57,721
Anyone who examines this closely can see how much this person follows and imitates that argument.

593
01:35:57,721 --> 01:36:03,889
Denying God's foreknowledge also denies God's predestination, as predestination without foreknowledge is meaningless.

594
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:19,915
To clearly understand how both free will and divine predestination can truly coexist without one destroying the other, we find it necessary and beneficial to include the words of Saint Augustine, who, in opposition to Cicero's impious argument, defends both concepts and teaches that both must be upheld.

595
01:36:19,915 --> 01:36:22,445
(Augustine, The City of God, Book 5, Chapter 9).

596
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:31,363
Item after some: And after some:
Item after a few:
These things are for our instruction and confirmation against the errors of human presumption and argumentation.

597
01:36:31,363 --> 01:36:45,452
The most blessed doctor has very clearly discussed this, who also, in another place about this same matter, thus says:
Item about the immutable reason of mutable things in God, and about His eternal and general predestination and foreknowledge, in another place thus says:

598
01:36:45,503 --> 01:36:50,688
Chapter Seven
In the seventh chapter, he provides the following definition.

599
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:54,527
1. Free will should be considered among the intermediate gifts of God.

600
01:36:54,527 --> 01:36:56,831
Therefore, it could have been used to sin.

601
01:36:56,831 --> 01:37:05,059
Here, a brief explanation is needed: although he says that free will is a gift from God, he asserts it only naturally, in the manner of the Pelagians.

602
01:37:05,059 --> 01:37:10,380
The faith of the Church clearly distinguishes between the gifts of nature and the gifts of grace.

603
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:17,676
For instance, God Almighty naturally gave humans a rational and intellectual mind, and in that mind, memory, understanding, and will.

604
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:28,372
He also naturally gave the human body substance, form, appearance, health, and the senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching, all of which are enlivened and animated by the soul.

605
01:37:28,372 --> 01:37:33,144
These are clearly natural gifts that God implanted in humans during the first creation.

606
01:37:33,144 --> 01:38:40,944
However, when God gives humans faith, hope, charity, piety, good will, the ability to do good works, and other similar gifts of His grace, these are gifts of the Holy Spirit, about which the Apostle says:
"But all these things are produced by one and the same Spirit, distributing them to each one individually as He wills"
First Corinthians
12:11.
He also explains that it is said in the psalm:
"When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men"
Ephesians
4:8;
Psalm
68:18.
Therefore, the Catholic faith, the true faith, also considers free will among the gifts of grace. Although God naturally implanted it in humans when He created them as good and endowed with good will, it still needed the grace of the Creator to remain in the good state in which it was created. Once it lost its freedom due to the first sin, it became weakened, corrupted, and deteriorated. Like a fallen ruin, it cannot rise at all to that eternal and supreme good for which humans were created unless it is healed, restored, enlightened, and liberated by God's grace. It cannot become truly free in any other way unless it is made free by God's grace through Him who says:
"If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed"
John
8:36.

607
01:38:41,328 --> 01:40:02,280
So that what the Apostle said might come true in us:
"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom"
Second Corinthians 3:17.
Therefore, as we have said, it is a foolish and Pelagian error to think that free will, which was lost by Adam's sin, can be restored without the grace of Christ.
The idea that free will, created in the first man, was good, right, and inclined towards higher and divine things, allowing him to be sinless if he chose, is far from the truth. Such a belief misrepresents the greatness of free will as one of the highest gifts from God, rather than a mediocre one.
As we have said, the good of free will in that first man was so great that none of the saints in this present life possess it. Although their free will is liberated and healed by the grace of Christ, they cannot live without sin. Despite their strong desire not to sin, they still find themselves unable to avoid it.
Hence, they need to pray daily and truthfully say to the Heavenly Father:
"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
Therefore, the gift of free will in paradise was not mediocre but the highest, allowing man to live without sin as long as he remained obedient to God. Had he continued to subject himself to God's rule and help, he would have been further perfected and given the strength to no longer sin.
However, the free will of the first man could lead to sin due to the abandonment of God and his own presumption. By neglecting to remain under God's guidance and wanting to be self-sufficient, he lost the gift of divine grace, the good of nature, and found himself condemned to misery.

608
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:06,936
Chapter Eight
In the eighth chapter, he presents these definitions:

609
01:40:06,936 --> 01:40:11,680
One, the substantial trinity of the inner human is contained in essence, will, and knowledge.

610
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:20,556
Two, there is no difference for him between being and willing, nor between willing and knowing; rather, these three are one nature, and the entire nature of the soul is will.

611
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:27,647
Three, free will is the nature of humans, and their free movement and power to move is what free will is, which is a gift from the Creator.

612
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:38,258
Four, just as the physical body could die because it was not yet perfect, that is, spiritual, so free will, still belonging to the physical body because it is mortal, could sin because it was not yet perfect.

613
01:40:38,258 --> 01:40:45,145
This perfection of freedom would be fulfilled after keeping the commandment, when the will to sin would be entirely taken away from it.

614
01:40:45,145 --> 01:40:48,104
Five, this movement is granted to no animal except humans.

615
01:40:48,104 --> 01:40:59,327
Six, there is such a difference between human free will and its substance that nature is in rational will, while free will is in its freedom, whether in the naturally free movement of will or in the gift of intelligence.

616
01:40:59,327 --> 01:41:12,030
Seven, these three, that is, freedom, movement, and intelligence, compose free will among themselves: so that, just as the substance in which it exists is threefold - it exists, it wills, and it knows - so it is threefold: free, moving, intelligent.

617
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:43,607
Therefore, he says that the substantial trinity of the inner human is contained in essence, will, and knowledge, partly taken from the discussions of Saint Augustine in the books "On the Trinity," and partly thought out by himself.
For the blessed Augustine, disputing about the holy and supreme Trinity, in Book Nine, Chapter Two, and Book Fifteen, Chapter Seven, and about the mind of humans where they were created in the image and likeness of God, draws a likeness to God, so that through that image of the trinity which is in the human mind, he might elevate us to contemplate in some way the Trinity which is God.

618
01:41:44,016 --> 01:41:52,157
He insists that these three aspects-being, knowing, and willing-are present in the human mind in a way that they are distinctly three, yet one in substance.

619
01:41:52,157 --> 01:42:01,342
Specifically, when the mind, which naturally exists, naturally knows itself and naturally wills, that is, loves itself, its knowledge and will are then directed towards itself.

620
01:42:01,342 --> 01:42:10,005
At that time, although these three-being, knowing itself, and willing itself-are distinctly understood to be in the mind, the being itself is the essence of the mind.

621
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:17,415
It naturally knows itself and naturally wills itself; it is whole, and just as it entirely has being, it also entirely knows and loves itself.

622
01:42:17,415 --> 01:42:21,956
Therefore, the scope of its essence is the same as the scope of its knowledge and will.

623
01:42:21,956 --> 01:42:29,210
From this comparison, the blessed doctor encourages us to rise from the likeness of our mind to contemplate the true Trinity, which is God.

624
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:38,499
Just as these three aspects-being, knowing itself, and willing itself-are found in the human mind, each can be distinctly discerned, yet they are substantially and naturally one.

625
01:42:38,499 --> 01:42:44,866
As great as the mind is, so is its knowledge of itself and its love of itself, because it entirely knows and loves itself.

626
01:42:44,866 --> 01:42:50,241
Thus, from this image and likeness of God, let us elevate our understanding to the Trinity of the Lord.

627
01:42:50,241 --> 01:43:03,288
Recognize in the blessed and supreme Trinity, distinctly and properly three things-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit-these three are essentially and naturally one and equal, so that just as great as the Father is, so is the Son, and so is the Holy Spirit.

628
01:43:03,288 --> 01:43:12,630
In this way, as if through a mirror and a reflection of our mind, let us learn to understand the holy Trinity, distinct in persons, united in substance, equal in nature and power.

629
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:20,730
This man, after reading these enlightening words aimed at strengthening our faith, was not content with the moderation and piety of the holy doctor.

630
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:28,923
He disregarded the boundaries set by him and added his own ideas, claiming that these three things, contemplated in the mind of man, form a substantial Trinity.

631
01:43:28,923 --> 01:43:35,068
However, a substantial Trinity, meaning one that exists substantially in persons, can only be found in the one true God.

632
01:43:35,068 --> 01:43:45,463
Therefore, the same doctor, to prevent anyone from making mistakes on this matter, clearly warns and teaches in his books that these three things are not the man himself but are of the man or in the man.

633
01:43:45,463 --> 01:43:53,195
In contrast, within the holy Trinity, those three distinct aspects should not and cannot be said to exist in one God, but rather that God truly is one.

634
01:43:53,195 --> 01:43:57,138
We do not say that the Trinity is in God; instead, the Trinity itself is God.

635
01:43:57,138 --> 01:45:00,940
As the holy doctor states in book fifteen on the Trinity, chapter six: "These three are in the mind, or the mind itself: and thus these three are not the man, but are of the man, or in the man. Even when the body is removed, if we consider the soul alone, its mind is like its head, or eye, or face, but these are not to be thought of as bodies. Therefore, it is not the soul, but what excels in the soul, that is called the mind."
But can we say that the Trinity is in God in such a way that some part of God is not God Himself? This man, after wrongly stating that a substantial Trinity is contained in the essence, will, and knowledge of the mind, added something even worse. He claimed that in the mind of man, its being and willing are not distinct, nor are its willing and knowing different, and that the entire nature of the soul is will; but these three are one nature.
Conversely, our faith firmly holds that no creature, whether angelic or human, exists with such a simple nature or essence that its being is also its understanding, because it can exist without understanding. Nor is its being the same as its willing, because it can exist without willing. Nor is its being the same as its knowing, because it can exist without knowing.

636
01:45:01,248 --> 01:45:05,284
This is not the same as loving for him, because he can exist without loving.

637
01:45:05,284 --> 01:45:12,720
Only the divine nature has that supreme and ineffable simplicity, where to exist is the same as to have whatever can truly be said to exist.

638
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:22,121
For example, for God, to exist is the same as to understand, because in Him, essence and understanding are not different: essence is understanding, and understanding is essence.

639
01:45:22,121 --> 01:45:30,513
Similarly, for Him, to exist is not different from being wise, because in Him, essence and wisdom are not different: essence is wisdom, and wisdom is essence.

640
01:45:30,513 --> 01:46:27,290
On this topic, the same blessed doctor speaks as follows:
And after some things:
Again, when he spoke only about the Son, he said this about Him:
Therefore, since these things are so, how did he dare to say about the human mind's creation: "And it is not different for it to exist and to will, nor is it different to will and to know, but these three make up one nature and the whole nature of the soul is will"? When, on the contrary, the holy doctor, whom he seems to follow, and whose caution and moderation he presumptuously surpasses with his own levity and vanity, shows so much distance between those three things found in the human mind as a certain likeness of the Trinity, that is, being, knowing, and loving.
He shows this distance so clearly, saying (On the Trinity, Book 10, Chapter 11, 12):
Behold, according to the truth taught by the holy man, how great is the distance and diversity in the human mind itself among these three things, which are naturally in it and belong to it: the memory of itself, the understanding of itself, and the love of itself.

641
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:34,620
While through memory alone it remembers itself, through understanding alone it understands itself, and through love alone it loves itself.

642
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:46,252
Therefore, memory can do one thing, understanding another, and love another: what memory can do, understanding cannot, and what understanding can do, memory cannot: and what memory and understanding can do, will cannot.

643
01:46:46,252 --> 01:46:53,316
And if the essence of the mind is considered distinctly, what it can do essentially in these three, it surely cannot do without them.

644
01:46:53,688 --> 01:46:59,856
This person argues that for the mind, being and wanting are not different, nor are wanting and knowing different.

645
01:46:59,856 --> 01:47:03,405
If we accept this, what is this new, unheard-of claim suggesting?

646
01:47:03,405 --> 01:47:09,574
It's saying that just as God has a simple nature, the human mind should also be believed to have a simple nature.

647
01:47:09,574 --> 01:47:19,182
If for the human mind, existing is the same as wanting, then its essence and will are clearly not different; rather, the essence itself is will, and the will itself is essence.

648
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:28,844
Similarly, if for the human mind, wanting and knowing are not different, then will and essence are not different; rather, will itself is knowledge, and knowledge itself is will.

649
01:47:28,844 --> 01:47:37,360
From this incredible reasoning, it follows that, as this person says, the entire mind is essence, the entire mind is will, and the entire mind is knowledge.

650
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:48,606
Just as it is truly believed about God, and can only be rightly said of Him, that what He has, He is: He has justice, but He is justice; He has wisdom, but He is wisdom; He has goodness, but He is goodness.

651
01:47:48,606 --> 01:47:53,465
Therefore, it follows that the same should be said of the human mind: what it has, it is.

652
01:47:53,465 --> 01:48:02,855
That is, it has will, but it is will; it has knowledge, but it is knowledge; so that, just as we believe about God, there is no difference for Him between being and having.

653
01:48:02,855 --> 01:48:23,435
Behold, therefore, this author, or rather deceiver, against all the truth of faith, against the authority of Holy Scripture, against the sincerity of the teachings of the Fathers, indeed against all divine and human reason, has invented a creature, that is, the human mind, which is of a simple nature, and thus unchangeable, just as God is of a simple and unchangeable nature.

654
01:48:23,435 --> 01:48:37,302
While, on the contrary, the truth cries out, and Saint Augustine himself, as we have shown above, clearly affirms that every creature is complex and in no way truly simple; and he also says: nothing changeable is simple, but every creature is changeable.

655
01:48:37,848 --> 01:48:48,912
Therefore, let this man choose one of two options: if the nature of the mind, as he tries to assert, is simple, it is not changeable, because, as the teacher himself says, and very truly says, nothing changeable is simple.

656
01:48:48,912 --> 01:48:53,896
However, if the nature of the mind itself, like all creation, is truly changeable, it is not simple.

657
01:48:53,896 --> 01:49:10,743
So, let it be far from us to think that the blessed Augustine, who affirms that all creation is changeable and complex, and in no way simple, thought or wrote such things about the nature of the human mind that he would assert it to be not only similar but also equal to God if he had said that it is of an unchangeable and simple nature!

658
01:49:10,743 --> 01:49:29,035
Let anyone who is willing and able read diligently and investigate very carefully what he said about this matter in the books about the Trinity, and they will find him saying that the three things found in the human mind, which have often been mentioned because of the unity of the substance of the mind in which they reside, are one, and one mind, and one substance.

659
01:49:29,035 --> 01:49:37,558
They will find him saying that these things are substantially within the mind, and that the mind is substance, and self-knowledge is substance, and self-will is substance.

660
01:49:37,558 --> 01:49:48,024
Likewise, they will find him saying that the whole mind knows itself, the whole mind wills or loves itself; yet nowhere will they find him saying that the mind itself is knowledge, that the mind itself is will.

661
01:49:48,024 --> 01:49:58,192
Since it has already been shown from his own words above that knowledge is one thing there, through which the mind alone knows itself, and will is another thing, through which the mind alone loves itself.

662
01:49:58,192 --> 01:50:02,877
Why, then, when the whole mind knows itself, did he not say that the mind itself is knowledge?

663
01:50:02,877 --> 01:50:06,964
And when the whole mind wills itself, did he not say that the mind itself is will?

664
01:50:06,964 --> 01:50:13,892
Unless because the mind itself is a creation and is not simple; and its being is one thing, its knowing is another, its willing is another.

665
01:50:13,892 --> 01:50:20,471
But if anyone, or this man who said this, objects: how then are these three one, one mind, one substance, if there is this and that?

666
01:50:20,471 --> 01:50:26,253
He should recognize that these three can be said to be substantially one because they are one, and in one substance.

667
01:50:26,253 --> 01:50:33,529
And potentially this and that, because, as the teacher himself shows, memory in the mind can be one thing, intelligence another, and will another.

668
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:43,716
In the divine Trinity, we can say one person and another and another; but we cannot say one thing and another thing and another thing, because of the supreme unity of its simple nature.

669
01:50:43,716 --> 01:50:48,484
Therefore, there is supreme simplicity where one thing and another thing can never be found.

670
01:50:48,484 --> 01:51:58,816
An ancient debater, discussing the incorporeal nature of the soul, once said: "And when the soul wills, if it wills entirely, it is entirely will."
He carefully asserted that the soul can sometimes be called entirely will when it entirely wills, because it wills not outside itself, but in itself and with itself.
He did not define it absolutely as will, but conditionally said, "if it wills entirely, it is entirely will."
This means that if it does not will entirely, it is not entirely will, something naturally understood by everyone.
The soul can will one thing in part and not will the same thing in part; what it entirely wills, it can entirely not will.
Therefore, due to this changeable and variable movement of will, the nature of the soul should not be said to be entirely will.
It is not entirely will when it wills in part, nor when it entirely does not will what it had willed, even though it always has the ability to will.
Yet, with its nature and substance always remaining, it wills the same thing according to its desires or rejections, either remaining the same, changing, or perishing.
Therefore, let us stop saying that the entire nature of the soul is will, that is, that the soul itself is will.
The soul is not of a simple nature like God, where to be is the same as to will, nor is it different for the soul to be and to have will.

671
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:04,237
Given these points, let such an impious and profane notion be driven away from the ears of the faithful.

672
01:52:04,237 --> 01:52:09,196
Those who admire and willingly listen to such a teacher should remember that they are Christians.

673
01:52:09,196 --> 01:52:13,541
They must keep the Catholic faith-the true understanding of God-whole and unviolated.

674
01:52:13,541 --> 01:52:19,216
They should faithfully guard the father's teachings and avoid the impious presumptions of words with all piety.

675
01:52:19,216 --> 01:53:40,403
As the Apostle vehemently recommends, saying: "O Timothy, guard the deposit, avoiding profane novelties of words and oppositions of falsely named knowledge; which some have professed and have fallen away from the faith, or have shipwrecked concerning the faith" First Timothy 6:20-21."
Let us learn not to have itching ears-that is, being eager and desiring empty and old wives' tales. Regarding this evil, the Apostle says: "For there will be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, they will heap up for themselves teachers, having itching ears. And they will turn away their ears from the truth and will be turned aside to myths" Second Timothy 4:3-4."
What remains for those who say or receive such things-that is, to equate the human mind with God, suggesting it is also of a simple nature-except that, as the worst ancient heretics said, they blaspheme that God and the soul are of the same nature.
He further says: "Free will is the nature of man, and its free movement, and the power of moving; that free will is a gift of the Creator." However, as we have already stated, and as the truth of the matter evidently shows, we do not say that man is will, but that man has will; because obviously, to be is one thing, and to will is another. Therefore, it is not man who is will, but it is man's will.
Nevertheless, he shows that, with Pelagian error, he believes free will to be according to the nature of man alone, and to be a gift of nature, not a gift of grace-that is, human will, as he says, free movement, and the power of moving.

676
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:48,279
This clearly shows that human will not only has a natural tendency to desire good or evil but also the freedom to choose and act on that desire.

677
01:53:48,279 --> 01:54:11,452
However, the Catholic faith asserts, against all such errors, that free will, although originally upright and whole in humans before sin, has been corrupted by sin, even lost, and has no desire for good nor the ability to do good, except through hidden grace given and inspired by Him of whom the Apostle very truly says:
"For it is God who works in you both to will and to act in order to fulfill His good purpose"
(Philippians 2:13).

678
01:54:11,452 --> 01:54:25,570
As we have already mentioned, it is naturally instilled by the Creator that one can will and even be able to do good; but to will and do this does not come from oneself, but only from Him who works in the hearts of the faithful to will and act for His good purpose.

679
01:54:25,570 --> 01:54:46,026
Hence, there is that most ecclesiastical and faithful definition, which the blessed Pope Celestine sets forth in his decrees saying,
(Celestine, Letter to the Bishops of Gaul 819):
And again, from this apostolic and ecclesiastical definition, it is most certainly shown that free will in humans can do nothing to desire or achieve good unless it has been freed by the grace of Christ.

680
01:54:46,026 --> 01:54:52,898
However, it is free to do evil, because when one sins, one is not compelled by any necessity, but is corrupted by one's own will.

681
01:54:53,112 --> 01:55:03,614
Then he adds: Just as the physical body could die because it was not yet perfect, meaning it was not yet spiritual, so the free will, still animal in nature and mortal, could sin because it was not yet perfect.

682
01:55:03,614 --> 01:55:09,566
This perfection of freedom would be fulfilled after keeping the commandment, while the will to sin would be taken away.

683
01:55:09,566 --> 01:55:23,020
Where else should we talk about the physical and spiritual body, except what the Apostle teaches, saying: If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written: the first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.

684
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:24,370
First Corinthians 15:44-45.

685
01:55:24,370 --> 01:55:30,822
And earlier, when talking about the resurrection of the dead, he said: It is sown a physical body, it will rise a spiritual body.

686
01:55:30,822 --> 01:55:32,022
First Corinthians 15:44.

687
01:55:32,022 --> 01:55:40,825
In these words, how else can we distinguish between a physical and a spiritual body, except that the physical body is only given life mortally and corruptibly through the soul?

688
01:55:40,825 --> 01:56:00,130
This was the nature of Adam's body even before the sin; because although it was not yet destined for death and decay, it could still be corrupted and die due to sin, just as it happened to him and happens to all his descendants, by the just judgment and punishment of Him who said: Until you return to the ground from which you were taken, for you are dust, and to dust you will return.

689
01:56:00,130 --> 01:56:08,482
But the spiritual body is called such, not because it ceases to be a body and becomes a spirit, because even though it is spiritual, the Apostle still calls it a body.

690
01:56:08,482 --> 01:56:13,834
But then it will be a spiritual body when it is given life immortally and incorruptibly through the spirit.

691
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:27,387
The kind of body the last Adam, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, showed in His resurrection, through which He transformed the mortal body He had taken into immortality and incorruption, and will show in His holy ones on the last day through the same grace of incorruption.

692
01:56:27,888 --> 01:56:42,188
Even as, according to the same Apostle:
This corruptible body must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must put on immortality, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life; and thus the saying that is written will be fulfilled: Death is swallowed up in victory.

693
01:56:42,188 --> 01:56:43,597
First Corinthians 15:53-54.

694
01:56:43,597 --> 01:56:48,347
The body, which is now sown as a natural body in death, will be raised as a spiritual body.

695
01:56:48,347 --> 01:56:49,599
First Corinthians 15:44.

696
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:58,107
It will no longer need sustenance, it will no longer be subject to corruption or death, but will instead be brought to life by the spirit with eternal immortality.

697
01:56:58,107 --> 01:57:05,309
This is how Adam's body would have been if there had been no intervening death, as a reward from God for his obedience, had he not sinned.

698
01:57:05,309 --> 01:57:14,860
Therefore, it is true that Adam's body was still natural and had not yet been transformed into that immortality, which would have been given to him if he had remained obedient to God.

699
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:23,367
So, even if he had not sinned, he could not die, and if he had sinned, he could die; it is clear that he could die because he had not yet been granted immortality.

700
01:57:23,367 --> 01:57:29,787
In this man, there was still a natural will, according to the desire of the human soul, not according to the spirit of God.

701
01:57:29,787 --> 01:57:37,564
He was not yet in the inner man, that is, in the spirit of his mind, spiritually, but was still natural, sensing in a natural, not spiritual, manner.

702
01:57:37,564 --> 01:57:42,417
About whom the Apostle says:
The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.

703
01:57:42,417 --> 01:57:43,618
First Corinthians 2:14.

704
01:57:43,618 --> 01:57:57,866
The Apostle shows that the great mystery which was to come in Christ and in the Church was prophesied by him, when, filled with the divine Spirit, he says:
For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.

705
01:57:57,866 --> 01:57:58,649
Ephesians 5:31.

706
01:57:59,328 --> 01:58:05,183
With these words, the Apostle explained:
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.

707
01:58:05,183 --> 01:58:05,974
Ephesians 5:32.

708
01:58:05,974 --> 01:58:11,988
How then was his will not spiritual, aided by the spirit, and enlightened, even elevated by the grace of prophecy?

709
01:58:11,988 --> 01:58:15,892
Yet even the spiritual will could sin if it fell into worse circumstances.

710
01:58:15,892 --> 01:58:31,559
As the same Apostle shows, even the spiritual can be tempted, that is, overcome by some temptation of sin, where he says:
Brothers, if someone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.

711
01:58:31,559 --> 01:58:32,298
Galatians 6:1.

712
01:58:32,298 --> 01:58:37,256
So then, the will of that man, even if spiritual, could be tempted and overcome by temptation.

713
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:44,694
And if it had reached that fullness of happiness by obedience where it could no longer sin, the will to sin would not be taken away from him.

714
01:58:44,694 --> 01:58:53,029
As this person says, it was not in him at all, but the good will that was in him would be so perfected by such happiness that it could not be changed to evil.

715
01:58:53,029 --> 01:59:01,997
For the human will can be faithfully understood in three states:
Firstly, that the first man was created with a good will such that, if he wished, he could avoid sinning.

716
01:59:01,997 --> 01:59:08,538
Now, however, even holy people, because they are born from his corrupted lineage, cannot avoid sinning even if they wish to.

717
01:59:08,538 --> 01:59:12,020
Hence, they truthfully say to God every day:
Forgive us our debts.

718
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:12,706
Matthew 6:12.

719
01:59:12,706 --> 01:59:24,628
But in the happiness that will be given to them, they will be so strengthened in virtue that they will no longer be able to sin, just as they will be clothed with such grace of incorruption that they will never be able to die.

720
01:59:24,628 --> 01:59:39,768
It is strange, however, why he wanted to add and say:
This motion, that is, free will, is granted to no animals except humans, when it is clear to everyone that where there is no rational nature, as in all brute and irrational animals, there can be no rational will to seek good or evil.

721
01:59:39,768 --> 01:59:44,304
But they are led to everything they do by mere natural, brute, and senseless appetite.

722
01:59:45,096 --> 01:59:51,678
From this, whatever actions they perform cannot be called good or bad, nor vices nor virtues, as far as they are concerned.

723
01:59:51,678 --> 01:59:58,313
It might be thought that human free will is somewhat like the desire of irrational beasts, driven solely by natural impulse.

724
01:59:58,313 --> 02:00:02,808
Similarly, human free will is led by its own natural instinct to whatever it wishes.

725
02:00:02,808 --> 02:00:06,822
How contrary this is to the truth has already been demonstrated many times.

726
02:00:06,822 --> 02:00:21,003
This disputant has taken such liberties with the senses and ears of his audience that he dared, like a fabricator and potter of lies, to create a new definition of free will, as if it were clay and muddy, and to present it as something significant to the observers.

727
02:00:21,003 --> 02:00:27,960
He further added: Let there be such a difference between human free will and its substance, that its nature lies in rational will.

728
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:33,686
Free will indeed in its freedom, or in the movement of naturally free will, or in the gift of intelligence.

729
02:00:33,686 --> 02:00:37,592
Behold what kind of free will he teaches: surely Pelagian, not Christian!

730
02:00:37,592 --> 02:00:47,171
Its nature is rational will, but its effect lies in the natural freedom of the will; and from or in the natural will alone, it has freedom, movement, and the gift of intelligence.

731
02:00:47,171 --> 02:01:01,513
We, however, according to the truth of faith, recognize free will in man in this way: although it is naturally implanted by God in the rational mind and given as good and right in the first condition, by the merit of sin, it is depraved and stripped of natural virtue.

732
02:01:01,513 --> 02:01:27,520
It can have no freedom towards true good, no movement of good will, and no light of intelligence unless restored by the grace of Him who said: If the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed John 8:36; and who, by His inspiration, moves the hearts of whom He wills to faith, as the prophet says: I will shake all nations, and the Desired of all nations shall come Haggai 2:7; and to whom we daily pray, saying: Give me understanding, that I may learn Your commandments Psalm 119:73.

733
02:01:28,056 --> 02:01:31,786
And again: "Give me understanding, and I shall live" (Psalm 119:144).

734
02:01:31,786 --> 02:01:39,139
Regarding this understanding, we give thanks to the Giver, saying: "I will bless the Lord, who has given me understanding" (Psalm 16:7).

735
02:01:39,139 --> 02:01:45,033
True free will is not a gift of nature, as some proponents of the Pelagian heresy claim, but a gift of grace.

736
02:01:45,033 --> 02:01:48,168
It is free because it is liberated by the grace of Christ.

737
02:01:48,168 --> 02:01:54,224
This proponent argues that freedom of choice, movement, and intelligence all rest solely in the power of nature.

738
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:57,900
He presents free will as a new entity composed of these three parts.

739
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:02,280
He says: These three-freedom, movement, and intelligence-together form free will.

740
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:09,957
Just as the substance in which it resides is threefold-being, willing, and knowing-so too it becomes threefold: free, moving, and intelligent.

741
02:02:09,957 --> 02:02:15,040
He argues that free will rests solely in nature itself and in those things inherent to nature.

742
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:27,745
He contends that, just as three things are naturally inherent to the human mind-being, willing, and knowing-so too free will proceeds from the mind itself and resides within it, having freedom, movement, and intelligence from it alone.

743
02:02:27,745 --> 02:02:32,287
Thus, man is naturally free, moving, and intelligent through this kind of free will.

744
02:02:32,287 --> 02:02:39,262
He does not say that the human mind possesses these three things within itself, but rather that it is threefold by simple nature.

745
02:02:39,262 --> 02:02:42,452
And in the same way, he claims that free will is threefold.

746
02:02:42,452 --> 02:02:45,479
Who has ever heard of such contentious impiety of error?

747
02:02:45,479 --> 02:02:53,481
He strives so hard to confine and seemingly fortify free will within the boundaries of human nature alone, completely excluding God's grace from it.

748
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:59,212
So what response should be given to him, to whom so many responses have already been given on this matter?

749
02:03:00,024 --> 02:03:05,142
Unless someone wants to be or appear as a Christian, they should reject this insane and deadly error.

750
02:03:05,142 --> 02:03:11,020
The more subtly they seem to follow and assert it, the more unfortunately they are trapped and blinded by the devil.

751
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:21,762
They should humbly submit themselves entirely to the truth of Holy Scripture, the authority of the Church Fathers, and the simplicity of faith, casting aside the false and deceptive arguments of human inventions.

752
02:03:21,762 --> 02:03:29,313
Otherwise, while they believe they are securing their own freedom and separating themselves from Christ, they truly deserve to be alienated from Him.

753
02:03:29,313 --> 02:03:34,937
For cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.

754
02:03:34,937 --> 02:03:35,647
Jeremiah 17:5.

755
02:03:35,647 --> 02:03:39,447
But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose trust is the Lord.

756
02:03:39,447 --> 02:03:40,157
Jeremiah 17:7.

757
02:03:40,512 --> 02:03:44,928
Chapter Nine
In this chapter, he presents these definitions:

758
02:03:44,928 --> 02:03:49,870
First, foreknowledge and predestination are attributed to God by analogy with temporal things.

759
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:52,183
Second, all predestination is foreknowledge.

760
02:03:52,183 --> 02:04:04,802
Considering the use of temporal things, which vary by the past, present, and future, it pertains more to temporal things where many future events are expected:
Because clearly foreknowledge and predestination properly concern future things.

761
02:04:04,802 --> 02:04:11,847
However, with God, just as nothing is past, nothing is future either, since in His eternal knowledge all things are eternally present.

762
02:04:11,847 --> 02:04:16,158
Therefore, these concepts are more metaphorically attributed to God than properly.

763
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:25,832
So, how did this person frequently define foreknowledge and predestination not only as being of God and in God (which we also acknowledge) but as the very substance and essence of God?

764
02:04:25,832 --> 02:04:33,929
If he contradicts his own argument, affirming one thing and later negating it, why do we need to refute his vanity when he so effectively refutes himself?

765
02:04:33,929 --> 02:04:49,755
If any rule of sophistical disputation, which he solely follows, allows secular wisdom to affirm in one place and subvert in another, who cannot see how contemptible and utterly rejectable it is, where there is no firmness of truth, and so impudent, so brazen, so insolent is the freedom of falsehood.

766
02:04:49,755 --> 02:05:00,428
As for his statement that all predestination is foreknowledge, it is partly true:
Because all predestination of future things is not without foreknowledge, through which those future things are foreseen.

767
02:05:00,428 --> 02:05:12,784
But if this means that predestination does nothing more than foreknowledge, it is most manifestly false:
Because by foreknowledge, future things are only foreseen;
But by predestination, they are also established, defined, and decreed.

768
02:05:12,784 --> 02:05:21,722
Therefore, the predestination of the wicked to eternal punishment not only foresaw but also established and defined by a just and eternal judgment what they would suffer.

769
02:05:22,248 --> 02:05:27,672
Chapter Ten
In the tenth chapter, he presents four definitions as follows:

770
02:05:27,672 --> 02:05:34,802
One, that God foreknows or predestines sins, or the death or punishments of humans or angels, should be understood in the opposite way.

771
02:05:34,802 --> 02:05:38,394
Two, that all evil is sin and its punishment; and these are nothing.

772
02:05:38,394 --> 02:05:47,268
Three, that sin and its consequences in death and misery are nothing other than the corruption of a complete and blessed life, so that each one is opposed to the other.

773
02:05:47,268 --> 02:05:51,388
Indeed, sin opposes integrity, death opposes life, misery opposes blessedness.

774
02:05:51,388 --> 02:05:52,919
These are absolutely nothing.

775
02:05:52,919 --> 02:06:03,114
Four, that every defect or deprivation or sin of a perverse will and its end in death and eternal misery of punishments are absolutely nothing; and therefore cannot be foreknown or predestined.

776
02:06:03,114 --> 02:06:13,625
Behold to what extent this diabolic debate has led: a man who wants to appear Christian, with pagan and diabolic arguments, subverts and destroys all faith in divine foreknowledge and predestination.

777
02:06:13,625 --> 02:06:22,340
He argues that God foreknew and predestined the wicked to be damned, nullifying the just judgment of God and His eternal and unchangeable counsel in their damnation.

778
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:26,883
He contends that sin and every punishment and damnation which follows sin are nothing.

779
02:06:26,883 --> 02:06:31,953
And therefore, because they are nothing, they could neither be foreknown nor predestined by God.

780
02:06:31,953 --> 02:06:44,630
So wherever in the Holy Scriptures or in the doctrines of the Fathers it is read that such things were foreknown and predestined, it should be understood in the opposite way, that is, that they were neither foreknown nor predestined at all.

781
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,954
What is this but to openly declare insanity?

782
02:06:46,954 --> 02:06:55,670
For who among the faithful ever presumed to think or say that what truth declared is not truth; what faith taught is false; what all the faithful believe is nothing?

783
02:06:56,304 --> 02:07:10,634
This person argues that sin, punishment, misery, and calamity-whether temporary or eternal-are nothing because they lack an essence for existing or subsisting, unlike the earth, waters, fires, plants, and trees, which have a substance for existing or subsisting.

784
02:07:10,634 --> 02:07:17,362
We know and believe that human souls and the spirits of good or evil angels have the substance for existing and subsisting.

785
02:07:17,362 --> 02:07:24,582
Therefore, he boldly asserts with diabolical presumption that God could only know, foresee, and predestine the substances of things.

786
02:07:24,582 --> 02:07:34,810
He claims that things contrary and punitive to these substances, because they lack the substance of existing, cannot be foreseen or predestined by God, and thus could not be known by Him.

787
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:40,608
He argues that God did not foresee the sin of the first man, because sin lacks the substance for existing.

788
02:07:40,608 --> 02:07:47,719
Nor did He foresee the punishment for sin-death, misery, and eternal suffering-because these similarly lack substantial existence.

789
02:07:47,719 --> 02:07:53,134
But where is the faith that firmly holds that Almighty God is truly prescient of all future events?

790
02:07:53,134 --> 02:08:02,651
Where is it that through His prophets, in the holy Scriptures, He foretells so many sins of men, and so many punishments, calamities, and miseries of sinners with His spirit?

791
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:16,271
Where is it also that His only begotten Son, who is Eternal Truth, foretells so many persecutions of His Church, so many wars, pressures, labors, terrors, earthquakes, plagues, and famines, advising His followers to endure them with utmost patience?

792
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:31,859
Why has this impious person dared to utter such an obvious lie, or rather such unheard-of and wicked blasphemy, against the faith of the entire holy Church, against the truth of the heavenly Scriptures, and against the majesty of Almighty God with sacrilegious mouth and impious words?

793
02:08:32,351 --> 02:08:42,295
What tries so hard to imitate and assist the devil's plan and deception by claiming that the eternal punishments, which God truthfully predicts and threatens for the wicked, are nothing?

794
02:08:42,295 --> 02:09:05,070
Just as the serpent in the beginning tried to remove the fear of death that God had warned about from the heart of man and entice him to delight in sin, saying: "You will not surely die" (Genesis 3:4); so too does this one, an imitator of the serpent, by saying that the eternal torments, which God warns sinners about, are nothing, remove the healthy fear from the hearts of listeners and make them reckless and eager to sin.

795
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:11,592
Therefore, it must be firmly and unshakably believed that the all-powerful God knows all future events, both good and bad.

796
02:09:11,592 --> 02:09:19,558
Not only did He foresee the nature of all things before He created them, but He also foresaw whatever could be contrary and harmful to those natures.

797
02:09:19,558 --> 02:09:25,760
Not because these things exist in substance, but because they can harm the substances created by Him in a penal way.

798
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:33,351
For Scripture confirms this faith, saying: "Eternal God, who knows the hidden things, who knows all things before they happen" (Daniel 13:42).

799
02:09:33,351 --> 02:09:45,541
And the Lord Himself warns His faithful about these things in the Gospel, saying: "I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has the power to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him" (Luke 12:5).

800
02:09:45,541 --> 02:09:54,255
But this one, on the contrary, says that the eternal torments, for both humans and evil angels, which are threatened and prepared for them, are absolutely nothing.

801
02:09:54,255 --> 02:10:08,476
If the eternal punishments for evil angels and the worst of humans are not predestined, then why did the just judge and condemner of them say in that judgment: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41)?

802
02:10:08,903 --> 02:10:13,655
If he is indeed prepared and predestined, is he predestined for the condemned among the angels?

803
02:10:13,655 --> 02:10:19,157
But for the wicked, who are to be punished with the same eternal fire, is he neither prepared nor predestined?

804
02:10:19,157 --> 02:10:28,860
However, the blessed Enoch, the very ancient patriarch who walked with God and was taken by the Lord, prophesied about the eternal punishments and penalties for the wicked even before the flood.

805
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:54,519
The blessed Apostle Jude, speaking of the most wicked heretics who began attacking the Church of God in the times of the apostles, bears witness, saying:
Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about these men, saying:
"Behold, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment on everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him"
(Jude 14-15).

806
02:10:54,519 --> 02:11:20,227
This judgment of condemnation for the wicked, unrighteous, and blasphemous people, foretold so marvelously from the beginning of the world and to be truly fulfilled at the end of the world, is also declared by the blessed Apostle Peter in these words:
"But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them-bringing swift destruction on themselves"
(Second Peter 2:1).

807
02:11:20,227 --> 02:11:27,480
And a little later he adds:
"Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping"
(Second Peter 2:3).

808
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:49,787
Therefore, if we seek the eternal predestination of this judgment from God, let us carefully hear what he says:
"Their condemnation has long been hanging over them," that is, they are not judged for the first time now; nor for the first time when they depart from the body to eternal punishment.
But this judgment of their condemnation has long been decreed, long predestined from eternity; and it has long been prepared for them without ceasing.

809
02:11:50,087 --> 02:11:57,109
If we seek to understand the punishment that will befall them through such judgment, it says their destruction does not slumber.

810
02:11:57,109 --> 02:12:08,520
Likewise, regarding these wicked and blasphemous people, the same apostle says:
"These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved"
(Second Peter 2:17).

811
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:15,542
How has it been reserved for them, except that it was prepared for them from the beginning and will be given to them in the end?

812
02:12:15,542 --> 02:12:33,316
Blessed Jude the apostle testifies to this with nearly the same words, saying:
"These are clouds without water, blown by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted; wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the storm of darkness is reserved forever"
(Jude 12, 13).

813
02:12:33,316 --> 02:12:43,410
Against these horrendous and terrible threats that Almighty God warns the wicked and sinners through His prophets and apostles, he says:
All evil, sin, and its punishment do not exist.

814
02:12:43,410 --> 02:12:47,415
And he asserts again:
The integrity of nature, life, and happiness exist.

815
02:12:47,415 --> 02:12:50,926
But on the contrary, sin, death, and misery do not exist at all.

816
02:12:50,926 --> 02:13:02,337
He further added:
Any defect or deprivation of perverse will, sin, and its end-death and the misery of eternal punishments-do not exist at all: and therefore, they are neither foreseen by God nor predestined.

817
02:13:02,337 --> 02:13:14,186
If we must discuss any of these things individually, faith clearly knows that evil, which is contrary to good, just as vice is to virtue, darkness is to light, and sickness is to health, does not exist substantially.

818
02:13:14,186 --> 02:13:24,225
Because, as has been said above, it does not have the substance of existing and subsisting by itself, like heaven, earth, water, air, fire, and other corporeal or spiritual creatures.

819
02:13:24,225 --> 02:13:33,387
Rather, the desertion of the highest good, to which a rational creature, whether angelic or human, must adhere to be blessed, has received this name to be called evil.

820
02:13:33,387 --> 02:13:42,932
Therefore, by deserting the highest good, rational creatures-whether angels or humans-sin and fall away from that good, are deprived of good, and this is their greatest evil.

821
02:13:43,536 --> 02:13:49,625
Whether we say that evil is the abandonment of good, a deficiency of good, or the absence of good, we are correct.

822
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:56,302
Just as a vice is the abandonment of virtue, darkness is the absence of light, and weakness is simply a deficiency of health.

823
02:13:56,302 --> 02:13:58,599
Similarly, sin has no substance of its own.

824
02:13:58,599 --> 02:14:02,445
Instead, the abandonment and deficiency of justice are what we call sin.

825
02:14:02,445 --> 02:14:04,795
Likewise, death has no substance of its own.

826
02:14:04,795 --> 02:14:06,397
It is merely the loss of life.

827
02:14:06,397 --> 02:14:11,792
In the same way, punishment has no substance, but pain and suffering from pain are called punishment.

828
02:14:11,792 --> 02:14:20,179
This is just the disturbance or loss of tranquility and natural peace, as punishment disrupts the tranquility and peace of nature through pain and suffering.

829
02:14:20,179 --> 02:14:30,702
All of these things-evil, sin, punishment, death, and misery, which is simply the loss of happiness-though they have no substance of their own, must necessarily occur within or from some substance.

830
02:14:30,702 --> 02:14:37,752
The abandonment of good, called evil, and the abandonment of justice, called sin, clearly happen in either an angelic or human mind.

831
02:14:37,752 --> 02:14:47,901
Similarly, the loss of life, called death, and the loss of tranquility or natural peace, called punishment, and the loss of happiness, called misery, are found in both the soul and the body.

832
02:14:47,901 --> 02:14:53,670
The soul dies by abandoning its life, which is God, and the body dies by losing its life, which is the soul.

833
02:14:53,670 --> 02:15:00,775
These two deaths-the death of the soul and the death of the body-are nothing but the loss of either happiness or tranquility in both.

834
02:15:01,416 --> 02:15:14,659
But the punishment felt in torment and pain is clearly experienced either in the soul or in the body; and when it happens in the body, it is mostly inflicted by another body: like when someone is whipped, wounded with swords, or tortured.

835
02:15:14,659 --> 02:15:21,003
This will also happen in eternal punishments, where the bodies of the damned will be tormented by fire and sulfur.

836
02:15:21,003 --> 02:15:27,347
However, all these pains and torments inflicted on the body by other bodies also affect the soul through the body.

837
02:15:27,347 --> 02:15:39,144
For the soul can feel pain and be tormented without the body; just like the soul of the rich man in hell, who said, "for I am tormented in this flame" (Luke 16:24); but the body cannot feel pain without the soul.

838
02:15:39,144 --> 02:15:50,329
Therefore, the Almighty God, about whom it is written: "For before they were created, all things were known to the Lord God: so also after they were completed, He looks upon all things" (Sirach 23:29).

839
02:15:50,329 --> 02:15:55,671
And again: "He looks from eternity to eternity, and nothing is new in His sight" (Sirach 39:21).

840
02:15:55,671 --> 02:16:06,300
And again, when Scripture speaks about humans, it says: "And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God: every thought is known to Him, and no word is hidden from Him" (Sirach 17:26).

841
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:21,714
To this, I say, almighty and ineffable Creator, who, before they were created, knew all things in His eternal knowledge, who, even after He completed all things, sees them not differently, but just as He saw them to be done, sees everything not outside Himself, but in Himself.

842
02:16:22,104 --> 02:16:28,430
And so, in His sight, nothing is new, not even when it was first created, because it has always been eternal in His knowledge.

843
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:34,204
All human deeds are as clear as day to Him; no human thought escapes Him, and no word of theirs is hidden from Him.

844
02:16:34,204 --> 02:16:46,856
This wondrous Creator and governor, who always knew in His eternal foreknowledge the nature, form, and order of all things that were to be, likewise eternally foresaw their state, whether they would progress towards betterment or decline towards worse.

845
02:16:46,856 --> 02:16:57,801
He, the most just ordainer of His work, both foresaw and predestined the rewards for those who would advance towards Him and the punishments for those who would stray from Him, and foretold that He would fulfill these.

846
02:16:57,801 --> 02:17:14,169
So, whether it is evil and sin, which are a departure from good; or death and punishment, which are justly due to that departure, they have always been in the foreknowledge of the Creator, who alone truly knows the measure of advancement and decline in His creatures, and alone is the just judge of their progress and decline.

847
02:17:14,169 --> 02:17:21,148
Thus, death and sin and all punishment and misery that follow from sin, because they have no substance of their own existence, are nothing.

848
02:17:21,148 --> 02:17:29,633
And because they harm the rational creature, whose defect and corruption are signified by these names, they are truly felt in its substance, whether bodily or spiritual.

849
02:17:29,633 --> 02:17:33,298
And what has no substance by existing is utterly harmful by causing harm.

850
02:17:33,298 --> 02:17:41,382
Let such blasphemy cease, and let the omnipotent God be acknowledged as the creator of all natures, the truest knower of their state, and the most just ordainer.

851
02:17:41,783 --> 02:17:46,967
Chapter Eleven
In the eleventh chapter, the following occurs and says.

852
02:17:46,967 --> 02:17:47,069
1.

853
02:17:47,069 --> 02:17:51,644
There is no predestination by God except for those who are prepared for eternal happiness.

854
02:17:51,644 --> 02:17:51,745
2.

855
02:17:51,745 --> 02:17:58,963
It is incorrect to say that God foresees and predestines everything: He foresaw what He would do and what He would not, as if He did not know.

856
02:17:58,963 --> 02:18:01,707
Similarly, He predestined those He prepared for grace.

857
02:18:01,707 --> 02:18:09,738
Conversely, He did not predestine the wicked for destruction or eternal punishment: if they are predestined, they will inevitably perish and suffer penalties.

858
02:18:09,738 --> 02:18:14,313
If this is true, how can the world be justly judged if predestination forces it to perish?

859
02:18:14,313 --> 02:18:14,414
3.

860
02:18:14,414 --> 02:18:22,953
The Holy Scriptures often place foreknowledge and predestination together, or mention only absolute predestination, for those whom God has chosen for eternal happiness.

861
02:18:22,953 --> 02:18:23,055
4.

862
02:18:23,055 --> 02:18:29,866
The Apostle referred to foreknowledge and predestination only in the saints, while Augustine sometimes applied them to the reprobates.

863
02:18:29,866 --> 02:18:35,660
Primarily, he says that there is no predestination by God except for those who are prepared for eternal happiness.

864
02:18:35,660 --> 02:18:46,893
Whether he said this from his own understanding or heard it from others, we know that this is a modern error among many, who do not believe that God's predestination is found in the Scriptures except in part of the elect.

865
02:18:46,893 --> 02:18:53,399
Nor did the blessed Apostle Paul place predestination in his Letters except only in the elect, as he also says in the following.

866
02:18:53,399 --> 02:19:04,988
We must humbly submit and obey the truth; not contentiously defend what we once believed, but diligently scrutinize the Holy Scriptures, not only the apostolic but also the prophetic, from which all apostolic authority descends.

867
02:19:04,988 --> 02:19:15,814
As the blessed Paul clearly declares at the beginning of the Epistle to the Romans, saying that he was set apart for the Gospel of God, which He had promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures.

868
02:19:15,814 --> 02:19:16,322
Romans 1:1

869
02:19:17,135 --> 02:19:27,734
At the end of the same letter, he confirms that the mystery of the gospel's preaching, including the deepest mystery of God's foreknowledge and predestination, has been revealed through the prophetic Scriptures.

870
02:19:27,734 --> 02:20:44,181
He says:
"Now to him who is able to strengthen you, according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages but has now been disclosed through the prophetic Scriptures, etc."
Romans 16:25-26.
Likewise, in the Acts of the Apostles, he speaks of himself, saying:
"To this day I stand testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass"
Acts 26:22.
Therefore, when the Apostle shows and confirms that he has been set apart for the gospel of God, which was promised beforehand through the prophets in the holy Scriptures, and that all the mysteries he preaches are revealed through the Scriptures, and that he says nothing beyond what is written in the law and the prophets, it becomes clear. The depth of divine foreknowledge and predestination must be diligently investigated not only in the Apostle's teachings but also in the writings of the prophets themselves.
What is found in both with clear truth should be faithfully followed without any debate or controversy. So, let's first hear what the Apostle, who testifies that he says nothing beyond what is written in the law and the prophets, says about this matter.
Let's not be absurd or contentious by denying something about predestination just because the word "predestination" is not explicitly mentioned. Whether the term "predestination" is used or the truth of predestination is evident, it should be accepted with equal faith.

871
02:20:44,231 --> 02:21:03,946
He first talks about the predestination of the elect in this way:
"For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified"
(Romans 8:29-30).

872
02:21:03,946 --> 02:21:11,660
After saying this, even if he had not mentioned the reprobates, we would still need to understand by contrast what should be thought about them.

873
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:18,625
Specifically, from the predestination of the elect to glory, we also recognize the predestination of the reprobates to punishment.

874
02:21:18,625 --> 02:21:30,196
Just as in the creed we seem to only confess eternal life, which is the reward of the saints, by contrast, we must similarly and undoubtedly believe and understand eternal death, which is the damnation of the wicked.

875
02:21:30,196 --> 02:21:34,268
The Apostle himself teaches us this rule of understanding in the Scriptures.

876
02:21:34,268 --> 02:21:41,339
When he spoke about the resurrection, he said:
"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body"
(First Corinthians 15:44).

877
02:21:41,339 --> 02:21:54,036
To ensure he wasn't speaking about a "spiritual body" without Scriptural authority, he immediately added what must be understood by contrast, saying:
"If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body"
(First Corinthians 15:44).

878
02:21:54,036 --> 02:22:04,964
Then, confirming both, he provides the testimony of Scripture and says:
"As it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit"
(First Corinthians 15:45).

879
02:22:04,964 --> 02:22:14,661
Similarly, when God said to the first man:
"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die"
(Genesis 2:17).

880
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:17,286
He certainly threatened death to the disobedient.

881
02:22:17,286 --> 02:22:22,964
But doesn't faith recognize what should be understood by contrast, that He prepared life for the obedient?

882
02:22:22,964 --> 02:22:33,250
Again, when God speaks to Abraham:
"Any male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant"
(Genesis 17:14).

883
02:22:33,839 --> 02:22:41,050
It is clear that this man, who was not circumcised on the eighth day, will be cut off from his people because he has broken God's covenant.

884
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:52,826
This doesn't refer to the time in his mother's womb or his very early infancy when he could neither do good nor evil, but rather to the time in paradise with Adam's transgression, in which, as the Apostle says, all have sinned.

885
02:22:52,826 --> 02:22:55,160
Those who descend from that condemned origin.

886
02:22:55,160 --> 02:23:08,596
Therefore, just as this man, not circumcised on the eighth day, is clearly declared to be perishing due to the guilt of the first transgression, so it is to be faithfully understood that he who is properly and lawfully circumcised is absolved from that guilt.

887
02:23:08,596 --> 02:23:21,928
We say this to make it clear that, even if the Apostle had remained silent about the fate of the reprobate in his discussion of predestination, our faith should nonetheless notice and understand what should be thought about them by the opposite implication.

888
02:23:21,928 --> 02:23:23,744
However, he does not remain silent.

889
02:23:23,744 --> 02:23:41,589
Right after presenting a similarity of both the elect and the reprobate, he adds this about the twins Isaac and Rebecca:
"Though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad (so that God's purpose of election might continue), not because of works but because of his call, it was said to her, 'The older will serve the younger.

890
02:23:41,589 --> 02:23:44,339
' As it is written, 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.

891
02:23:44,339 --> 02:23:46,154
'" (Romans 9:11-13; Malachi 1:1-2).

892
02:23:46,154 --> 02:23:56,633
Therefore, it is clear in this example, and in Jacob, who was loved and chosen without any merits and yet was similarly subject to original sin, that the predestination of the elect to life is declared.

893
02:23:56,633 --> 02:24:03,222
In Esau, who was hated solely due to the guilt of original sin, the predestination of the reprobate to destruction is declared.

894
02:24:03,222 --> 02:24:11,989
This is further supported by what is stated shortly after about both sides:
"So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills." (Romans 9:18).

895
02:24:12,455 --> 02:24:19,223
And then he adds: Doesn't the potter have the power to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?

896
02:24:19,223 --> 02:24:21,157
Romans chapter nine, verse twenty-one.

897
02:24:21,157 --> 02:24:37,085
Regarding these vessels of honor and dishonor, he immediately adds: What if God, wanting to show His wrath and make His power known, endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, and to make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory?

898
02:24:37,085 --> 02:24:39,884
Romans chapter nine, verses twenty-two to twenty-three.

899
02:24:39,884 --> 02:24:52,809
From all this, it is clear that the Apostle is speaking not only about the predestination of the elect, which he mentioned first, but in the broader context of his argument, he is addressing the predestination of both groups, whether to life or to death.

900
02:24:52,809 --> 02:25:00,544
He has illustrated this with examples and prophetic testimonies, presenting Jacob as the example of the elect, and Esau as the example of the reprobate.

901
02:25:00,544 --> 02:25:05,174
In these two groups, certainly, God shows mercy to whom He wills and hardens whom He wills.

902
02:25:05,174 --> 02:25:08,991
But He shows mercy by mercifully helping, and hardens justly by abandoning.

903
02:25:08,991 --> 02:25:18,303
Just like a potter from the same lump of clay, all of which was condemned, He makes one vessel for honor by mercifully delivering it, and another for dishonor by justly condemning it.

904
02:25:18,303 --> 02:25:22,476
So there are two orders: some being vessels of wrath, and others vessels of mercy.

905
02:25:22,476 --> 02:25:26,089
The former are prepared for destruction, the latter prepared for glory.

906
02:25:26,089 --> 02:25:30,567
But those prepared for destruction are so by their own merit and by God's just judgment.

907
02:25:30,567 --> 02:25:35,605
Those prepared for glory are so by no merit of their own, but by the benefit of divine grace alone.

908
02:25:36,215 --> 02:26:31,492
Since the Apostle speaks so clearly: "And vessels of wrath made for destruction, and vessels of mercy prepared for glory, and from the same lump one vessel for honor, another for dishonor," who does not understand that in these words, the divine predestination of both parties is most clearly shown? The elect are predestined to life not by any merit of their own, but solely by God's goodness, while the reprobate are predestined to destruction not by any prejudice of God, but solely by their own merit, whether original or actual.
Divine predestination does not impose the necessity of perishing on them, just as it does not impose the necessity of sinning. It only imposes the necessity of suffering just punishments. So, those who remain in sins by their own will are tormented by necessity in punishments.
If we carefully and faithfully consider the Apostle's discussion from this passage to the end, where he says: "For God has imprisoned all in disobedience, so that he may have mercy on all" (Romans 11:32), we see that it is about the predestination of both parties.

909
02:26:31,492 --> 02:26:41,355
This applies whether it is within the one people of the Jews, in those who were blinded, and in those who deserved to be saved according to the election of grace, or in both Jews and Gentiles.

910
02:26:41,355 --> 02:26:53,068
While some were broken off like natural branches, and others were grafted into a good olive tree like a wild olive tree (Romans 11:17), without a doubt, he discusses this with his words and especially with prophetic testimonies.

911
02:26:53,068 --> 02:27:06,013
In these prophetic testimonies, which the blessed Apostle proposed with such authority, he intended to teach us about the depth and obscurity of this matter-that is, divine predestination for either side-based on their firmness and evident attestation.

912
02:27:06,167 --> 02:27:37,114
We must particularly consider with full dedication that, even though the word "predestination" isn't directly mentioned in these texts, the concepts themselves clearly relate to both types of predestination. They are evident and well-explained, which is why the Apostle confidently used them to confirm and teach this significant matter. He conveyed them to the Church to be understood and upheld, guiding us with his authority and example.
This way, we avoid contentious or unnecessary debates about the word "predestination" in the sayings of the holy prophets among ourselves, and certainly do not quarrel (God forbid).

913
02:27:37,114 --> 02:27:44,677
Instead, with peaceful and pious understanding, wherever the matter is clearly declared, we must undoubtedly recognize and affirm divine predestination.

914
02:27:44,677 --> 02:28:19,604
The first prophetic testimony he referenced is from Genesis, where he says: "For this is the word of promise: At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son" Romans 9:9. Although it may not seem to mention predestination directly, it clearly speaks of a promise. This promise can only be rightly understood if it is faithfully taken as the predestination of Abraham's chosen descendants, meaning those who are considered children of God, distinguished from the children of the flesh by divine grace.
As the Apostle himself explains in the same passage, saying: "It is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as offspring" Romans 9:8.

915
02:28:19,703 --> 02:28:28,065
In the second place, he referenced a passage from Genesis about the twins, Isaac and Rebekah, where it was said, "The older will serve the younger" (Genesis 25:23).

916
02:28:28,065 --> 02:28:38,619
Although predestination may not seem explicitly mentioned there, the matter is so deeply demonstrated that the Apostle urges us to pay careful attention to the entire oracle given to Rebekah about the twins.

917
02:28:38,619 --> 02:28:45,196
We must consider that they were neither condemned from their mother's womb nor had they done anything good or bad in their lives.

918
02:28:45,196 --> 02:28:50,091
They were conceived from the same union, yet Almighty God made a great distinction between them.

919
02:28:50,091 --> 02:28:57,025
Without any preceding merits of good or evil, by His goodness and judgment alone, He preferred one and subjected the other to servitude.

920
02:28:57,025 --> 02:29:08,598
And lest we think this is a minor issue, as if it were only about temporal circumstances where one descendant would dominate over the other, the Apostle elevates our understanding by adding a testimony from the prophet Malachi.

921
02:29:08,598 --> 02:29:16,654
Here, God speaks about the same twins, not just temporally but eternally distinguished and separated by a great distance in both temporal and eternal matters.

922
02:29:16,654 --> 02:29:20,121
God says, "I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated" (Malachi 1:2).

923
02:29:20,121 --> 02:29:24,709
This prophetic testimony is rightly understood only when joined with the one from Genesis.

924
02:29:24,709 --> 02:29:41,229
Just as it was said, "The older will serve the younger," so also, "I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated," is understood to have preceded before they were born and before they had done anything good or bad. It must be accepted that in the just divine judgment, both God's love for Jacob and His hatred for Esau preceded.

925
02:29:41,687 --> 02:30:01,065
And with these two things-God's love towards one and hatred towards the other, and their birth, and all the merit of their lives having been predetermined according to the true and apostolic understanding-since neither could be blamed for any bad things they had not yet done, nor credited for any good things they had not yet performed, it is understood that these actions are justly done.

926
02:30:01,065 --> 02:30:12,443
The almighty God, who had eternally determined in his judgment both the election of one and the rejection of the other, had predefined the original guilt in them coming from Adam's transgression, to which both were equally bound.

927
02:30:12,443 --> 02:30:18,554
Foreseeing the future, he would mercifully love one and liberate him, and justly hate and reject the other and condemn him.

928
02:30:18,554 --> 02:30:23,423
From this, we may faithfully understand the deeper and more hidden arrangement of divine judgment.

929
02:30:23,423 --> 02:30:36,888
We may perceive more profoundly, with the enlightening apostolic understanding, the general condemnation of the entire human race in Adam: from which the almighty God liberates those he wishes by his grace alone and condemns those he does not wish by his eternal justice.

930
02:30:36,888 --> 02:30:51,445
Although in this prophetic testimony, where God says, "I have loved Jacob, but Esau I have hated," (Malachi 1:2-3), the word predestination does not appear, the truth of the matter is so evident in the election or rejection of both parties that nothing stronger or more explicit could be said.

931
02:30:51,445 --> 02:30:59,097
From the form of these twins, almighty God is shown by his testimony to have loved some with his eternal mercy and hated others with his eternal judgment.

932
02:30:59,097 --> 02:31:08,885
This prophetic testimony and apostolic understanding show that both the love and the hatred of God towards the two twins, still in their mother's womb, are understood from God's mercy and judgment.

933
02:31:08,885 --> 02:31:21,207
The words of the prophet Isaiah wonderfully resonate and agree with this, where the almighty God is shown as the helper of the chosen people from the womb, and conversely, the condemner of the reprobate people as if from the womb of a transgressor.

934
02:31:21,207 --> 02:31:28,808
The same prophet says first to the chosen people: "This is what the Lord says, the one who made and formed you, your helper from the womb" (Isaiah 44:2).

935
02:31:29,255 --> 02:31:35,778
Then, after addressing the people, adding in the voice of God:
"And I called you a transgressor from the womb" (Isaiah 68:8).

936
02:31:35,778 --> 02:31:44,597
The Apostle clearly explains that what was shown in the form of the twins must be understood as referring to the two types of people, namely the chosen and the rejected.

937
02:31:44,597 --> 02:31:59,259
While some are accused by divine judgment as transgressors from the womb, God similarly shows Himself as a helper from the womb to others, so that from the same originally condemned mass in the maternal womb, some vessels become for honor, and others for dishonor (Romans 9:21,15).

938
02:31:59,259 --> 02:32:09,539
Similarly, in the third prophetic testimony, which is stated as:
"For He says to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion" (Exodus 33:19).

939
02:32:09,539 --> 02:32:11,939
The word of predestination is clearly implied.

940
02:32:11,939 --> 02:32:14,861
The matter is so clear that it cannot be doubted at all.

941
02:32:14,861 --> 02:32:34,168
Since Almighty God, to all equally condemned from that first transgression, not for any preceding good merits, but by His grace alone, shows mercy to whom He shows mercy, and becomes compassionate to whom He grants compassion; it is evident that to the others, to whom He chooses not to grant this grace, He justly and eternally judges them with hatred and condemnation.

942
02:32:34,168 --> 02:32:48,570
After this, he added the fourth prophetic testimony, just as the third from Exodus, saying:
"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth" (Romans 9:17).

943
02:32:48,935 --> 02:34:19,720
Although the term "predestination" isn't explicitly mentioned here, the concept of the wicked being destined for eternal destruction because of their own wickedness is made so clear that anyone who hears and understands it faithfully cannot doubt it. The impious, hard, and unyielding king of the Egyptians, by divine judgment, whether due to his damned origin or the power of his royal honor, was raised up solely for this purpose: that he, being deserving of eternal destruction by his own merit, with God adding iniquity upon iniquity, would increase his contempt for the Lord.
By such great and various plagues, through God's admirable power, he deserved to be scourged and ultimately, along with all his similarly impious people, to be destroyed by eternal submersion and perdition. They would justly receive what they deserved, and God's omnipotent power, whether in their scourging or their destruction, would become more magnificently known to all. From the punishment of one, many would advance to the knowledge of God and their own salvation.
As blessed Ambrose clearly discusses this matter: Thus says blessed Ambrose. The apostle, after presenting two testimonies-one pertaining to the mercy granted to the elect, the other to the judgment inflicted on the reprobate-and as if concluding both, teaching that both occur by the merciful and just will of God, adds: Therefore, He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills. (Romans 9:18)
Then, against the audacity and presumption of men who, not recognizing their own fragility nor considering their own merits, dare to criticize divine judgments they do not understand, he presents a fifth testimony from the prophet Isaiah, saying: O man, who are you to answer back to God?

944
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:23,406
Does the molded object say to its maker: Why did you make me like this?

945
02:34:23,406 --> 02:34:24,496
(Isaiah 45; Romans 9)

946
02:34:24,599 --> 02:35:05,381
Although the word "predestination" is not mentioned, the concept is so clearly and perfectly defended that it compels the faithful listener to truly understand that the omnipotent Creator is a true potter. All humans, made from the clay of the earth by Him, are His creation. Therefore, for the most just reason, the creation cannot judge its potter; rather, the potter judges his creation. He alone knows with His eternal counsel how to kindly shape each vessel of His great creation, and to ordain and arrange them for the uses that please Him, which are indeed just and proper.
To make this even clearer, he adds a sixth testimony from the prophet Jeremiah, saying: "Does not the potter have the power to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?" (Romans 9:21).

947
02:35:05,381 --> 02:35:17,468
In the book of Jeremiah, we read that the Lord said to him, "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there you will hear my words." (Jeremiah 18:2 ff.) When the prophet entered, the potter was working a piece of clay with his hands.

948
02:35:17,468 --> 02:35:24,070
Suddenly, the work he was making was spoiled, and immediately he turned and made it into another vessel, as it seemed good to him.

949
02:35:24,070 --> 02:35:37,071
Then the prophet was commanded to go and proclaim to the people from the person of God: "Can I not do to you as this potter does, O house of Israel?" says the Lord: "Behold, like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand," etc. (Jeremiah 18:6).

950
02:35:37,223 --> 02:35:42,917
With this prophetic reading, God clearly shows that He is the potter, and all of humanity is like clay in His hands.

951
02:35:42,917 --> 02:35:45,518
He can shape different vessels from it as He pleases.

952
02:35:45,518 --> 02:35:50,868
From one single lump, all equally condemned in Adam, He makes vessels distinct and different by His judgment.

953
02:35:50,868 --> 02:35:53,273
Some are made for honor, and others for dishonor.

954
02:35:53,273 --> 02:36:04,905
Even a vessel destined for destruction, if through the potter's repentance, is broken in His hands and is no longer fit for destruction, it is reshaped through His wisdom and goodness into a vessel for honor, pleasing the Creator's eyes.

955
02:36:04,905 --> 02:36:15,261
In all these words, although predestination is not explicitly stated, the power and truth of predestination are shown on both sides: the elect and the reprobate, the vessels of honor and the vessels of dishonor.

956
02:36:15,261 --> 02:36:20,219
It is revealed with such clarity and distinction that nothing could be found more certain or clearer.

957
02:36:20,219 --> 02:36:31,556
We have presented all these things with careful and diligent consideration to the readers, so that according to this form of apostolic understanding in all prophetic Scriptures, we do not struggle much with the word predestination.

958
02:36:31,556 --> 02:36:37,790
The truth of divine predestination matters is so clearly and abundantly presented that human frailty can scarcely grasp it all.

959
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:50,158
We have included some examples here, especially those that are clearer and more evident, so that the peaceful and faithful listeners may be more easily instructed, and the contentious, if they do not refuse to accept the truth, may be corrected sooner.

960
02:36:50,158 --> 02:36:58,453
We do not discuss the predestination of the elect now, since understanding and faithfully believing it is clearly presented by the Apostle through prophetic testimonies.

961
02:36:58,943 --> 02:37:06,685
None of us should doubt, with the Lord's guidance, the just judgment of predestination by which He has preordained and destined the wicked for destruction.

962
02:37:06,685 --> 02:37:08,683
This is a topic that many hesitate over.

963
02:37:08,683 --> 02:37:10,930
We will share a few clear examples from many.

964
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:20,969
In the book of Genesis, we read that Almighty God foretold the destruction of the entire human race, except for those saved by His mercy in the ark, because of their excessive iniquities and impieties.

965
02:37:20,969 --> 02:37:24,665
They would perish in the present and face eternal damnation in the future.

966
02:37:24,665 --> 02:38:28,094
He spoke to the holy patriarch Noah, saying:
"The end of all flesh has come before me. The earth is filled with iniquity because of them, and I will destroy them with the earth"
Genesis 6:13.
Regarding this general destruction, earlier in the same Scripture, it says:
"And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man forever, because he is flesh. And his days shall be one hundred and twenty years"
Genesis 6:3.
And a little later:
"But God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth"
Genesis 6:5-6.
Where it is also added:
"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and creeping thing, and the birds of the heavens. For it repents me that I have made them"
Genesis 6:7.
What could be clearer than such a prediction and predestination of the destruction of all the wicked, with whom the world was then filled? This is what God wanted to announce long before to the holy and chosen patriarch. He decided and predetermined this in His eternal counsel, showing that He had established and predetermined these things not through an angel or any prophet of that time, but by Himself.

967
02:38:28,343 --> 02:38:37,387
And yet, the most kind judge and creator did not abandon even those whom he had justly predestined to such dreadful destruction and death because of their iniquities and impieties.

968
02:38:37,387 --> 02:38:40,200
He still showed them the goodness and pity of his mercy.

969
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:52,107
He granted them time and space to repent, giving them 120 years to either satisfy God by repenting worthily or, if they accumulated wrath for themselves due to their hard and unrepentant hearts, to perish inexcusably on the day of wrath.

970
02:38:52,107 --> 02:38:58,589
In this way, he predestined them to destruction because of their wickedness, but he did not compel them to sin by predestination.

971
02:38:58,589 --> 02:39:00,950
He waited for them to repent for so many years.

972
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:40,188
The book of Ecclesiasticus speaks lamentably about the unfortunate stubbornness and terrible damnation of these people, mentioning their destruction, saying:
"The ancient giants did not plead for their sins, who were destroyed, trusting in their own strength: and he did not spare their journey and cursed them because of their pride. He did not have mercy on them, destroying the whole nation that exalted itself in its sins. And like the 600,000 foot soldiers who gathered in the hardness of their hearts: and if one had been stiff-necked, it would be a wonder if he had been spared. For mercy and wrath are with him. He is powerful in supplication and pours out wrath. According to his mercy, so does his correction judge a man according to his works."
(Ecclesiasticus 16:8-13).

973
02:39:40,188 --> 02:40:04,354
Such is the prediction and predestination of God speaking to Abraham about the future oppression, affliction, and deliverance of his descendants, and conversely, the damnation and destruction of their oppressors, when he said to him:
"Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will be enslaved and afflicted for 400 years. But I will judge the nation that they serve, and afterward, they shall come out with great possessions."

974
02:40:04,655 --> 02:40:08,077
But you will go to your ancestors in peace, buried at a good old age.

975
02:40:08,077 --> 02:40:14,871
However, in the fourth generation, they will return here, for the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet complete up to the present time.

976
02:40:14,871 --> 02:40:15,714
Genesis 15:13-16.

977
02:40:15,714 --> 02:40:18,045
What could be clearer than this predestination?

978
02:40:18,045 --> 02:40:25,980
It predicts that the descendants of Abraham will live as strangers in a foreign land for many years and that they will be subjected to servitude and affliction.

979
02:40:25,980 --> 02:40:34,410
From this very affliction, they will be gloriously liberated, and at the appointed time-in the fourth generation-they will return to the land promised to their ancestors.

980
02:40:34,410 --> 02:40:38,873
The blessed patriarch himself will be united with his ancestors in peace and good old age.

981
02:40:38,873 --> 02:40:46,064
Conversely, the nation and the king of the Egyptians, who will oppress them, are destined for eternal destruction by the eternal judgment of God.

982
02:40:46,064 --> 02:40:53,155
A similar, or even more evident, prophecy and predestination is about the destruction of the Amorites, or rather the seven most wicked nations.

983
02:40:53,155 --> 02:41:38,481
Due to their impiety, the almighty God determined long beforehand that He would destroy and wipe them out, as He clearly declared to Abraham when He said, "For the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet complete up to the present time."
He had promised the same holy patriarch that, once they were destroyed, He would hand over their kingdoms and lands to his descendants as a possession. Yet this just and merciful judge did not wish to do this out of favoritism. According to His goodness, patience, and long-suffering, He waited and delayed for many ages, giving them a space for repentance. If those nations persisted in their impieties and fulfilled the measure of their sins, they would be justly punished in the fullness of their iniquities. In their place, the descendants of Abraham, who were to serve God, would succeed-not because of favoritism or their own righteousness, but solely by divine goodness.

984
02:41:38,927 --> 02:42:06,185
When the time came for the destruction of these nations due to their iniquities, and for the introduction of the seed of Abraham into their lands through God's mercy, God spoke about their sins and the imminent, just destruction to the seed of Abraham, that is, to the people of Israel, saying:
"Do not defile yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations that I am driving out before you have been defiled, and with which the land has become polluted. I will punish its sins so that it will vomit out its inhabitants" (Leviticus 18:24-25).

985
02:42:06,185 --> 02:42:20,475
Shortly after, He said:
"For all these abominations have the inhabitants of the land done, who were before you, and have polluted it. Therefore, be careful that the land does not vomit you out as it vomited out the nation that was before you when you do the same things" (Leviticus 18:27-28).

986
02:42:20,475 --> 02:42:35,548
Concerning the ultimate destruction of these nations, both in the present and in the future, Scripture generally says:
"For it was the Lord's decision to harden their hearts so that they would fight against Israel, fall, and not deserve any mercy, but perish, as the Lord had commanded Moses" (Joshua 11:20).

987
02:42:35,548 --> 02:42:58,352
What could be clearer about the predestination of the wicked to eternal destruction than this: Almighty God, who had decreed this in His secret judgment, had foretold these things to Abraham long before, had frequently threatened them in the intervening times, and finally, Scripture confirms that it was His decision, that is, His counsel and judgment, that they should not deserve any mercy but should utterly and eternally perish in their wickedness and contempt.

988
02:42:58,352 --> 02:43:12,740
Regarding these divine judgments, the Book of Wisdom also speaks to God, saying:
"For who will say to you, 'What have you done?' or who will stand against your judgment? Or who will come before you as an avenger of wicked people? Or who will blame you if the nations perish that you have made?"

989
02:43:12,935 --> 02:43:15,962
For there is no other God but you, who cares for everyone.

990
02:43:15,962 --> 02:43:21,285
You judge justly, and neither king nor tyrant will question those you have destroyed in your presence.

991
02:43:21,285 --> 02:43:23,894
Since you are just, you arrange everything justly.

992
02:43:23,894 --> 02:43:25,303
Wisdom of Solomon 12:12-15.

993
02:43:25,303 --> 02:43:39,444
Similarly, when the same Scripture distinguishes between divine goodness towards His people and righteous severity towards their enemies, specifically the Egyptians, destined for eternal ruin, it says:
Showing how you exalted your own people and killed their adversaries.

994
02:43:39,444 --> 02:43:45,759
When they were tested, they received discipline with mercy and learned how the wicked, judged in anger, suffered torment.

995
02:43:45,759 --> 02:43:52,229
You tested these people like a father admonishing them; but you condemned those others like a stern king interrogating them.

996
02:43:52,229 --> 02:43:53,586
Wisdom of Solomon 11:9-11.

997
02:43:53,586 --> 02:44:01,361
And again:
It was fitting that destruction without excuse should come upon those exercising tyranny, but to show how their enemies were exterminated.

998
02:44:01,361 --> 02:44:02,562
Wisdom of Solomon 16:4.

999
02:44:02,562 --> 02:44:11,224
And again:
Even the righteous were touched by the trial of death, and there was a disturbance in the wilderness among the multitude, but your anger did not last long.

1000
02:44:11,224 --> 02:44:16,390
A brief trial of wrath was sufficient; but upon the wicked, wrath came without mercy until the end.

1001
02:44:16,390 --> 02:44:18,321
Wisdom of Solomon 18:20, 25 and 19:1.

1002
02:44:18,321 --> 02:44:28,705
And shortly after, regarding the eternal destruction of the Egyptians in the Red Sea, it says:
While still mourning and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another thought of ignorance.

1003
02:44:28,705 --> 02:44:31,993
Those whom they had begged to leave, they pursued as fugitives.

1004
02:44:31,993 --> 02:44:40,238
A fitting necessity led them to this end, and they lost the memory of what had happened, so that the punishment might complete the torments that were lacking.

1005
02:44:40,238 --> 02:44:43,786
Your people crossed over miraculously, while they found a new death.

1006
02:44:43,786 --> 02:44:45,091
Wisdom of Solomon 19:3-5.

1007
02:44:45,091 --> 02:44:47,804
Similarly, in the book of the prophet Daniel,
Daniel

1008
02:44:48,743 --> 02:44:59,859
The four great cardinal kingdoms of the future, their order, their times, and their eternal nature and destruction, as determined by divine predestination, are revealed through God's admirable foreknowledge and arrangement.

1009
02:44:59,859 --> 02:45:06,488
These kingdoms are depicted either as four metals in the statue seen by the king in his dreams or as four beasts rising from the sea.

1010
02:45:06,488 --> 02:45:14,463
They are also foretold through prophecies of kings and wars up to the end times, including the downfall of the Antichrist and the coming of Christ for judgment.

1011
02:45:14,463 --> 02:45:22,886
These kingdoms, along with the kingdom of the Antichrist, have brought great and horrendous evils to the world and have greatly oppressed and attacked the Church of God.

1012
02:45:22,886 --> 02:45:24,381
Who can fully comprehend this?

1013
02:45:24,381 --> 02:45:32,905
Yet, all these events, whether past or future, are understood to have happened or will happen according to the eternal judgment of divine foreknowledge and predestination.

1014
02:45:32,905 --> 02:45:42,026
They have been wonderfully foretold in their order, marked by their times, and set to end at their appointed limits, as recognized and described long ago through prophetic revelation.

1015
02:45:42,026 --> 02:46:24,443
If we look for the term "predestination," which is the decree and pre-definition of divine judgment in prophetic words, we find a remarkable and memorable example in the prophet Isaiah. He speaks historically about the destruction of the Babylonian and Assyrian kingdoms, but mystically about the destruction of the entire city of the devil at the end of the world. He introduces Almighty God swearing-confirming His words with His unchanging truth-and says in Isaiah 14:24, 26, 27:
"The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying: Surely, as I have thought, so it shall be: and as I have purposed, so shall it come to pass." And a little later: "This is the plan determined for the whole earth: and this is the hand stretched out over all nations. For the Lord of hosts has decreed it: and who can annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?"

1016
02:46:24,791 --> 02:46:31,341
Clearly observe the predestination of the destruction of the reprobate-those nations opposing the people of God and His enemies.

1017
02:46:31,341 --> 02:46:40,397
This happens through the divine mind's discussion and counsel, its decree, and the extension of God's hand, signifying the fulfillment and perfection of all works under an oath.

1018
02:46:40,397 --> 02:46:43,468
This oath declares the immovable firmness of divine counsel.

1019
02:46:43,468 --> 02:46:50,631
In the vision of the great tree, which extended to the ends of the earth and was seen by the king in a dream, God ordered it to be cut down.

1020
02:46:50,631 --> 02:46:55,952
This tree represented the height of worldly power, often overthrown by divine judgment due to arrogance.

1021
02:46:55,952 --> 02:47:03,218
This vision shows that such events occur by the predestination, decree, and judgment of divine counsel, through the ministries of holy angels.

1022
02:47:03,218 --> 02:47:10,791
The king himself recounts this dream: I was looking in the vision of my head on my bed: and behold, a watcher, and a holy one descended from heaven.

1023
02:47:10,791 --> 02:47:16,880
He cried aloud and said: Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit, etc.

1024
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:17,750
(Daniel 4:10-11).

1025
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:28,546
And later: In the decree of the watchers, it is determined, and by the word of the holy ones, until the living know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will (Daniel 4:17).

1026
02:47:28,546 --> 02:47:35,505
These things were not done just for Nebuchadnezzar, but to instill fear and humility in all worldly powers who read or hear these words.

1027
02:47:35,505 --> 02:47:42,259
It serves to remind everyone that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, giving and taking away power according to His judgment.

1028
02:47:42,259 --> 02:47:50,599
Since this is orchestrated through angelic ministries, it is said that the decree of the watchers and the word of the holy ones will be fulfilled in these matters.

1029
02:47:50,599 --> 02:48:01,446
The prophet further clarifies that the watchers' sentence is the sentence of the Most High, saying: This is the interpretation of the sentence of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king (Daniel 4:24).

1030
02:48:02,111 --> 02:48:09,311
Therefore, the decree of divine judgment, by which events are determined and established by God, belongs to the Most High and the holy angels.

1031
02:48:09,311 --> 02:48:16,307
The Most High judges and commands, while the holy angels, who judge all lower things under His authority, obey and execute these commands.

1032
02:48:16,307 --> 02:48:20,921
They are granted authority so that their words in such matters carry the weight of command.

1033
02:48:20,921 --> 02:48:27,359
However, a petition is added, so that whatever is to be carried out in the world by them may be obtained through prayer to God.

1034
02:48:27,359 --> 02:48:32,277
This predestination and determination of divine judgment is briefly shown by the prophet Ezekiel.

1035
02:48:32,277 --> 02:48:49,312
In reference to the kingdom and priesthood of Judah, due to their impiety in the last times when Christ the Lord is coming, it is said to the condemned king: "But you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come in the time of iniquity appointed," thus says the Lord: "Remove the turban, take off the crown" (Ezekiel 21:25).

1036
02:48:49,312 --> 02:48:52,911
The crown represents the kingdom and the turban represents the priests.

1037
02:48:52,911 --> 02:48:58,387
Both were taken away from that people when Christ the Lord came, as their day of appointed iniquity arrived.

1038
02:48:58,387 --> 02:49:09,743
The Lord also speaks of the sharpened and polished sword for the slaughter and destruction of the wicked: "To be placed on the necks of the slain wicked, whose day has come in the time of appointed iniquity" (Ezekiel 21:29).

1039
02:49:09,743 --> 02:49:15,624
These predestinations are clearly shown by the Apostle in his letters and by the prophets in the ancient Scriptures.

1040
02:49:15,624 --> 02:49:21,049
Through these, we see that nothing is unjust or disorderly; everything is arranged with justice and reason.

1041
02:49:21,049 --> 02:49:28,958
Blessed Augustine, faithfully following this apostolic and prophetic authority, spoke truly of predestination in the just judgments and dispositions of God.

1042
02:49:28,958 --> 02:49:39,351
Contrary to what some may falsely claim, Augustine did not pretend, but spoke against the deceitful and false rules that attempt to destroy what is affirmed as true by one, using similarity and opposition.

1043
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:50,240
He wants everything stated simply and truthfully in the Holy Scriptures or in the teachings of the Fathers about predestination, particularly regarding the reprobate, to be understood in the opposite way.

1044
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:54,826
So, what was done should be seen as not done, and what was said should be seen as not said.

1045
02:49:54,826 --> 02:49:56,439
Who has ever heard such madness?

1046
02:49:56,439 --> 02:50:05,410
Shouldn't anyone who dares to think or write such blatant lies against the truth of the Scriptures and the purity of the Fathers' teachings be kept far away from everyone's ears?

1047
02:50:05,410 --> 02:50:12,516
After presenting so many deceitful arguments, he suddenly remembers the Holy Scriptures, the Apostle, and Augustine, almost as if in a dream.

1048
02:50:12,516 --> 02:50:22,444
However, his conclusion from the Holy Scriptures and the Apostle, that nothing about the predestination of the wicked to eternal punishment is mentioned, is clearly shown above to be a blatant lie.

1049
02:50:22,444 --> 02:51:22,113
He claims about God, according to his ridiculous and contemptible rule: "He foreknew what He would not do, instead of He didn't know."
Who has ever heard such a thing?
That where we read that God foreknew something, we understand that He didn't know.
Both are certainly false, that either "He foreknew" is understood as "He didn't know," or that what God would not do is said because He didn't know:
Who truly, with His eternal knowledge, as He foreknew whatever He was going to do, so also He foreknew whatever He was not going to do.
For example, He foreknew that He would raise Lazarus and did so; He foreknew that He would not raise Judas and did not do so.
But this man says: "He predestined the wicked to destruction or eternal punishment, instead of not predestined";
that is, where we read "He predestined," we understand with unheard-of madness "He did not predestine."
He also raises the question: "How will the world be justly judged, which is forced to perish by the necessity of predestination?"
Let none of us say such a thing.
Because it is the most obvious blasphemy to say that God, by the prejudice of His predestination, forces someone to sin and perish by sinning.

1050
02:51:22,415 --> 02:51:31,237
By the just judgment of His predestination, those whom He has decided to punish for persisting in sins, He calls back from sin and instills a healthy fear in those who listen.

1051
02:51:31,237 --> 02:51:34,917
This fear corrects them, and through correction, they avoid condemnation.

1052
02:51:34,967 --> 02:51:39,887
Chapter Twelve
In this chapter, he introduces definitions like these:

1053
02:51:39,887 --> 02:51:39,991
1.

1054
02:51:39,991 --> 02:51:44,458
All of God's foreknowledge is predestination, and all predestination is foreknowledge.

1055
02:51:44,458 --> 02:51:44,562
2.

1056
02:51:44,562 --> 02:51:49,236
All of God's predestination is entirely the preparation of grace, and all grace is a gift.

1057
02:51:49,236 --> 02:51:52,820
Therefore, all divine predestination is the preparation of His gifts.

1058
02:51:52,820 --> 02:51:52,924
3.

1059
02:51:52,924 --> 02:51:59,727
Punishment tortures the wicked justly, which is not a gift; otherwise, if it were a gift, it would not torture but surely liberate.

1060
02:51:59,727 --> 02:52:02,012
Therefore, punishment is not predestination.

1061
02:52:02,012 --> 02:52:04,557
If it were, it would not be punishment but grace.

1062
02:52:04,557 --> 02:52:07,414
However, it is punishment, so it is not predestination.

1063
02:52:07,414 --> 02:52:07,518
4.

1064
02:52:07,518 --> 02:52:12,348
Hence, predestination should always be understood in terms of the gifts of divine generosity.

1065
02:52:12,348 --> 02:52:19,879
Those predestined for punishment are always understood in opposition, like the elect for the non-elect: the children of God for the non-children.

1066
02:52:19,879 --> 02:52:33,849
Anyone who has diligently read and faithfully understood what we have previously said according to the rule of faith, with the Lord's help, can easily judge and refute these four very long and meaningless propositions, seemingly crafted with the artifice of syllogisms.

1067
02:52:33,849 --> 02:52:42,159
For who does not understand how blasphemous and impious it is to say, as he does here in the first statement, that all of God's foreknowledge is predestination?

1068
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:58,675
When faith clearly holds that the omnipotent God foresees all things, both good and evil: what He Himself will do and what He will not do; but predestines only the good, which He will do either by mercifully liberating and rewarding the elect or justly condemning the reprobate, because what is just is certainly good.

1069
02:52:58,675 --> 02:53:08,024
Therefore, if according to his definition, all of God's foreknowledge is predestination, then everything He foreknew, including evil, He predestined Himself to do, which is absurd!

1070
02:53:08,024 --> 02:53:14,879
Because He only foreknew evil, but in no way predestined it, as He was not going to do it Himself, unlike everything He predestined.

1071
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:17,684
Neither did He decide or ordain that it should happen.

1072
02:53:17,684 --> 02:53:23,397
Similarly, the premise of the second proposition begins with falsehood and therefore also ends with falsehood.

1073
02:53:24,383 --> 02:53:28,334
For it is said:
All predestination by God is entirely a preparation of grace.

1074
02:53:28,334 --> 02:53:40,801
This has been clearly shown with apostolic and prophetic testimonies, where we found and demonstrated that God's predestination must be understood in two ways: either for the merciful reward of the good or for the just damnation of the wicked.

1075
02:53:40,801 --> 02:53:49,727
Therefore, as the words of the blessed Augustine, which we cited earlier, clearly teach, God's predestination, when understood in a positive sense, is a preparation of grace.

1076
02:53:49,727 --> 02:53:54,806
In the third proposition, it is very false to assert that there is no predestination to punishment.

1077
02:53:54,806 --> 02:54:06,606
For if the punishment for the devil, his angels, and all the reprobates who are to be punished with them was not predestined, Truth would never say: "Go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).

1078
02:54:06,606 --> 02:54:14,763
And what he states at the end of this third proposition-that predestination must always be understood in terms of the gifts of divine generosity-is also false.

1079
02:54:14,763 --> 02:54:21,022
Predestination is truly understood not only in the gifts of divine generosity but also in the judgments of just damnation.

1080
02:54:21,022 --> 02:54:32,874
His fourth proposition, which is as follows: The predestined to punishment should always be understood in the opposite way, belongs to that insanity discussed earlier, where he wants us to understand predestined as non-predestined.

1081
02:54:32,874 --> 02:54:44,212
But what he added, by way of example: Just as elect means non-elect; children of God means non-children, will be better discussed in the following chapter, where he explains more broadly what he thinks about these things.

1082
02:54:44,212 --> 02:54:56,473
It must be remembered and recognized, however, that the blessed Augustine, as his words cited above demonstrate, sometimes said that in Scriptures the foreknowledge of God signifies predestination (On the Gift of Perseverance, chapter 18).

1083
02:54:56,473 --> 02:55:07,862
From these words, he, as if taking the opportunity for his argument, goes against this very true statement, which Augustine sometimes taught should be understood in this way, adding the word "all" and removing "sometimes."

1084
02:55:08,375 --> 02:55:13,748
And so, he gave a very incorrect definition, saying:
All foreknowledge of God is predestination.

1085
02:55:13,748 --> 02:55:32,944
Similarly, because the blessed Augustine, as we mentioned earlier, defined predestination as the preparation of grace by God
(On the Predestination of the Saints, chapter 10),
which applies only to the elect, he added the word "all," and made a very incorrect definition, saying:
All predestination by God is entirely the preparation of grace.

1086
02:55:32,999 --> 02:55:37,415
Chapter Thirteen
In the thirteenth chapter, it says this:

1087
02:55:37,415 --> 02:55:37,517
1.

1088
02:55:37,517 --> 02:55:47,397
To consider Judas as chosen instead of not chosen, and the children of God instead of not the children, is to take it in the opposite sense: just like the same friend who was never not an enemy.

1089
02:55:47,397 --> 02:55:47,499
2.

1090
02:55:47,499 --> 02:55:54,883
It is pointless to seek the children of God outside of His chosen ones: it is pointless to think that His chosen ones are not predestined by Him.

1091
02:55:54,883 --> 02:55:54,985
3.

1092
02:55:54,985 --> 02:56:06,087
Likewise, it is impious to think that those predestined by God are not among His chosen ones, or to consider the chosen ones of God as different from His children, nor to be predestined if they are not children of God.

1093
02:56:06,087 --> 02:56:06,188
4.

1094
02:56:06,188 --> 02:56:21,466
Those predestined for punishment, destruction, or suffering should be understood as nothing other than not predestined; but from the mass condemned by the merit of original and personal sin, they are not separated: therefore, they are allowed to live impiously and will be punished with eternal fire.

1095
02:56:21,466 --> 02:56:29,614
In these words, it is understood that Judas was counted among the chosen apostles by the Lord, where it says: "Did I not choose the twelve of you?" (John 6:71).

1096
02:56:29,614 --> 02:56:39,697
So the others are understood to be truly chosen, but he in a contrary sense, that is, ironically, is called so; it is better if it is taken this way so that Truth is recognized to have spoken truly.

1097
02:56:39,697 --> 02:56:49,119
So all twelve are understood to have been chosen by the Lord: but the others in one way, Judas in another, that is, the others eternally to the kingdom, this one temporally to ministry.

1098
02:56:49,119 --> 02:57:04,854
For he was chosen for a time among the others to the apostolic ministry, sent to the office of preaching: he also perhaps received the grace of miracles; hence blessed Peter in the Acts of the Apostles speaks of him this way: "For he was numbered among us and received his share in this ministry" (Acts 1:17).

1099
02:57:04,854 --> 02:57:23,340
And when they had set up two, and prayed that God would show which of them should be appointed to the place that he had lost by transgressing, they prayed saying: "You, God, who knows the hearts of all, show which of these two you have chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place" (Acts 1:24-25).

1100
02:57:23,951 --> 02:57:30,754
Thus, he was chosen by the Lord to be temporarily associated with the apostles and to share in their ministry and apostleship.

1101
02:57:30,754 --> 02:57:33,345
It is said that he fell from the apostolic rank.

1102
02:57:33,345 --> 02:57:43,278
However, the Lord, who always knew in his eternal foreknowledge the unwavering faith of the other apostles and his fall and future ruin, did not do this out of ignorance of the future.

1103
02:57:43,278 --> 02:57:52,294
As the blessed John the Evangelist testifies, "For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him" (John 6:64).

1104
02:57:52,294 --> 02:58:13,241
Therefore, the Lord himself, after saying what was previously mentioned, "Did I not choose you, the twelve?" (John 6:70), immediately added, as one truly knowing the future, "And one of you is a devil." The Evangelist, explaining who he was talking about, immediately added, "He was speaking of Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray him" (John 6:71).

1105
02:58:13,241 --> 02:58:19,989
He also knew the place of his damnation in eternal punishment, which was deservedly assigned and predestined for his impiety.

1106
02:58:19,989 --> 02:58:23,336
Thus, the apostles said, "To go to his own place" (Acts 1:25).

1107
02:58:23,336 --> 02:58:31,974
And the Lord himself said, "Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed; it would have been better for that man if he had not been born" (Matthew 26:24).

1108
02:58:32,351 --> 02:58:36,700
And yet, he wanted him to take on the ministry and position of apostleship for a time.

1109
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:42,769
This way, when he misused the Lord's great goodness, the Lord would, in contrast, use his great evil for our great good.

1110
02:58:42,769 --> 02:58:50,557
By teaching through such an example, he showed that in his Church, there would be bad people mixed in, just as this man was among the apostles for a time.

1111
02:58:50,557 --> 02:58:55,866
He shared with the Church not only the sacraments and divine ministries but also the place of governance.

1112
02:58:55,866 --> 02:59:02,845
He demonstrated patience to his followers, showing how he tolerated the bad, knowing this man well and enduring him with amazing patience.

1113
02:59:02,845 --> 02:59:09,369
This taught true believers that they were not defiled by such company and that their God-given ministries should not be rejected.

1114
02:59:09,369 --> 02:59:16,651
The blessed apostles were not defiled by his false companionship, nor was his ministry, as long as it was done according to God, disapproved of.

1115
02:59:16,651 --> 02:59:22,871
When his wretchedness reached the point of betrayal, the great evil of one man was turned into the good of the whole world.

1116
02:59:22,871 --> 02:59:26,866
Through this, the true Lamb who takes away the sin of the world was sacrificed.

1117
02:59:26,866 --> 02:59:31,619
The good Lord chose him for good, granting him good things and turning his evil into our good.

1118
02:59:31,619 --> 02:59:38,092
His transgressions and perdition were due to his own wickedness, but being chosen among the good was due to the Lord's goodness.

1119
02:59:38,092 --> 02:59:49,066
If he had remained in goodness, as the Apostle says:
"Consider therefore the goodness and severity of God: severity to those who have fallen, but goodness to you, provided you continue in his goodness" (Romans 11:22).

1120
02:59:49,066 --> 02:59:58,219
Regarding the temporary ministry of apostleship, about which the Lord said:
"Did I not choose you, the Twelve?" (John 6:71),
it can be well said that he was chosen among the others.

1121
02:59:58,219 --> 03:00:08,485
But concerning the eternal election to beatitude, only those were chosen of whom he said, when distinguishing between him and them:
"I do not speak of all of you; I know whom I have chosen" (John 13:18).

1122
03:00:08,485 --> 03:00:14,604
Therefore, it can be well and truly understood that it was said, with Judas included:
"Did I not choose you, the Twelve?"

1123
03:00:15,311 --> 03:00:19,068
And when that one was separated as a reprobate: I know whom I have chosen.

1124
03:00:19,068 --> 03:00:21,555
It's not necessary to interpret it any other way.

1125
03:00:21,555 --> 03:00:24,347
Both are clearly shown to be true by evident reasoning.

1126
03:00:24,347 --> 03:00:30,083
For it is also written about Saul when he was chosen for the kingdom, for which he was to be useful in many ways.

1127
03:00:30,083 --> 03:00:40,794
He indeed received this as chosen, as Scripture says:
There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Saul, chosen and good, and there was no one among the children of Israel better than him (First Samuel 9:2).

1128
03:00:40,794 --> 03:00:44,348
However, he was later very unhappily rejected, cast off, and perished.

1129
03:00:44,348 --> 03:00:49,272
Yet, for a time, he is said to have been chosen for a certain temporal usefulness of the kingdom.

1130
03:00:49,272 --> 03:00:55,059
He was preferred to the people of God by the mystical anointing and by the choice of lot through the holy prophet.

1131
03:00:55,059 --> 03:00:59,424
But where the evangelical Scripture specifically names Judas as a son, we do not read.

1132
03:00:59,424 --> 03:01:10,947
For when the Lord said of the apostles: The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them (Luke 5:34), there is no necessity that this should not also be rightly understood as said of the others, excluding Judas.

1133
03:01:10,947 --> 03:01:21,506
For it exclusively pertains to those, with him already lost, what the Lord adds, saying:
The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days (Luke 5:35).

1134
03:01:21,506 --> 03:01:33,892
But if anyone wishes to understand that Judas himself is among the sons in these words of the Lord, it can clearly be so because of some faith he had in the Lord and the fellowship of the sacraments, by which he was joined to the holy apostles.

1135
03:01:33,892 --> 03:01:37,141
Not contrary but rightly and consequently he could be called so.

1136
03:01:37,141 --> 03:01:43,283
Thus, even when the Lord said to the one who was about to betray Him and mark Him with a kiss:
Friend, why have you come?

1137
03:01:43,283 --> 03:01:45,466
(Matthew 26:50), it can be well understood.

1138
03:01:45,466 --> 03:01:55,974
Not what was happening at that moment, but what had been reproached to him before: that when he had once been, in a certain way, a disciple and friend, he suddenly turned into such a cruel and impious enemy.

1139
03:01:56,735 --> 03:02:03,946
But even if this was said ironically, as some have interpreted, it does not lend any validity to the rule of this new and foolish debater.

1140
03:02:03,946 --> 03:03:49,387
It's one thing to sarcastically state something true, like when we indignantly or reproachfully say to a bad man, "You are a good man," or to someone acting poorly, "You are doing well," or to an enemy, "Friend," and many similar things. It's quite another thing, according to this diabolical rule, to openly deny the truth with falsehood. For instance, when someone, justly condemned by divine judgment for their impiety, is truthfully said to be predestined for punishment, and this person, in new madness, falsely teaches that "predestined" means "not predestined."
With this most perverse and false understanding, neither Scripture, which must never be misinterpreted in matters of faith, nor any ecclesiastical teacher, nor any truthful person has ever spoken. But if no one is predestined by the just judgment of God to suffer punishment for sins, as some claim, what did the Apostles mean when they prayed to the Lord about Judas, saying, "Judas turned aside to go to his own place"? Acts 1:25. What did Solomon mean when he said, "The Lord has made everything for its purpose, even the wicked for the day of trouble"? Proverbs 16:4.
What is meant in the book of Job, where it is written, "The wicked are reserved for the day of doom; they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath"? Job 21:30. Why does Scripture say about the Egyptians in the Red Sea, who were destined to be eternally destroyed, "For a deserved necessity led them to this end"? Wisdom 19:4. This clearly shows that they were led to destruction by the necessity of divine judgment, and yet deservedly so for their impiety and contempt.
What also is meant by what is written elsewhere: "He who turns from righteousness to sin, God has prepared him for the sword"? Ecclesiasticus 26:27. And the angel said to Blessed John in the Revelation about the Antichrist, who is yet to be revealed and destroyed at the end of the world: "The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the abyss and go to destruction" Revelation 17:8.

1141
03:03:49,439 --> 03:05:14,312
If this is not predestined by God, how does the angel say,
"These words are the most faithful and true words of God"?
(Revelation 21:5)
If the same Antichrist, the man of sin, the son of perdition
(Second Thessalonians 2:3) ,
along with all his followers, is not predestined for the judgment of eternal damnation, how does the Apostle clearly say about him,
"Whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the spirit of his mouth, and will destroy with the brightness of his coming"?
(Second Thessalonians 2:8)
And about all who are to be deceived by him, and who will perish with him forever, he adds shortly after,
"Because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved, God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie, and all will be judged who did not believe the truth but consented to unrighteousness"
(Second Thessalonians 2:10-11)
How is it said in the prophet Ezekiel, regarding the sharpened and polished sword for the slaughter and destruction of the wicked,
"That it may be upon the necks of the wicked who are to be slain, whose day has come, in the time of iniquity that is predetermined"?
(Ezekiel 21:29)
Why does the same prophet also say about the Jews who will lose both kingdom and priesthood, and will perish in their infidelity under the persona of the wicked king,
"And you, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of iniquity that is predetermined, this is what the Lord says: Remove the turban, take off the crown"?
(Ezekiel 21:25-26)
The crown being the kingdom, and the turban being the priesthood, as we have already stated, is clear.

1142
03:05:14,312 --> 03:05:24,960
If anyone objects that these two prophetic examples do not indicate predestination but predetermination, let them understand that predestination is nothing else but the predetermination of a future event.

1143
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:39,471
This is clearly shown by the Apostle, saying,
"According to the predetermination of the ages, which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord"
(Ephesians 3:11)
For where we read "predetermination" in Latin, in Greek it has Prothesin, which is properly translated into Latin as "purpose."

1144
03:05:39,575 --> 03:05:51,109
Which message is also placed in the Letter to the Romans, where the same Apostle says:
"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose" (Romans 8:28).

1145
03:05:51,109 --> 03:06:06,265
But the purpose of God is nothing other than the predestination of God, as the same Apostle explains, for after saying "those who have been called according to His purpose," he immediately adds, "For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son" (Ephesians 3:29).

1146
03:06:06,265 --> 03:06:14,278
From all these things, we can most rightly understand that the purpose of God, the predestination of God, and the foreordination of God are one and the same.

1147
03:06:14,278 --> 03:06:27,852
This foreordination, that is, predestination, is most clearly placed in the Apostle's words in a good sense and in the Prophet's words, which we mentioned earlier, in a bad sense, as it designates those ordained to life here, but there those ordained to destruction.

1148
03:06:27,852 --> 03:07:13,883
Such are the vessels of wrath, as the same Apostle says (Romans 9:22), "prepared for destruction," or, as others have translated it, "perfected for destruction," both by their own merit and by the just divine judgment.
About whom he says:
"Because they are left in the mass of the damned due to the merit of original sin, allowed to live wickedly, and ultimately to be punished with eternal fire," and even unwilling and contradicting, he says nothing other than that they are predestined by divine judgment to eternal fire.
For if that mass is wholly damned, it is undoubtedly condemned by the just judgment of God and condemned to eternal perdition and punishment.
What else is this than to say that this same mass is condemned by divine judgment to eternal destruction?
Thus, while trying to resist the truth, he is compelled, even unwilling and unaware, to confess the truth with invincible reason.

1149
03:07:14,087 --> 03:07:17,975
Chapter Fourteen
In this chapter, it states:

1150
03:07:17,975 --> 03:07:26,485
From the words of Augustine, it is shown that only the just are considered predestined, as he says:
We do not know who belongs to the number of the predestined and who does not.

1151
03:07:26,485 --> 03:07:30,042
And again: We cannot distinguish the predestined from the non-predestined.

1152
03:07:30,042 --> 03:07:33,071
Also: Those who fall and perish were not among the predestined.

1153
03:07:33,071 --> 03:07:37,205
The punishment predestined for sinners: those who are foreknown only, not predestined.

1154
03:07:37,205 --> 03:07:51,387
This is also inferred from human laws, which do not define a person as sinful, but by defining the punishments for those who will sin, aim to deter those prone to sinning by the severity of the punishments; and through this, they bring about no less mercy than retribution for the transgressors.

1155
03:07:51,387 --> 03:08:00,618
To these words, we respond, indeed from the words of the blessed Augustine
(On the Predestination of the Saints, chapter 10, 16)
it is shown that the predestined can also come from the unjust.

1156
03:08:00,618 --> 03:08:06,483
When he defined what predestination is, he said: The predestination of God, which is in good, is the preparation of grace.

1157
03:08:06,483 --> 03:08:34,510
Without a doubt, he would not have added "in good" unless he knew that predestination also exists in evil, as he clearly demonstrates from the book of Acts of the Apostles, citing the passage:
For truly in this city, they were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, Herod and Pilate, along with the people of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place
(Acts 4:27-28)
He also added: Indeed, the hand and the plan of God predestined to be done by the Jewish enemies as much as was necessary for the Gospel because of us.

1158
03:08:34,510 --> 03:08:50,567
Therefore, it is clearly shown both from the words of the divine book and from the words of Saint Augustine that the predestination mentioned here was not for good for those who committed such great and terrible deeds against the Lord at the time of his passion, but for great and deadly evil; although God turned it into good for us.

1159
03:08:50,951 --> 03:09:17,232
If anyone thinks that the blessed Augustine quoted this testimony incorrectly from the book mentioned earlier, because we read: "What your hand and counsel decreed to happen," let them know that he quoted it accurately, as it is in the Greek.
The word itself, proorisen, is also found here in Greek, where it says: "What your hand and counsel predestined to happen."
This same term is also found in the Letter to the Romans in Greek, where the Apostle says: "And those he predestined, he also called" (Romans 8:30).

1160
03:09:17,232 --> 03:09:41,216
From this, it is clear that the same Greek term is properly translated into Latin as "predestined."
But it can also be translated as "decreed" or "predefined," so we can understand that predestined means nothing other than decreed and defined.
This is clearly demonstrated in the words of the prophet Isaiah, where he says: "For the Lord God of hosts has decreed" (Isaiah 14:27); and in the book of Daniel: "In the decision of the watchers, the decree is" (Daniel 4:14).

1161
03:09:41,216 --> 03:09:48,819
So what good does it do to lie with such intent and contention, saying that the blessed Augustine defined all predestination of grace as preparation?

1162
03:09:48,819 --> 03:10:23,774
He never said "all," but defined predestination only in respect to what is good, implying that only the righteous should be called predestined.
He is not found anywhere to have said otherwise, but applied the term only to the predestination of the righteous, by which some are predestined, and others are not.
He insisted less stubbornly and shamelessly, as if that holy doctor always had to speak of both kinds of predestination, both good and bad, together.
It doesn't follow that when he discusses only the predestination of the good, he denies the predestination of the bad.
He clearly mentions and demonstrates this in many places (On the Perfection of Righteousness, chapter 13).

1163
03:10:23,927 --> 03:10:32,544
About which
we will place one testimony here as an example, where it says: That Psalm blames a certain people, among whom there was not a single one who did good (Psalm 13:3).

1164
03:10:32,544 --> 03:10:39,241
These people wish to remain children of men and not become children of God, by whose grace a person becomes good and is able to do good.

1165
03:10:39,241 --> 03:10:48,842
We should understand the good mentioned here to mean what it says there: God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any who understood and sought God (Psalm 14:2).

1166
03:10:48,842 --> 03:10:57,361
Therefore, this good, which is seeking God, was not done by anyone, not even one, among those destined for destruction, as God's foreknowledge had passed judgment upon them.

1167
03:10:57,361 --> 03:11:17,696
But what use is this example of God's predestination of the wicked, against this one, when he is ready, with his usual madness, to tell his listeners: when they hear in the words of this holy teacher that a kind of people is predestined for destruction, they should understand the opposite, not predestined, and thus they are deceived, who seek truth not in the Scripture of truth, but in the fabricators of lies.

1168
03:11:17,696 --> 03:11:23,112
He further adds and says: Punishment is predestined for sinners, but they are only foreknown, not predestined.

1169
03:11:23,112 --> 03:11:33,502
We have spoken enough about this matter both here and in the previous chapter, showing clearly with many testimonies that sinners who remain in their sins are justly predestined by God's judgment for punishment.

1170
03:11:33,502 --> 03:11:48,519
It is surprising by what sense or reason it can be understood that God has predestined punishments for sinners, and yet has not predestined the sinners for punishments; for when He predestined and prepared those punishments for them, He certainly did not ignore who would be punished and tortured by them.

1171
03:11:48,519 --> 03:11:50,735
Even this one admits that they are foreknown.

1172
03:11:50,735 --> 03:12:03,685
Therefore, if He most certainly foreknew who would be justly punished and tortured by those punishments, what else did He do when He prepared the most certain punishments for the most certain people, except that He most certainly predestined them for punishments?

1173
03:12:03,685 --> 03:12:07,427
For indeed, only those will suffer them, whom He foreknew would suffer them.

1174
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:13,966
So, what does it mean for unchanging foreknowledge to have foreseen punishment, other than to have unchangeably predestined it?

1175
03:12:13,966 --> 03:12:19,632
There was no fear that what it most certainly foresaw would justly happen, it would not predestine itself to justly do.

1176
03:12:19,632 --> 03:12:21,870
However, the nature of human laws is different.

1177
03:12:21,870 --> 03:12:28,916
They set certain punishments for those who sin, without knowing exactly who will sin in such a way that they would justly deserve those punishments.

1178
03:12:28,916 --> 03:12:33,439
Therefore, they can prepare and predestine punishments for sinners, which they know to be just.

1179
03:12:33,439 --> 03:12:38,772
Yet, they cannot predestine the sinners themselves to those punishments, as they are completely unknown to them.

1180
03:12:38,772 --> 03:12:49,484
But if they were to know for certain the individuals who would be worthy of those punishments, they could indeed very justly, just as they set punishments for sinners, predestine those sinners to certain and just punishments.

1181
03:12:49,484 --> 03:13:00,578
Just as in the examination of judgment, when they have most certainly proven individuals guilty of a capital crime, they proclaim the death penalty decreed by the laws for them and pronounce a clear sentence condemning them to death.

1182
03:13:00,578 --> 03:13:08,386
This certain knowledge of judgment gives them the authority to predestine not only the punishments for sinners but also the sinners themselves to those punishments.

1183
03:13:08,386 --> 03:13:34,287
Therefore, if both of these can rightly and justly be done in human judgment, informed and guided by certain knowledge, so that punishments are justly and irreproachably decreed for sinners and sinners for punishments; and yet none of these criminals are compelled to sin by the laws or judges, but only justly punished because they have sinned: how much more incomparably and ineffably must we believe it is done in divine judgment, since eternal knowledge knows both the punishments justly due to sinners and the sinners to whom they are due?

1184
03:13:34,287 --> 03:13:44,523
While He is the author or cause of no sin, He most justly predestines both the punishments He knows to be most just for sinners and the sinners, never unknown to Him but eternally well-known, to eternal punishments.

1185
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:49,511
None of us claim, as is often argued, that God's predestination forces anyone to sin.

1186
03:13:49,511 --> 03:13:54,076
Rather, we state that for the sins they have committed, they must bear the punishment.

1187
03:13:54,076 --> 03:14:00,445
Just as laws, by decreeing punishment, do not compel sin but ensure that voluntary and willing sins are justly punished.

1188
03:14:00,551 --> 03:14:06,239
Chapter Fifteen
In the fifteenth chapter, he provides the following definitions.

1189
03:14:06,239 --> 03:14:08,691
1. Sins and their punishments are nothing. 2.

1190
03:14:08,691 --> 03:14:22,803
God foreknew and predestined sins or punishments; as if He did not foreknow, did not predestine, and did not prepare them: using the example of Judas, who was chosen as if he were not chosen, a friend as if he were not a friend, a son as if he were not a son.

1191
03:14:22,803 --> 03:14:22,912
3.

1192
03:14:22,912 --> 03:14:31,576
Punishments are evil and therefore not from God, from whom nothing evil comes, and God does not punish what He Himself does, nor take away their natural gifts.

1193
03:14:31,576 --> 03:14:31,685
4.

1194
03:14:31,685 --> 03:14:39,640
Pain is the absence of health, darkness the absence of light, silence the absence of noise, sadness the absence of joy, labor the absence of rest.

1195
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:42,636
Thus, sins or punishments are foreknown or predestined.

1196
03:14:42,636 --> 03:14:42,745
5.

1197
03:14:42,745 --> 03:14:49,992
By feeling pain, we do not come to know pain itself, but rather health, which we would not know if we did not have some notion of it.

1198
03:14:49,992 --> 03:14:50,101
6.

1199
03:14:50,101 --> 03:14:55,877
The memory of health remains in the senses; but health itself resides in that substance which God created.

1200
03:14:55,877 --> 03:15:03,777
In these six propositions, the first point he made, that sins and punishments are nothing, has already been discussed above, as much as we could.

1201
03:15:03,777 --> 03:15:24,537
For even if sins can be said to be nothing, in that they have no substance in themselves to exist or subsist, still the abandonment of justice, which is to sin, cannot happen except in and through some substance, whether spiritual or physical;
spiritual when truth, justice, and goodness are abandoned in the soul itself, and their opposites, lies, injustice, and malice, enter in.

1202
03:15:24,537 --> 03:15:54,395
Although these have no natural substance for subsisting, they are still great vices or illnesses of nature, that is, of the soul itself, which they dominate and whose health and integrity they violate;
so that the soul itself, bent and depressed by these, becomes servile from being free and sick from being healthy, as the Lord says in the Gospel: "Everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin" John 8:34.
And the Psalmist, pleading sorrowfully and miserably: "I said, Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you" Psalm 41:4.

1203
03:15:55,103 --> 03:16:04,205
But because these evils begin in the mind, although they are mostly carried out through the body, the spiritual evil of the mind moves into the physical evil of the body.

1204
03:16:04,205 --> 03:16:12,181
Thus, like a plague, it stains and corrupts the whole being, so that the soul, serving the dominant sin, brings its own body into the same servitude.

1205
03:16:12,181 --> 03:16:20,747
The members of the body become instruments of unrighteousness to sin, which makes the unrighteousness and sin dominate even more strongly and violently in both.

1206
03:16:20,747 --> 03:17:33,823
Hence the Apostle says to the faithful: "Do not offer your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer the members of your body to God as instruments of righteousness" Romans 6:13.
To this great and deadly illness that claims and wounds the whole person, only the one true doctor can apply a remedy and bring health, who said about himself: "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick" Matthew 9:12, and about whom it is written: "He will save his people from their sins" Matthew 1:21.
About whom also the Apostle says: "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" First Timothy 1:15.
Therefore, the one who persistently says and repeats that sins are nothing, what else does he seek to do, instigated by the devil, but to make them seem insignificant in the hearts of listeners, so that they do not grieve, do not recognize how great the evil that holds them is, nor care to say with the Psalmist: "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy, and according to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is always before me" Psalm 51:1-3.

1207
03:17:33,983 --> 03:17:37,738
Let this deceiver be cast out from the ears and hearts of the faithful.

1208
03:17:37,738 --> 03:17:42,760
In the face of such great misery, let us sorrowfully and simply implore the great mercy of God.

1209
03:17:42,760 --> 03:17:54,710
Against the multitude of so many miseries, let us seek a multitude of mercies, so that iniquity may be erased, the person may be washed from that iniquity, and cleansed from the sin by which they had become filthy and unclean.

1210
03:17:54,710 --> 03:18:08,034
Let them recognize their iniquity, not think their sin is nothing, nor put it behind their back, but always keep it before their eyes and implore Him who said:
"I have blotted out your iniquities like a cloud, and your sins like a mist"
(Isaiah 44:22).

1211
03:18:08,034 --> 03:18:14,484
Similarly, he tries to diminish, lighten, and nullify the punishments due to sins, always asserting that they are nothing.

1212
03:18:14,484 --> 03:18:26,011
Although they have no substance in themselves, through physical natures-eternal fire, the lake of sulfur, and the worms that never die-they are inflicted on the bodies and souls of the damned, tormenting both together.

1213
03:18:26,011 --> 03:18:33,413
Therefore, although they are not substantial, they are always penal and miserable in the souls and bodies of those they torture without end.

1214
03:18:33,413 --> 03:18:58,845
Therefore, let us not be deceived into thinking that the punishments of sinners are nothing; but rather let us hear what Truth most truly says:
"The rich man also died and was buried in hell. Lifting up his eyes, being in torment, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom; and he cried out and said: 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.'"
(Luke 16:22-24).

1215
03:18:58,845 --> 03:19:07,041
A little later, when he was pleading for his brothers, he said:
"That he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment"
(Luke 16:28).

1216
03:19:07,463 --> 03:19:10,600
Behold the unfortunate and most miserable condemned rich man.

1217
03:19:10,600 --> 03:19:15,175
As soon as he died physically, his soul was buried in hell, where it was held in torment.

1218
03:19:15,175 --> 03:19:20,059
He was tortured even more in the place where he had sinned the most, which was with his tongue.

1219
03:19:20,059 --> 03:19:23,452
He was tormented in the flame that burned and scorched everywhere.

1220
03:19:23,452 --> 03:19:33,735
Just as he had not given the crumbs from his table to Lazarus, the poor man full of sores lying at his door, he did not deserve to obtain a drop of water from Lazarus' finger to cool himself a little.

1221
03:19:33,735 --> 03:19:38,105
He even begged for his brothers so that they would not come to that place of torment.

1222
03:19:38,105 --> 03:19:46,588
Therefore, according to the voice of Truth, hell is a place of torment, and the souls of the wretched, stripped of their bodies, are buried there and are in torment.

1223
03:19:46,588 --> 03:19:53,014
They are tortured by the same means by which they sinned, so their judgment is without mercy because they did not show mercy.

1224
03:19:53,014 --> 03:21:00,260
As it is written in the book of James, chapter 2, verse 13: "Because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment." Let every faithful person hear this and be afraid, and while there is still time, flee from the coming wrath about which blessed John the Baptist said: "Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruits worthy of repentance." Luke chapter 3, verses 7 to 8. The Lord Himself often calls this place of torment the outer darkness, the furnace of fire, and the eternal fire prepared for the devil and all the wicked, where there will be endless pain, eternal weeping of the eyes, and gnashing of teeth. Book of Matthew, chapter 25, verse 41. Regarding such punishment of the unfortunate condemned, the prophet Isaiah says: "Their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind." Book of Isaiah, chapter 66, verse 24. Also, blessed Job tearfully implores God, saying: "Are not my few days almost over? Leave me alone, so that I may have a moment of joy, before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and utter darkness, to the land of deepest night, of utter darkness and disorder, where even the light is like darkness." Book of Job, chapter 10, verses 20 to 22.

1225
03:21:00,671 --> 03:21:12,050
And blessed John in the Apocalypse says: "They were thrown," he says, "into the lake burning with fire and sulfur, which is the second death, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever" (Revelation 20:14).

1226
03:21:12,050 --> 03:21:17,170
And as he says elsewhere: "The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever" (Revelation 14:11).

1227
03:21:17,170 --> 03:21:27,877
Let us faithfully believe these things, truly fear them, and completely reject this babbler and deceiver from our ears:
For, as the Apostle says, "Bad company corrupts good morals" (First Corinthians 15:33).

1228
03:21:27,877 --> 03:21:34,238
Hence another Scripture also advises saying: "Fence your ears with thorns, and do not hear a wicked tongue" (Sirach 28:28).

1229
03:21:34,238 --> 03:21:46,341
Immediately after these things, he adds his impious and furious rule, where he tries to persuade us that when we hear something is done, we should understand it as not done; when something is said, we should understand it as not said.

1230
03:21:46,341 --> 03:21:53,426
He also claims that God foreknew and predestined sins or punishments as if He did not foreknow, did not predestine, did not prepare them.

1231
03:21:53,426 --> 03:21:55,702
This is clearly contrary to faith and truth.

1232
03:21:55,702 --> 03:22:00,926
For if God did not foreknow all future sins of angels or humans, He is not all-knowing of the future.

1233
03:22:00,926 --> 03:22:15,149
And what else is this but for this foolish person to say in his heart, "There is no God" (Psalms 14:1), if He did not foreknow the punishments justly owed to sinners, how can He threaten them so frequently, so gravely, and so terrifyingly in the Gospels and other Scriptures?

1234
03:22:15,149 --> 03:22:21,149
But he says: Since sins or punishments are nothing, because they do not have the substance of existing on their own.

1235
03:22:21,149 --> 03:22:24,614
And therefore, God could neither know nor foreknow what is nothing.

1236
03:22:24,614 --> 03:22:41,527
As if it were unknown to God whatever does not exist, and what He Himself did not make to exist essentially and naturally:
since with His omnipotent knowledge and foreknowledge, just as He knows all that He made, He also knows what He did not make:
and, as He knows what He would make, so He always knew what He would not make.

1237
03:22:42,095 --> 03:22:48,016
So indeed, both what He wanted to exist and what He did not want to exist, He could not at all be ignorant of.

1238
03:22:48,016 --> 03:23:00,612
And what He did not want to have the nature or substance of existence, He undoubtedly knew to be a great evil for the subsisting nature of angels or humans, when it is changed for the worse with sin and eternally punished without end.

1239
03:23:00,612 --> 03:23:03,250
Now, it's true that God does not predestine sins.

1240
03:23:03,250 --> 03:23:08,955
He did not predestine them, except for what He Himself was going to do, which are certainly good and just.

1241
03:23:08,955 --> 03:23:14,230
However, it's utterly false to say that He did not predestine punishments, but also prepared them.

1242
03:23:14,230 --> 03:23:22,089
As the Lord Himself says in the Gospel: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).

1243
03:23:22,089 --> 03:23:26,288
He adds the example of Judas quite absurdly and incongruously, as shown above.

1244
03:23:26,288 --> 03:23:31,993
And immediately he adds, saying: Punishments are evil and therefore not from God, from whom no evil comes.

1245
03:23:31,993 --> 03:23:38,829
Against this, God Himself testifies through the prophet, saying: "I am the Lord, making peace and creating evil" (Isaiah 45:7).

1246
03:23:38,829 --> 03:23:44,104
And elsewhere it is written: "If there is evil in the city, has not the Lord done it?" (Amos 3:6).

1247
03:23:44,104 --> 03:23:49,057
And again: "Good and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God" (Sirach 11:14).

1248
03:23:49,057 --> 03:23:59,661
And therefore it must be faithfully discerned that there is one kind of evil, that is, vice, contrary to good, which certainly is not from God, but either invented by the devil or committed by man.

1249
03:23:59,661 --> 03:24:16,885
And another kind of evil, which signifies some affliction either temporary or eternal: such as famine, pestilence, hostilities, devastations, death, and those that are called eternal punishments; all of which are indeed from God, because they are prepared or inflicted only by His just arrangement and His just judgment.

1250
03:24:16,885 --> 03:24:33,572
But the one who confirms that those eternal punishments are not from God must be compelled to say from whom he thinks they are, whether from the devil, for whom they are prepared; or from humans, who are equally to be punished there; or from no one, so that they exist co-eternally with God without any author.

1251
03:24:34,271 --> 03:24:39,817
He continues by saying: God does not punish what He created, nor does He take away their natural gifts.

1252
03:24:39,817 --> 03:24:49,832
To consider this more carefully, it is clear that what God made in rational creatures, either angelic or human, exists as spirit in angels without a body, and as soul and body in humans.

1253
03:24:49,832 --> 03:24:57,586
The natural gifts that God gave to these rational creatures, which He wants us to understand, are those that He spoke about extensively earlier.

1254
03:24:57,586 --> 03:25:03,562
That is, the human or angelic mind naturally possesses memory, intelligence, will, being, knowing, and willing.

1255
03:25:03,562 --> 03:25:09,431
It naturally remembers itself, understands itself, loves itself, exists, recognizes itself, and loves itself.

1256
03:25:09,431 --> 03:25:15,085
Free will is also considered a natural gift from the Creator, as He has clearly shown in His words above.

1257
03:25:15,085 --> 03:25:24,023
Thus, He says that God does not punish what He created; that is, neither the angelic spirit in evil angels, nor the spirit and body in humans who are to be condemned.

1258
03:25:24,023 --> 03:25:31,830
And how does He say that the eternal fire is prepared for the devil and his angels, if those angelic spirits are not to be punished by that fire?

1259
03:25:31,830 --> 03:25:44,268
How also does He say elsewhere about humans and to humans: "But rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28), if neither soul nor body, both created by God, are to be punished by that torment of hell?

1260
03:25:44,268 --> 03:25:58,321
But indeed, both spirits and bodies will be punished in hell, as true faith believes, and as Truth itself testifies: not because God created them, but because they did what God did not make, and what God hates and does not allow to go unpunished, that is, sins.

1261
03:25:58,321 --> 03:26:12,644
These cannot exist or be punished without their authors: for they do not subsist by themselves to be punished in themselves, but they are within depraved minds, whether angelic or human, committed by them, adhering to them, and to be condemned with them and in them.

1262
03:26:12,644 --> 03:26:20,505
Thus, it is also true what Scripture says in praise of God: "For you love all that exists, and hate nothing of what you have made" (Wisdom 11:25).

1263
03:26:20,505 --> 03:26:25,081
And what the Lord says: "Who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28).

1264
03:26:25,727 --> 03:26:29,631
For He loves His creature, as it is in its pure nature, created by Him.

1265
03:26:29,631 --> 03:26:31,994
And He hates it insofar as it is corrupted.

1266
03:26:31,994 --> 03:26:52,499
Hence it is written: "You hate all who do iniquity, You destroy all who speak falsehood: The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man" Psalm 5:7-8. Therefore the prophet also says about certain people: "They have become as detestable as that which they loved" (Hosea 9:10); and again: "Likewise, both the ungodly and his ungodliness are hateful to God" (Wisdom 14:9).

1267
03:26:52,499 --> 03:27:03,548
Thus, He loves everything that exists and hates nothing that He has made; yet, in the rational creature corrupted, depraved, and spoiled, He does not allow these things to go unpunished and disordered.

1268
03:27:03,548 --> 03:27:21,249
It is justly ordered and punished in pain the nature that did not want to be blessed under God and from God but desired to be free in itself and by itself: so that what did not want to be subjected willingly, should be subjected unwillingly; and what could have been always blessed there, here becomes endlessly miserable.

1269
03:27:21,249 --> 03:27:32,024
Because it is impossible to escape the hand of God, as Scripture itself says, (Tobit 13:2), to whom it is necessary that what did not want to be subjected willingly, be subjected out of necessity.

1270
03:27:32,024 --> 03:27:39,885
But what benefit will it be to the rational natures themselves, if in that eternal damnation the natural gifts, as he says, are not taken away?

1271
03:27:39,885 --> 03:27:59,565
Since it is clearly understood that they are to be left only to increase the heap of torments, not to any fruit of happiness, so that they remember themselves, to the eternal sorrow of a guilty conscience: they understand themselves to be always miserable, always damned; they love themselves, so that they grieve more for perishing endlessly what they love.

1272
03:27:59,565 --> 03:28:06,601
But what kind of free will will there be in those, whose will can neither abandon its own iniquity nor perform any good further?

1273
03:28:06,601 --> 03:28:17,705
As Scripture says: "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom" (Ecclesiastes 9:10).

1274
03:28:17,705 --> 03:28:24,962
What benefit will it be to them to always be unhappily, to know their damnation, to wish but not be able to escape their punishment?

1275
03:28:25,511 --> 03:28:31,597
All things given here to do good and obtain the Lord's grace, if any trace remains, will serve as punishment, not comfort.

1276
03:28:31,597 --> 03:28:44,116
However, if the memory, intellect, and will of a rational creature are directed not towards themselves but towards their Creator, what will these faculties do in those who are completely abandoned by God and separated from that eternal and true light?

1277
03:28:44,116 --> 03:30:13,748
What, I ask, will memory do, where no one can say, "I remembered God, and I was delighted"? Psalm seventy-seven verse three, and where what is written will be fulfilled: "For in death there is no remembrance of you" Psalm six verse five. There will be no enlightenment of intellect by which God is known, sought, and found. There will be no devout affection by which God is loved, desired, and enjoyed. For they will be in outer darkness, away from that light, and will not enjoy any of its illumination.
And that dreadful night, about which our true light, the Lord, says: "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. The night is coming, when no one can work" John nine verse five, four. Therefore, as long as He is in the world through His illuminating grace, He is the light of the world, liberating it from its darkness. But when He withdraws this grace of His illumination from those condemned to eternal blindness, what else will remain for them except a dreadful, perpetual night in which no one can work?
If we also consider the bodily senses, which are natural gifts from the Creator, what will sight avail there, where there will be no view of light? Or if there is sight for a moment, it will not be for comfort, but for greater pain: so that they may see something good, which they can no longer have or earn. Just as that rich man, condemned to the same infernal punishments, could see Abraham and Lazarus for a moment Luke sixteen verse twenty-three, but it increased his pain, not provided him any relief. Although this is believed to happen before that final judgment according to the hidden disposition of the Creator, nothing like this is read to happen afterward. What will hearing do there, where a dreadful noise and sad, countless groans will always be heard?

1278
03:30:13,847 --> 03:30:24,774
What will happen to our sense of smell when, as God warns through the prophet, "Instead of a sweet smell, there will be a stench"?
(Isaiah 3:24)
And what about taste, when eternal hunger and thirst are upon us?

1279
03:30:24,774 --> 03:30:37,261
As it is clearly written about the city of the devil, meaning the entire multitude of the damned, in Revelation: "In one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine; for mighty is the Lord God who judges her" (Revelation 18:8).

1280
03:30:37,261 --> 03:30:43,349
The Gospel speaks clearly about the condemnation of the rich man, highlighting his eternal thirst and burning tongue.

1281
03:30:43,349 --> 03:30:50,269
What about the sense of touch when the whole body experiences no pleasure or sweetness, but faces eternal pain, burning, and torment?

1282
03:30:50,269 --> 03:30:57,606
What, then, is the point of saying, as if to console fools, that God does not punish what He has created, nor takes away their natural gifts?

1283
03:30:57,606 --> 03:31:07,231
Since He punishes corrupted nature eternally for its wrong acts, and if He allows any natural gifts to remain in that damnation, it will only increase the punishment, not bring comfort.

1284
03:31:07,231 --> 03:31:17,013
What does it mean to say: Pain is the absence of health, darkness is the absence of light, silence is the absence of noise, sadness is the absence of joy, and labor is the absence of rest?

1285
03:31:17,013 --> 03:31:19,875
Thus, sins and punishments are foreseen or predestined.

1286
03:31:19,875 --> 03:31:38,398
If, by these words, he wanted to persuade us that just as we know pain through the absence of health, darkness through the absence of light, silence through the absence of sound, sadness through the absence of joy, and labor through the absence of rest, so God foresees sins or predestines punishments, then what could be more horrible than such a thought?

1287
03:31:38,398 --> 03:31:40,739
It equates divine virtue with human weakness.

1288
03:31:41,207 --> 03:31:45,256
The power of God, always constant and unchanging, knows everything within itself.

1289
03:31:45,256 --> 03:31:47,806
It doesn't need to know anything outside of itself.

1290
03:31:47,806 --> 03:31:55,404
It doesn't distinguish between things that happen one way or another, because it perceives everything equally with its eternal and unchanging knowledge.

1291
03:31:55,404 --> 03:31:58,653
It sees what it has willed to be and what it hasn't willed to be.

1292
03:31:58,653 --> 03:32:01,452
It doesn't recognize sins due to the absence of justice.

1293
03:32:01,452 --> 03:32:05,601
Being the highest form of justice, it sees within itself whatever deviates from it.

1294
03:32:05,601 --> 03:32:09,500
Similarly, it doesn't recognize punishments due to the absence of blessedness.

1295
03:32:09,500 --> 03:32:14,799
As the highest blessedness, it perceives the depth of punishment for those who stray from its tranquility.

1296
03:32:14,799 --> 03:32:23,996
Thus, it understands deviations from justice within justice itself, and recognizes punishments within blessedness, seeing the pain and labor of those who separate from its tranquility.

1297
03:32:23,996 --> 03:32:31,594
He further explains: By feeling pain, one doesn't truly know the pain but rather knows health, which they wouldn't understand without some notion of it.

1298
03:32:31,594 --> 03:32:38,093
This implies that the pain of eternal punishment cannot be fully recognized by the suffering soul, as pain itself lacks substance.

1299
03:32:38,093 --> 03:32:44,141
Therefore, since pain is insubstantial, it isn't recognized by the sufferer; instead, health is recognized by comparison.

1300
03:32:44,141 --> 03:32:49,989
Health, which is naturally present in the body and contrary to pain, would not be known unless it remained in memory.

1301
03:32:49,989 --> 03:32:56,638
To support this idea, he adds: The memory of health remains in the senses, but health itself resides in the substance created by God.

1302
03:32:57,287 --> 03:33:02,679
Perhaps he wants to convey that within the sense of eternal suffering, there is always a reminder of health.

1303
03:33:02,679 --> 03:33:09,169
Through the senses, whether the body or the soul feels the pain, the memory of health is created from the very experience of pain.

1304
03:33:09,169 --> 03:33:20,850
True health in that damnation might be understood because the substance of a human, which God created, is not consumed or destroyed in the perpetuity of both soul and body, but rather lasts eternally in a kind of wholeness of its own.

1305
03:33:20,850 --> 03:33:29,337
All these points illustrate that through eternal pain, neither the knowledge of health, nor the memory of it, nor health itself in those who are to be tormented, is lost.

1306
03:33:29,337 --> 03:33:40,470
On the contrary, all of these-knowledge and memory of health in a perpetually suffering soul, and the preservation of an indestructible nature-add not to any grace or joy of salvation but rather to the accumulation of pain.

1307
03:33:40,470 --> 03:33:49,905
Thus, the damned suffer not only in body and soul, but also, while remembering and recognizing the good health they have utterly lost, they are punished in that very memory and recognition.

1308
03:33:49,905 --> 03:33:59,040
Therefore, it is insane to consider there being health in eternal and all-encompassing pain, while what is thought to remain there as a sign of health is nothing but a source of pain.

1309
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:03,034
As the one who is tormented never ends, so do the torments themselves never end.

1310
03:34:03,383 --> 03:34:09,575
Chapter Sixteen
In the sixteenth chapter, he proposes twelve definitions, saying:

1311
03:34:09,575 --> 03:34:11,714
1. No nature punishes another nature. 2.

1312
03:34:11,714 --> 03:34:15,456
The punishments of sins are nothing other than the sins themselves. 3.

1313
03:34:15,456 --> 03:34:20,107
In eternal fire, the punishment is nothing other than the absence of blessed happiness.

1314
03:34:20,107 --> 03:34:20,214
4.

1315
03:34:20,214 --> 03:34:31,226
In it, everyone has an inherent notion of absent happiness and its desire: the miserable will have a notion and knowledge of happiness and truth, and therefore they are not miserable, nor are they punished.

1316
03:34:31,226 --> 03:34:31,333
5.

1317
03:34:31,333 --> 03:34:37,747
In the devil and wicked men, only the perversity of their own will is punished; neither nature sinned, but the will did.

1318
03:34:37,747 --> 03:34:37,854
6.

1319
03:34:37,854 --> 03:34:42,559
Nor did the general nature sin in the first man, but the individual will of each person.

1320
03:34:42,559 --> 03:34:42,666
7.

1321
03:34:42,666 --> 03:34:47,049
If that nature were to sin, since it is one, it would certainly perish completely.

1322
03:34:47,049 --> 03:34:47,156
8.

1323
03:34:47,156 --> 03:34:54,159
Therefore, in no one is nature punished, because it is from God, and it does not sin, but the voluntary lustful motion is punished.

1324
03:34:54,159 --> 03:34:54,266
9.

1325
03:34:54,266 --> 03:35:00,360
Thus, in the wicked, the punishments are not endured for what God made, but for what pride has viciously invented.

1326
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:00,520
10.

1327
03:35:00,520 --> 03:35:06,508
The lust of a perverse will is tormented, while it is not allowed to have what it wrongly or unworthily desires.

1328
03:35:06,508 --> 03:35:06,668
11.

1329
03:35:06,668 --> 03:35:08,165
No evil comes from any good.

1330
03:35:08,165 --> 03:35:08,325
12.

1331
03:35:08,325 --> 03:35:23,400
He who, here, with the free choice of will, which is the gift of natural intelligence, that is, the sharpness of mind, turns it to the uses of disgrace, there, by the most just decree, does not enjoy the dignity of truth at all, and does not avoid the darkness of eternal ignorance.

1332
03:35:23,400 --> 03:35:39,170
In these words, when he first stated that no nature punishes another nature, he seems to mean that every nature created by the good author, God, is good inasmuch as it is nature: for example, the nature of the soul or body is good; and the nature of fire, inasmuch as it is nature, is also good.

1333
03:35:39,170 --> 03:35:54,191
Therefore, since both are naturally good, he rightly seems to say and define that no nature punishes another nature; because, evidently, two goods, according to his understanding, cannot be contrary to each other, lest one good nature could be a punishment for another good nature.

1334
03:35:55,367 --> 03:36:00,813
The clear fallacy of this argument seeks to undermine the firmest truth of faith in the hearts of listeners.

1335
03:36:00,813 --> 03:36:20,023
This truth is one that all the faithful undoubtedly believe and confess: that both the nature of evil spirits and the nature of lost humans, including their souls and bodies, will be damned, punished, and tormented without end by His just and eternal judgment:
He who can destroy both soul and body in hell, and who, after killing, has the power to throw into hell (Matthew 10:28).

1336
03:36:20,023 --> 03:36:32,427
Our faith is certain not only about these eternal punishments, by which both angels and human nature will be tormented by eternal fire, but also that it is most certain in the common sense of humans that nature is never punished except by nature.

1337
03:36:32,427 --> 03:36:44,528
Just as the body can be punished by itself-when it fails from health and succumbs to weakness and disease, diminishing the good of health and suffering the evil of disease-or by the withdrawal of another nature that supports or comforts it.

1338
03:36:44,528 --> 03:36:54,914
For instance, when food, drink, light, clothing, or anything of that kind is taken away as a punishment, the body wastes away, fails from hunger and thirst, and is afflicted by darkness or tortured by cold.

1339
03:36:54,914 --> 03:37:06,007
Additionally, the human body can be punished by the nature of another thing, such as when robbers' bodies are punished by whips, swords, and multiple torments inflicted upon their bodies by other natures as a punishment.

1340
03:37:06,007 --> 03:37:17,049
Given that these scenarios are true and that nature is never punished except by itself, by the withdrawal of another nature's benefit, or by inflicted violence, how then can one say that no nature is punished by nature?

1341
03:37:17,351 --> 03:37:21,428
So, as far as it depends on itself, it destroys the truth of eternal punishments.

1342
03:37:21,428 --> 03:37:29,683
Both the nature of spirits and bodies are in accordance with the gospel and apostolic truth: the nature of eternal fire will torment day and night forever and ever.

1343
03:37:29,683 --> 03:37:43,223
But if he says this because natures do not harm each other except by their qualities-like fire and water, where water is naturally wet, and fire is naturally dry-then fire can be extinguished by water's moisture, and water's moisture can be dried out by fire's dryness.

1344
03:37:43,223 --> 03:37:49,162
These things don't oppose each other because of their natures, but because their qualities are contrary to each other.

1345
03:37:49,162 --> 03:37:57,618
If he says this, let him know that in our faith, it doesn't matter whether natures are punished by natures or if natures penalize each other by their natural qualities.

1346
03:37:57,618 --> 03:38:02,601
Both were created by one Creator, meaning both the nature and the qualities inherent in the nature.

1347
03:38:02,601 --> 03:38:09,345
Therefore, both together are rightly called one nature, distinguished from each other by their proper qualities by the wisest Creator.

1348
03:38:09,345 --> 03:38:19,613
Furthermore, since the nature of the angelic or human spirit is immortal, by the power of the Creator and just avenger God, it will be bound to that corporeal and eternal fire, both penally and eternally.

1349
03:38:19,613 --> 03:38:28,723
Just as here, by the same power of the supreme Creator, the human spirit is bound to the earthly body and cannot be released except by the will and judgment of the one who bound it.

1350
03:38:28,723 --> 03:38:37,431
Likewise, the nature of the human body in that eternal fire of the damned will be so penally immortal that it will never be dissolved by death, enduring eternal punishments.

1351
03:38:37,431 --> 03:38:42,867
It will be passible and incorruptible, afflicted by every kind of pain, torment, and punishment without end.

1352
03:38:42,867 --> 03:38:51,373
For Scripture warns us to avoid this punishment with all intent, saying: Humble your spirit greatly, because the vengeance on the flesh of the impious is fire and worms.

1353
03:38:51,373 --> 03:38:52,028
Sirach 7:19
.

1354
03:38:52,631 --> 03:38:57,903
And again: For the Lord Almighty will take vengeance on them; on the day of judgment, He will visit them.

1355
03:38:57,903 --> 03:39:01,970
He will put fire and worms in their flesh, so they will burn and feel it forever.

1356
03:39:01,970 --> 03:39:02,773
Judith 16:20-21.

1357
03:39:02,773 --> 03:39:06,790
Someone in ancient times posed a similar question about the conflict of natures.

1358
03:39:06,790 --> 03:39:21,349
We find it necessary to briefly insert here how this question was posed and how it was thoroughly refuted by Saint Augustine, for the instruction and confirmation of the readers, especially since the one who posed it was either Pelagius himself or a follower of Pelagius, as is this person.

1359
03:39:21,349 --> 03:39:31,591
Therefore, Saint Augustine recalls the same question, saying:
After this, Saint Augustine adds his contrary response, saying:
The holy doctor goes on to convince and destroy the madness of the wicked man.

1360
03:39:31,591 --> 03:39:45,398
Since the terror and truth of eternal punishments are so clearly and abundantly recommended by our faith to instill a healthy fear and prompt continuous improvement, how could this person dare to add and say that the punishments of sins are nothing but their sins themselves?

1361
03:39:45,398 --> 03:40:01,163
Since our faith most certainly holds that there are other punishments for sins that souls suffer in the present due to their own merits, being deserted by God, deserted from the light of justice, from the contemplation of truth, from the illumination of charity; and sometimes even handed over to a reprobate mind.

1362
03:40:01,163 --> 03:40:27,270
For divine Scripture very clearly testifies that these punishments are inflicted on sinners and lovers of carnal pleasures in the present, when it says about certain people: "My spirit will not remain in these men forever, because they are flesh" Genesis 6:3; when the wicked, lamenting and groaning at the end, will say: "The light of righteousness did not shine upon us, and the sun did not rise upon us" Wisdom 5:6; when Scripture says about the same wicked people: "For their own wickedness has blinded them" Wisdom.

1363
03:40:27,671 --> 03:40:37,829
And generally about those who hate their brothers:
Everyone who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

1364
03:40:37,829 --> 03:40:38,757
(First John 2:11).

1365
03:40:38,757 --> 03:40:46,594
And about some people, it is written:
Since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.

1366
03:40:46,594 --> 03:40:47,316
(Romans 1:28).

1367
03:40:47,316 --> 03:40:56,906
The punishments of sinning souls are their own sins because the health of their souls is corrupted and violated, and their conscience becomes miserable, disturbed, and full of anxieties.

1368
03:40:56,906 --> 03:41:01,701
Thus, the punishments of sinners are their own sins by the just and terrible judgment of God.

1369
03:41:01,701 --> 03:41:07,579
And yet for the same sins, other very severe punishments are immediately inflicted in the present, as shown above.

1370
03:41:07,579 --> 03:41:24,903
Moses testifies very clearly about all these present punishments, with which the souls of sinners are continually struck and punished, saying about the almighty God:
Showing mercy to thousands who love Him;
(Deuteronomy 5:10);
and repaying those who hate Him immediately, to destroy them, without delay, repaying them what they deserve.

1371
03:41:24,903 --> 03:41:25,883
(Deuteronomy 7:10).

1372
03:41:25,883 --> 03:41:30,214
Therefore, even in the present, the gravest punishments of souls are their own sins.

1373
03:41:30,214 --> 03:41:36,865
The gravest punishments of souls are the abandonment and damnation by God, which sinners are continually repaid for their merits.

1374
03:41:36,865 --> 03:41:44,805
But those punishments of eternal torment remain for the future, about which it is written, the Lord saying:
The rich man also died and was buried in hell.

1375
03:41:44,805 --> 03:41:45,476
(Luke 16:22).

1376
03:41:45,476 --> 03:41:51,508
And again:
Lest your adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be thrown into prison.

1377
03:41:51,508 --> 03:41:55,427
Truly I tell you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.

1378
03:41:55,427 --> 03:41:56,355
(Matthew 5:25-26).

1379
03:41:56,355 --> 03:42:08,162
And in another place, when speaking about the wicked servant who refused to forgive his fellow servant as he had been forgiven, he said:
Then his master, angry, handed him over to the torturers until he would pay his entire debt.

1380
03:42:08,162 --> 03:42:08,987
(Matthew 18:34).

1381
03:42:09,863 --> 03:42:15,482
These punishments for sinners, whether due to their own sins or because of being abandoned by God, are deserved.

1382
03:42:15,482 --> 03:42:21,401
They are inflicted immediately in the present or through various afflictions that are divinely imposed on sinners now.

1383
03:42:21,401 --> 03:42:24,712
Additionally, there are eternal punishments that await at the end.

1384
03:42:24,712 --> 03:42:40,262
Since Scripture clearly testifies to this and the Church's faith holds it undoubtedly, let those deceived by such fallacies hear what the Apostle warns all the faithful:
"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience" (Ephesians 5:6).

1385
03:42:40,262 --> 03:42:50,496
Blessed Jerome adds to these words of the Apostle, explaining:
This holy doctor, refuting the error of ancient heretics on this matter, overturns the fraudulent lies and fabrications with apostolic truth.

1386
03:42:50,496 --> 03:43:39,405
Yet, this man dares to add even greater and more detestable things, saying:
"In eternal fire, there is no other punishment than the absence of blessed happiness."
Rightly, he is asked why both evil angels and wicked humans are to be cast into eternal fire if they will suffer no punishments or torments from that fire? Is it only so that those who now dwell either in the air or on the earth will begin to have a new dwelling in the fire? Consider how it is written about the three holy youths condemned in the Babylonian furnace: the fire had no power over their bodies, their hair was not singed, and the smell of fire did not pass over them. As the Scripture says about them:
"The angel of the Lord went down into the furnace with Azariah and his companions, drove the flame of the fire out of the furnace, and made the middle of the furnace like a moist whistling wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all, nor hurt them, nor cause them any pain" (Daniel 3:49-50).

1387
03:43:39,405 --> 03:43:43,067
He contends with astonishing madness to affirm this about others as well.

1388
03:43:43,367 --> 03:43:53,918
Imagine if it were possible for an incredible miracle to occur: a vast multitude of fallen angels and lost humans standing amidst immense and raging flames, yet the fire doesn't touch them at all.

1389
03:43:53,918 --> 03:43:58,116
The fire would forget its strength, leaving the devil and his angels unharmed.

1390
03:43:58,116 --> 03:44:02,530
Who could ever believe such a thing or tolerate the madness of such great impiety?

1391
03:44:02,530 --> 03:44:09,635
If there is no punishment in the eternal fire for the damned, then there can't be any glory in the eternal reward for the righteous.

1392
03:44:09,635 --> 03:44:27,076
For the same one who promised this glory by saying, "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 25:34), also truly threatened that punishment by saying, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).

1393
03:44:27,076 --> 03:44:34,934
He also added with unchanging truth about both: "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life" (Matthew 25:46).

1394
03:44:34,934 --> 03:44:43,278
So, if we seek to understand what that kingdom prepared for the righteous from the foundation of the world is, we should faithfully see it as eternal life.

1395
03:44:43,278 --> 03:44:51,352
If we want to understand what to believe about the fire into which wicked humans and angels are cast, we should likewise see it as eternal punishment.

1396
03:44:51,352 --> 03:45:01,310
There can be no greater glory than eternal life; nor any greater punishment than eternal suffering: the former for those in the kingdom, the latter for those damned in the eternal fire.

1397
03:45:01,310 --> 03:45:13,098
Blessed John clearly testifies about this punishment of eternal fire in Revelation, saying, "They were thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, and will be tormented day and night forever and ever" (Revelation 20:9-10).

1398
03:45:13,098 --> 03:45:18,373
And in another place: "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever" (Revelation 19:3).

1399
03:45:18,911 --> 03:45:24,524
Therefore, neither the angels nor the damned humans in eternal fire will ever be at rest or free from punishment.

1400
03:45:24,524 --> 03:46:23,183
As the Truth says:
"They will be tormented day and night forever and ever; and the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever." Revelation 14:11
This punishment even now follows those like the rich man clothed in purple and condemned.
About whom, Scripture says: "They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to Sheol" Job 21:13.
Just like the rich man, they immediately begin to be in torment, suffer in the flame, and are assigned to the place of eternal torments.
As we have heard, this man often says when someone tries to oppose him with the truth of the faith: "What do you want? Reason defeats you."
So, what is this reason, empty of all reason, alien to all truth, and driven by the spirit of the most impious error, and fanatical?
He wants people to abandon the truth of Christ and follow his fantastic and demonic shadows.
When he said that the condemned in eternal fire feel no other punishment than the absence of blessed happiness, he adds, as if it were a kind of their happiness, "In this (that is, in the absence of blessed happiness) there is no one who does not naturally have within them the concept of the absent happiness and its desire.

1401
03:46:23,183 --> 03:46:53,134
"
He also adds that the miserable will have the concept and knowledge of happiness and truth, and thus are not miserable nor punished.
With these words, he clearly tries to affirm that all those who will be in that damnation, which he thinks is nothing other than the absence of the happiness that the saints enjoy, will naturally have an innate understanding and desire for that happiness, of which they will not be partakers.
Repeating and emphasizing this, he says they will have the knowledge and understanding of truth and happiness; and thus, being miserable, they are not miserable, nor punished.

1402
03:46:53,183 --> 03:47:03,706
So, through this understanding, those who seek knowledge, awareness, and desire for happiness and truth-without which they would be damned-are not truly miserable, and those punished are not truly punished.

1403
03:47:03,706 --> 03:47:08,405
Because being absent from happiness and bliss, they can be called both miserable and damned.

1404
03:47:08,405 --> 03:47:16,118
However, having knowledge, awareness, and desire for happiness and truth, which will be absent from them, means they are not truly miserable or damned.

1405
03:47:16,118 --> 03:47:27,407
Yet, the faith of the Church understands that the greatest damnation for a rational creature is to be separated from God; to be deprived of His illumination, grace, liberation, and the joy of His vision and contemplation.

1406
03:47:27,407 --> 03:47:40,688
Therefore, angels and men damned with such great unhappiness and completely excluded from happiness and truth, even if they felt no external punishment or torment, gain nothing from the knowledge, awareness, and desire for happiness and truth promised to them.

1407
03:47:40,688 --> 03:47:49,933
This is because it only leads to greater torment to have some knowledge of truth but never experience its foresight; to desire eternal happiness but never rejoice in its possession.

1408
03:47:49,933 --> 03:47:58,208
It is unthinkable to believe they are not the most miserable, completely separated from God, or to say they are not punished when excluded from eternal happiness.

1409
03:47:58,208 --> 03:48:05,819
Therefore, they will truly be miserable and eternally damned, always exiled from truth and happiness, without any light of truth or joy of happiness.

1410
03:48:05,819 --> 03:48:14,605
In addition to this utmost misery, they will also face endless external punishment, tormented inside by the unhappiness of their conscience and outside by the fire of hell.

1411
03:48:14,605 --> 03:48:24,668
The Psalmist briefly shows both of these when he speaks to the Judge of the living and the dead: "May Your hand find all Your enemies; Your right hand will find those who hate You" (Psalms 21:8-9).

1412
03:48:25,127 --> 03:48:28,569
You will make them like a fiery furnace in the time of Your presence.

1413
03:48:28,569 --> 03:48:32,010
The Lord, in His anger, will disturb them, and fire will devour them.

1414
03:48:32,010 --> 03:48:33,856
Psalm twenty-one, verses nine to ten.

1415
03:48:33,856 --> 03:48:43,681
Blessed Augustine explains this succinctly:
Given this, we must diligently ask ourselves, according to the rule of true faith, what to think about those who will be punished with eternal damnation.

1416
03:48:43,681 --> 03:48:48,968
By understanding the state of those eternally damned, we grasp how much the Lord deems it worthy to grant.

1417
03:48:48,968 --> 03:48:52,210
We learn why there can be no correction or liberation from there.

1418
03:48:52,210 --> 03:49:01,985
Therefore, the Catholic faith firmly holds that no person, upon departing from the body through death, can gain any merit to abandon the wickedness in which they died or be changed for the better.

1419
03:49:01,985 --> 03:49:16,848
Even if some, as the piety of the faith knows, receive forgiveness of sins after death through the prayers, offerings, and alms of the Church, and are cleansed by certain purgatorial punishments, deserving to be associated with eternal happiness, this does not grant them any new merit after death.

1420
03:49:16,848 --> 03:49:19,242
Instead, it is merit they acquired before death.

1421
03:49:19,242 --> 03:49:24,877
Indeed, their life's merit in the body is such that they deserve to be helped by these remedies even after death.

1422
03:49:24,877 --> 03:49:34,005
The Apostle clearly states:
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

1423
03:49:34,005 --> 03:49:36,199
Second Corinthians, chapter five, verse ten.

1424
03:49:36,199 --> 03:49:41,187
Indeed, the deeds of the body, whether good or evil, are what the soul did while it was in the body.

1425
03:49:41,187 --> 03:49:51,311
Just as the soul could not do any good or evil before the body existed, neither can it do any good or evil after the body is laid down, for the time for doing and acting ended with the death of the body.

1426
03:49:51,959 --> 03:49:58,578
Even those bound only by the guilt of original sin and leave the body without a saving remedy are damned due to their own bodily evils.

1427
03:49:58,578 --> 03:50:03,726
They contracted that original debt in the body and with the body, which leads to their eternal damnation.

1428
03:50:03,726 --> 03:50:11,669
Therefore, everything must be revealed, as the Apostle says, before the judgment seat of Christ, so each may receive according to what they have done in the body.

1429
03:50:11,669 --> 03:50:16,082
Second Corinthians 5:10, explains that it's about what they did or contracted in the body.

1430
03:50:16,082 --> 03:50:21,377
Indeed, they could neither do anything before having a body nor can they do anything after leaving the body.

1431
03:50:21,377 --> 03:50:25,250
There's no longer time for action, only for receiving according to their deeds.

1432
03:50:25,250 --> 03:50:34,320
Our faith must be certain that none of those to be punished with eternal damnation on the day of judgment carried any merit from this life that could free them from eternal destruction.

1433
03:50:34,320 --> 03:50:39,910
If any had prepared such merit in this life, they would not be handed over to eternal damnation by the just judge.

1434
03:50:39,910 --> 03:50:47,852
Whoever is to be punished with that damnation, without a doubt, carried such merit from here, ensuring by just judgment that they will never be absolved or freed.

1435
03:50:47,852 --> 03:50:56,138
To ensure that such damnation is both just and eternal, the reason is that there will be no further opportunity to correct the past, and no merit for future improvement.

1436
03:50:56,138 --> 03:51:01,629
There will be repentance for past evils and a desire for liberation and deliverance, but it will have no effect.

1437
03:51:01,629 --> 03:51:10,798
Where then is the mercy of God, who will neither be moved to forgive by such great and long repentance nor by the desires of the damned, or even by the groans of those asking for release?

1438
03:51:10,798 --> 03:51:13,200
How can He be just if He disregards these things?

1439
03:51:13,200 --> 03:51:17,319
How can He not look upon such pain of conscience and the affliction of His creature?

1440
03:51:17,319 --> 03:51:21,486
What, I ask, will be the reason that nothing healthy or acceptable can be done there?

1441
03:51:21,486 --> 03:51:25,016
If it could, it would never be rejected by such great mercy and justice.

1442
03:51:25,751 --> 03:51:26,906
Why is it not possible?

1443
03:51:26,906 --> 03:51:34,387
It's because, with God completely withdrawn from them, they lack the special grace through which the virtues of faith, hope, and charity are granted.

1444
03:51:34,387 --> 03:51:39,759
Without this grace, they cannot repent of the past with true piety or desire the future with genuine piety.

1445
03:51:39,759 --> 03:51:42,470
This means they cannot believe, hope, or love piously.

1446
03:51:42,470 --> 03:51:48,896
As mentioned, they are fundamentally separated from God and are preserved for eternal punishment solely by His omnipotent power.

1447
03:51:48,896 --> 03:51:51,908
Thus, they will never be able to partake in the Holy Spirit.

1448
03:51:51,908 --> 03:52:01,899
Even if they have some form of faith-whether from memories of things they heard or learned here, or from the terror and manifestation of present things-they cannot truly connect with the Holy Spirit.

1449
03:52:01,899 --> 03:52:06,568
This includes the revealed power and authority of God and Christ that will be evident to all.

1450
03:52:06,568 --> 03:52:12,844
It will be seen in the majesty of His judgment, the eternal reward of the righteous, and the eternal damnation of the wicked.

1451
03:52:12,844 --> 03:52:19,672
These truths will be undeniable, and while they will be known and acknowledged by all, they will only be worshipped out of sheer terror.

1452
03:52:19,672 --> 03:52:28,809
At that time, all creation will be perfectly subject to the Creator-either out of piety, as in holy angels and holy humans, or out of necessity, as in evil angels and impious humans.

1453
03:52:28,809 --> 03:52:37,445
This will fulfill what the Apostle recalls from the prophet: "As I live, says the Lord God, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will confess to God" (Romans 14:11).

1454
03:52:37,445 --> 03:53:04,857
In the same judgment, it will become clear what Scripture predicted about the wicked: "They will say among themselves, repenting and grieving with anguish of spirit: These are the ones we once held in derision and as a likeness of reproach.
We fools considered their lives madness, and their end without honor; how then are they counted among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints? Therefore, we strayed from the path of truth, and the light of righteousness did not shine for us, and the sun did not rise for us" (Wisdom 5:3-6).

1455
03:53:04,857 --> 03:53:07,819
They will say these and other sorrowful things on that day.

1456
03:53:08,471 --> 03:53:34,441
So, if from such immense divine power and the manifestation of Christ the Lord, combined with the fear of such a profound and evident eternal judge, there is any faith-whether from those who once believed or even from unbelievers compelled by such present majesty and terror-
then, in their lamentation, as we have already mentioned, they say:
"We have strayed from the path of truth, and the light of justice did not shine for us, and the sun did not rise for us"
(Wisdom of Solomon 5:6).

1457
03:53:34,441 --> 03:53:50,267
Yet, such faith in those who, as often said, are utterly abandoned by God and illuminated by none of His grace, will certainly not come from pious love but from the necessity of terror:
as the blessed Apostle James testifies is in demons, saying:
"Even the demons believe-and shudder"
(James 2:19).

1458
03:53:50,267 --> 03:54:00,836
Such faith, therefore, will not avail them for salvation but for confusion, as it is written in the psalm:
"Let them be ashamed and terrified forever; let them be disgraced and perish"
(Psalm 83:17).

1459
03:54:00,836 --> 03:54:17,193
There will be no hope left for them, condemned by the eternal sentence and completely despairing of their deliverance:
likewise, no love by which they might piously love God and their neighbor according to God, or in God, or for God, will be in them, since God Himself, who is love, will have abandoned them.

1460
03:54:17,193 --> 03:54:33,922
The grace of the Spirit, of which the Apostle says:
"God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us"
(Romans 5:5), will not be present with them, and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit will have departed from them.

1461
03:54:33,922 --> 03:54:55,006
For even if that rich man, already condemned in hell, seemed to love his brothers, whom he had left in the flesh, according to God, for whom he was anxiously striving and pleading that they might not come to that place of torment
(Luke 16:27), it was not truly according to God, since it was extorted from him not by divine love but either by the terror of present damnation or by human affection.

1462
03:54:55,271 --> 03:55:05,551
Without faith and charity, and lacking the hope that comes from God's illumination and the Holy Spirit's gift, there will be no true repentance for past actions, nor any desire for a better future.

1463
03:55:05,551 --> 03:55:13,169
This is because their actions won't stem from genuine piety and love for divine grace, but from the necessity brought by tribulation and distress.

1464
03:55:13,169 --> 03:55:25,640
Thus, with the light of divine illumination completely withdrawn, and excluded from the promised joy to the faithful servant, as the Lord says: "Enter into the joy of your Lord" (Matthew 25:21), they will remain alienated from God's light.

1465
03:55:25,640 --> 03:55:33,050
They will be sent into outer darkness, into that terrible night about which the Lord says: "Night is coming, when no one can work" (John 9:4).

1466
03:55:33,050 --> 03:55:39,102
And in another place, He mercifully warns: "Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you" (John 12:35).

1467
03:55:39,102 --> 03:55:48,338
In such darkness and night, they will no longer be able to do anything pious and fruitful that the just judge can accept, nor can they earn anything to escape eternal damnation.

1468
03:55:48,338 --> 03:55:53,921
Without pious repentance, there will be no forgiveness of sin; consequently, the punishment will never end.

1469
03:55:53,921 --> 03:56:00,235
Any memory of truth or happiness they have will be barely grasped by human sense, not as usually inspired by God's grace.

1470
03:56:00,235 --> 03:56:13,750
Then, indeed, the terrifying Scripture will be fulfilled: "Only distress will give understanding to the hearing" (Isaiah 28:19); and "Because neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge will be in the grave, where you are heading" (Ecclesiastes 9:10).

1471
03:56:13,750 --> 03:56:22,516
There will be no good work to earn merit, no reason to justly excuse or satisfy, no wisdom from the illumination of truth, no knowledge from the exercise of any virtue.

1472
03:56:22,516 --> 03:56:30,030
How then will they have knowledge and awareness of the truth, from which they will be eternally deprived of both illumination and contemplation?

1473
03:56:30,551 --> 03:56:38,636
How can they desire the same truth and happiness without the love of piety, which allows the truth to be truly loved and true happiness to be truly desired?

1474
03:56:38,636 --> 03:56:48,068
They might have some knowledge of the truth because they recognize themselves as deserving of such punishments, condemned by a just judgment, never to be freed from eternal judgment.

1475
03:56:48,068 --> 03:56:52,058
But all this serves them only as torment, not for the comfort of consolation.

1476
03:56:52,058 --> 03:56:58,381
Thus, they may desire a certain happiness, to be delivered from those torments, and to be refreshed by some peace or rest.

1477
03:56:58,381 --> 03:57:09,367
However, knowing and desiring the very truth of God, the very happiness of God, is a gift for the pious and those illuminated by God's spirit, not for the impious condemned by perpetual blindness and unhappiness.

1478
03:57:09,367 --> 03:57:19,680
Even if there were some who once believed and knew, and somewhat remembered the truth or happiness, it would only cause them more grief, more repentance, and a just recognition of their condemnation.

1479
03:57:19,680 --> 03:57:25,950
Indeed, they may desire time to amend their ways to escape punishment, but without the piety needed to merit God's favor.

1480
03:57:25,950 --> 03:57:35,175
Therefore, let those who are not illuminated by God and are alienated from the life of God stop claiming they are not miserable or damned by any sweetness of truth and happiness.

1481
03:57:35,175 --> 03:57:38,440
True and eternal misery is to be alienated from a blessed life.

1482
03:57:38,440 --> 03:57:44,607
No greater damnation exists than to be utterly excluded and repelled from God, with no hope or recourse to God anymore.

1483
03:57:44,607 --> 03:57:55,593
Hence, let every faithful person consider how vain and insane it is to claim that those who can never be blessed by God can be blessed by themselves, not by any grace of God, but by some supposed goods of nature.

1484
03:57:56,111 --> 03:58:02,556
Even if Almighty God leaves them in that state, it will be a testament to His goodness and a witness to their just condemnation.

1485
03:58:02,556 --> 03:58:08,648
This will help them realize the fairness of the judgment carried out on them and thus be condemned by their own judgment.

1486
03:58:08,648 --> 03:58:39,761
This unspeakably horrible damnation of the wicked and impious, without any consolation of divine mercy or illumination of truth, is briefly emphasized by Blessed Augustine, who warns us to avoid it at all costs, saying:
Moreover, when he explained the words of the psalm where it is said, "In hell, who will give you praise?" (Psalm 6:6), he acknowledged that in hell, the rich man, of whom the Lord says that he saw Lazarus at rest while he himself was in torment (Luke 16:23), confessed so much that he even wanted to warn his family to refrain from sins because of the punishments they do not believe exist in hell.

1487
03:58:39,761 --> 03:58:47,212
Even though his confession was in vain, those torments happened to him justly, since he also desired to teach his family to avoid falling into them.

1488
03:58:47,212 --> 03:58:50,887
What then does it mean: "In hell, who will give you praise?" (Psalm 6:6).

1489
03:58:50,887 --> 03:58:58,943
Does it mean that in hell, where the wicked will be thrown after judgment, they will see no light of God to confess anything to Him, due to the deeper darkness?

1490
03:58:58,943 --> 03:59:08,005
For this man, while still lifting his eyes, although through a huge chasm, could still see Lazarus at rest, from whose comparison he was compelled to acknowledge his own situation.

1491
03:59:08,005 --> 03:59:19,584
In these words of the holy doctor, it is perhaps not necessary to understand two hells, one where the souls of the damned are now cast down, and another where those same souls will be thrown after judgment along with their bodies.

1492
03:59:19,584 --> 03:59:28,949
But one and the same hell can be understood, now sometimes milder in the torments of souls; after judgment, however, more atrocious and horrible in the torments of both souls and bodies.

1493
03:59:29,351 --> 03:59:36,279
For our Lord seems to refer to both punishments of hell-the present age and the future-under the single name of Gehenna in the Gospels.

1494
03:59:36,279 --> 04:01:08,084
He speaks of the present punishment when He says:
"Fear him who, after he has killed, has the power to cast into Gehenna" Luke 12:5.
And of the future punishment when He says:
"But rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna" Matthew 10:28.
The holy Fathers of the Church frequently understood the same eternal fire to be inflicted upon the wicked both before and after judgment. But the aforementioned doctor signifies such a great difference between the two punishments that now, through certain visions and divinely arranged manifestations, the light of God can somewhat be felt there, by which the damned are at least driven to confess their crimes.
When they see some of the divine light, they have, from the respect of this granted vision, someone to whom they can confess. However, then, oppressed by greater and irreparable darkness, they will not deserve to see anything like that, by which they could be driven to any confession, so that it can be truly understood about them:
"For in death there is no remembrance of you; in hell who will confess to you?" Psalm 6:5.
Hence, the prophet Isaiah, foreseeing this irreparable damnation and warning most attentively that it should be foreseen and avoided, where there will be no place to find God, no grace to call upon Him:
"Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near" Isaiah 55:6.
He clearly shows that He cannot be found in that damnation anymore, nor can He be appeased by any invocation or supplication from the wretched damned, as if He were far off and completely alienated from them.
This one also adds and says: In the devil and wicked men, only the perversity of their own will is punished, not the nature, but the will that has sinned. Behold again something new and unheard of.

1495
04:01:08,135 --> 04:01:16,325
This person argues that in the devil and wicked people condemned to eternal destruction, it is not their nature that God punishes, but their perverse will.

1496
04:01:16,325 --> 04:01:20,287
According to this person, it is not their nature that sins, but their will.

1497
04:01:20,287 --> 04:01:28,635
However, the faith of the Church firmly holds that rational nature, whether in angels or humans, has both natural reason and a natural will inherent from God.

1498
04:01:28,635 --> 04:01:31,171
Nature, with its reason and will, is one entity.

1499
04:01:31,171 --> 04:01:34,975
This rational nature cannot exist without will, nor will without nature.

1500
04:01:34,975 --> 04:01:38,832
Therefore, whatever this nature wills, it is inseparable from its nature.

1501
04:01:38,832 --> 04:01:42,477
When this nature wills something, it does so entirely, not partially.

1502
04:01:42,477 --> 04:01:45,912
So, whether it is moved to do good, it acts with its entire will.

1503
04:01:45,912 --> 04:01:49,610
Conversely, if moved to do evil, it acts with its entire will as well.

1504
04:01:49,610 --> 04:01:52,939
Therefore, whether moved to good or evil, it is moved entirely.

1505
04:01:52,939 --> 04:01:54,999
When it is moved to good, it is virtue.

1506
04:01:54,999 --> 04:01:56,954
When it is moved to evil, it is vice.

1507
04:01:56,954 --> 04:02:03,717
Thus, by virtue, the whole nature becomes better when moved to good; by vice, the whole nature becomes worse when moved to evil.

1508
04:02:03,717 --> 04:02:07,574
It is not only the will that is improved by virtue, but the whole nature.

1509
04:02:07,574 --> 04:02:11,325
Nor is it only the will that is worsened by vice, but the whole nature.

1510
04:02:11,325 --> 04:02:14,706
By virtue, not only the will, but the whole nature becomes good.

1511
04:02:14,706 --> 04:02:24,163
Conversely, by vice, not only the will, but the whole nature becomes bad, not by losing the goodness of its substance, but by being corrupted and depraved by the vice of its will.

1512
04:02:24,163 --> 04:02:28,232
When this nature acts rightly, it acts entirely because it wills it entirely.

1513
04:02:28,232 --> 04:02:32,405
Similarly, when it acts wrongly, it acts entirely because it wills it entirely.

1514
04:02:32,405 --> 04:02:40,066
Therefore, it is just before God that the whole nature is glorified for good deeds, and conversely, the whole nature is condemned for evil deeds.

1515
04:02:40,066 --> 04:02:44,663
For if in wicked angels and wicked people it is not the nature that sins, but the will.

1516
04:02:45,719 --> 04:02:52,727
Therefore, in both holy angels and pious humans, it is not their nature that has done anything right or earned any good, but only their will.

1517
04:02:52,727 --> 04:03:04,904
And if, in the case of evil angels and wicked humans, it is not the whole nature but only the will that will be condemned, then likewise, in the case of holy angels and humans, it is not the whole nature but only the will that will be glorified.

1518
04:03:04,904 --> 04:03:15,390
But it is absolutely certain, and faith holds without doubt, that the entire nature of the holy angels is already blessed and glorified; similarly, the entire nature of holy humans will be blessed and glorified.

1519
04:03:15,390 --> 04:03:25,628
Therefore, conversely, it must be held without any doubt that in evil angels and wicked humans, it is not only their will but their entire nature that will be condemned, because the whole nature has sinned.

1520
04:03:25,628 --> 04:03:36,264
However, this person, against all faith and the truth of God, introduced such an argument to claim that angels and wicked humans are to be condemned only in their will so that his insane deception may have a place.

1521
04:03:36,264 --> 04:03:42,725
He says, as he already stated above, that in the eternal fire there will be no other punishment except the absence of blessedness.

1522
04:03:42,725 --> 04:03:52,615
Thus, according to this person's view, there will be no punishment inflicted externally on angelic or human nature because it did not sin; only the will will be punished internally in the conscience.

1523
04:03:52,615 --> 04:04:03,947
He asserts that only the will sinned, and it will be punished not by any torment of external punishment, but only by the absence of blessedness and the prohibition of its depraved desire, which it will not be allowed to fulfill.

1524
04:04:03,947 --> 04:04:06,332
All these ideas are contrary to faith and truth.

1525
04:04:06,332 --> 04:04:21,143
They favor the will of the devil by flattering humans so that they neither truly recognize that they have sinned, since their nature is defended as not having sinned, nor truly recognize that they are to be punished, since it is claimed that not their nature but only their will is to be condemned.

1526
04:04:21,143 --> 04:04:30,487
This is evident to all who care for their own salvation, who reject heretical fabrications and delusions far from themselves, and who faithfully follow the evangelical and apostolic truth.

1527
04:04:30,983 --> 04:05:00,617
To ensure that those who read our argument against this insane and impious definition are more reliably and firmly informed, we include the words of the blessed Augustine, who teaches about this matter very clearly and thoroughly, saying:
Shortly after, he says: We must be careful not to fall into that prophetic judgment where it is written: Woe to those who call what is good, evil, and what is evil, good; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter (Isaiah 5:20).

1528
04:05:00,617 --> 04:05:06,736
And yet the Lord says: An evil man brings evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart (Matthew 12:35).

1529
04:05:06,736 --> 04:05:10,759
But what is an evil man, if not an evil nature, since man is by nature?

1530
04:05:10,759 --> 04:05:16,538
Furthermore, if man is something good because he is by nature, what is an evil man, if not a bad good?

1531
04:05:16,538 --> 04:05:24,188
However, when we distinguish these two things, we find that a man is not evil because he is a man, nor is he good because he is wicked.

1532
04:05:24,188 --> 04:05:28,154
Rather, he is good because he is a man, and evil because he is wicked.

1533
04:05:28,154 --> 04:05:38,523
Therefore, whoever says it is bad to be a man or good to be wicked, falls into that prophetic judgment: Woe to those who call what is good, evil, and what is evil, good (Isaiah 5:20).

1534
04:05:38,523 --> 04:05:44,189
For such a person criticizes God's work, which is man, and praises man's fault, which is wickedness.

1535
04:05:44,189 --> 04:05:50,195
So every nature, even if it is flawed, is good as far as it is nature; as far as it is flawed, it is evil.

1536
04:05:50,195 --> 04:06:02,773
Behold, the venerable doctor does not say only the corrupted or flawed will of man is evil, but the flawed nature of man is evil: and he confirms that what is evil is nature; and he says that an evil man is an evil nature.

1537
04:06:02,773 --> 04:06:07,759
Thus, he says: He did not say that an evil man is only an evil will, but an evil nature.

1538
04:06:07,759 --> 04:06:12,802
Clearly, because when a man is evil, he is evil not only by will but by his whole nature.

1539
04:06:12,802 --> 04:06:24,361
Yet he faithfully teaches that we must distinguish, when we say an evil man, between God's work and the fault of the man himself; because evidently, to be a man is God's work, to be wicked is man's fault.

1540
04:06:24,361 --> 04:06:30,367
And thus nature, even if it is flawed, is good as far as it is nature; as far as it is flawed, it is evil.

1541
04:06:31,103 --> 04:06:41,537
In all these matters, he asserts that not only the will, but the very nature itself is good, insofar as it is nature; however, he also says that the very nature itself is bad, insofar as it is flawed.

1542
04:06:41,537 --> 04:06:56,926
This must be faithfully followed, understood in a Catholic manner, and firmly held, so that we know for certain that neither the will of the evil angel nor that of the evil man alone is bad when they sin; rather, their whole nature is bad and will suffer eternal punishment when they are damned.

1543
04:06:56,926 --> 04:07:02,612
He further adds: Neither did the general nature sin in the first man, but the individual will of each person.

1544
04:07:02,612 --> 04:07:06,941
If that nature had sinned, since it is one, the whole of it would certainly perish.

1545
04:07:06,941 --> 04:07:15,705
With these words, he tries to assert clearly that in other men, nature does not sin, only the will does; similarly, in the first man, nature did not sin, only the will.

1546
04:07:15,705 --> 04:07:26,243
Therefore, the nature of the human race in general did not sin in him because his nature did not sin; only the specific and individual will of each person sinned in him, meaning he sinned by will alone.

1547
04:07:26,243 --> 04:07:30,677
He asserts that if the whole nature of man had sinned, the whole would have perished.

1548
04:07:30,677 --> 04:07:35,424
But now, because only the will sinned, only the will is corrupted; nature remains unharmed.

1549
04:07:35,424 --> 04:07:38,919
What then shall we say to these elaborate and unheard-of fantasies?

1550
04:07:38,919 --> 04:08:02,185
Except that we oppose them with the testimonies of the Scriptures of God, by which we truly understand and faithfully hold that the whole nature in that man sinned, the whole perished, and the whole was transmitted to his descendants subject to sin and perdition:
As the Apostle clearly teaches, saying: "Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death, and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned" (Romans 5:12).

1551
04:08:02,185 --> 04:08:16,374
He does not say: "Through the will of one man sin entered into the world," but "through one man"; nor does he say: "and so it passed into the wills of all," but "so it passed into all men"; nor does he add: "in whom the wills of all sinned," but "in whom all have sinned."

1552
04:08:16,895 --> 04:08:21,278
Through one man, sin entered the world, affecting the entire nature of humanity.

1553
04:08:21,278 --> 04:08:35,194
Just as it was completely corrupted by sin in that man, it passed into all humans, completely corrupted by sin, so that from that origin, the entire sinful nature of all humans was derived; because in that one sinning man, the whole nature of all sinned.

1554
04:08:35,194 --> 04:08:39,906
Hence, as the Apostle says, all became, not by will, but by nature, children of wrath.

1555
04:08:39,906 --> 04:09:55,347
For he says:
"We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest" Ephesians 2:3.
Truly, all who are born from that corrupted root become by nature children of wrath, not as that nature was created by God, but as it was made through sinning.
From this perspective, the Psalmist says:
"Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me" Psalm 51:5.
Behold, a sinful nature conceived in iniquities, born in sins. This nature, entirely lost in Adam and passed on lost to his descendants, our Lord Jesus Christ came to seek and save-not partially, that is, only in will, but completely.
As he says:
"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost" Luke 19:10.
And because it was entirely lost, he came to save it entirely.
Therefore, he took on the whole of it, both the soul and the body of man, so that he might save it completely through his death and resurrection: justifying the soul from sins, and raising the body from the dead.
As the Apostle says:
"He was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification" Romans 4:25.
Therefore, whoever says that human nature was not entirely lost strives to nullify, as much as they can, the sacrament of the divine incarnation. For the Lord would have taken on the whole of it in vain through his incarnation, if the whole did not need salvation, if the whole did not need a savior.

1556
04:09:55,511 --> 04:10:05,534
It's amazing how he says that in the first man, each of our own wills committed sins that did not yet exist at all; and that the nature of all of us did not sin, which was indeed in him.

1557
04:10:05,534 --> 04:10:10,815
But he argues: if the entire nature of that man had sinned, the entire nature would indeed perish.

1558
04:10:10,815 --> 04:10:27,089
Therefore, according to his reasoning, if only the will in him sinned, then only the will perished; and if it perished, then it certainly needs to be liberated, saved, and reformed, so that it can be healthy and free through Him who says: "If the Son sets you free, you will be truly free" (John 8:36).

1559
04:10:27,089 --> 04:10:34,256
And how does he defend free will from the virtue of nature, and not from the gift of grace, in this entire, very vain dispute of his?

1560
04:10:34,256 --> 04:10:45,841
And if, according to him, only the will perished and the nature remained safe, then the Truth, God forbid, did not speak the truth when He said about Himself: "He made the whole man well on the Sabbath" (John 7:27).

1561
04:10:45,841 --> 04:10:53,709
He adds and says: Therefore, nature is punished in no way because it is from God and does not sin, but the voluntary lustful movement is punished.

1562
04:10:53,709 --> 04:10:59,528
And so, in the wicked, the punishments are not endured for what God made, but for what pride found wickedly.

1563
04:10:59,528 --> 04:11:05,456
The lust of a perverse will is tormented when it is not allowed to have what it wrongly or unworthily desires.

1564
04:11:05,456 --> 04:11:12,892
Therefore, what he says: Nature is not punished in any way because it is from God and does not sin, is doubly contrary to faith and truth.

1565
04:11:12,892 --> 04:11:19,898
Because both angelic and human nature, as shown above in many ways, is punished by the just judgment of God and eternal damnation.

1566
04:11:19,898 --> 04:11:34,662
Since evil cannot and should not go unpunished, it must be punished where it is found and by whom it is perpetrated, that is, in the very natures in which sins are committed and which are corrupted and depraved by sinning; and therefore, they are justly condemned for these.

1567
04:11:34,662 --> 04:11:43,015
And the angelic or human nature itself, although it is from God not by generation but by creation, not by birth but by origin, can indeed sin and does sin.

1568
04:11:43,607 --> 04:11:55,401
Both aspects are affirmed by the Catholic faith because it knows both to be true: nature is truly punished because of sin, and conversely, this person denies both, claiming neither that nature is punished nor that nature sins.

1569
04:11:55,401 --> 04:12:02,655
According to his assertion, no nature created by God is found that does not sin, just as the one nature begotten by God alone does not sin.

1570
04:12:02,655 --> 04:12:08,395
However, true faith firmly holds that every rational nature, both angelic and human, has the potential to sin.

1571
04:12:08,395 --> 04:12:13,457
This is evident in the rebellious angels and in humans who fell by transgressing the commandment.

1572
04:12:13,457 --> 04:12:20,606
But the same nature in the elect angels does not sin due to divine grace and goodness, making them good by nature and sustained by grace.

1573
04:12:20,606 --> 04:12:25,042
Only that nature, which is from God in such a way that it is what God is, cannot sin.

1574
04:12:25,042 --> 04:12:32,243
It is not created from nothing but begotten or proceeding from Him, which is undoubtedly the only begotten Son of God and the Holy Spirit.

1575
04:12:32,243 --> 04:12:39,236
Hence, this person who says no other nature does not sin attempts to equate the creature with the Creator, which is a clear blasphemy.

1576
04:12:39,236 --> 04:12:46,437
What else remains for him but to claim that the angelic or human spirit is of the same nature as God, as the impious ancient heretics did?

1577
04:12:46,437 --> 04:13:03,762
While they introduced two natures separately opposed to each other, one good which cannot be evil and the other evil which cannot be good, this person, in a new and unheard-of type of error, says in the same angelic or human spirit that nature does not sin, meaning it cannot be evil; and that the will sins, meaning it can be evil.

1578
04:13:03,762 --> 04:13:12,946
Therefore, when he said that nature neither sins nor is punished, to confirm that only the human will sins, he immediately added: but the voluntary lustful impulse is punished.

1579
04:13:12,946 --> 04:13:20,617
Repeating and emphasizing this, he added: In the wicked, punishment is not endured for what God has made, but for what pride has wickedly invented.

1580
04:13:21,191 --> 04:13:27,521
With these words, as mentioned earlier, he confirms that the nature of angels or wicked humans will never suffer punishment.

1581
04:13:27,521 --> 04:13:32,064
Rather, what a proud will has wrongfully committed should be punished in the will itself.

1582
04:13:32,064 --> 04:13:43,754
And as if we were to ask him what the future punishment of this corrupt will would be, he added, as if explaining: The desire of a perverse will is tormented when it is not allowed to have what it wrongly or undeservedly desires.

1583
04:13:43,754 --> 04:13:48,654
Behold, this is the kind of torment he predicts for the wicked will in angels and wicked humans.

1584
04:13:48,654 --> 04:13:55,954
That is, not eternal fire or any external punishment, but the torment of being oppressed and restrained from fulfilling their wrongful desires.

1585
04:13:55,954 --> 04:14:15,402
Thus, it is established that not only will the nature of wicked angels or humans never sin and never be punished, but also the will itself, which sins in them, will feel no punishment or suffering, except what all wicked people suffer in this life when they are not permitted to fulfill their wrongful desires, either due to divine judgment or some other necessity compelling them.

1586
04:14:15,402 --> 04:14:24,387
From this, it is clear that every punishment, every torment, every suffering of future damnation, which Almighty God so frequently and so terribly threatens, he utterly denies.

1587
04:14:24,387 --> 04:14:31,533
Therefore, as something contrary to our faith and an enemy of the truth, it should be repelled far from the ears and hearts of the faithful.

1588
04:14:31,533 --> 04:14:36,842
To these great and important matters, he adds a very brief definition and says: Evil comes from no good.

1589
04:14:36,842 --> 04:14:41,691
To understand this vigilantly, it must first be considered that something good can become evil.

1590
04:14:41,691 --> 04:14:48,787
Just as the nature of angels or humans is certainly good in its own way and in its own kind, this good nature can become evil through vice.

1591
04:14:48,787 --> 04:14:54,198
Therefore, insofar as it is nature, it remains good, and insofar as it is corrupted, it begins to be evil.

1592
04:14:54,198 --> 04:15:03,539
Thus, it is not doubted that good can become evil, but for this to happen, that is, for good to begin to be evil, there is no preceding cause from which this could consequently occur.

1593
04:15:04,151 --> 04:15:11,254
For example, if we ask what makes something in nature good, we find that the highest good is God, and all good comes from this highest good.

1594
04:15:11,254 --> 04:15:16,987
If we ask why someone is wise and just, we similarly find that the highest wisdom and the highest justice is God.

1595
04:15:16,987 --> 04:15:23,785
Therefore, He is the highest and most certain cause of why anyone who is truly wise is wise, and why anyone who is truly just is just.

1596
04:15:23,785 --> 04:15:30,229
So, for someone to be good, wise, and just, the preceding and efficient cause is the highest wisdom and highest justice itself.

1597
04:15:30,229 --> 04:15:47,732
But can we say in the same way, if asked why evil begins in something good, that there is a highest evil beyond all angelic or human nature, and that from this highest evil comes everything evil in these creatures, such that a bad angel and a bad man have a preceding and efficient cause of their wickedness, by which they become evil from good?

1598
04:15:47,732 --> 04:15:50,979
Even an angel, like a man, was indeed good and began to be evil.

1599
04:15:50,979 --> 04:15:53,972
So where did he get the preceding cause that made him evil?

1600
04:15:53,972 --> 04:15:57,016
Could a good God be the cause by which an angel became evil?

1601
04:15:57,016 --> 04:16:00,770
Absolutely not, because the supremely good could not be the cause of evil.

1602
04:16:00,770 --> 04:16:07,112
Similarly, it is absurd to say there is a highest evil, and that it is the preceding cause by which a good angel became evil.

1603
04:16:07,112 --> 04:16:15,280
If we say this, we clearly introduce two principles contrary to the truth of faith: that just as there is a principle of good, there is also a principle of evil.

1604
04:16:15,280 --> 04:16:22,434
But this is absurd because there is no nature of evil at all, nor does it exist substantially, so that it could be the principle of anything.

1605
04:16:22,434 --> 04:16:28,826
Rather, evil is called a deficiency of good, just as darkness is a deficiency of light, and illness is a deficiency of health.

1606
04:16:28,826 --> 04:16:34,863
Therefore, this deficiency of good, which is called evil, how did it come to be in the devil, who was the first to sin?

1607
04:16:34,863 --> 04:16:42,321
It did not come from God, because God is not the author of evil; it did not come from any substance of evil, because there is no substance of evil.

1608
04:16:43,031 --> 04:16:49,355
If someone says that this change from good to evil was done by his own will, we must ask whether that will was good or evil.

1609
04:16:49,355 --> 04:16:52,262
If it was good, how could a good will cause an evil will?

1610
04:16:52,262 --> 04:16:55,679
But if an evil will caused this change, who created that evil will?

1611
04:16:55,679 --> 04:17:03,328
Since it's impossible to find an answer, we must admit that there was no preceding cause that created the evil will by which a good angel became evil.

1612
04:17:03,328 --> 04:17:07,357
Instead, the cause is a deficiency because a deficiency of good is called evil.

1613
04:17:07,357 --> 04:17:15,312
Similarly, in a sinning human, just as a good person became evil, neither God's will nor the nature of evil-which clearly does not exist-could be the cause.

1614
04:17:15,312 --> 04:17:20,310
Nor could the person's own good will be the cause of evil, nor could his evil will have a creator.

1615
04:17:20,310 --> 04:17:28,061
If it is said that the devil's evil will made the human's will evil, just as he could have given in to the evil suggestion, he could have also resisted.

1616
04:17:28,061 --> 04:17:38,108
Since both options were in his power, no one pushed him, no one forced him, and no one could prevail by persuasion, except because he fell by his own voluntary deficiency and became evil from good.

1617
04:17:38,108 --> 04:17:43,921
This also applies to other people; hence, it is clear that the good itself, that is, the good nature, is from God.

1618
04:17:43,921 --> 04:17:51,418
However, when this good nature is corrupted by vice and becomes evil, it comes from nothing, because it has no efficient cause but a deficient one.

1619
04:17:51,418 --> 04:18:01,464
Therefore, this whole matter is rightly understood and said about rational angelic or human nature, so that in them, it is understood that the good nature itself becomes or is evil from no creator.

1620
04:18:01,464 --> 04:18:09,012
As frequently said, the evil in rational creatures neither comes from God nor from any evil creator but started from their own deficiency from good.

1621
04:18:09,623 --> 04:18:14,894
This person claims that neither angelic nor human nature commits sin, but only the will of that nature.

1622
04:18:14,894 --> 04:18:21,955
It seems they've made this distinction to show that the will's goodness can turn evil while defending the nature itself as free from evil.

1623
04:18:21,955 --> 04:18:30,245
Since the nature couldn't be the author of evil to its own will, which changed from good to evil, it suggests that for good to become evil, it comes from nothing.

1624
04:18:30,245 --> 04:18:34,799
Evil doesn't have an efficient cause from any author; rather, it is a deficiency of good.

1625
04:18:34,799 --> 04:18:43,446
This implies that evil originates from no good, because the good of angelic or human will, when turning evil, wasn't produced by their nature, thus it remains blameless.

1626
04:18:43,446 --> 04:18:48,359
Essentially, for the good of its will to become evil, it was made from nothing, not from itself.

1627
04:18:48,359 --> 04:19:26,428
However, he misinterpreted this argument from the words of Saint Augustine in "The City of God."
What Augustine argued for the edification of faith and against heretics, especially the Manichaeans, this person has twisted against the faith itself.
In everything, he uses Augustine's subtle arguments meant to confirm piety and repurposes them to support his error.
He also states that one who, with the free will of choice-a gift of natural intelligence-turns it to disgrace, justly loses the honor of truth and cannot avoid the darkness of eternal ignorance.
Here, he is not talking about angelic or human nature itself, nor its will, but rather its intelligence.
In the rational mind, three things are considered: being, knowing, and willing.

1628
04:19:26,735 --> 04:19:32,155
And now, it seems we have sufficiently discussed two things: being and willing, both in their own natures.

1629
04:19:32,155 --> 04:19:35,376
Now let us also consider knowing, that is, intelligence itself.

1630
04:19:35,376 --> 04:19:48,310
With nature preserved and free from all punishments, according to his understanding, not only the will of this nature but also the intelligence in future damnation is understood to be punished, not with any external torment, but only with an inner loss.

1631
04:19:48,310 --> 04:20:01,245
He explains that whoever, by free will, has misused the gift of natural intelligence-which should have been used for seeking, finding, and contemplating the truth-by focusing on vain, useless, or harmful things, will face punishment in future damnation.

1632
04:20:01,245 --> 04:20:06,920
The free will of man, which has misused intelligence here, will be punished by not enjoying the light of truth.

1633
04:20:06,920 --> 04:20:11,675
It will justly lose the good of intelligence and fall into the darkness of eternal ignorance.

1634
04:20:11,675 --> 04:20:24,661
If this is the case, it is indeed a great punishment for human will: that which has misused intelligence in this life, in future damnation, will lose the good of intelligence, will not enjoy any light of truth, and will be condemned to eternal ignorance.

1635
04:20:24,661 --> 04:20:34,579
This punishment of the perverse human will, losing the light of intelligence, will be so severe that it justly seems to be lost, and in its place, the darkness of eternal ignorance will prevail.

1636
04:20:34,579 --> 04:20:40,816
This punishment of the human mind in future damnation is not rejected by us, because, as we read in the Gospel of Matthew.

1637
04:20:40,816 --> 04:20:40,867
.

1638
04:20:40,867 --> 04:20:40,918
.

1639
04:20:41,327 --> 04:20:59,458
When the useless servant is condemned for not using the single talent of intelligence he received effectively, and by using it, doubling it:
but instead, tied it in a napkin or hid it in the ground, meaning he lived delicately and immersed himself in earthly cares, rendering it unfruitful:
when, I say, that useless servant is condemned, as the Gospel truth reveals.

1640
04:20:59,458 --> 04:21:09,782
First, it will be said: Take the talent away from him (Matthew 25:28);
and then it will be added: And throw the useless servant into outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30).

1641
04:21:09,782 --> 04:21:22,627
Hence, no punishment should be feared by a faithful person more than this: being stripped of the light of God's intelligence and thrown into outer darkness, where for those damned with eternal blindness, there will be no illumination or contemplation of truth.

1642
04:21:22,627 --> 04:21:33,841
Since these things are so, how could he promise the knowledge and wisdom of that same happiness and truth to those who are to face such severe damnation of eternal blindness, always suffering the absence of truth and happiness?

1643
04:21:33,841 --> 04:21:45,450
Because of this knowledge, he asserted that the miserable would not be miserable and the damned would not be damned;
therefore, let him hold on to what he said truthfully here, and discard what he placed there unnecessarily and vainly.

1644
04:21:45,647 --> 04:21:51,599
Chapter Seventeen
In the seventeenth chapter, he provides seven definitions in this way:

1645
04:21:51,599 --> 04:21:55,094
1. God is not the author, maker, or predestinator of punishments. 2.

1646
04:21:55,094 --> 04:22:00,542
God's predestination is only for things that are good, but His foreknowledge applies to both good and bad.

1647
04:22:00,542 --> 04:22:03,677
This difference is not by nature, but by the use of language.

1648
04:22:03,677 --> 04:22:03,780
3.

1649
04:22:03,780 --> 04:22:15,138
Just as it is said that God is present everywhere by the power of His presence, but not everywhere by the grace of His dwelling, it can be said that He is everywhere by foreknowledge, but not everywhere by predestination.

1650
04:22:15,138 --> 04:22:24,903
As the truth clearly proclaims about God: wherever God is by presence, He will certainly be by dwelling; similarly, wherever He is by foreknowledge, He will necessarily be by predestination.

1651
04:22:24,903 --> 04:22:25,006
4.

1652
04:22:25,006 --> 04:22:33,949
And, just as God's presence and dwelling are only in those things which are made by Him, so His foreknowledge and predestination are only of those things which He would make.

1653
04:22:33,949 --> 04:22:45,718
Just as His presence and dwelling are not in those things which are neither made by Him nor created by Him, so His foreknowledge and predestination are not in those things which He neither made nor gave, because they are nothing.

1654
04:22:45,718 --> 04:22:45,821
5.

1655
04:22:45,821 --> 04:22:49,470
The eternal fire was made to burn the devil and his angels, not humans.

1656
04:22:49,470 --> 04:22:57,744
After he was cast down from the ether, where in his ethereal body he could not feel punishment, an aerial body was added to him, in which he would feel the fire.

1657
04:22:57,744 --> 04:22:57,847
6.

1658
04:22:57,847 --> 04:23:02,113
That fire is not a punishment, nor was it prepared or predestined for this purpose.

1659
04:23:02,113 --> 04:23:05,556
But it was predestined to exist in the universe of all good things.

1660
04:23:05,556 --> 04:23:10,901
It was made the seat of the impious, where without a doubt both the blessed and the wretched will dwell.

1661
04:23:10,901 --> 04:23:11,004
7.

1662
04:23:11,004 --> 04:23:15,167
There is no misery except eternal death; eternal death is the ignorance of truth.

1663
04:23:15,167 --> 04:23:17,891
And there is no misery except the ignorance of truth.

1664
04:23:17,891 --> 04:23:20,204
Where the truth is unknown, there is no life.

1665
04:23:20,204 --> 04:23:28,684
Therefore, what he first stated, that God is not the author, maker, or predestinator of punishments, is clearly against the faith, as we have frequently shown above.

1666
04:23:29,711 --> 04:23:35,262
For those punished with eternal damnation-whether the devil, his angels, or wicked people-it's not unjust.

1667
04:23:35,262 --> 04:23:39,765
Each one is tormented according to their own deeds and the extent of their wickedness.

1668
04:23:39,765 --> 04:23:47,148
This fulfills what is written in the psalm about the just and eternal judge: "He will repay each one according to their deeds" (Psalm 62:12).

1669
04:23:47,148 --> 04:23:55,892
The fire of hell is one, but it torments each person differently, just as the sun's heat is one but is felt differently by each person depending on their constitution.

1670
04:23:55,892 --> 04:24:03,694
The punishments never end because it is just in God's sight that those who never wanted to end their sins should never have an end to their torments.

1671
04:24:03,694 --> 04:24:11,286
Those who did not want to submit to God in piety will be subjected to Him out of necessity, ensuring no creature remains contrary to its Creator.

1672
04:24:11,286 --> 04:24:21,183
Those who rejected the truth and believed in iniquity will be coerced by iniquity and unable to deny the clear truth of divine judgment, divine majesty, and the power of God and His Christ.

1673
04:24:21,183 --> 04:24:26,785
Even the wicked, who have always been strangers to the worship of God, will be forced to confess the truth.

1674
04:24:26,785 --> 04:24:36,629
They will lament and repent too late, saying: "So we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness did not shine on us, and the sun did not rise upon us" (Wisdom 5:6).

1675
04:24:36,629 --> 04:24:45,897
Thus, when God threatens dreadful and eternal punishments through His prophets, He often adds at the end of His threats: "And they shall know that I am the Lord" (Exodus 29:46).

1676
04:24:45,897 --> 04:24:53,699
This means they will admit, out of necessity and to their shame, what they never wanted to acknowledge out of piety and devotion for their salvation.

1677
04:24:53,699 --> 04:25:06,423
Even the devil, the author and instigator of all wickedness, along with his unclean and damned angels, will come to the end of his tyranny, which he has continuously exercised against God and the salvation of the human race from the beginning.

1678
04:25:06,423 --> 04:25:10,507
As it is written: "He will be thrown down before the eyes of all" (Job 40:28).

1679
04:25:11,135 --> 04:25:17,263
Because of all these things, and other secrets known only to God, the holy Scriptures also refer to hell as useful.

1680
04:25:17,263 --> 04:25:23,337
Just as the punishment by human laws serves to maintain peace by deterring the guilty, hell has a similar purpose.

1681
04:25:23,337 --> 04:25:29,304
For the Scripture says, when speaking of a bad tongue: "And hell is more useful than it" (Ecclesiasticus 28:25).

1682
04:25:29,304 --> 04:25:35,858
Since the eternal punishments of angels and damned humans are so just and orderly, why shouldn't God be the author of them?

1683
04:25:35,858 --> 04:25:40,547
Not that He causes such evils, but He is the just organizer and judge of these torments.

1684
04:25:40,547 --> 04:25:58,876
How is He not the author of these punishments, considering it is clearly stated in the Gospel: "Who can destroy both soul and body in hell" (Luke 12:5); and: "Who, after He has killed, has the power to cast into hell" (Matthew 10:28); and who will say in the judgment itself: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire" (Matthew 25:41).

1685
04:25:58,876 --> 04:26:04,950
If those punishments and the place of torments exist somewhere in creation, who else could be their maker but God?

1686
04:26:04,950 --> 04:26:10,171
Scripture clearly states: "He who lives forever created all things at once" (Ecclesiasticus 18:1).

1687
04:26:10,171 --> 04:26:16,405
Indeed, that eternal fire is a created thing and is not co-eternal with God; it was created for just and proper uses.

1688
04:26:16,405 --> 04:26:28,180
Anyone who claims that this or any other creation is not from God, the sole author of all, but from some other unknown source, is clearly engaging in heretical impiety, whether of the Manichaeans or other wicked heretics.

1689
04:26:28,180 --> 04:26:43,579
Therefore, since that eternal fire is truly a part of creation, it undoubtedly has the same author as all other creatures; about whom it is also written: "For in six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day" (Exodus 20:11).

1690
04:26:44,111 --> 04:26:52,406
Let this person say where he thinks hell is located, the place of eternal torment-whether in the sky, on the earth, in the sea, or among other things in them.

1691
04:26:52,406 --> 04:26:55,346
Wherever he thinks it is, it must have been made by Him.

1692
04:26:55,346 --> 04:26:58,706
He who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.

1693
04:26:58,706 --> 04:27:10,465
Given these points, why shouldn't the omnipotent God, who is the author and creator of all things, be rightly and truly understood, or even believed to be the predestinator of both the righteous and the ordained punishments?

1694
04:27:10,465 --> 04:27:19,652
Although to those suffering and enduring those punishments they may seem bad, to that eternal judge they are not bad because they are just, and nothing just can be called bad.

1695
04:27:19,652 --> 04:27:33,774
Therefore, He both predestined and prepared that eternal fire, of which Truth itself says:
Which is prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41);
and of which Solomon says:
Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and blows for the backs of fools (Proverbs 19:29).

1696
04:27:33,774 --> 04:27:52,568
If these punishments for the impious and unjust were not predestined by the just God as judge, how is it said about them, still future and yet to come, through blessed John in the Apocalypse:
And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Revelation 20:10);
and again:
And the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever (Revelation 14:11).

1697
04:27:52,568 --> 04:27:59,603
How does blessed Peter also say about certain evil people:
For whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved (Second Peter 2:17).

1698
04:27:59,603 --> 04:28:06,060
And blessed Jude the apostle similarly says about them:
For whom the storm of darkness has been reserved forever (Jude 13).

1699
04:28:06,060 --> 04:28:14,932
Surely, we all unanimously confess that God predestined all things that He would make, and undoubtedly no one but Him could make such great, just, and eternal judgments.

1700
04:28:14,932 --> 04:28:25,275
Therefore, if they pertain to His works and cannot be made by anyone else, it is certain and should not be doubted at all that they have Him as their predestinator, who is their author and creator.

1701
04:28:25,799 --> 04:28:39,927
If someone says that God is not the author or creator of punishments because punishment, like evil, sin, or death, does not have substance or nature to exist on its own, and therefore could not have been predestined by God, we must firmly contradict them with the evident truth.

1702
04:28:39,927 --> 04:29:46,197
Clearly, the word "punishment" does not represent any subsistent thing or nature, unlike words such as Heaven, earth, or sea.
These words immediately denote specific natures of things.
Although the word "punishment" does not signify something that exists by itself, it does represent a significant evil acted upon by existing natures.
So, even though it has no substance of its own, it signifies something brought about through existing things and substances, just as the word "death" signifies no substance of its own because it cannot exist by itself.
Yet, "death" signifies and is understood as a severe evil known in the separation of soul and body.
Thus, almighty God did not predestine punishment to exist in its own nature, but He did predestine it in the natures and substances that truly exist, to which such a great evil, signified and understood by that name, is truly and substantially exhibited.
After this, he says: God's predestination is only for things that are good, but His foreknowledge is for both good and evil.
This difference does not arise from the nature of things, but from the manner of speaking.
We hold and embrace this difference between God's foreknowledge and predestination, because, as the holy Fathers have handed it down and the truth itself demonstrates, it is true.

1703
04:29:46,247 --> 04:29:51,595
God, who knows all future events, has eternally foreseen everything that is to come, both good and bad.

1704
04:29:51,595 --> 04:29:58,397
However, He predestined only the good things that He Himself would bring about, through either His free mercy or His just judgment.

1705
04:29:58,397 --> 04:30:10,391
Therefore, it is most accurate to understand God's foreknowledge in both good and bad things, but predestination only in the good and just things, which He not only foresaw but also determined, defined, and decreed to come to pass.

1706
04:30:10,391 --> 04:30:31,990
This person mentions this difference to argue that God could foresee bad things but could not predestine them, not understanding the distinction of evil that we have already pointed out; namely, that one kind of evil is contrary to good, which is indeed a vice and does not have God as its author, and another kind of evil is contrary to peace, rest, or health, which never happens except by God's will and judgment.

1707
04:30:31,990 --> 04:31:36,944
As He speaks through the prophet:
I am the Lord, who makes peace and creates evil" Isaiah forty-five, verse seven.
Hence, it is also said by another prophet:
"Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord has not done it?" Amos three, verse six.
And again:
"Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, are from God" Ecclesiasticus eleven, verse fourteen.
Therefore, regarding the evil that is understood as vice or sin, God is not the predestinator, because He is not its author;
but regarding the evil that is understood as affliction, torment, and punishment, whether temporal or eternal, since these, as Scripture teaches, are from Him and arranged and inflicted by His judgment, He is clearly both the author and the predestinator, because He both foresaw them as future and justly predestined them to be done.
Given these things, bringing up this difference did nothing but deny the truth and demonstrate ignorance.
As for what he said: that this difference in divine foreknowledge and predestination is not from nature but from the use of expressions, it seems better and more true to us that it is from nature and according to nature; because even in God's nature:
"There is no variation or shadow due to change" James one, verse seventeen.

1708
04:31:37,151 --> 04:31:41,771
So, for Him, knowing is one thing, foreknowing is another, and predestining is yet another.

1709
04:31:41,771 --> 04:31:49,488
His one, simple, and eternal knowledge contains everything at once and equally, which in temporal matters is acted upon and exhibited in different ways.

1710
04:31:49,488 --> 04:31:58,474
However, since God's foreknowledge and predestination truly relate to the state and disposition of His creatures, they do not differ in God's eternal and unchangeable knowledge.

1711
04:31:58,474 --> 04:32:04,008
Everything there is one and simple knowledge, neither varied by times nor changed by the diversity of things.

1712
04:32:04,008 --> 04:32:06,851
Yet, there is a difference in temporally passing things.

1713
04:32:06,851 --> 04:32:16,649
Some things are present or past, where human understanding properly recognizes knowledge, and other things are future, to which it properly understands foreknowledge or predestination to apply.

1714
04:32:16,649 --> 04:32:23,604
And because in those future things there occurs another diversity, so that some are good, and others are evil, another difference occurs.

1715
04:32:23,604 --> 04:32:29,341
Predestination is recognized in good things only, while foreknowledge is understood in both good and evil things.

1716
04:32:29,341 --> 04:32:44,064
Thus, this difference between foreknowledge and predestination, although it does not arise from the nature or according to the nature of the unchangeable deity, is nevertheless recognized from the nature and according to the nature of administering and disposing of the changeable creature.

1717
04:32:44,064 --> 04:32:48,988
We have also spoken more fully about this matter above, in the second chapter of this discussion.

1718
04:32:48,988 --> 04:32:59,345
Therefore, we in no way allow these things, which are so rightly and truly distinguished by their properties and handed down to us by the Fathers, to be disturbed and confused by anyone's new presumption.

1719
04:32:59,345 --> 04:33:07,468
So, when someone indiscriminately and confusedly presumes to say, as this person does, that all foreknowledge is predestination, it is most clearly blasphemous.

1720
04:33:07,468 --> 04:33:12,341
While God can foreknow even evil things, it would be said, God forbid, that He predestined them.

1721
04:33:12,341 --> 04:33:18,180
Although predestination, because it is not without foreknowledge, cannot absurdly be said to include foreknowledge.

1722
04:33:18,839 --> 04:33:28,768
However, he argues that this distinction comes not from the truth and nature of things, but only from the usage of our language, and he provides an example that contradicts his own statement.

1723
04:33:28,768 --> 04:33:41,192
He says: Just as it is said that God can be present everywhere by the power of His presence, but not everywhere by the grace of His habitation, so it can be said that He is everywhere by foreknowledge, but not everywhere by predestination.

1724
04:33:41,192 --> 04:33:46,390
Yet, the truth clearly states about God: wherever He is present, He is indeed present by habitation.

1725
04:33:46,390 --> 04:33:50,809
Similarly, wherever there is foreknowledge, there must necessarily be predestination.

1726
04:33:50,809 --> 04:34:05,884
He asserts that this religious phrasing of ecclesiastical discipline, which helps us distinguish and say that God is everywhere by the presence of His majesty, but not everywhere by the presence of His habitation, is not from the nature of things, but only from the usage of human language.

1727
04:34:05,884 --> 04:34:17,528
This undermines the most beneficial sense of the entire Holy Scripture, where the almighty God is presented to us as being generally everywhere by the presence of His majesty, but specifically by the grace of His habitation.

1728
04:34:17,528 --> 04:35:08,160
Regarding His general presence of majesty, He Himself says: "I fill heaven and earth."
And the Prophet says to Him: "If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I descend to hell, You are present: if I take the wings of the dawn and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will hold me"
Psalm 139:8-10.
But regarding the grace of His habitation, which is not everywhere but in His temple, that is, in the holy and rational creature, angelic or human, which alone is capable of His knowledge and intelligence, illumination, and grace; sometimes signified by the heavens, through which the heavenly life of angels or holy humans is understood; sometimes by the specific mention of His temple.
Scripture speaks in this way: "He who sits in the heavens shall laugh"
Psalm 2:4.
And: "To You, I lift up my eyes, You who sit in the heavens"
Psalm 123:1.
And: "Look down from Your holy habitation, from heaven"
Deuteronomy 26:15.

1729
04:35:08,471 --> 04:35:10,728
Our Father, who is in heaven. Matthew 6:9.

1730
04:35:10,728 --> 04:35:16,851
And what the Apostle said:
Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Holy Spirit dwells in you?

1731
04:35:16,851 --> 04:35:18,087
First Corinthians 3:16.

1732
04:35:18,087 --> 04:35:27,112
And again:
For you are the temple of the living God, as God says,
because I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.

1733
04:35:27,112 --> 04:35:29,314
Second Corinthians 6:16; Leviticus 26:12.

1734
04:35:29,314 --> 04:35:54,937
Since there is such a great distance and difference between the presence of divine majesty, which is generally and potentially shown to all creation,
and the grace of habitation, which is specially and mercifully granted only to rational and chosen creatures who can comprehend its influence, understanding, and sweetness:
Why does he try so recklessly to nullify this divine sense, so necessary for our faith and salvation, to the extent that he says the very truth cries out?

1735
04:35:54,937 --> 04:35:57,892
That wherever God is present, He is also in habitation?

1736
04:35:57,892 --> 04:36:10,086
On the contrary, this truth of God's Scripture always carefully discerns and distinguishes that the habitation of God is only in His temple, either heavenly or still placed on earth, commended through the goodness of His grace.

1737
04:36:10,086 --> 04:36:31,197
It is indeed said that He sometimes inhabits a temple made by hands and consecrated with religious devotion to His name,
because of the grace of that consecration, and the more familiar worship of His majesty, and the more renowned effect of supplication and hearing:
As the Lord Himself shows in the Gospel, saying:
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it, and by Him who dwells in it.

1738
04:36:31,197 --> 04:36:31,949
Matthew 23:21.

1739
04:36:31,949 --> 04:36:37,213
And yet the Scripture clearly says:
Because the Most High does not dwell in temples made by hands.

1740
04:36:37,213 --> 04:36:37,751
Acts 7:48.

1741
04:36:37,751 --> 04:36:48,279
Hence Solomon also says in his prayer about the temple which he built and consecrated for Him:
If heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built?

1742
04:36:48,279 --> 04:36:49,461
Second Chronicles 2:6.

1743
04:36:50,159 --> 04:37:00,651
Thus, we understand that in a temple built by human hands, dedicated and consecrated to His name, God can be said to dwell by a certain grace of favor and through the sanctification of heavenly sacraments.

1744
04:37:00,651 --> 04:37:08,123
However, He does not dwell there by the immensity of majesty and the abundance of grace that He bestows only on the chosen and rational creatures.

1745
04:37:08,123 --> 04:37:39,496
A certain holy and glorious martyr said about Him: "The whole world is His temple." If by this he meant the entire world, consisting of heaven and earth, it is understood correctly. This is because God can be worshiped everywhere in the world, adored everywhere. True worshipers no longer worship in Jerusalem with the Jews, nor on that mountain with the Samaritans, but worship the Father everywhere in spirit and in truth. (John 4:3)
However, if he meant that the whole world is His temple in the sense that Scripture often refers to the entire human race, it is clear that the whole world is the temple of God.

1746
04:37:39,496 --> 04:37:44,870
Specifically, those who, from the entire human race, are converted and gathered to God become His temple.

1747
04:37:44,870 --> 04:38:24,227
Hence, the same blessed martyr, after saying "The whole world is His temple," added, "He must be dedicated in our mind, consecrated in our heart."
Therefore, from the truth and nature of things, Almighty God is said to be everywhere by the presence of majesty, but not everywhere by the grace of inhabitation. He exhibits the presence of majesty to all creation generally and grants the grace of His inhabitation only to the chosen rational creatures.
But what does it mean to say: Of God, there is foreknowledge everywhere, but not predestination everywhere; and wherever there is foreknowledge, there will necessarily be predestination? Who has ever spoken in such a way as to say that God is everywhere by foreknowledge? Since His foreknowledge is known only to Him.

1748
04:38:24,431 --> 04:38:29,443
Why say that He is everywhere by predestination, when His predestination is only known to Himself?

1749
04:38:29,443 --> 04:38:35,017
Similarly, it is foolish to claim: Wherever there is foreknowledge, there must necessarily be predestination.

1750
04:38:35,017 --> 04:38:39,824
No one says this; as some of the ancient Fathers have noted, it is merely a novelty of speech.

1751
04:38:39,824 --> 04:38:46,370
We say that God is everywhere in majesty, power, and virtue because all of this-majesty, power, virtue-is He, who is everywhere.

1752
04:38:46,370 --> 04:38:51,024
However, it is unnecessary to say that He is everywhere by foreknowledge or predestination.

1753
04:38:51,024 --> 04:38:54,399
Nowhere is it written that God is foreknowledge or predestination.

1754
04:38:54,399 --> 04:39:05,138
Therefore, the statement that God's foreknowledge and predestination apply only to the things He would do is clearly false, because His foreknowledge can also apply to evil things, which He was not going to do.

1755
04:39:05,138 --> 04:39:11,582
Moreover, the claim that His foreknowledge and habitation are in things neither from Him nor made by Him is similarly foolish.

1756
04:39:11,582 --> 04:39:13,013
Where has he ever read this?

1757
04:39:13,013 --> 04:39:19,610
Where has he heard from the faithful that God is said to have presence and habitation in things neither from Him nor made by Him?

1758
04:39:19,610 --> 04:39:23,701
What are these things which, as he writes, are neither from Him nor made by Him?

1759
04:39:23,701 --> 04:39:28,406
If such things exist, then there is some creature which is neither from God nor made by God.

1760
04:39:28,406 --> 04:39:36,384
This is not Christian but Manichaean because the Gospel cannot lie, where it is written: All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made.

1761
04:39:36,384 --> 04:39:36,844
John 1:3.

1762
04:39:36,844 --> 04:39:45,487
It is also similar to what he immediately added: The foreknowledge and predestination of God are pronounced in opposition to those things which He neither made nor gave.

1763
04:39:45,487 --> 04:39:52,032
He says it is pronounced in opposition, so according to his own new and insane rule, what is pronounced is not truly pronounced.

1764
04:39:52,799 --> 04:39:59,725
Therefore, it is a lie to claim that eternal punishment is nothing and has not happened; such a claim contradicts the truth on both counts.

1765
04:39:59,725 --> 04:40:05,007
These future events were truly foreseen by God and will truly be inflicted by God on those who deserve it.

1766
04:40:05,007 --> 04:40:16,118
Since these things are so clearly found in the Scriptures as having been done, foreseen, and predestined, let such a rule be crushed and perish, which insanely affirms that deeds should be understood as not having happened.

1767
04:40:16,118 --> 04:40:21,151
He further added, saying: The eternal fire was made for burning the devil and his angels, not humans.

1768
04:40:21,151 --> 04:40:30,668
This is what this person and others perhaps seeking or affirming seem to say; that is, that this eternal fire was not prepared for human punishment but only for the punishment of evil angels.

1769
04:40:30,668 --> 04:40:40,135
The Lord did not say in that judgment to those who will be on his left: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for you, but rather, prepared for the devil and his angels.

1770
04:40:40,135 --> 04:40:45,765
So from this, it appears to be prepared only for evil spirits, that is, the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41).

1771
04:40:45,765 --> 04:41:01,560
Hence, it is understood that some have held the opinion that one fire now tortures the souls of the damned in the underworld, and another eternal fire will be entered by humans only then, when, resurrected with their bodies, they will be compelled to go into the same eternal fire along with the devil and his angels.

1772
04:41:01,560 --> 04:41:09,582
Whether it is one fire in which now only souls, and then also bodies, will be tormented, or whether it is one fire or another; let us believe the true Scripture.

1773
04:41:09,582 --> 04:41:25,327
Both the punishment of eternal fire and the outer darkness, which will undoubtedly be there, are prepared and reserved not only for the angels who did not keep their principality but abandoned their dwelling, whom God also delivered into judgment to be tormented as they fell from heaven, but also for wicked humans.

1774
04:41:25,775 --> 04:41:36,902
As we have already mentioned, blessed Peter the apostle speaks about certain wicked individuals who will be condemned to final destruction: "For whom the gloom of darkness is reserved forever" (Second Peter 2:17).

1775
04:41:36,902 --> 04:41:43,797
Similarly, blessed Jude the apostle says about the same individuals: "For whom the storm of darkness is reserved forever" (Jude 12).

1776
04:41:43,797 --> 04:41:52,834
Just as that gloom and storm of eternal darkness are prepared and reserved for wicked and very evil people, so too is the eternal fire, which must be understood as the same.

1777
04:41:52,834 --> 04:42:10,803
Therefore, what the Lord says about the same eternal fire: "Which is prepared for the devil and his angels" Matthew 25:41, we should faithfully understand that what is said primarily about the devil should consequently also be understood about his followers, about whom Scripture says: "But they imitate him, who are on his side" (Wisdom 2:25).

1778
04:42:10,803 --> 04:42:19,788
So, the punishment primarily prepared for the devil is also accepted as prepared and reserved for his followers, as the above-mentioned apostolic words clearly demonstrate.

1779
04:42:19,788 --> 04:42:28,511
He adds and says: After he was cast down from the ether, where he could not feel pain in an ethereal body, a body of air was added to him, in which he could feel fire.

1780
04:42:28,511 --> 04:42:39,898
Regarding this matter, let us not listen to this man's hasty and inconsiderate definition, but rather let us heed the pious, moderate, and very cautious words of blessed Augustine, who was more searching than defining.

1781
04:42:39,898 --> 04:42:48,413
He says, the higher part of the air, because of its pure tranquility, is joined in common peace to the sky, to which it is adjacent, and is named by the same name.

1782
04:42:48,413 --> 04:43:06,278
In this part, perhaps, if the transgressing angels were with their prince before their transgression, now the devil, then the archangel (for some do not believe them to have been heavenly or super-heavenly angels), it is not surprising if after sin they were cast into this gloom, where there is still air, and it is woven with thin moisture.

1783
04:43:06,695 --> 04:43:14,295
If those transgressors, before they sinned, possessed heavenly bodies, it's not surprising that they were transformed as a punishment into an airy quality.

1784
04:43:14,295 --> 04:43:17,777
This way, they can now suffer from fire, an element of a higher nature.

1785
04:43:17,777 --> 04:43:21,258
They were not allowed to occupy the higher and purer spaces of the air.

1786
04:43:21,258 --> 04:43:26,700
Instead, they were confined to these murky regions, which serve as a kind of prison until the time of judgment.

1787
04:43:26,700 --> 04:43:35,624
If we need to inquire more diligently about these transgressing angels, we can look to the teacher of piety, who presumes nothing rashly but treats each matter cautiously and humbly.

1788
04:43:35,624 --> 04:43:49,696
He says that the transgressing angels, with their leader now called the devil - formerly an archangel - were either in the higher part of the air, the ethereal heaven, before they sinned, or perhaps they existed in the heavenly realms among the other celestial or super-celestial angels.

1789
04:43:49,696 --> 04:43:57,394
If they were only in the ethereal heaven, they were cast out from that pure and serene tranquility into this lower and murky part of the air after their sin.

1790
04:43:57,394 --> 04:44:06,661
Similarly, if before their transgression, like the other angels, they had heavenly bodies, those bodies could have been transformed or were transformed as a punishment into an airy quality.

1791
04:44:06,661 --> 04:44:10,142
This way, they can now suffer the punishment due to them from the fire.

1792
04:44:10,142 --> 04:44:18,722
Therefore, this holy teacher did not define whether they existed in the ethereal heaven or even in the starry heaven before their sin, but he does not deny either possibility.

1793
04:44:18,722 --> 04:44:28,136
Wherever they fell from after their transgression, whether from the higher or lower heaven, even if they had heavenly bodies before, they were transformed as a punishment into an airy quality.

1794
04:44:28,136 --> 04:44:34,020
He does not consider it inappropriate that no other bodies were added to them from the air itself, that is, airy bodies.

1795
04:44:34,559 --> 04:44:41,475
Unlike him, it is not concluded that the devil was cast down from the ether to the air, because he could have fallen from the heavens.

1796
04:44:41,475 --> 04:44:44,571
Nor is it concluded that he had an etheric or heavenly body.

1797
04:44:44,571 --> 04:44:48,132
But if he did, it was transformed into something worse as punishment.

1798
04:44:48,132 --> 04:44:54,222
Nor was an airy body added to him, as if he were clothed with two bodies, one heavenly or etheric, and the other airy.

1799
04:44:54,222 --> 04:45:06,040
Instead, his heavenly body itself, if it existed, was changed as punishment into an airy quality, so that it would no longer be a heavenly or etheric body, but an airy body, where he could feel the punishment and torment of fire.

1800
04:45:06,040 --> 04:45:20,490
Again, considering the same matter elsewhere, and deliberating very cautiously and hesitantly, he says: Therefore, with this caution that the blessed doctor shows in his inquiries, such matters should be considered and discussed, and nothing should be believed lightly or falsely.

1801
04:45:20,490 --> 04:45:34,940
He continues, and says: That fire is not a punishment, nor was it prepared or predestined for that: but it was predestined to be in the universe of all good things, and has become the place of the impious, in which without a doubt the blessed will dwell no less than the wretched.

1802
04:45:34,940 --> 04:45:49,132
In these words, when he says that the eternal fire is not a punishment, he clearly contradicts the Truth itself, that is, the judge of the living and the dead, who foretold that he would say in that judgment: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire (Matthew 25:41).

1803
04:45:49,132 --> 04:46:03,324
And so that we understand that the eternal fire itself is punishment and everlasting torment, immediately after a few words about the wretched who are to be eternally damned and tormented there, he adds, saying: Then they will go away into eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46).

1804
04:46:03,324 --> 04:46:16,587
He also contradicts the blessed apostle Paul, who says: In the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ from heaven with his mighty angels: inflicting vengeance in flaming fire on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1805
04:46:16,587 --> 04:46:23,915
They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might (Second Thessalonians 1:7-9).

1806
04:46:24,431 --> 04:46:40,114
It contradicts the blessed apostle John regarding the same lake of fire and sulfur in the Apocalypse, where he says:
"And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever"
(Revelation 20:10);
and again:
"And the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever"
(Revelation 14:10).

1807
04:46:40,114 --> 04:46:47,818
And the Scriptures, which say:
"He will give fire and worms into their flesh, so that they may be burned and feel it forever"
(Judith 16:21).

1808
04:46:47,818 --> 04:46:53,665
And again:
"Humble your spirit greatly, because the revenge of the wicked is fire and worms"
(Sirach 7:19).

1809
04:46:53,665 --> 04:47:11,041
Since these things are so, and must be faithfully held for constant fear and correction,
how does this person dare, or why is he allowed such impious and harmful freedom, to say in the Church, to the subversion of the listeners and the nurturing of a deadly security, that there is not that eternal fire of punishment?

1810
04:47:11,041 --> 04:47:25,248
When the Lord testifies that it is eternal punishment, and the truth of apostolic teaching clearly declares it as the fire and flame of vengeance, eternal punishment in destruction, torment day and night, and the smoke of their torment rising forever and ever.

1811
04:47:25,248 --> 04:47:36,996
And therefore, we must undoubtedly and truly believe these things, so that such fear may restrain and mortify in us the delight of sinning, and may arouse and strengthen the diligence of doing good and pleasing God.

1812
04:47:36,996 --> 04:47:51,858
For the Lord himself shows us this as especially necessary, saying:
"I will show you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has the power to cast into hell"
(Luke 12:5);
and again:
"But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell"
(Matthew 10:28).

1813
04:47:51,858 --> 04:48:03,169
Wherefore, elsewhere the Scripture, showing the benefit of this fear, and the harm of security, says:
"The fear of the Lord drives out sin"
(Sirach 1:27):
for the one who is without fear cannot be justified.

1814
04:48:03,551 --> 04:48:11,644
What this person is saying is that the eternal fire wasn't initially created for punishment, but simply to exist within the universe created by a good Creator.

1815
04:48:11,644 --> 04:48:14,698
However, according to our faith, this is not to be accepted.

1816
04:48:14,698 --> 04:48:24,216
Instead, we believe that the omnipotent God, who created everything from the beginning, did so with specific reasons and necessary uses in mind, creating nothing in vain or superfluously.

1817
04:48:24,216 --> 04:48:42,437
He intended each creation to have its own purpose or utility: like light for day, darkness for night, the firmament of heaven as the seat of the luminaries, the separation of waters above the heavens to temper the stars, herbs and trees for the sustenance of living beings, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light and stars to rule the night.

1818
04:48:42,437 --> 04:48:49,002
Just as these things were created and ordained from the beginning, God immediately assigned them to their proper duties and uses.

1819
04:48:49,002 --> 04:49:04,322
Similarly, the eternal fire, created from the beginning, is believed to have been predestined by His just providence and justice for the purpose He indicated when He said to the wicked and condemned: "Go into the eternal fire," adding, "which is prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).

1820
04:49:04,322 --> 04:49:07,885
This means it is for the eternal punishment of both angels and humans.

1821
04:49:07,885 --> 04:49:21,627
From His words, "Come, blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 25:34), we can understand that, conversely, the eternal fire for the punishment of the wicked was also prepared from the foundation of the world.

1822
04:49:21,983 --> 04:49:31,057
However, there is no injustice with God in preparing and predestining the fire of eternal punishment for such a great multitude of the wicked, long before they even existed.

1823
04:49:31,057 --> 04:49:42,175
For example, in the construction of a new city, if a dreadful and terrifying prison is built at the same time as the city itself, it cannot be considered an injustice, but rather a provision of mercy and justice.

1824
04:49:42,175 --> 04:49:52,664
This way, those who live in the city, seeing the penal and grim prison of condemnation, are either mercifully deterred from sinning, or, if they do not avoid sins, are justly and inexcusably punished.

1825
04:49:52,664 --> 04:50:02,577
Thus, the fire created for eternal punishment should be believed to be both merciful and just, as it either corrects people through fear or justly punishes those who refuse to be corrected.

1826
04:50:02,577 --> 04:51:19,830
Regarding the creation of this eternal fire, which we must understand to be among those works of God, when He made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them in six days, and rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done Exodus 20:11, so says the holy Pope Gregory, explaining the words of the book of blessed Job, where it is written about the wicked: "A fire not fanned will devour him" Job 20:26, he says this:
Still explaining the same blessed doctor's words following which it is said of the same wicked person: "The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him" Job 20:27, he adds what should be faithfully thought about the punishments of that eternal fire:
Also, when he explained the words of the same book, in which it is written about the same wicked person: "He will repay what he has labored for and will not swallow it down; according to the measure of his iniquity, so shall he suffer" Job 20:18, he says:
This holy doctor speaks these terrifying truths in a terrifying and true manner, to arouse the minds of the listeners to fear, stimulate them to correction, and compel them to awaken from deadly security to the care of their own salvation.
However, this one, still speaking vainly about vain things and falsely about false things, says that the eternal fire, which was created for this purpose alone, as he wishes, to be in the universe of all good things, has become the seat of the wicked.

1827
04:51:20,039 --> 04:51:23,745
He did not say torment, punishment, or suffering was made for the wicked.

1828
04:51:23,745 --> 04:51:26,182
Instead, he said a seat was made for the wicked.

1829
04:51:26,182 --> 04:51:36,334
According to his understanding, just as each person's seat is their home, where they peacefully reside, so also for the wicked, that fire is not a torment of damnation but a peaceful seat of dwelling.

1830
04:51:36,334 --> 04:52:49,023
He further adds about the same fire, saying: "In which undoubtedly the blessed will dwell no less than the wretched." Here he said they will dwell in that fire, not be tortured or punished, completely denying, as usual, the true punishments of eternal torments, which all of Scripture announces with such terror and commends with such attention.
But when he says: "In which undoubtedly the blessed will dwell no less than the wretched," he clearly strives to affirm that both the blessed and the wretched will dwell in one eternal fire after the resurrection. This follows the foolish and vain persuasion of secular philosophers, who think that the souls of the pious, after the dissolution of the body, will dwell either in the ethereal heaven, in that circle called the Milky Way, or in the spheres of the stars.
He calls all these, including the ethereal heaven itself, the firmament of heaven where the Milky Way appears, and the stars themselves, eternal fire, just like the fire of Gehenna. He thinks all these, which are established above the three elements of the world-earth, water, and air-exist from the fourth element, fire. Thus, the same fourth element of the world, and in the underworld, is eternal fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels, as stated in Matthew 25:41, and for all wicked humans; and in the heavenly spaces is eternal fire where the dwelling of the blessed will be after the resurrection.

1831
04:52:49,175 --> 04:53:00,094
Behold the kind of happiness promised to the saints and the chosen ones of God: those who lived on earth as mortals will now live immortally in the highest element of the world, as He says, in eternal fire.

1832
04:53:00,094 --> 04:53:05,023
Their reward will be to dwell in any element, no matter how bright or peaceful, and yet pure.

1833
04:53:05,023 --> 04:53:18,115
However, the Lord promises eternal happiness not in the elements of the world but in heavenly and super-heavenly realms, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God Colossians 3:1, exalted above the heavens, and interceding for us Romans 8:34.

1834
04:53:18,115 --> 04:54:33,008
Regarding the height of this happiness, the Apostle says: "Jesus did not enter a sanctuary made with hands, which are copies of the true one, but into heaven itself, to appear now in the presence of God for us" Hebrews 9:24.
To this dwelling, so that His saints may reach it, He prays to the Father in the Gospel, saying: "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me" John 17:24.
About this blessed and angelic dwelling of the saints, the Apostle says: "We know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands" Second Corinthians 5:1. He also said: "I desire to depart and be with Christ" Philippians 1:23.
To all the chosen ones after the resurrection, He promises: "We will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever" First Thessalonians 4:16.
About this glorious and blessed dwelling of the righteous, the Psalmist says: "The upright will dwell in your presence" Psalm 139:14.
Therefore, let this dwelling be sought and desired, not in the elements of the world, but in the presence of God, in the vision of Christ's glory, in the company of the blessed and super-heavenly angels. When the saints will be, as the Truth itself promises, equal to the angels of God in heaven Luke 20:36.

1835
04:54:33,167 --> 04:54:42,431
Therefore, the habitation, or rather the confinement, of the blessed will not be in one fiery element of the world, nor will they be enclosed there like the wicked in eternal fire.

1836
04:54:42,431 --> 04:54:55,246
Instead, they will have all the elements of the world under their control, so subjected to them with such happiness and ease, and so suited to their immortal state, that wherever they want to be, and just as they want, they can be there immediately.

1837
04:54:55,246 --> 04:55:03,583
They will see and possess all these things not so much as a reward of blessedness, but as a culmination of happiness, and for the praise and glory of the Creator.

1838
04:55:03,583 --> 04:56:24,949
For prophetic Scripture promises this power and glory to them, saying:
"But the kingdom and the power and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve and obey him"
Daniel 7:27.
After these things, he adds and says: There is no misery except eternal death. Eternal death is ignorance of the truth, and there is no misery except ignorance of the truth; and where truth is unknown, there is no life.
Indeed, what is said in these words could be good if the good itself were not said with a bad, that is, a wrong meaning. For it is true that for a just and wise man, all labor, all adversity, all misery that can happen in this mortal life, if it does not break him and change him for the worse but rather exercises him tirelessly, cannot be misery to him, because it does not make him miserable. Instead, it purifies and tests him, and like gold in a furnace makes him purer. Such a man considers no misery to be his except ignorance of the truth, as he is still delayed from its contemplation, and in a way is repelled by his own weakness.
He does not fear this external death of the body, but that internal death of the soul, which is truly the ignorance of the highest truth, by which all unbelievers are dead, who neither believe nor acknowledge God's truth. About them, the Lord also says:
"Let the dead bury their own dead"
Matthew 8:22; and the Apostle: "Alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them"
Ephesians 4:18.

1839
04:56:25,103 --> 04:56:28,536
The life of the faithful is truly the knowledge of the truth itself.

1840
04:56:28,536 --> 04:56:32,827
They know it here through faith, and in the future, they will know it through vision.

1841
04:56:32,827 --> 04:56:38,835
Here, they receive life through faith in the truth, as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith" (Romans 1:17).

1842
04:56:38,835 --> 04:56:49,740
There, they will have eternal life through the knowledge and vision of the same truth, as the Lord says: "This is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17:3).

1843
04:56:49,740 --> 04:56:57,867
Therefore, anyone who attains this knowledge through true faith and eternal contemplation will undoubtedly have eternal life through the eternal vision of Truth.

1844
04:56:57,867 --> 04:57:06,652
But for those who are separated from it, either through unbelief or ultimate damnation, what will such separation and ignorance of the truth be for them if not eternal death?

1845
04:57:06,652 --> 04:57:10,993
According to this understanding, this is what is read in the teachings of the doctors.

1846
04:57:10,993 --> 04:57:47,089
However, what they read well, he twists into something depraved and perverse to fit his own error and lies:
He says all this with no other intention than to use such an argument violently and wickedly, misusing it from good to bad, to seemingly show and confirm that there will be no other misery for the damned in eternal fire, whether they are evil angels or lost humans, except for ignorance and, as he said before, the absence of the truth itself;
And that this ignorance and absence of the truth alone will be their eternal misery, their eternal death:
So that in this way, he contends they will be free from all the misery of punishments and torments applied externally, and from all death of penal damnation.

1847
04:57:47,089 --> 04:58:01,780
But no matter how much he contends and tries to argue otherwise, besides that death which they incur internally from ignorance and absence of the truth, they will also suffer externally, as the Apocalypse says: "The lake of fire and sulfur, which is the second death" (Revelation 20:10, 14).

1848
04:58:02,183 --> 04:58:08,452
They will truly suffer eternal misery when God, the just and powerful judge, inflicts fire and worms upon their bodies.

1849
04:58:08,452 --> 04:58:10,506
They will burn and endure pain forever.

1850
04:58:10,506 --> 04:58:22,358
As stated in the Book of Judith, Chapter 16, Verse 21:
"For they will always be in death, compelled to die by the severity of their punishments, and the strictness of divine judgment will never allow them to be extinguished."

1851
04:58:22,463 --> 04:58:26,351
Chapter Eighteen
In the eighteenth chapter it says:

1852
04:58:26,351 --> 04:58:26,458
1.

1853
04:58:26,458 --> 04:58:35,000
The error of predestination comes from ignorance of the disciplines that wisdom intended as companions and investigators, and from ignorance of Greek literature.

1854
04:58:35,000 --> 04:58:35,106
2.

1855
04:58:35,106 --> 04:59:12,088
The word oro means "I see," "I define," and "I determine."
Similarly, the compound προωρω means "I foresee," "I predefine," "I predestine"; thus, predestination and predefinition are essentially foreseeing.
3. God neither foresaw nor predestined death and punishment because they are nothing.
4. Sinners are left in the mass of original sin; left behind, they are deprived of light; deprived of light, they are tormented by darkness; deprived of life, they are destroyed by death.
5. God does not abandon or forsake what He created in them (otherwise their nature would return to nothing if the highest essence were not in them); but He has rejected what He did not create in them, that is, pride.

1856
04:59:12,088 --> 04:59:12,194
6.

1857
04:59:12,194 --> 04:59:15,590
God always dwells in the nature that He created towards Himself.

1858
04:59:15,590 --> 04:59:15,696
7.

1859
04:59:15,696 --> 04:59:26,414
God's wisdom has predestined, through its laws, the limits beyond which the malice of the wicked cannot go, and does not allow anyone's malice to extend infinitely, imposing limits based on divine laws.

1860
04:59:26,414 --> 04:59:26,520
8.

1861
04:59:26,520 --> 04:59:31,720
The wicked and the devil desire nothing more than to withdraw from Him who is the highest essence.

1862
04:59:31,720 --> 04:59:35,115
If the divine law allowed, their nature would return to nothing.

1863
04:59:35,115 --> 04:59:45,409
However, eternal laws prevent them from falling as much as they would like, causing them to suffer, be tormented, punished, and tortured, making them miserable in the poverty of empty pleasures.

1864
04:59:45,409 --> 04:59:53,686
This difficulty, which stops them from achieving what they lustfully desire, leads to their penal destruction and the just torment of their wretched desire.

1865
04:59:53,686 --> 04:59:53,792
9.

1866
04:59:53,792 --> 04:59:55,914
The number of each party is predestined.

1867
04:59:55,914 --> 04:59:56,073
10.

1868
04:59:56,073 --> 05:00:08,967
The wicked serve God unwillingly: not the nature He created in them, which He does not punish, but the evil will, which He did not create in them and which He punishes; and in serving Him unwillingly, they are punished by their own punishment.

1869
05:00:09,815 --> 05:00:15,042
For those He does not justly free, He somewhat prepares them by allowing them to prepare themselves for it.

1870
05:00:15,042 --> 05:00:48,354
When he says:
The error of predestination arises from ignorance of the disciplines, which wisdom itself wanted to be its companions and investigators, and from the lack of knowledge of Greek literature;
he certainly reminds his listeners to learn the knowledge of the liberal disciplines from him, as he is a very learned and philosophical man, perhaps also to learn the expertise of Greek literature from him similarly:
for he affirms that wisdom itself has those same doctrines of the liberal arts joined to it as companions and associates, so that whoever wishes to attain its understanding must absolutely have those liberal disciplines to investigate what is true through them.

1871
05:00:48,354 --> 05:00:59,198
Therefore, if ignorance of secular literature has caused error regarding the truth of divine predestination among others, what has this man, who boasts of being skilled in them, investigated about this matter through them?

1872
05:00:59,198 --> 05:01:00,370
What truth has he found?

1873
05:01:00,370 --> 05:01:05,890
What has he discussed in his lengthy speech that is supported by the firmest reason and worthy of all acceptance?

1874
05:01:05,890 --> 05:01:39,739
Where nothing else is found except the superfluous labor of vanity, the entanglement of infinite error, and the most open opposition to the truth, while he despises the Scriptures of truth, and also remains ignorant of the histories of divine words, not meditating on them day and night, nor striving to correct, direct, and inform his faith according to their rule:
but he spends days and nights reading human vanities and wishes to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs eat
Luke 15:16, yet he does not find any nourishment from it: but he wastes away and perishes with the most wretched hunger under the rule of the most wicked master, who sent him into his field to feed pigs
Luke 15.

1875
05:01:39,983 --> 05:02:08,697
Let him return to himself, get up, and go to his father so that he may find bread inside when he was dying of hunger outside; there he will be fed with the feast of the fattened calf, sacrificed for the salvation of the world; there he will hear the music and chorus (Luke 15:25), which is the admirable harmony of the heavenly Scriptures and the sweet concord of the faithful, who all, being of the same mind, are united in the same sense and judgment, unanimously honoring God with one voice and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1876
05:02:08,697 --> 05:02:24,667
In this house, therefore, placed by God's mercy and the grace of faith, let us hear and faithfully hold on to what the steward of the eternal bread, that is, the divine word, conveys to us, saying: If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool so that he may become wise.

1877
05:02:24,667 --> 05:02:27,517
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

1878
05:02:27,517 --> 05:02:30,690
For it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness.

1879
05:02:30,690 --> 05:02:35,744
And: The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain (First Corinthians 3:18, 20).

1880
05:02:35,744 --> 05:02:46,498
Let's also hear that most wise man, who says: I am the most foolish of men, and human wisdom is not with me; I have not learned wisdom, nor do I know the knowledge of the holy ones (Proverbs 30:2, 3).

1881
05:02:46,498 --> 05:03:18,277
We do not say this as if there is no truth to be found in those human writings, or that those disciplines do not have some usefulness in seeking the truth; but because every faithful person must first diligently learn the truth of faith from the authority of the Scriptures of God: so that whatever might later need to be read or known from those human writings, it should all be judged from that divine authority and truth of faith; so that whatever does not disagree with its rule may be accepted without danger, but whatever is found to be in discord with it should be rejected as deadly.

1882
05:03:18,599 --> 05:03:32,655
Whoever thinks they can discover the truth of God and the integrity of faith without true knowledge, without the trustworthy authority of Holy Scripture, and without the diligent teaching of the Fathers, using only human writings and disciplines, undoubtedly deceives and misleads themselves.

1883
05:03:32,655 --> 05:03:36,458
While trying to appear as an inventor of truth, they become a teacher of error.

1884
05:03:36,458 --> 05:03:52,968
The order of piety must be so attentively observed that even the sacred writings in the books of the law and the prophets cannot be useful and beneficial to readers unless the faith of Christ either precedes in the heart of the reader, through which they are truly understood, or is faithfully sought in them and found with God's illumination.

1885
05:03:52,968 --> 05:04:05,050
Thus, the Apostle, advising and instructing his faithful and beloved disciple, says: "And from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to instruct you for salvation through the faith that is in Christ Jesus" (Second Timothy 3:15).

1886
05:04:05,050 --> 05:04:13,859
This means that the sacred writings can instruct a person for salvation through the faith that is in Christ Jesus, because without this faith no saving instruction can be found there.

1887
05:04:13,859 --> 05:04:27,288
Therefore, this person erred greatly, perceiving and writing much that was false and fallacious, because they ignored the Holy Scriptures, did not seek the truth of faith in them humbly and faithfully, but arrogantly believed they could find it through human and inept arguments.

1888
05:04:27,288 --> 05:04:31,332
Consequently, they did not find it but rather attacked it faithlessly and unhappily.

1889
05:04:31,332 --> 05:04:52,271
Therefore, whoever wishes to escape human error concerning the truth of divine predestination and find what they should hold according to the truth should carefully and faithfully read the prophetic, evangelical, and apostolic writings, as we have already said, and should not dare to defend their own understanding against them, but humbly submit to their authority and truth, lest they try to kick against the goad to their own ruin.

1890
05:04:52,607 --> 05:05:03,776
From these sacred writings, since we have already discussed this matter at length above, to avoid boring the readers, we will briefly mention just one point here, from the letter of the blessed Jude the apostle.

1891
05:05:03,776 --> 05:05:17,274
Speaking about the most ungodly heretics who have attacked and will attack the Church of the Lord from the time of the apostles until the end of the world, he shows that they have been given over to a depraved mind by the eternal and just judgment of God.

1892
05:05:17,274 --> 05:05:25,902
This causes them to dare to speak such great and terrible things against God, and they are ultimately condemned to eternal destruction by the same divine judgment.

1893
05:05:25,902 --> 05:05:39,294
He says: "For certain men have secretly slipped in among you (who long ago were marked out for this condemnation), ungodly people, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord" (Jude 4).

1894
05:05:39,294 --> 05:06:02,638
Showing how long ago and how many ages before this was predicted and prophesied about them, he adds after many things: "Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about them: 'See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him'" (Jude 14, 15).

1895
05:06:02,638 --> 05:06:13,913
Regarding their eternal damnation and the horrible punishment prepared and reserved for them, he explicitly adds, saying: "They are wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever" (Jude 13).

1896
05:06:13,913 --> 05:06:27,305
What could be clearer about the predestination of the ungodly to the condemnation of eternal judgment than that these ungodly people were marked out for this judgment so long ago and so many ages before, by both divine judgment and prophetic prediction?

1897
05:06:27,305 --> 05:06:27,781
(Jude 4).

1898
05:06:28,151 --> 05:06:41,500
We shouldn't be so unreasonable as to think that because the blessed patriarch and prophet Enoch, the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied this, that God Almighty decided or predestined something then that wasn't already in His eternal judgment and counsel.

1899
05:06:41,500 --> 05:06:51,678
In God's unchangeable eternity, there can be no new will or recent arrangement; but what was eternally determined by Him, He wanted to be prophesied and fulfilled in the most fitting order over time.

1900
05:06:51,678 --> 05:07:05,027
This was for the judgment and condemnation of those who would dare and do such things, and for the testing and strengthening of His Church, which He also intended to be more diligently taught and more gloriously arranged through such contradictions and attacks.

1901
05:07:05,027 --> 05:07:12,494
As the Apostle says: "For there must be heresies among you, that those who are approved may be made manifest among you" (First Corinthians 11:19).

1902
05:07:12,494 --> 05:07:25,434
If we seek the just and eternal predestination of God in the condemnation of the wicked, let's hear that certain men are marked out for this impious judgment; and they are marked not just temporally by prophetic speech, but eternally by divine judgment.

1903
05:07:25,434 --> 05:07:30,088
For what was eternally fixed by God was foretold and marked temporally through the prophet.

1904
05:07:30,088 --> 05:07:58,781
If we ask whether punishment and torment are prepared for them by God's eternal judgment, let's hear what is said about them: "For whom the storm of darkness is reserved forever"; and thus, faithfully accepting the divine truth, neither the wicked nor the punishments divinely prepared for the wicked. But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God; and rebuke some who are judged, save others by snatching them out of the fire, and have mercy on others with fear (Jude 1:20-23).

1905
05:07:59,087 --> 05:09:30,288
He does not say, "Rebuke those to be judged," but rather, "Rebuke those already judged." This means that what is destined to come to those persisting in their impiety, now appears to them by the terrifying predestination of divine and eternal judgment, as has been said. This applies to those who are to be punished in the future and already condemned by divine sentence in the present.
Moving on, we need to consider what this man adds to appear knowledgeable in Greek: "Behold the Greek word oro, which means 'I see,' 'I define,' and 'I determine.' Similarly, the compound prooro means 'I foresee,' 'I predefine,' 'I predestine.' Thus, predestination and predefinition are nothing other than foreseeing."
In these words, he correctly states that oro can be translated into Latin as video. But how should this video be understood? Is it simply seeing many things passively and presenting themselves to our sight, or is it with a certain fixed gaze, by which we come to know something with certainty? Or do we direct our gaze with such intention that our sight follows like an arrow toward a target? Just as Scripture says of the ironworker or any other metalworker, that the eye of the craftsman is upon the object being made, with such intense focus that nothing in it is allowed to be different from what he has intended.
Therefore, the term oro, meaning "I see," should be understood in such a way that this vision is directed with certainty, so that the gaze, or the aim, or the crafting, or other such actions are directed straight and unwaveringly toward it.
From the word oro comes the term oroμα, which in Latin is visio. This vision, for example, of a dream or some revelation, was defined by the ancients as seeing something that will happen in the same way it appeared.

1906
05:09:30,288 --> 05:09:42,248
Therefore, especially in the Scriptures, any vision of divine revelation, seen in the spirit in such a way that it cannot happen otherwise, is read in Greek as appearing or being seen in oroματε.

1907
05:09:42,248 --> 05:10:53,216
According to this clear reasoning, when it is said "I see" in this context, it is understood as "I define" or "I determine." When the sentence is composed with the added preposition, and it is said prooro, it is understood as "I predetermine" or "I predestine," which both have the same meaning and can also be interpreted as "I foresee." This foresight, when related to God, is completely certain, and it will happen as He has foreseen. From this word oro, it seems that the Greek word ορισμος, which means determination, is derived, and with the added preposition προορισμος, it means predestination. No one has ever dared to interpret these two words as vision or prevision, but as determination and predestination. Similarly, from the same word oro, it seems that orisen, which means "he determined," is derived, and with the added preposition proorisen, it means "he predestined." However, prooro, as mentioned above, can also be interpreted as "I foresee." For example, in the psalm where we say in Latin: "I foresaw the Lord always before me" (Psalm 15:8); in Greek, it is read as prooroμεν τον Κυριον, indicating certain foresight and determination.

1908
05:10:53,216 --> 05:11:11,618
Blessed Jerome, in his edition, put it this way: "I have set the Lord always before me," which more clearly pertains to determination. What is determined is directed towards a specific intention or plan, as shown in Scripture, which says: "Or like an arrow shot at a designated target" (Wisdom 5:12).

1909
05:11:11,618 --> 05:11:20,143
And the Apostle, where he says about himself: "I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly calling of God" (Philippians 3:14).

1910
05:11:20,328 --> 05:12:54,336
The blessed Jerome, explaining this, said:
"Therefore, let this person not mock our ignorance by changing some Greek words with a new interpretation and diminishing their force as much as he can. For what all the ancient interpreters in the Holy Scriptures have understood as either predestination, predefinition, providence, or purpose, this person now wants to call 'foreknowledge' with an unusual and absurd name.
And although foreknowledge in God, like prescience, is most certain, we do not allow the sense of predestination to be diminished or destroyed by the novelty of this term. This is because God can foresee and know in advance even those things which He is not going to do. However, only those things which He will do, either out of His mercy or His judgment, are understood to be predestined by Him.
Therefore, let us completely reject the notion that predestination and predefinition by God are nothing but foreknowledge, as this person has said and seemingly defined. This interpretation is clearly impious, as if God merely foresaw what each person would do and what they would suffer for their actions, and did not predestine or predefine in His eternal judgment anything about the person who would act well or poorly.
Furthermore, this person adds and says that God neither foresaw nor predestined death and punishments because they are nothing. This is so vain and contrary to the truth that it has already been shown sufficiently and often.
Then this person, speaking of God, adds: 'He left sinners in the mass of original sin; those left behind He abandoned; the abandoned are tortured by darkness, deprived of light, and killed by death. God does not leave or abandon what He has made in them; otherwise, their nature would return to nothing if the supreme essence were not in them. But He scorned what He did not make in them, which is pride.'"

1911
05:12:54,336 --> 05:13:03,406
Therefore, what he says about God leaving sinners in the mass of original sin-if he had said the reprobate, or those who are to be punished or damned, it would certainly be true.

1912
05:13:03,406 --> 05:13:16,247
For indeed, the reprobate, those to be punished and damned, remain in that mass condemned generally from Adam, because the omnipotent potter did not distinguish them from it, as he makes one vessel for honor and another for dishonor from the same lump.

1913
05:13:16,247 --> 05:13:24,451
Romans 9:21
Now, what he says, that God left sinners in the mass of original sin, cannot be entirely true, because surely he distinguished and liberated sinners.

1914
05:13:24,451 --> 05:14:38,439
As it is written: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." Matthew 9:13 And of whom the Apostle says: "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." First Timothy 1:15
However, because he did not say, "He left all sinners in that mass," which would certainly be blatantly false, but said indefinitely, "He left sinners in that mass," this can be understood as partial, so what is said may stand in some way.
But what he adds about those left in the mass of sin: "Left them, deserted them to be tormented by the darkness, deserted by life to be killed by death," he wants them to be understood as left by God, and by leaving, deserted. Therefore, because they are deserted by the true light, they are tormented by the darkness of their blindness in mind, and because they are deserted by the true life, they are killed by a special death in the soul. This is to be their punishment and penalty in that eternal damnation, so that with no external torment applied, they are punished solely by the blindness of mind and the death of the soul, as he has tried to assert repeatedly above.
And to show that some great good remains for them in that damnation, he still says of them: "Nor does God leave or desert what he made in them, otherwise their nature would revert to nothing if the supreme essence were not in them, but he despised what he did not make in them, that is, pride."

1915
05:14:38,592 --> 05:14:45,370
Behold the goodness that God proclaims to remain for them, the very goodness He deems fit to bestow even upon the insensible elements.

1916
05:14:45,370 --> 05:14:49,366
By His almighty power, He grants them existence and ensures their continuation.

1917
05:14:49,366 --> 05:14:54,424
Their nature is not reduced to nothingness; through that same power, He sustains and preserves them.

1918
05:14:54,424 --> 05:15:03,125
However, these elements of the world, as they exist, are preserved in their natural state, continuing to praise the Creator and serving the use or honor of rational beings.

1919
05:15:03,125 --> 05:15:08,285
But the nature of the damned and lost is preserved by God's almighty power so that it does not perish.

1920
05:15:08,285 --> 05:15:12,938
By God's just judgment, it serves only to their punishment, ensuring their agony never ends.

1921
05:15:12,938 --> 05:15:19,059
It is fitting to praise the Creator, who did not wish the goodness of nature, which He created, to be entirely destroyed.

1922
05:15:19,059 --> 05:15:24,826
What He says is true: Otherwise, their nature would return to nothingness if the supreme essence were not in them.

1923
05:15:24,826 --> 05:15:32,616
If He had said their nature would return to nothingness if the supreme essence did not grant them existence or preserve their existence, it would be true.

1924
05:15:32,616 --> 05:15:37,017
For everything that exists received its existence from that supreme and divine essence.

1925
05:15:37,017 --> 05:15:46,476
However, since He said, unless the supreme essence were in them, it seems He attributes so much to those who will be damned in perdition that they might even seem to be the temple of God.

1926
05:15:46,476 --> 05:15:56,289
For if the supreme essence is in them, and since the supreme essence is God, who says of Himself: I am who I am (Exodus 3:14), then God will be in them, and they can be called the temple of God.

1927
05:15:56,289 --> 05:15:59,021
So that God may say of them: And I will dwell in them.

1928
05:15:59,021 --> 05:16:02,916
Indeed, they would be more than a temple if the supreme essence were in them.

1929
05:16:02,916 --> 05:16:19,811
They would seem to be united with God by a certain essential union-something that is uniquely to be believed about the one and only Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, whom the Word of God and God the Word united to Himself by an essential and natural conjunction, that is, He assumed Him into the unity of His person.

1930
05:16:20,520 --> 05:16:34,257
If he claims that the highest substance exists within them by its own action, meaning their substance isn't destroyed or lost through any grace of inhabitation that allows them to enjoy some good in it and from it, he should reconsider this unusual and bold way of speaking.

1931
05:16:34,257 --> 05:16:45,788
Instead of saying the highest essence is in wicked people doomed to eternal damnation, he should state that the highest essence is present to them through the power of the one acting, not through the dignity of the one inhabiting.

1932
05:16:45,788 --> 05:16:57,320
There's a significant question that should be explored with faithful piety as far as divine grace allows: how the omnipotent God is believed to always be present everywhere in the universe of creation and sometimes even within it.

1933
05:16:57,320 --> 05:17:07,447
However, we propose this topic for more investigation rather than explanation here, so that the truth of this matter may be sought piously and faithfully by the devout, and with God's help, truly found.

1934
05:17:07,447 --> 05:17:17,475
This individual, lacking experience in ecclesiastical speech and Christian piety, further asserts regarding the same wicked, damned people, that God always dwells in the nature He created for Himself.

1935
05:17:17,475 --> 05:17:23,040
By these words, he clearly refers to human nature, which God made in a rational mind to His image and likeness.

1936
05:17:23,040 --> 05:17:39,084
He claims that God always dwells in this rational mind nature, both in the present age and in the future, in believers who are faithful to Him, in unbelievers and pagans who are estranged from Him by their own disbelief, in the elect whom He made His temple, and in the reprobates whom He condemned to eternal damnation.

1937
05:17:39,084 --> 05:17:41,390
This is certainly contrary to faith and truth.

1938
05:17:41,390 --> 05:17:53,172
If this were true, it would mean that God the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit dwell even in the most unfaithful Jews and pagans, who, as far as the good nature created by God is concerned, are made in the image and likeness of God.

1939
05:17:53,172 --> 05:17:59,188
Likewise, it would imply that God the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit dwell in those condemned to eternal damnation.

1940
05:17:59,640 --> 05:18:04,104
In what impious and detestable sense could anything more horrible be said or thought?

1941
05:18:04,104 --> 05:18:15,186
For this absurdity also follows: if angels, who are certainly rational creatures, are rightly believed to be made in the image and likeness of God, they did not receive anything less in their nature than humans.

1942
05:18:15,186 --> 05:18:24,062
Even in the devil and his angels, who exist of the same nature as the holy angels, God the Father, heaven forbid, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit would be said to dwell.

1943
05:18:24,062 --> 05:18:33,096
Whereas this gift of blessed and gracious dwelling is believed to be granted only to the chosen and faithful rational creatures, as we have shown from the Scriptures above.

1944
05:18:33,096 --> 05:18:40,029
For the Lord promises to the pious and faithful, saying: "My Father and I will come to him and make our home with him" (John 14:23).

1945
05:18:40,029 --> 05:18:48,905
Similarly, He promises the dwelling of the Holy Spirit, saying: "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever" (John 14:16-17).

1946
05:18:48,905 --> 05:18:59,724
He also adds shortly after: "You will know him, because he will dwell with you and will be in you."
About such people, God Himself says: "I will dwell in them and walk among them" (Second Corinthians 6:16).

1947
05:18:59,724 --> 05:19:04,504
And the Psalmist says: "They will rejoice forever, and He will dwell in them" (Psalm 5:12).

1948
05:19:04,504 --> 05:19:11,594
He also says elsewhere: "If the Lord had not been on our side, let Israel now say, if the Lord had not been on our side" (Psalm 124:1).

1949
05:19:11,594 --> 05:19:26,773
Hence, the blessed apostle John, distinguishing between the indwelling God of the pious and the indwelling devil of the impious, says to the faithful: "You are from God, little children, and have overcome them, for He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world" (First John 4:4).

1950
05:19:26,773 --> 05:19:36,962
If this person desires correction, let him learn faithfully from the Scriptures, and not argue against the truth of God with human and vain arguments, but let him submit to it with gentle piety.

1951
05:19:37,488 --> 05:19:58,392
But since everything he says about those who remain in the state of original sin is repeated only to assert that they are bound by the chain of original sin and not predestined by God to punishment, we must ask him and others who think this way whether it was by any judgment of God that such a large number of the human race became subject to that original sin and thus deserving of eternal death, or not?

1952
05:19:58,392 --> 05:20:14,406
If it was not by God's judgment but only by the natural course of corrupted origin that this happened, then sin was transferred to them naturally from that first man in such a way that none of its condemnation was transferred to them, and only the origin of sin, not its just punishment, came to them from Adam.

1953
05:20:14,406 --> 05:20:20,842
Clearly, the Apostle says that through one man sin entered the world, and through sin, death, and so death spread to all men.

1954
05:20:20,842 --> 05:20:22,232
Romans chapter 5, verse 12.

1955
05:20:22,232 --> 05:20:27,278
Therefore, through one man, not only sin but also the punishment of sin, death, entered the world.

1956
05:20:27,278 --> 05:21:18,150
By whose judgment, if not by Him who had foretold to man: "On the day you eat from it, you will surely die"?
Genesis chapter 2, verse 17.
Eating from that forbidden tree was indeed sin, and the punishment of sin was consequently added: you will surely die.
God certainly threatened him with not only this first physical death but also the death that happens in the soul through sin, because the soul that sins shall die.
Ezekiel chapter 18, verse 4.
This also includes the second death, which is eternal damnation, to which the guilt of that first sin drags every man unless freed by the grace of Christ.
When God said these things, He did not only want to instill terror in the listener, but He revealed by that threat what He justly decreed in His eternal judgment: that by His just and eternal judgment, if man committed that sin, first, death would be inflicted on the soul, second, the body would also be dissolved by death, and third, he would also be condemned by the second death.

1957
05:21:18,408 --> 05:21:25,028
This entire damnation, both in the soul and the body, would be passed on to all descendants along with the sin itself over time.

1958
05:21:25,028 --> 05:21:42,303
Thus, the judgment of His eternal counsel and justice, which He decided to begin with the first individual man, was extended to all his offspring:
so that by His just judgment, anyone from that condemned mass in Adam who was not separated by Christ's grace would be bound by the first sentence of divine judgment to eternal damnation.

1959
05:21:42,303 --> 05:21:58,337
He did not merely leave the reprobates in the mass of original sin without making any decision or judgment about them;
rather, He judged that His eternal and just judgment, which began with the root, would follow in the offspring;
and what began in the parent would necessarily be fulfilled in the descendants.

1960
05:21:58,337 --> 05:22:17,681
Among the faithful, there is no doubt whatsoever that Almighty God, before man sinned, knew he would sin:
and just as He foresaw the sin, He also predestined what man would suffer by His just judgment:
and what He began in judging justly, He completed in the entire progeny with the same foreknowledge, the same predestination of judgment, and the same justice of damnation.

1961
05:22:17,681 --> 05:22:31,698
However, the claim that God left the reprobates in that mass of damnation without predestining anything about their damnation
seems to be taken from the book which the Greeks call Hypognosticon,
which many mistakenly believe to be by Saint Augustine due to a false title.

1962
05:22:31,698 --> 05:22:39,353
The style and sense of that book itself show that it is not by Saint Augustine and not only contrary to his writings but also contrary to the faith.

1963
05:22:39,353 --> 05:22:50,938
The testimonies taken from this new edition we use, which he continuously refuted when disputing against heretics and dealing with matters of faith using the old edition,
convince the contradictors and instruct the faithful.

1964
05:22:50,938 --> 05:22:57,921
He further adds: God's wisdom has predestined, in His laws, the limits beyond which the wickedness of the impious cannot progress, etc.

1965
05:22:57,921 --> 05:23:00,765
, up to where he says, the most just torment of desire.

1966
05:23:01,128 --> 05:23:05,219
In these words, some truths are mentioned as a basis to draw a false conclusion.

1967
05:23:05,219 --> 05:23:18,157
It is true that God's wisdom, within the hidden laws of His plan, has predestined and set limits on the extent and measure of the wickedness of evildoers, whether they be angels or humans, so that their malice cannot proceed as far as they would desire.

1968
05:23:18,157 --> 05:23:31,914
If their malice is restrained by certain measures and limits under God's hidden laws, it is clearly true because both the devil and wicked humans always have the will to do evil or harm, but they do not always have the power, except when and as much as God allows them.

1969
05:23:31,914 --> 05:23:36,721
For instance, when the devil maliciously wished to harm the blessed Job, he was given a limit.

1970
05:23:36,721 --> 05:23:40,454
He could only harm as much as he was permitted, not as much as he wanted.

1971
05:23:40,454 --> 05:24:30,776
And regarding wicked humans who attempt evil and crooked deeds but cannot accomplish them because God imposes limits, Scripture clearly states:
"They devised plans that they could not fulfill."
Psalms 20:12.
And again:
"He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success."
Job 5:12.
What this person adds, saying that the devil and all evildoers desire nothing but to sin and act wickedly, thereby distancing themselves from God, who is the supreme essence, is clearly true. By sinning and acting wickedly, they distance themselves from God and perish. As it is written:
"Those who are far from you will perish."
Psalms 73:27.
And what this person further adds, saying that the wicked desire of both the devil and wicked humans is so inclined and eager towards evil that if divine power permitted them, they would immerse themselves in sins to such an extent that even their very nature could be destroyed, is indeed exaggerated but perhaps not entirely false.

1972
05:24:31,032 --> 05:24:40,176
Similarly, he adds that because of the difficulty and impossibility imposed on them by divine power and providence, they do not fall into as deep an abyss of wickedness as they desire.

1973
05:24:40,176 --> 05:24:48,625
In their minds - both in the minds of evil spirits and very wicked people - there is an effort to try and a torment of repeatedly thinking about what they cannot achieve.

1974
05:24:48,625 --> 05:24:55,881
This effort indeed becomes a torment, a punishment, a torture for their minds, so that they are tortured and punished by their very own evil will.

1975
05:24:55,881 --> 05:25:06,467
He further adds that from this internal torment and punishment of the mind, while they cannot fulfill their desires because God opposes them, the soul becomes miserable, enduring the lack of their empty pleasures.

1976
05:25:06,467 --> 05:25:11,487
It is true that this perverse desire of the mind, whether fulfilled or not, makes the mind miserable.

1977
05:25:11,487 --> 05:25:17,798
But the mind is much more miserable when it is permitted to do such things than when it is prevented from them by divine power.

1978
05:25:17,798 --> 05:25:22,023
It is more unfortunate to be able to do evil than just to want to and not be able to.

1979
05:25:22,023 --> 05:25:43,692
Hence, the saying of the secular philosopher about someone is true: "O miserable one, who was allowed to sin!" Indeed, he who said this spoke the truth, because if the one about whom this was said were prevented from sinning, he would certainly be less miserable with just the will to sin. But when he was allowed to sin, with the most unfortunate permission, he was much more miserable both in the desire for evil and in the affection.

1980
05:25:44,040 --> 05:25:49,221
The reason why this person explains and reiterates everything he has mentioned is clarified at the end.

1981
05:25:49,221 --> 05:25:59,785
He says that the difficulty and impossibility faced by wicked angels or humans, due to God's opposition, will only occur in the eternal damnation of punitive destruction and the torment of their unjust desires.

1982
05:25:59,785 --> 05:26:09,141
They will suffer this torment in their minds because they will no longer be able to fulfill their perverse desires, nor will any external punishment from eternal fire be applied to them.

1983
05:26:09,141 --> 05:26:14,122
This, he says, is a manifest lie, contrary to faith and truth, as has been frequently shown before.

1984
05:26:14,122 --> 05:26:23,931
He then adds that the wicked serve God unwillingly: not the nature that God created in them, which He does not punish, but the evil will, which He did not create in them and which He does punish.

1985
05:26:23,931 --> 05:26:32,231
Therefore, they are punished by their own evil will, from which He justly does not free them, and in a way, He allows them to prepare for this punishment themselves.

1986
05:26:32,231 --> 05:26:34,243
His intention is similar in these words.

1987
05:26:34,243 --> 05:26:41,940
He says that all the wicked, both evil angels and humans, in their subjection to God's power and judgment, will unwillingly serve the divine disposition.

1988
05:26:41,940 --> 05:26:53,258
According to his understanding, they will be unwillingly subjected to God not by the nature that God created in them, which He never punishes, but by the evil will, which He did not create in them and which He alone punishes.

1989
05:26:53,258 --> 05:27:00,049
From the fact that they serve divine judgment unwillingly, they are punished not by external torment, but internally in their own will.

1990
05:27:00,049 --> 05:27:06,639
Their will becomes their punishment as it desires to be wickedly free but is restrained from that perverse freedom by divine power.

1991
05:27:06,639 --> 05:27:15,694
Therefore, he says, the only punishment of wicked angels and humans is that in desiring but failing to obtain the freedom of wickedness, they are tormented by their own will alone.

1992
05:27:16,248 --> 05:27:23,819
The nature by which they exist in spirit or body is created by God, and therefore, it never sins, is never punished, and never suffers any torment.

1993
05:27:23,819 --> 05:27:28,969
Regarding all these matters, as the Lord has provided, we have already responded sufficiently above.

1994
05:27:28,969 --> 05:27:39,167
Here, we raise only one point for everyone to consider, indeed even to condemn: how he claims, against human understanding and apostolic truth, that nature does not sin, but only the will of nature.

1995
05:27:39,167 --> 05:27:47,974
For who among humans has ever said that when someone commits adultery, gluttony, or drunkenness, only the will sins in that person, and neither the soul nor the body sins?

1996
05:27:47,974 --> 05:28:00,283
On the contrary, according to the truth of the Catholic faith, all souls with their bodies must be brought to the judgment of Almighty God, so that just as they have sinned in both and through both, they may be judged and punished in both.

1997
05:28:00,283 --> 05:28:07,958
For if the nature of the bodies of the wicked is entirely free from sins, what need is there for it to rise again, since it deserves no condemnation?

1998
05:28:07,958 --> 05:28:13,932
Or how will it justly be condemned with its soul, if it had no partnership in sinning, and incurred no merit of sin?

1999
05:28:13,932 --> 05:28:23,151
If this were so, it would be sufficient for only the soul to be presented at judgment, and for the evil will, since it inhabits it, which he says alone sins, to be punished in it.

2000
05:28:23,151 --> 05:28:29,023
Thus, such an assertion of impiety not only attacks the faith of the truth but also the faith of the resurrection.

2001
05:28:29,023 --> 05:28:34,122
The Apostle says: Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey its desires.

2002
05:28:34,122 --> 05:28:43,753
Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.

2003
05:28:43,753 --> 05:28:44,577
Romans 6:12, 13.

2004
05:28:45,144 --> 05:29:03,216
So, according to the Apostle of Christ, if sin reigns in our mortal body, and it holds its power there when we obey its desires, causing our actions to become tools of wickedness for sin, which then overpowers and harms our soul, how does the body not sin, nor the sin pertain to it, in which the kingdom of sin dwells and the army of sin operates?

2005
05:29:03,216 --> 05:29:08,640
Chapter Nineteen
In the nineteenth, and final, chapter, it says:

2006
05:29:08,640 --> 05:29:17,112
This eternal fire is the fourth element of the world, where the bodies of the saints will be transformed into an ethereal state, and the bodies of the wicked into an airy state.

2007
05:29:17,112 --> 05:29:22,617
In this transformation, there will be great joy for the natures themselves, but unspeakable torment for evil wills.

2008
05:29:22,617 --> 05:29:26,973
The bodies of all the wicked angels and humans will suffer the punishments of eternal fire.

2009
05:29:26,973 --> 05:29:31,664
Their substance will not perish, their beauty will not fade, and their natural health will remain.

2010
05:29:31,664 --> 05:29:39,514
All the good qualities of nature will shine forth in a marvelous order for the adornment of the universe, except for the blessedness which they will be deprived of.

2011
05:29:39,514 --> 05:29:47,891
With the higher corporeal fire contending with the bodies of the lower air, the natural force preserved, the unhappy souls will suffer eternal hardships from their own bodies.

2012
05:29:47,891 --> 05:29:56,124
This same fire will be glory for all bodies, but for the damned souls, it will be filled with punishment both internally by their own wickedness and externally by the fire.

2013
05:29:56,124 --> 05:30:02,059
In these fantastical words, full of every madness and delirium, the simplicity of faith and apostolic confession is omitted.

2014
05:30:02,059 --> 05:30:12,590
The whole Church believes and confesses that our Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and will come from there to judge the living and the dead.

2015
05:30:12,590 --> 05:30:17,664
At his coming, there will be the resurrection of the flesh and the granting of eternal life to the saints.

2016
05:30:17,664 --> 05:30:24,844
This simplest and purest confession of piety is omitted, never mentioning Christ's coming from heaven, never recalling the resurrection from the dead.

2017
05:30:24,844 --> 05:30:34,705
Everything is confused and obscured with certain inventions, making it hard to recognize any truth of the resurrection, divine judgment, eternal punishment, or the future life of the saints in his writings.

2018
05:30:35,232 --> 05:30:46,299
He says that in the eternal fire, which he considers to be the fourth element of the world, located naturally above the earth, waters, and air, the bodies of the saints will be transformed into an ethereal quality.

2019
05:30:46,299 --> 05:30:49,660
Even the bodies of the wicked will transition to an airy quality.

2020
05:30:49,660 --> 05:31:04,451
This view clearly contradicts the apostolic doctrine, which states that the resurrection and transformation of the saints will not occur in the fourth element of the world, nor in some fiery furnace, but in this earthly dwelling place, where both the just and the unjust lived and died.

2021
05:31:04,451 --> 05:31:14,690
This miraculous and ineffable transformation will happen with incredible speed, as the Apostle himself says, in a moment, in the blink of an eye, which is indeed the fastest of all bodily movements.

2022
05:31:14,690 --> 05:32:02,889
He states: "We will all rise, but not all of us will be transformed. In a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will rise incorruptible, and we will be transformed" First Corinthians 15:51-52. These words clearly describe the general resurrection of all.
However, he specifies this general resurrection when he says that we will all rise, but not all of us will be transformed. When he adds: "And the dead will rise incorruptible, and we will be transformed," he shows that all will rise with their bodies, but not all will be transformed with the glorification of the just. The wicked will rise incorruptible in the sense that they will no longer be able to die; however, they will be entirely capable of feeling and enduring eternal punishments and tortures. As the Scripture says, fire and worms will be given into their flesh to burn and torment them forever Judith 16:21.

2023
05:32:03,096 --> 05:32:09,273
The righteous, on whose behalf the Apostle speaks, will be changed and rise incorruptible, no longer subject to death.

2024
05:32:09,273 --> 05:33:13,243
They will have the special privilege of their bodies being transformed for the better, as the Apostle explains:
"For this perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality"
First Corinthians 15:53.
This means that the same body, now perishable and mortal in the saints, will become imperishable and immortal by the power of the resurrection. It will be clothed with incorruption and immortality.
The incorruptibility of the saints will be so great that they will no longer experience pain, labor, trouble, or need.
Through the immortality granted to them, death will be swallowed up in their bodies. Not only will death be eradicated, but the cause of death, the sting of sin, will be utterly destroyed.
However, the sting of sin will never be eliminated in the bodies of the damned, so they will never truly be free from death.
Regarding this blessed transformation of the righteous, the Apostle says:
"When this perishable body puts on imperishability, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?'"
First Corinthians 15:54-55.

2025
05:33:13,296 --> 05:33:24,749
Regarding the transformation of the wicked and the eternal punishments of the damned, whose bodies, according to this person, will be changed into an airy quality in a new and unheard-of kind of error, the Apostle says nothing at all.

2026
05:33:24,749 --> 05:33:31,406
Therefore, we should rather disdain such a fantasy than listen to it, lest we become itching ears and turn away from the truth to myths.

2027
05:33:31,406 --> 05:33:34,391
How, according to him, will they change into an airy quality?

2028
05:33:34,391 --> 05:33:43,055
For if they become airy from earthly, it will not be a true resurrection, because the same bodies will not arise that fell through death; those were earthly, these will be airy.

2029
05:33:43,055 --> 05:33:52,404
But if the nature of earthly bodies remains, and yet they take on the quality of air, being changed by the subtlety of the air and winds, the faith of the Church does not accept this novelty.

2030
05:33:52,404 --> 05:33:56,613
As already mentioned, the Apostle says nothing about the transformation of the wicked.

2031
05:33:56,613 --> 05:34:15,261
But what he says about the bodies of the saints being changed into an ethereal quality, if he believes this change will occur while their nature remains, so that the same bodies that fell in death and were raised in resurrection will be glorified with heavenly brightness and become luminous from being obscure, it is enough for us to hold to this wondrous clarification of theirs.

2032
05:34:15,261 --> 05:34:21,184
As the Lord says about them: "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father" (Matthew 13:43).

2033
05:34:21,184 --> 05:34:33,029
But if he says the same bodies will be changed into an ethereal quality so that they lose their nature and become heavenly instead of earthly, he clearly contradicts the truth of the resurrection and is therefore not to be listened to at all.

2034
05:34:33,029 --> 05:34:58,383
Anyone who desires to simply, purely, and truly understand the resurrection of the saints and the nature of spiritual bodies should listen to and faithfully hold what the blessed Augustine sincerely teaches about these matters, saying:
He adds and says: "And in this wonderful joy of natures within themselves will be perfected, but the ineffable torment of evil wills; that is, to speak according to his sense, the wonderful joy of natures will be perfected there only, which according to him have not sinned at all."

2035
05:34:58,824 --> 05:35:09,264
The joy of nature lies in the belief that the earthly body will change: for the wicked, it will take on an airy quality, while for the holy, it will ascend to an even higher glory, an ethereal quality.

2036
05:35:09,264 --> 05:35:13,056
The wicked will face indescribable torment from their own bad conscience.

2037
05:35:13,056 --> 05:35:15,913
This idea has already been proven to be vain and false.

2038
05:35:15,913 --> 05:35:21,835
He further adds:
The bodies of all the wicked, both angels and humans, will suffer the punishment of eternal fire.

2039
05:35:21,835 --> 05:35:34,197
Their substance will not perish, their beauty will not diminish, and their natural integrity will remain intact, showcasing the good qualities of nature for the adornment of the universe, except for the happiness they will be deprived of.

2040
05:35:34,197 --> 05:35:42,924
It is surprising that he says: The bodies of all the wicked, both angels and humans, will undergo the punishment of eternal fire, which he previously denied repeatedly.

2041
05:35:42,924 --> 05:35:56,793
In this instance, he either falsely confessed this, being deceitful to God by lying about his faith while presenting truth with his mouth, as it is written:
"You will destroy all who speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man" (Psalms 5:6-7).

2042
05:35:56,793 --> 05:36:06,091
Or if he confessed this truthfully out of fear of offending the Church to avoid being judged as faithless, the confession is empty and worthless due to his prior multiple denials.

2043
05:36:06,091 --> 05:36:27,544
For us, it is not permissible to say one thing now and another later in matters of faith:
What the Church received from the Lord and his apostles must be believed and confessed;
so that we may hold it with unchangeable truth, as the Lord commanded, saying:
"Let your statement be, 'Yes, yes; No, no'" (Matthew 5:37);
so that our truth may be confirmed by unchanging truth and falsehood rejected by our confession.

2044
05:36:27,960 --> 05:36:32,635
And yet, he reveals how strongly he believes in the torments of eternal fire in what follows.

2045
05:36:32,635 --> 05:36:51,688
After stating that the bodies of impious angels and humans will endure the torments of eternal fire, to clarify his belief, he immediately added:
This will happen in such a way that their substance, that is, the substance of the angels and wicked humans, will in no way perish, so that beauty will by no means be lacking to them, and their natural intactness will remain in them.

2046
05:36:51,688 --> 05:37:04,005
Behold what good he attributes to them in the torments of eternal fire, namely the integrity of nature, beauty, and intactness: so that they have the integrity of their nature, because their whole nature in soul and body will remain perpetually.

2047
05:37:04,005 --> 05:37:10,038
But let each faithful person consider where or how they might have beauty, for beauty is either of the soul or the body.

2048
05:37:10,038 --> 05:37:17,981
But which of the faithful would believe that there could be any beauty of souls there, where there will be the loss of all virtues and the filth of all vices?

2049
05:37:17,981 --> 05:37:21,047
For a soul is either beautiful by virtue or deformed by vice.

2050
05:37:21,047 --> 05:37:29,946
But what beauty of bodies could there be, where it will be obscured and darkened by the eternal horror of sadness, the eternal burning of fire, and the eternal tearing of worms?

2051
05:37:29,946 --> 05:37:42,363
What natural intactness could there be in those damned angels and humans, as he says, since their nature is preserved intact for them only for this purpose, and never separated from its natural frame, so that it may be fully tormented without end.

2052
05:37:42,363 --> 05:37:55,685
But he, not content with such foolishness and absurdity of his corrupted mind, adds at the end a most blatant error of heretical impiety, so that what he harbored in his heart against the truth and for the subversion of listeners, he also spewed out with his mouth.

2053
05:37:56,088 --> 05:38:06,579
He immediately adds about the similar natures of demons and condemned humans that afterwards that is, after those eternal fire punishments they will shine with all the good things of nature in a marvelous order.

2054
05:38:06,579 --> 05:38:18,513
They will be endowed and illuminated in their souls with the natural gifts of memory, intelligence, and free will; and in their bodies, they will shine and excel with the liveliness of the five natural senses and the beauty of perfect form.

2055
05:38:18,513 --> 05:38:27,065
He also says that they will be exempt from punishments and adorned with all natural goods so that they may enhance the adornment of the universe, shining with great beauty.

2056
05:38:27,065 --> 05:38:32,783
Among other earthly and heavenly creatures, they will remain as ornaments of the world, who were once in damnation.

2057
05:38:32,783 --> 05:38:42,131
And after this, lest it should seem entirely against the faith of the Church and the evangelical and apostolic truth, he added, except for the blessedness from which they will be deprived.

2058
05:38:42,131 --> 05:38:53,468
That is, they will shine with all the natural goods, demons and humans freed from punishments, except for the blessedness of the vision of God, which alone will be denied to them, so it may seem nothing good is lacking for them.

2059
05:38:53,468 --> 05:39:06,495
Behold what a man dares to think, to say, and even to write, who wants to appear Christian and strives for nothing else but to oppose Christian truth and to introduce the doctrines of heretics, with whom he is unfortunately united, into the purity of the Church.

2060
05:39:06,495 --> 05:39:12,064
For the Church of Christ denies and detests both, because both are heretical and entirely contrary to the truth.

2061
05:39:12,064 --> 05:39:26,882
That is, both the liberation of demons and humans from those eternal punishments and the existence of some intermediate place where those same demons and humans are in rest and abundance of all goods and clarity, neither in the damnation of eternal fire with the devil, nor in blessedness with God.

2062
05:39:26,882 --> 05:39:33,992
And it firmly holds that after that universal judgment, no one can be except either in eternal blessedness or, conversely, in perpetual misery.

2063
05:39:34,440 --> 05:39:42,050
For those who have been sent to either punishment or the joy of eternal life in that judgment, they will never be able to be elsewhere or different.

2064
05:39:42,050 --> 05:39:56,447
As the Lord clearly shows about both sides: the condemned, who will be on the left, and the blessed, who will be on the right, delivering an irreversible sentence when he says, "Then these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life" (Matthew 25:46).

2065
05:39:56,447 --> 05:40:02,206
If there will ever be an end to that eternal punishment, there will also (God forbid) be an end to eternal life.

2066
05:40:02,206 --> 05:40:08,222
But if eternal life will never end, without a doubt, that punishment, that is, eternal torment, can never end either.

2067
05:40:08,222 --> 05:40:17,427
Therefore, there will not be some, as this person imagines, placed in the middle so that they are neither blessed nor miserable, and yet have some rest outside the Father's house.

2068
05:40:17,427 --> 05:40:30,436
For the Lord clearly says, "In my Father's house are many mansions" (John 14:2), showing that outside his Father's house, that is, outside the community of holy angels and chosen humans, which he inhabits forever, there is no place, no mansions of rest.

2069
05:40:30,436 --> 05:40:43,651
For all that multitude and diversity of mansions is only in the Father's house, where just as in one heaven one star differs from another in brightness, so in one and the same house there will be a diversity of mansions according to the diversity of merits.

2070
05:40:43,651 --> 05:40:55,272
After this, he adds and says, "With the quality of the higher fiery bodies contending with the bodies of the lower air, the intention of the unhappy souls to endure eternal sufferings from their bodies is naturally preserved."

2071
05:40:55,632 --> 05:41:09,958
Here is how he believes, if indeed he believes, that the eternal fire will be executed: He thinks this fire, which is the higher element, will affect the bodies of demons, which he believes are airy, and the bodies of wicked people, which he previously said would turn airy as well.

2072
05:41:09,958 --> 05:41:13,464
Now he explicitly states they are airy, just like the demons' bodies.

2073
05:41:13,464 --> 05:41:24,692
The nature of both elements-fire (which he believes to be the eternal fire in the punishment of the damned) and air (which he believes to be in the bodies of demons and lost people)-will clash in that prison of damnation.

2074
05:41:24,692 --> 05:41:30,433
This causes the unfortunate souls of both humans and demons to suffer eternal punishments from their airy bodies.

2075
05:41:30,433 --> 05:41:36,478
This is because these two elements, fire and air, will retain their natural force even in that furnace of eternal fire.

2076
05:41:36,478 --> 05:41:55,429
Just as in this world, the higher fire's heat, through the sun's warmth, makes the lower air vaporize and boil, affecting our bodies with its vapor and heat; so, in that furnace of eternal punishment, the fire naturally inflames the airy bodies of demons and humans, causing the souls within them to endure eternal afflictions from the heat and burning of their own bodies.

2077
05:41:55,429 --> 05:42:09,654
Now, let him who feels and writes this explain how the unfortunate souls of both angelic and human creatures will ever be rescued from those punishments and, as he says, shine with all the goods of nature if their airy bodies will suffer eternal punishments from the fire's force.

2078
05:42:09,654 --> 05:42:18,138
For if they are freed from those punishments, they will certainly be free from afflictions; but if they are in eternal afflictions, they will never deserve liberation.

2079
05:42:18,138 --> 05:42:34,345
However, this person, explaining further how he thinks this punishment, so fictional and painstakingly crafted, will be, adds: Thus, evidently, this same fire will become glory for all bodies, while for the damned souls it will be filled with punishment from within by their own wickedness and from without by the fire.

2080
05:42:34,752 --> 05:42:45,851
These words seem to assert that the same eternal fire torments the souls of the damned both internally through their guilty conscience and externally by inflaming and heating their bodies, thereby increasing their punishment.

2081
05:42:45,851 --> 05:42:51,228
This means they are tortured not only internally by their conscience but also externally by fiery punishment.

2082
05:42:51,228 --> 05:42:54,928
However, the same fire imparts a certain glory to their bodies made of air.

2083
05:42:54,928 --> 05:43:16,091
We believe that just as this fire, which shines in the stars, illuminates the dark nature of this air with its glow-naturally dark unless lit by the rays of the sun by day or the moon and stars by night-so this person thinks that the bodies of demons and humans made of air will be enlightened and glorified by the radiance of that eternal fire, just as the blackness of iron is turned into brightness by the heat of the furnace.

2084
05:43:16,091 --> 05:43:22,010
So how could he have said earlier that the airy bodies of angels and humans will undergo the punishment of eternal fire?

2085
05:43:22,010 --> 05:43:28,325
If that eternal fire is punishment for them, it certainly will not be glory; if it is glory for them, it will not be punishment.

2086
05:43:28,325 --> 05:43:43,864
Therefore, rejecting and pushing away such tortuous and serpentine twists and laborious and pernicious windings, let us hold onto the simplicity of faith: believing that the true bodies of the damned humans, that is, earthly bodies, will endure true and eternal punishments for those who will suffer that damnation.

2087
05:43:43,864 --> 05:43:58,614
Because the truest Word of Truth says in the Gospel, "For the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear the voice of the Son of God: and those who have done good will come forth to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment" (John 5:28-29).

2088
05:43:58,614 --> 05:44:15,781
At the voice of the Son of God, all who are in the graves will come forth: they will receive the same bodies that were placed in the graves, and they will rise in those same bodies, having either the resurrection of life or the resurrection of judgment; so that they will either possess eternal life in those bodies or suffer eternal death in them.

2089
05:44:16,175 --> 05:44:22,557
It's essential for us, and absolutely necessary for our salvation, to be grounded in the truth and simplicity of faith.

2090
05:44:22,557 --> 05:44:31,460
We should fear and, with the Lord's help, avoid the evil that the Apostle warns the Church, betrothed to Christ and endowed with the virginity of pure faith, to fear.

2091
05:44:31,460 --> 05:44:45,404
He says: "For I betrothed you to one man to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I fear that just as the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning, your minds may be corrupted and fall away from the simplicity that is in Christ." (Second Corinthians 11:23).

2092
05:44:45,404 --> 05:44:50,874
Therefore, he also warns elsewhere, saying: "Avoid foolish and old wives' tales." (First Timothy 4:7).

2093
05:44:50,874 --> 05:44:58,757
And again: "Avoid profane and idle chatter, for it will lead to more ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene." (Second Timothy 2:17).

2094
05:44:58,757 --> 05:45:18,493
In the same spirit and concern, the blessed Apostle Peter also admonishes the faithful, saying: "Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." (Second Peter 3:17-18).

2095
05:45:18,493 --> 05:45:24,821
Let these not become for us like jokes and play, because even the Apostle calls Ishmael's play with Isaac persecution.

2096
05:45:24,821 --> 05:45:44,933
And so, wherever we recognize such things, we should be stirred by zeal for the faith against them, being guided and helped by the one who says in the psalm: "Zeal for your house consumes me." (Psalm 69:10); and who also, making a whip out of cords, drove out the violators of God's house with their wares, because they had made the same house of his Father a den of thieves.

2097
05:45:44,933 --> 05:45:45,576
(John 2:15).

2098
05:45:45,576 --> 05:46:04,293
Truly, they turn the house of the Lord, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth (First Timothy 3:15) into a den of thieves, and truly, they are thieves who, under the pretense of the Christian name, try to hide their infidelity and with deceitful and malicious arguments lay traps for the lives of the faithful.

2099
05:46:04,775 --> 05:47:45,695
And because this man, whose words we have responded to with the Lord's help using philosophical rules and syllogistic arguments, boasts, let us listen faithfully and obediently to the most blessed bishop and confessor of Christ, Hilary, as he reproves such men and says:
Likewise, the same glorious confessor, when he was explaining the words of the Apostle, who says:
"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ."
These are the words of the blessed Hilary.
But let us hear our Lord Himself, both terrifyingly and sweetly threatening and promising in the Apocalypse, about how much punishment and damnation await not only the authors but also the supporters of lies, and with what pious intention one should withdraw from such people, so that each of the faithful, cleansed and pure in faith, may deserve to have a share in the tree of life:
"The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son. But for the cowardly and the faithless, the detestable, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death" Revelation 21:7-8.
And again:
"Its gates will never be shut by day-and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life" Revelation 21:25-27.
And again:
"Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches" Revelation 22:14-16.
