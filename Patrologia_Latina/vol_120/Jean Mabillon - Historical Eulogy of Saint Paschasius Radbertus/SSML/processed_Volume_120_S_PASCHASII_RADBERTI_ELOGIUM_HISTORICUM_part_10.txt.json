Posteriores istius controversiae partes tuebantur plerique omnes;\npriores Ratramnus, Corbeiae Gallicae coenobita, edito\nlibello de Nativitate Christi, ratus, Christum, si communi\nvia non processisset ex matre, non vere natum\ngenitumve, sed violenter egressum dici debere. Ratramnum\nejusque sequaces refutavit Paschasius, asserens\nChristum haud secundum communem legis naturam fuisse natum, qui non secundum usum naturae\nin utero de carne Virginis esset procreatus. Sic quorumdam\nfratrum impudicam (quam vocat) temeritatem\ncompescere tentavit uno libro; at cum nec sic\ndiscederent a sententia sua, sed sive scriptis, seu verbis\neam propugnare pergerent, addidit secundum, totumque\nopus venerabili matronae Christi, una cum Christi\nvirginibus Vesona monastice degentibus nuncupavit. Haec Christi matrona est Theodrada parthenonis\nbeatae Mariae apud Suessiones abbatissa, sic dicta,\nquod in saeculo conjugata fuisset. Nam Immam ipsius\nTheodradae filiam, et in coenobii regimine subsequacem, perpetuo virginem Christi ac filiam appellat\nPaschasius in explicatione psalmi XLIV. Itaque primum\nsaltem hujus operis de Nativitate Christi librum\nscripsit Paschasius ante annum 846, quo Theodrada\ne vivis excesserat. Scripsit, inquam, multo senio jam\nconfectus, ut ipse in praefatione testatur, id est sexagenario\nmajor. Ex quo intelligitur eum ad annum\naetatis prope octogenarium pervenisse, cum annum\nChristi 860 attigerit aut forte excesserit. Certe saeculo\noctavo natus adultusque fuerat, ut colligitur ex\nlib. I de Epitaphio Walae cap. 3. 38. Libellum de Passione sanctorum Rufini et Valerii\ncomposuit abbas rogatu incolarum oppidi ipsis\ndicati, quod Basilicas  vocant, in pago\nSuessionensi. 38."

These words describe the rite of Benedictine profession, by which those professing promise obedience, conversion of manners, and stability in the congregation.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
