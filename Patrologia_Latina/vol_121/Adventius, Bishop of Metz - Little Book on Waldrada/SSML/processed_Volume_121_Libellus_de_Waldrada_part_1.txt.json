I understood it this way: The most Christian Emperor, in the faith of Christ and his own, gave a virgin to his son. The faith of God does not give a harlot but rejects it, saying: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"You shall not commit adultery\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈɛksədəs\">Exodus</phoneme> 20). \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        And the Psalmist says: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"You will destroy all who are unfaithful to you\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"sɑːm\">Psalm</phoneme> 73). Paul, who was girded with the faith of God, exclaims, saying: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"Understand this, that no fornicator, impure person, or covetous man, which is idolatry, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ɪˈfiːʒənz\">Ephesians</phoneme> 5). \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        He who bears the mark of Jesus in his body, which is the banner of faith, does not support adulterers but pierces them with the spear of sacred zeal, saying: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"Neither shall adulterers inherit the kingdom of God\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"fɜːst kəˈrɪnθiənz\">First Corinthians</phoneme> 6). The Lord, who is faithful and gives the holy promises of David and to the orthodox Emperor Lothair, did not take away the power to marry his son to any girl he had decided upon, says in the Gospel: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈmæθjuː\">Matthew</phoneme> 19). \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, it is necessary for those who hear this to listen to and keep the paternal canons with pious and devoted zeal, because one should never transgress the boundaries of the Fathers. For the sacred canons proclaim by paternal gift that a woman given is free from blame. The Emperor, who was devoted to divine worship, did not permit his son, King Lothair, to engage in the detestable crime of fornication. The profession of all the senators was such regarding the union with Waldrada, that his father had given her to him in the faith of God. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Regarding Theutberga, who confessed and was proven guilty of the evil of her crime due to the horrendous embrace of her shameless brother, they similarly protested entirely. She was neither terrified by our fearful threats nor comforted by pleasant flattery. He himself, according to the Apostle, did as he says: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (<phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈroʊmənz\">Romans</phoneme> 12).\n    </p>\n</speak>",
