Ex verbis Anonymi Cellotiani jus mihi vindico ut\n omnes intelligant tam varias hominum fidelium discrepantesque\nsententias de causa Eucharistiae non\nreputari factiones, hoc est diversas partes veritati\nfidei repugnantes. Observat Ratramnus num. 11\ntotam hanc controversiam esse inter fideles exortam. Sed, utcunque res sit, cum Anonymus Cellotianus\nscriptor sit humillimi ingenii et nullius meriti, cujus\ntestimonio solitario nititur persuasio eorum qui\nRatramnum et Paschasium inter se depraeliatos\nfuisse sibi fingunt, tota haec controversia faciliter\ndirimi potest ex lectione accurata librorum Ratramni,\nPaschasii et Anonymi Cellotiani, ex quibus\nperspectum habebit lector istum Anonymum nec\nRatramni mentem nec Paschasii assecutum esse. Enimvero cum Anonymus non animadverterit Ratramnum\nnunquam negare corpus de Maria natum\nVirgine in Eucharistia reperiri, sed solum a corpore\nquod celebratur in Ecclesia differre, scilicet a\ncorpore nuncupativo sub quo occulitur et latet verum\ncorpus: cum etiam Ratramnus neget solum illud\n corpus nuncupativum esse de Maria natum, iste\nAnonymus sibi persuasit Paschasium, qui asserit\nverum corpus de Maria natum esse in Eucharistia,\net Ratramnum, qui negat corpus nuncupativum esse\nde Maria natum, sibi invicem esse contrarios: cum\nrevera, posita distinctione corporis nuncupativi et\nveri, seu corporis veri occulti sub umbra corporis\nfigurati, faciliter conciliari et ad concordiam adduci\npossint.",

Yet, since the Anonymous Cellotian is a writer of very humble talent and little merit, whose solitary testimony supports the belief that Ratramnus and Paschasius were in conflict, this whole controversy can be easily resolved by carefully reading the works of Ratramnus, Paschasius, and the Anonymous Cellotian. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        From these, a reader will understand that this Anonymous neither grasped the mind of Ratramnus nor of Paschasius. Indeed, the Anonymous failed to notice that Ratramnus never denies the body born of the Virgin Mary is present in the Eucharist, but only states that it differs from the body celebrated in the Church, which is a nominal body under which the true body is hidden and concealed. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        And since Ratramnus only denies that this nominal body is the one born of Mary, the Anonymous mistakenly believed that Paschasius, who claims that the true body born of Mary is in the Eucharist, and Ratramnus, who denies the nominal body is born of Mary, are opposed to each other. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In fact, considering the distinction between the nominal body and the true body, or the true body hidden under the figurative body, they can easily be reconciled and brought to agreement.\n    </p>\n</speak>"
