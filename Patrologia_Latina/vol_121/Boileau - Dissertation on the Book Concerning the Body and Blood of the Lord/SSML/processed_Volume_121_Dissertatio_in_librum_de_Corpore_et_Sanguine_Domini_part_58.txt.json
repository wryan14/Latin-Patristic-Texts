      "original_latin": "RESPONSIO. Exscribere tantummodo opus est concepta verba\nex hoc numero 78, ut perspiciat lector quam supervacaneum\nsit ejusmodi opinionem ascribere Ratramno\net suasionem non esse extra mentem in altari corpus\nChristi; ait enim: Aliud est quod exterius geritur,\naliud quod per fidem creditur. Nunquid non hoc\nverum est cum exterius species tantum videantur\n panis et vini, et interius existere corpus Christi\nvere credatur? Ad sensum quod pertinet corporis\ncorruptibile est; quod fides vero credit, incorruptibile. Estne in his aliquid commentitii et falsi? cum species quotidie corrumpantur, corpus vero\nChristi quod fidei objectum est, nulla corruptione\nvioletur. Exterius quod apparet non est ipsa res. Albedo,\nrotunditas, sapor panis, odor vini, sunt ne corpus\nChristi? Sed imago rei nunquid non revera sunt\nimago, figura, velamen, operculum, quo fallit oculos\nhominum? Mente vero quod sentitur, veritas rei, cum\nres ipsa sit corpus Christi, veritas rei est veritas\ncorporis Christi: et cum sit veritas non chimaera\nnec ens rationis, an per solam cogitationem mentis\nexistit et non per se verum et solidum mentis objectum? LV. (Edit. Amstelodam. pag. 296, Paris. 191.) Num. 89 et 94. Ratramnus fide spiritualiter animam\npasci ait, dum non attenditur quod corpus pascit quod\n dente premitur, quod per partes comminuitur, sed\nquod in fide spiritualiter accipitur, innues nimirum\nextra fidem nihil esse nisi quod corpus pascit, dente\npremitur. Nec dici posse, quod profitetur Ecclesia\nDei cum Paulo et Augustino, imo cum Christo Domino. Quod videtis est corpus meum.",
