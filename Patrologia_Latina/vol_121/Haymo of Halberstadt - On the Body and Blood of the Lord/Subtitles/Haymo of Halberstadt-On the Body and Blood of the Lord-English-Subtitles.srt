On the Body and Blood of the Lord

2
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:08,037
Since this letter gives us a chance to discuss this great sacrament in detail, let's share what His grace has given us.

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:12,815
He chose to leave this sacrament of His body and blood on earth for the salvation of faithful souls.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:16,541
This strengthens the integrity of faith and increases the merits of believers.

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:22,609
Therefore, it is sheer madness for believers to doubt that the bread and wine on the altar become the body and blood of Christ.

6
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:29,967
This transformation happens through the mystery of the priest and the act of thanksgiving, with God performing this through divine grace and secret power.

7
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:36,178
We believe, faithfully confess, and hold that the bread and wine, by divine power, are substantially changed into flesh and blood.

8
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:43,870
It is not impossible for God's omnipotence to change established natures as He wishes, just as it wasn't impossible for Him to create those natures from nothing.

9
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,647
If He can make something out of nothing, then it is not impossible to change one thing into another.

10
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:54,381
Therefore, the invisible priest changes His visible creations into the substance of His flesh and blood by secret power.

11
00:00:54,381 --> 00:01:04,700
In this body and blood of Christ, the taste and appearance of bread and wine remain for the reverence of those receiving it, while the nature of the substances is entirely converted into the body and blood of Christ.

12
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,000
The senses of the flesh perceive one thing, while the faith of the mind perceives another.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,163
The senses can only perceive what they feel, but the intellect and faith proclaim and confess the true flesh and blood of Christ.

14
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:20,371
Believers receive the crown and merit of their faith because they fully believe in what is beyond the senses.

15
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,954
And it should be noted that the consecrated bread and cup are called signs.

16
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:32,806
This isn't about receiving Christ's flesh and blood physically, as some might mistakenly think, being overly influenced by their senses and blinded in their minds.

17
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:36,239
If that were the case, Christ's body and blood would cease to exist.

18
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,622
A sign is never the thing it signifies; it's always something else.

19
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:43,763
A sign, as long as it is recognized as such, is different from what it represents.

20
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:50,276
Therefore, the body and blood of Christ are called sacraments—holy signs—not of themselves, but as symbols for those who partake.

21
00:01:50,276 --> 00:02:04,465
Just as the bread, consecrated to become the body of Christ, is made from many grains into one loaf, and the drink, sanctified to become the blood of Christ, is made from many grapes into one drink, so all who worthily partake of this sacrament become one body in Christ from many.

22
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:08,101
The body and blood of Christ can also be viewed as signs in another way.

23
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:16,432
As we consume them and they become part of our bodies, symbolizing our unity with Him, this signifies the spiritual and eternal communion we will have in the future.

24
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:22,845
We will be united with Him forever, and we must confidently hope for this with complete faith, eager hope, and burning charity.

25
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:32,640
Those who partake of this sacrament must firmly believe that, no matter how small the amount they receive, they are taking in the whole body of Christ—not divided into parts, but entirely whole.

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,204
Just as a grain of wheat, when planted and dying, rises again and multiplies, each new grain contains the essence of the original.

27
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:44,708
Without this understanding, how could it be possible for each part of the grain to produce individual grains?

28
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:53,656
If we judged ourselves, meaning if we discussed and examined our lives to see whether we were worthy or not, and if we corrected our mistakes, we would not be judged.

29
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:58,004
That is, we would not be condemned by Christ, neither in this world nor in the future.

30
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:08,014
But when we are judged in small matters, specifically in those who are weak and sick in this present time, and even in those who die, we are corrected by the Lord and chastened in body through them.

31
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:12,008
This way, we are terrified by fear and not condemned eternally with this world.

32
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,738
That is, with the unbelievers and lovers of the world.

33
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:21,614
There is no difference from an unbeliever who irreverently, while stained with all criminal sins, presumes to approach the Lord's table.

34
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:28,945
In fact, he is worse and deserving of greater punishment, because it is better not to know the way of truth than, after knowing it, to turn back.

35
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:40,118
Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat the body and blood of Christ in the church, wait for one another, so that the offering of many may be celebrated together, and all may partake of one bread communally.

36
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,303
For that offering is one bread, and it should be shared by all.

37
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,376
If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home.

38
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:53,061
Meaning, if he is impatient and does not want to fast with the others, let him eat earthly bread at home, so that you do not come together for judgment.

39
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:57,358
That is, so you do not partake of the body of Christ unworthily to your condemnation.

40
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:01,504
The rest, meaning those things that remain disordered, I will arrange when I come.
