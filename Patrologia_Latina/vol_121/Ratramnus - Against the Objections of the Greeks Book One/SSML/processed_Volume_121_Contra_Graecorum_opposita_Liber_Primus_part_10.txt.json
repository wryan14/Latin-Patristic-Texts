            "original_latin": "Et cum venerit\nille, arguet mundum de peccato, et de justitia, et de\njudicio (Joan XVI 7). Quod Apocalypsis dicit de\nigne altaris, quod miserit angelus eum in terram, et\nfacta sint tonitrua; hoc est quod Salvator ait: Mittam\neum ad vos; et cum venerit ille, arguet mundum. Post adventum Spiritus sancti quae tonitrua et voces\npraedicationum insonuerint, quanto pavore mortalium\ncorda concusserint, quae fulgura miraculorum\ncoruscaverint, qui terrae motus exstiterint duritiam\nmortalium concutientes, totus orbis agnovit; ignem\nautem altaris Spiritum sanctum dicit Christi, quem\n ipse se missurum promittit apostolis; et Apocalypsis\ntestatur quod miserit eum in terram, manifeste docens\nquod Spiritus sanctus, Spiritus sit Filii, et ab\nipso sit post ascensionem ejus super apostolos missus. Quomodo namque mittitur a Filio, nisi procedendo? et procedit ab eo, cujus est Spiritus. Item in eadem Apocalypsi Joannes: Et vidi coelum\napertum, et ecce equus albus, et qui sedebat super eum\nvocabatur fidelis et verax, et justitia judicat et pugnat:\noculi autem ejus sicut flamma ignis (Apoc XIX 21). Equus albus corpus est Christi sanctitatis candore\nperfusum, maculam nullam habens; sessor ejus, divinitas\nChristi, quae sic hominem quem suscepit, regit,\net sedet, ut unum faciat Filium, ex divinitate,\n Patris; ex humanitate, matris substantiam continentem;\ncujus oculi sunt velut flamma ignis, quia\nsancti Spiritus divinitas et splendor flammificus in\neo consistit: de cujus plenitudine velut oculorum\nlux effulget; tali figura significans, imo clarissime\ndocens divinitatem Spiritus a Filii divinitate procedere;\net tanquam lumen oculorum ejus dicitur esse,\ncujus sunt oculi: ita Spiritus sanctus, Spiritus est\nChristi, in quo consistit, et a quo procedit.",
