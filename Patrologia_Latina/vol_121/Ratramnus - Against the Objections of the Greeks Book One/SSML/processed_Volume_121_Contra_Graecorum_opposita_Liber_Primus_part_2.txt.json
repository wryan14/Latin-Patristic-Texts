      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n\nSo, our Ratramnus took on this task and completed it skillfully and thoroughly in four books. In the first books, he focuses entirely on the Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the Greek and Latin Fathers to refute the heresies of the innovators and uphold the Catholic truth about the Holy Spirit. In the fourth book, he discusses various practices related to Lent, the different ways food is used, fasting on Saturdays among the Latins, the shaving and tonsure of clergy, clerical celibacy, the sacrament of Confirmation given only by bishops, the supreme authority of the Roman Pope over the Patriarch of Constantinople and all the bishops of the Christian world, and other church ritualsâ€”doing so very successfully. Anyone who reads these four books will easily see how well-versed Ratramnus was in the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the ancient Fathers and councils. This preface is too brief to fully praise such a great man, so I've decided to include some testimonies from other writers here. But before I go further, it's worth noting that Jacques Sirmond, a man of immortal memory, when publishing certain works of Saint Fulgentius, mistakenly attributed Ratramnus' books to Hincmar of Rheims in a fragment at the end of his work. He even included Ratramnus' exact words as if they were Hincmar's. Why Sirmond made this mistake and misattributed these works to someone else is unknown to me, especially since he should have recognized this work as not being insignificant and added it to the other works of Hincmar, which he had diligently gathered for almost forty-eight years. Now, let us present the testimonies. SIGIBERT in his work on Church Writers, chapter...\n</speak>",
