00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,952
Four Books Against the Objections of the Greeks
by Ratramnus, a Monk of Corbie

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:06,371
NOTICE.

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:02:03,768
These words at the end of the fourth book suggest that Ratramnus composed these works at the urging or command of the bishops:
"We have done our best in response to your request.
If you find this pleasing, we thank God; but if it displeases you, we await your correction."
Indeed, the supreme hierarch of the Church, Pope Nicholas the First, had written to the bishops of Gaul, urging them to respond to the objections raised by the Greeks, who were adversaries of the Roman See.
As Frodoard relates in the Ecclesiastical History of Reims, Book 3, Chapter 17:
"Pope Nicholas sent a letter to Hincmar and the other archbishops and bishops in the kingdom of Charles, stating that the Greek emperors and Eastern bishops were slandering the holy Roman Church, and the entire Church that uses the Latin language.
They claim that we fast on Saturdays; that we say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son; that we prohibit priests from anointing the foreheads of the baptized with chrism.
The Greeks say that we Latins make chrism from river water.
They criticize us for not ceasing to eat cheese and eggs for eight weeks.
They also say that at Easter we bless and offer a lamb on the altar along with the Lord's body, as the Jews do.
They are also angry with us because our clergy shave their beards; and they say that a deacon is ordained as a bishop among us without first being a priest, etc."
Then he includes the words of Nicholas's letter:
"Your charity, Hincmar, when you read this letter, should make every effort to ensure it is also delivered to the other archbishops in the kingdom of our glorious king Charles, so that each one, along with their suffragans, may properly address these matters in their own dioceses, and inform us of what they find.
Do not neglect to encourage them, etc."
This summarizes the schism in the East incited by Photius, the false patriarch of Constantinople, and supported by the Greek emperors Michael and Basil.

4
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:09,298
So, our Ratramnus took on this task and completed it skillfully and thoroughly in four books.

5
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:21,490
In the first books, he focuses entirely on the Holy Scriptures and the teachings of the Greek and Latin Fathers to refute the heresies of the innovators and uphold the Catholic truth about the Holy Spirit.

6
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:46,468
In the fourth book, he discusses various practices related to Lent, the different ways food is used, fasting on Saturdays among the Latins, the shaving and tonsure of clergy, clerical celibacy, the sacrament of Confirmation given only by bishops, the supreme authority of the Roman Pope over the Patriarch of Constantinople and all the bishops of the Christian world, and other church rituals—doing so very successfully.

7
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:55,746
Anyone who reads these four books will easily see how well-versed Ratramnus was in the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the ancient Fathers and councils.

8
00:02:55,746 --> 00:03:03,359
This preface is too brief to fully praise such a great man, so I've decided to include some testimonies from other writers here.

9
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:17,572
But before I go further, it's worth noting that Jacques Sirmond, a man of immortal memory, when publishing certain works of Saint Fulgentius, mistakenly attributed Ratramnus' books to Hincmar of Rheims in a fragment at the end of his work.

10
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,497
He even included Ratramnus' exact words as if they were Hincmar's.

11
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:38,150
Why Sirmond made this mistake and misattributed these works to someone else is unknown to me, especially since he should have recognized this work as not being insignificant and added it to the other works of Hincmar, which he had diligently gathered for almost forty-eight years.

12
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,291
Now, let us present the testimonies.

13
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,145
SIGIBERT in his work on Church Writers, chapter.

14
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:43,205
.

15
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:43,264
.

16
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:52,263
Bertramus, also known as Ratramnus, wrote a book about the Body and Blood of the Lord and another on Predestination for Charles.

17
00:03:52,263 --> 00:04:07,274
Johannes Trithemius, an abbot, mentions in the book about Notable Men of the Order of Saint Benedict, Book 2, Chapter 48, that Bertramus was a monk, knowledgeable in the Holy Scriptures, and well-educated in secular literature.

18
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:10,778
He wrote significant works that showcased his genius.

19
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:18,978
Among these, Trithemius found only the book about the Body and Blood of the Lord and the book on Predestination for Charles.

20
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,623
Bertramus was prominent in the year 870.

21
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:34,319
Claudius Espenceus, a Parisian doctor, notes in his book about the Eucharist, Book 4, Chapter 19, that for 700 years, Bertramus was neither accused of heresy nor criticized for writing poorly.

22
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:42,254
He was included in the catalog of ecclesiastical writers as a notable man for his life, teaching, genius, and eloquence.

23
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:55,809
Claudius de Saintes, bishop of Evreux, also emphasizes in his book, Controversies about the Eucharist, Book 2, Chapter 14, that for 700 years, no one accused Bertramus of heresy or criticized his writings.

24
00:04:55,809 --> 00:05:03,215
He is noted in the catalog of ecclesiastical writers for his life, teaching, genius, eloquence, and catholicity.

25
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:20,805
Aubertus Miraeus, in his notes to the aforementioned chapter of Sigibert, mentions that Bertramus's book about the Body and Blood of the Lord was printed in Cologne in 1532, in Basel at the Mycropresbytery, and elsewhere, but was condemned by the Tridentine censors.

26
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:30,327
Molanus noted in the manuscript library that heretics first printed his works and seemed to have inserted obscure or seemingly perverse content.

27
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:45,602
In many places, Bertramus asserts the true presence of Christ and teaches transubstantiation, so much so that even the interpolator couldn't hide this, stating that many things do not cohere and precede contradicting the following.

28
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:50,429
Bartholomeus Petrus Lintrensis, a doctor of theology, also observed this.

29
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:51,817
Dionysius Petavius S.

30
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:51,950
J.

31
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,248
, in the volume of theological dogmas, Volume 2, Book 7, Chapter.

32
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:56,314
.

33
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:56,380
.

34
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:06,335
Before the end, he references Ratramnus, a respected and Catholic writer, to explain the term and the Son, which was added to the Nicene Creed.

35
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:18,611
Furthermore, Ratramnus, a monk of Corbie, in his second book for the Roman Church against the Greeks, written around 868 during the time of Photius, refutes the accusation of a corrupted creed.

36
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:29,106
He adds that Ratramnus wrote this after receiving an encyclical from Nicholas, which was sent to Hincmar and other bishops in the kingdom of Charles the Bald in 867.

37
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:38,265
This encyclical urged them to counter the Greeks' slanders against the Roman Church, which were raised by Emperor Michael and Basil in a letter.

38
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:52,831
John De Launoy, a doctor of Paris, in his dissertation on the old selection of foods, mentions on page 13 that Ratramnus, a monk of Corbie, responded to the Greeks' objections in a work written under the authority of the bishops.

39
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:56,774
De Launoy excerpts a lengthy passage from Book 4 of this work.

40
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:13,312
Gilbert Mauguin, a royal counselor, in chapter 17 of his Historical and Chronological Dissertation, notes that in the year 850, Ratramnus, a monk of Corbie and a significant figure in the Church of Christ, composed two books on Predestination by royal mandate.

41
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:16,301
He was the first to bring these books to light.

42
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:25,333
James De Sainte Beuve, a Sorbonne associate and royal professor, while lecturing on the Eucharist, defends Ratramnus with extensive erudition.

43
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:42,824
He teaches that Ratramnus earned a place among ecclesiastical and orthodox writers after Sigebert, Trithemius, Espencaeus, and Sanctesius, and composed a Catholic work on the Body and Blood of the Lord, based on the testimonies of Sigebert and others, and compelling reasons.

44
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:50,075
Another point is that for seven hundred years, no writer has accused Ratramnus of heresy, let alone condemned him.

45
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:57,656
The other one, however, you will not find praised anywhere by Berengar the heresiarch himself, nor by his disciples.

46
00:07:57,656 --> 00:08:09,511
Additionally, the book by Ratramnus was free from the censure of the Council of Vercelli, where Berengar’s impious doctrine and the works of John Scotus Erigena were condemned with eternal anathema.

47
00:08:09,511 --> 00:09:14,590
Finally, Sanbovaeus adds: Even if that work "On the Body and Blood of the Lord," which bears Bertram’s name, were genuinely his and not corrupted or altered, they still try in vain to persuade us that it is our Ratramnus or that it supports his heresy, due to the blemishes contained in that work. For he lived continuously within the Church and peacefully passed away in its communion.
Facundus says in book 10, chapter 5: The words are to be judged not by the mere sound, but by the intention of the speaker. And the intention of the speaker, when the person is already deceased, is judged by their religious communion.
And indeed, Ratramnus could be defended in a Catholic manner from the calumny of the heterodox, just as Athanasius once defended Dionysius of Alexandria. He presents a strong argument (he himself says in the letter about Dionysius’s opinion against the Arians) that they are not even telling the truth here, but are pressing the man with slanders, because he was never convicted of impiety by other bishops, nor did he separate from the Church by advocating heresy.

48
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:23,511
He peacefully passed away in it with piety, and his memory has been celebrated with the Fathers up to this time and has been included in the catalog.

49
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:33,808
If he had been of the same opinion as these men, or if he had not given an account of his writings, there is no doubt that he would have suffered the same fate as they did.

50
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:52,308
Finally, with such clear and evident proof in the aforementioned work of Ratramnus of the real presence of the body and blood of Christ under the Eucharistic species and of transubstantiation, the more obscure and difficult parts can be explained in an orthodox sense, according to the Rule of Facundus, book.

51
00:09:52,607 --> 00:10:09,166
Chapter 9, verse 5:
Just as slandering heretics tend to interpret doubtful and obscure things in a way that distorts what is certain and clear, it is wise and pious for Catholics to use what is indisputable and evident to clarify and confirm the ambiguous and hidden.

52
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,934
However, if some orthodox believers think otherwise, they should not be imitated by the wise.

53
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:22,128
These are the words of Acherius, who also notes that these books were published by him from the Thuaneus manuscript.

54
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:34,469
This manuscript was later compared by Baluzius in the Colbertine library, and he reported that, in some places, he found that the scribe of Acherius had been too creative in copying Ratramnus's work.

55
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,000
Book One

56
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,919
Chapter One
Response to the objections of Emperors Michael and Basil.

57
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,175
Objections of the Greeks.

58
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:50,408
The objections raised by Michael and Basil, emperors of the Greeks, against the Roman Church are known to be either false, heretical, superstitious, or irreligious.

59
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:56,533
Therefore, they rightfully deserve contempt, except that they could cause scandal and harm to the simple and less capable.

60
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:04,515
As it is written in the sayings of Solomon, spoken by the Holy Spirit: "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes" (Proverbs 26:5).

61
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:14,957
When they claim that we make chrism from water and place the lamb to be consecrated with the Lord's body on the holy day of Easter on the altar according to the custom of the Jews, are they not clearly lying?

62
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:20,781
They do not fear the words of the Psalmist, spoken by the Holy Spirit: "You destroy all who speak lies" (Psalm 5:7).

63
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:26,102
And what the Holy Spirit threatens elsewhere: "A false witness will not go unpunished" (Proverbs 19:5, 9).

64
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:46,234
Moreover, when they attempt to criticize not only the Roman but the entire Latin Church for confessing that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, according to the Catholic faith, while they say that He proceeds only from the Father, do they not condemn themselves with the perversity of heresy, remove themselves from the communion of the Church, and blaspheme against the Holy Spirit?

65
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:49,999
This sin, the Savior declares to be unforgivable in the Gospel (Mark 3:29).

66
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,317
Unless perhaps they can show that this was ever denied by their Catholic predecessors.

67
00:11:54,317 --> 00:12:00,592
For indeed, when they say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, they do not deny that He also proceeds from the Son.

68
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:14,850
If they wish to follow their predecessors, they will embrace the Catholic teaching that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, just as their predecessors did, who were well instructed by the sacred writings and knew perfectly well that the Spirit is of both the Father and the Son.

69
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,661
This will be demonstrated more clearly in the following.

70
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:22,603
Chapter Two
Again about the objections of the Greeks.

71
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,223
What duties fall upon emperors.

72
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:30,655
Now, they argue that we fast on the Sabbath or that we do not celebrate the Easter fast the same way they do.

73
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,495
Who cannot see the pride and foolishness in their claims?

74
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:36,485
They criticize those who fast and reproach those who do not.

75
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:38,429
If fasting is good, why do they accuse?

76
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:41,020
If it is bad, why do they practice what they accuse?

77
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,249
Perhaps the matter is judged based on who is doing it, so that fasting by a Latin is criticized, but by a Greek is venerated.

78
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,740
Thus, they judge either out of pride or ignorance.

79
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:57,065
But who can bear their criticism when they pretend to be virtuous, distancing themselves from women, and emulating sanctity of both flesh and soul?

80
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:01,401
These virtues should be praised among all, especially in ministers of the sacred altar.

81
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:07,879
It is their duty to attend to the sacred, offer constant service to the Divinity, and pray daily for the people entrusted to them.

82
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,164
Because our priests uphold these traditions, they are defamed for condemning marriage.

83
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:13,958
What do they attack if not religion?

84
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,144
What do they strive to destroy if not sanctity, without which no one can please God?

85
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,532
Who does not see the absurdity in criticizing the shaving of beards?

86
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:26,516
Or that our priests leave the anointing of the baptized's foreheads with holy chrism to the bishops?

87
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:30,352
Is there any divine command being transgressed in shaving or keeping a beard?

88
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:38,774
If priests do not anoint the foreheads with sacred unction, do they not complete the grace of baptism by performing the triple immersion in the name of the Holy Trinity?

89
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:42,760
These criticisms are seen as superstitions, not matters of religious importance.

90
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:50,882
Why be surprised if such accusations come from men who are experts in sacred law, supported by worldly power, and confident in imperial pride?

91
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:55,442
Matters of sacred doctrines and church rituals were for bishops to discuss, not emperors.

92
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:59,233
They were entrusted with learning, not teaching, in the Church's ministry.

93
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:04,971
Although emperors excel in imperial dignity, they are entrusted with public affairs, not the episcopal ministry.

94
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:09,940
Emperors should handle secular laws; bishops, on the other hand, should discuss divine doctrines.

95
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:25,975
They should strive to keep to their own roles, not usurp the episcopal office, lest what happened to King Uzziah, who presumed the priestly ministry, happens to them; he was struck with leprosy by divine power and was cast out not only from the temple but also from the people's community Second Chronicles 26:17.

96
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:37,707
Why then do these recent teachers, and dare we say, monstrous instructors, now try to call into question what their predecessors, if indeed they are children of the Church and followers of Catholic unity, always deemed venerable?

97
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:43,137
No new worship is practiced in the Roman Church now; no new religion, no new doctrine, no new institution.

98
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:50,617
We hold to and preserve what our ancestors held, taught, and left to their descendants to observe, adding nothing and taking nothing away from it.

99
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:53,588
What they believed about the Holy Spirit, we also believe.

100
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:57,533
They received it from the apostles, and the apostles received it from Christ.

101
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:01,580
The Church in both the East and the West has always remained in the same faith.

102
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,678
The apostles knew the saying that there is one faith, one baptism Ephesians 4:5.

103
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:11,519
And although heresies frequently arose, which, like bad fish, broke Christ's nets, Christ's tunic remained intact.

104
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:24,070
The institutions of our ancestors, established in their respective places, did not divide the unity of faith, even though they were not the same in all churches; nor did they lose the communion of mutual fellowship because of changes in customs.

105
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:30,935
For it is one thing to distinguish in matters of habit and conduct, and another to have a similar understanding of the unity of faith.

106
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,528
But we will discuss these matters later.

107
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:40,828
Now, let's get to the main points and talk about each of the gifts given by the grace of the Holy Spirit, without following the order of the proposed questions.

108
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:47,169
The order seems to be less thoughtfully arranged, as it appears to be organized with a light mind rather than with the gravity of prudence.

109
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,815
First, let's talk about what the Holy Spirit has given us.

110
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:54,104
This is the first and foremost thing, and it pertains to the foundation of the Catholic faith.

111
00:15:54,104 --> 00:16:00,719
It is essential to show that we feel and confess the same about Him as our Fathers did, and they felt and professed the same as the apostles did.

112
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:07,334
If anyone chooses to argue against the teaching of the apostles, they must also refute the teaching of Christ and the prophecies of the prophets.

113
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:13,649
Chapter Three
It is proven that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.

114
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,924
The Greeks are likened to Arius.

115
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,630
The Savior is the truth.

116
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,824
The Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth, that is, of Christ.

117
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:24,027
The Holy Spirit is called love.

118
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:30,330
You argue that we say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, while you say He proceeds from the Father only.

119
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,685
Let us consider the reading from the Gospel and take the essence of our response from it.

120
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:48,924
For the Savior speaks in the discourse He made to the disciples on the night He was to be betrayed, according to John, as follows:
"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about me" (John 15:26).

121
00:16:48,924 --> 00:17:59,973
You read "who proceeds from the Father" and refuse to hear the Son saying, "whom I will send to you from the Father."
Explain how He is sent by the Son:
for you do not deny that the Son says this, if you read the Gospel or if you believe in the Gospel?
Therefore, either confess that this mission is the procession, or, which is impious, claim it is mere service; and you will be with Arius, who perversely asserted that the Holy Spirit is lesser than the Son.
Let it not be that you wish to support Arius;
let it not be that you wish to affirm the Holy Spirit is lesser than the Father and the Son.
Therefore, when the Son says He will send the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He indeed admits that He says the Spirit proceeds from Himself, as He confirms He will send Him.
Perhaps there is a question because the Savior did not simply say, "Whom I will send to you," but added, "from the Father."
The Arians first raised this, wanting to create a distinction within the Divinity.
But the truth of the Gospel shows the unity of the entire Trinity as consubstantial.
The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, because He flows from His substance.
The Son also sends the Spirit of truth from the Father, because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, as He is born from the Father;
and just as the Son received substance from the Father by being born, so too He received from the Father the ability to send the Spirit of truth from Himself.

122
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:22,536
When it says, "Who proceeds from the Father," it doesn't deny proceeding from Himself. This is because the mission of the Son is the procession of the Holy Spirit, to send the Spirit of truth—not as if commanding a lesser one, but showing that just as the Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, He also proceeds from the Son.
And then, "But He will glorify me because He will take from what is mine and will announce it to you" (John 16:14).

123
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:27,030
What will the Holy Spirit take from the Son when they are of one substance and one power?

124
00:18:27,030 --> 00:19:01,665
Clearly, He said, "He will take from what is mine," meaning He proceeds from me. Just as the Father and the Son share one substance, the Holy Spirit, proceeding from both, shares in that same consubstantiality.
Don't be troubled by the phrase "He will take" in the future tense. This refers to His future mission to the disciples, not to the fact that He proceeds from the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and also from the Son, because the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three persons of the same substance.
Next, "All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said, He will take from what is mine and will announce it to you" (John 16:15).

125
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:07,370
If all that the Father has belongs to the Son, then the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of both the Father and the Son.

126
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,914
If He were only the Spirit of the Father, the Son wouldn't have everything the Father has.

127
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:16,206
But since the Son has all that the Father has, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of both.

128
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:19,286
We shouldn't think of this as diminishing or adding anything.

129
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:24,638
It's simply declared that just as the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, He also proceeds from the Son.

130
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:38,068
Earlier, Christ said, "When the Spirit of truth comes," and before that, "When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth." The Savior, who is the truth, testified to Philip, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).

131
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:38,989
John 14:6.

132
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:45,976
If truth is the Savior, and the Savior is the Son of the Father, then what else could the Spirit of truth be but the Spirit of the Son?

133
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:53,429
Thus, the Spirit of the Father, who proceeds from the Father, is also known as the Spirit of the Son, whom the Savior calls the Spirit of truth.

134
00:19:53,429 --> 00:20:06,472
If you question where the Spirit of truth comes from, consider where the Spirit of the Father comes from: for by proceeding from the Father, it is the Spirit of the Father; and by also proceeding from the Son, who is truth, it is the Spirit of the Son.

135
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,561
This is not said to imply subordination but to indicate the unity of substance.

136
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:15,323
Just as the Father and the Son share the same substance, the Holy Spirit proceeds from both.

137
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:24,794
Do not think that the Holy Spirit has two fathers because He proceeds from the Father and the Son; for the Holy Spirit is not the Son, and whoever is not the Son cannot have a father.

138
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:29,297
The Holy Spirit is also called love, as the blessed John says: God is love 1 John 4:16.

139
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:40,063
Commending this love, he writes to the faithful: And the anointing you received from Him remains in you; and you do not need anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things 1 John 2:27.

140
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,445
Similarly, the Savior says: When the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth John 16:13.

141
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:54,917
Whether you say: God is love; or you say: His anointing teaches you about all things; or you say: the Spirit of truth, who teaches you all truth: you are referring to the Holy Spirit.

142
00:20:54,917 --> 00:21:00,352
This love is the Father's love, by which He loved us; it is also the Son's love, by which He redeemed us.

143
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:13,653
But it is not a different love because it is said to be of the Father and of the Son: for with the same love with which the Father loves the Son, the Son loves the Father: for the Holy Spirit is the Father's love, and the Holy Spirit is also the Son's love.

144
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:19,657
The Father's love proceeds from the Father to love the Son; the Son's love proceeds from the Son to love the Father.

145
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:23,539
Therefore, it is one love from both, because one Spirit proceeds from both.

146
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:28,105
Christ cried out, saying: If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and drink.

147
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:28,696
(John 7:37).

148
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:33,719
Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within them.

149
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:38,595
The evangelist adds: He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive.

150
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:39,186
(John 7:39).

151
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:47,213
The streams of living water, as the evangelist explains, signify the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, which the Savior teaches will refresh those who believe in him.

152
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:50,267
So where do the streams come from if not from faith in Christ?

153
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,320
And where does faith come from if not from Christ’s teachings?

154
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:04,303
Just as Christ's teaching comes from Christ, and faith in that teaching comes from Christ, so too the streams of living water, that is, the Holy Spirit, proceed from Christ: for Christ is both perfect human and perfect God.

155
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:15,088
Because he is the perfect God, he grants and pours out the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from him, to those who believe in him; the streams of the Holy Spirit flood the hearts of believers with the fountain of eternal life.

156
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:22,475
He also said to the Samaritan woman: Whoever drinks this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks the water I will give them will never thirst.

157
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:26,760
The water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.

158
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,351
(John 4:13).

159
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:41,288
What he previously called streams of living water, he now calls a spring of water welling up to eternal life; in both instances, he wants us to understand the Holy Spirit, whom he clearly says is given by him when he says: The water I give them will become in them a spring of water.

160
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:49,611
What he gives, he gives from himself: he gives the spring of water welling up to eternal life, that is, he abundantly grants the Holy Spirit to those who believe in him.

161
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:54,388
He demonstrates that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him, as he says that he gives it to believers.

162
00:22:54,388 --> 00:23:04,681
After rising from the dead and appearing to the disciples who were gathered in a locked room, following the greeting of peace and the commission of peace, he breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit.

163
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:05,321
(John 20:22).

164
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:09,409
What does he signify by breathing on them if not the procession of the Holy Spirit?

165
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:17,817
It’s not that the physical breath taken from the air and exhaled through the mouth with the help of the lungs is the substance of the Holy Spirit.

166
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:25,906
Rather, He wanted to teach us that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Himself, and that the substance of the Holy Spirit also flows from the substance of the Son.

167
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:39,147
Just as the Father, wanting to show that the birth of the Son originated from His own substance and that the Son is of the same substance as Himself, speaks to the Son in the Psalm: "From the womb before the morning star, I have begotten you" (Psalm 109:3).

168
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:43,938
This doesn't mean that God the Father had a womb from which He begot the Son before the ages.

169
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:51,202
Instead, it testifies that He begot the Son not from nothing, not from the substance of another thing, but from His own nature and substance.

170
00:23:51,202 --> 00:24:00,939
Similarly, the Son, by breathing out and giving the Holy Spirit to the apostles, showed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from His own substance, which He wanted to grant through such a breath.

171
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:08,564
When speaking to the disciples about the sacrament of His body and blood, He said: "The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life" (John 6:64).

172
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:11,656
So where do words come from, if not from the innermost mind?

173
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:18,353
Therefore, the words that Christ speaks are spirit and life, because the Spirit, which proceeds from the heart of Christ, is life.

174
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:28,193
Not that in Divinity there is a heart, as in a part of flesh; but by such a term, He wanted to show the sacrament of the inner substance, from which He says the Spirit, who is life, proceeds.

175
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:33,036
Thus, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son and is of one and the same substance with the Son.

176
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:39,240
Chapter Four
Testimonies are brought forth from the Gospel and the Letters of Paul.

177
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,010
In the Gospel of Luke, it is written: "And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee" (Luke 4:14).

178
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:50,157
It is read about the Savior that He is the power of the Father, and now the Spirit is called power.

179
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,705
Is Christ one power and the Spirit another power?

180
00:24:52,705 --> 00:24:56,552
Certainly not: both are called power to show the unity of their substance.

181
00:24:56,552 --> 00:25:44,435
What does it mean when it says: "In the power of the Spirit?" Did it mean to show the power of the Holy Spirit as greater than the power of the Son? Not at all. So, what does it mean when it says: "In the power of the Spirit?" It did not mean to show an external power to Christ, as if granted from elsewhere, but His own; which, while it is the Holy Spirit's, is also the Son's, as in one nature, not in different essence, and remaining together in one. The one proceeds from the other, namely, the Holy Spirit from the Son; but both from the Father: the Son by being born, the Holy Spirit by proceeding.
Not that at different times He proceeds from the Father or the Son, but that without any intervening time He proceeds from both the Father and the Son.
Blessed Paul the Apostle writes to the Galatians: "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (Galatians 4:6).

182
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:46,307
He did not say: God sent His Spirit.

183
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:56,913
If he had said that, it would not entirely exclude the Son; for the Son is also God, just as the Father is God, and both are not two gods, but one God: for what the person separates, the substance unites.

184
00:25:56,913 --> 00:26:26,444
But wishing to remove all questions, he specifically mentioned the person of the Son, saying, "God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts."
Is the Spirit of the Son different from the Spirit of the Father? If it is the same Spirit of both, it surely proceeds from both; for the Spirit of the Son is not said to be less than the Son; whoever thinks or says this is not a Catholic. Therefore, it is not necessary to say the Spirit of the Son, except because He proceeds from the Son; just as He is called the Spirit of the Father because He proceeds from the Father.

185
00:26:26,807 --> 00:28:26,663
To the Philippians, he writes, among other things, like this:
"For I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance"
Philippians 1:19.
Jesus Christ, God and man.
Was the Apostle speaking of the human spirit when he said these things?
For on the cross, Jesus Christ gave up His human spirit, as the evangelist testifies, who says of Him:
"He bowed His head and gave up His spirit"
John 19:30.
And He Himself also says:
"I have the authority to lay down my life and the authority to take it up again"
John 10:18.
But this Spirit, of whom the Apostle now speaks in First Corinthians, through whose provision he confidently hopes that he will not be put to shame in any way concerning the ministry of Christ, is God.
He is also called the Holy Spirit, to distinguish Him from the Father and the Son, of whom the Apostle testifies that He distributes the different gifts of grace and works all things as He wills.
Therefore, this Spirit is Christ's, not by servile subjection, but by divine procession, equal to the Father and the Son in nature, majesty, and dignity.
Saint Luke writes in the Acts of the Apostles:
"When they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them"
Acts 16:7.
About which Spirit he narrates earlier, saying:
"They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia"
Acts 16:6.
The same Spirit he previously called the Holy Spirit, he later called the Spirit of Jesus, clearly indicating that the Spirit of Jesus is no different from the Holy Spirit.
Why is He called the Spirit of Jesus? It has often been said, because He proceeds from Jesus.
Not from the nature by which He mercifully became man, but from the nature by which He is equal to the Father, being born of the Father.
He also speaks to Titus:
"He saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior"
Titus 3:5-6.
How did He pour out the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ? Was it as if a lesser through a greater?

186
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:39,399
The Arians believed this: but it says that the Father poured out the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ, showing that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was done by Jesus Christ, not as if He received it from somewhere else, but by sending it from Himself.

187
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:49,717
This does not mean that the Father poured out the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ as if water were poured through a pipe, implying that the Son's role was merely one of service, conveyance, or transition.

188
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:51,177
Thinking this way is impious.

189
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:59,432
Truly, the Father abundantly poured out the Holy Spirit on us through Jesus Christ our Savior because it proceeds from the Son, just as it proceeds from the Father.

190
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:07,687
By saying it was poured out through the Son, it shows its procession from the Son while not denying that it also proceeds from the Father; as it proceeds from both.

191
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:24,902
Blessed Peter testifies about this outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles, speaking to the Jews about the Lord Jesus Christ: "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing" (Acts 2:33).

192
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:47,704
Luke also testifies about this in the same Acts: "When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. Suddenly, there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance" (Acts 2:1-4).

193
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:56,564
And later: "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy" (Acts 2:17); and more.

194
00:29:56,564 --> 00:30:03,913
And a bit further on: "Even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy" (Acts 2:18).

195
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:13,778
We included all this so that, taught by blessed Peter, we might know that the Holy Spirit was poured out on the apostles and the other believers gathered together on the day of Pentecost by Jesus.

196
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:18,701
Hence it is written: God raised up Jesus, and we are all witnesses to this Acts 2:32.

197
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:27,481
Then he added: Exalted by the right hand of God, he poured out this, meaning the Holy Spirit, indeed Jesus, whom God raised up, whom you have seen and heard Acts 2:33.

198
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:45,041
You saw the tongues of fire, you heard the variety of languages: for the Holy Spirit in his own nature cannot be seen with bodily vision, nor heard with bodily hearing, but he took on the form and appearance of fire under the image of tongues, so that he could be seen, and possessed the voices of the disciples, so he could be heard.

199
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:53,296
But when he said: Having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this Spirit, he commends the grace of humanity, not divinity.

200
00:30:53,296 --> 00:31:01,445
According to divinity, he did not receive the promise, since everything the Father has is his, not by receiving it temporarily, but by having it eternally.

201
00:31:01,655 --> 00:31:05,525
Chapter Five
What the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is.

202
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:07,847
Who the Holy Spirit breathes on.

203
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:15,308
Let's compare this to Paul's statement where he told Titus about the Holy Spirit being poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior.

204
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:15,816
Titus 3:6.

205
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:20,384
Paul testifies that the Father poured out the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Savior.

206
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:25,053
Peter, however, says that Jesus poured out this same Holy Spirit after rising from the dead.

207
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:33,276
From this, we learn that both the Father and Jesus Christ pour out the Holy Spirit, so we understand that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, as both pour it out.

208
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:46,167
We should not think of this outpouring as a local event, as if it flowed from the Father to Christ, leaving the Father behind, or as if it could come to the Son by extending itself so that one part reaches the Son while the other remains with the Father.

209
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:52,004
Similarly, when it was poured out from the Son to the disciples, it did not leave the Son to come to the disciples.

210
00:31:52,004 --> 00:32:01,597
Rather, in a certain proportion, it illuminated the hearts of the disciples and remained with Christ, like a ray of the sun that illuminates its sphere and touches the earth simultaneously.

211
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,170
But these things are in bodies.

212
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,079
However, in the Divinity of the Holy Trinity, none of these things are found.

213
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,017
Instead, without the interval of time or place, the Holy Spirit is poured out by the Father and similarly by the Son.

214
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:20,630
It is poured out by the Father into the Son because the Father begot the Son, and also by the Son, because the Son has all that belongs to the Father.

215
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,284
The Holy Gospel also testifies that the Spirit breathes where it wishes.

216
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:24,741
John 3:8.

217
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,213
What does it mean to breathe?

218
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:30,071
Clearly, it means that whenever and wherever it wishes, it pours itself out.

219
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:32,964
Let's observe the single operation of the entire Trinity.

220
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:35,806
The Father pours out, the Son pours out the Holy Spirit.

221
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:38,902
The Holy Spirit, breathing where it wishes, pours itself out.

222
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:47,134
How fittingly the Apostle says that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit happened through Jesus Christ, through whom God the Father made everything.

223
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:55,007
The Apostle Peter also testifies that the Son poured out the Holy Spirit, about whom the Gospel says that everything the Father does, the Son does likewise.

224
00:32:55,007 --> 00:33:03,032
Therefore, the Father pours out the Holy Spirit, and the Son pours out the Holy Spirit, because just as it is given by the Father, it is also given by the Son.

225
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:14,337
So, let the emperors of the Greeks not accuse the Latins of confessing that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son as he proceeds from the Father, but rather let them learn the truth of the faith from Christ and his apostles.

226
00:33:14,337 --> 00:34:11,822
Also, in the Acts of the Apostles, Peter says:
"And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
Whom does he say gave the Holy Spirit, unless it is the same one about whom he said above:
"Exalted at the right hand of God, he poured out what you now see and hear";
showing that it is understood to be Jesus Christ.
But how did God give the Holy Spirit to those who obey him?
Was it as if he were lesser?
Not at all.
For the Son says:
"The Spirit blows where it wishes."
Therefore, God gives the Holy Spirit by infusing the hearts of those who obey him, not to leave himself where he remains in the unity of substance but to illuminate those whom he did not previously enlighten.
No one can give what they do not possess: thus the Son testifies to having the Holy Spirit, whom he gave to all who obey him.
And just as he has it by the unity of substance, not by the acquisition of possession, so when he gives, he does not bestow it as if it were someone else's right, but he imparts what is his own gift.
The Son would not do this if the Holy Spirit did not also proceed from him.

227
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:27,744
In the following passages, even the blessed Peter, teaching how Cornelius, a Gentile, and those who believed with him received the grace of baptism, says this:
"So if God gave them the same grace as He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God's way?" (Acts 11:17).

228
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:44,063
Although here God, or the Holy Spirit, who filled the hearts of the believers and gave them the knowledge of tongues, or certainly the Father could be understood; if we consider Peter's earlier words about the sending of the Holy Spirit upon believers, which the Son poured out, we see that here God the Son is also understood.

229
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:52,546
He gave the same grace to Cornelius and his companions, as Peter mentioned, which He previously gave by pouring out the Holy Spirit upon the disciples in tongues of fire.

230
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:59,733
It is clearly shown that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or the gift, pertains to both the Father and the Son, because it proceeds from both.

231
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:09,514
Therefore, when Peter says He gave the same grace to the new believers as He gave before to the apostles, it clearly signifies the Holy Spirit, whom the Son could give, since He proceeds from Him.

232
00:35:09,514 --> 00:35:12,758
This would not be possible at all if He did not proceed from Him.

233
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:16,127
Chapter Six
Testimonies from Scripture.

234
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:28,522
Writing to the Romans, blessed Paul says to the faithful:
"But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him" (Romans 8:9).

235
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:56,500
Notice whose presence you accept when it says: "If the Spirit of God dwells in you."
If you accept the presence of the Father, then you also acknowledge that the same Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.
By this statement, it is clearly shown that the Spirit of the Father is also the Spirit of Christ. It indicates that the Spirit comes from both.
But if you understand this in reference to Christ, which the context supports (since Christ is God), we also learn that the Spirit of Christ is the Holy Spirit, affirming that it proceeds from Christ.

236
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:29,725
The presence of the Father is more clearly indicated later when it says: "But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you."
Although it can also be understood that the Son, together with the Father, raised the man he assumed, as stated in the Gospel.
Either way, it is clear that the same Spirit belongs to both the Son and the Father.
Hence, what the holy Apostle says later: "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" (Romans 8:14), can be understood without hesitation to refer to either the Father or the Son, as the Spirit is from both, proceeding from both, as has already been proven.

237
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:38,108
And later: "For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father'" (Romans 8:15).

238
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:46,594
Writing to the Galatians, he says: "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, 'Abba, Father'" (Galatians 4:6).

239
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:52,674
Notice that he refers to the same Spirit as the Spirit of adoption, whom he acknowledges as the Spirit of the Son.

240
00:36:52,674 --> 00:36:59,940
The Apostle teaches us that the Spirit of the Father is also the Spirit of adoption and the Spirit of the Son, whom God sent into our hearts.

241
00:36:59,940 --> 00:38:31,456
Through this same Spirit, who is both the Spirit of the Father and the Son, we cry out, "Abba, Father."
We could not do this if the Holy Spirit did not proceed from the Son as He does from the Father. In his second letter to the Corinthians, he writes: "You are our letter, written in our hearts; known and read by all men: you are shown to be a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God" Second Corinthians 3:2, 3.
When he says that the Corinthians are a letter of Christ, written by the Spirit of the living God, he demonstrates the single operation of the Holy Spirit and Christ. But whom does he call the living God in this passage? Clearly, Christ, whose letter he says the Corinthians are, revealing that the Spirit is Christ's, who wrote in the hearts of the Corinthians not with bodily ink but with his own illumination.
Therefore, because Christ and the Holy Spirit write the same letter, they are shown to be of one substance as they are of one operation. What Christ writes, the Holy Spirit also writes, and what the Holy Spirit writes, Christ also writes—not by alternation of time, nor by exchange of places, nor by variety of work. For as they have the same will, they have the same operation and not dissimilar power, because they are not of dissimilar essence.
As it has often been said, the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ; not as a part of him, or a quality, or a subject, but as proceeding from Christ. Again, to the Corinthians in the same letter: "To this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed" Second Corinthians 3:15, 16.
He clarifies just above who he calls the Lord here, saying how the same veil is removed in Christ.

242
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:38,231
When the veil of old understanding is removed in Christ, it becomes clear that when someone turns to Christ, the veil is taken away.

243
00:38:38,231 --> 00:40:16,389
Blessed John also says in his Revelation: "And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, nor to look at it. And one of the elders said to me: Do not weep; behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has triumphed to open the book and its seven seals." Revelation chapter five, verses four to five.
The opening of the book symbolizes the removal of the veil. It's clear that the lion of the tribe of Judah and the root of David signify Christ, who is also said to open its seven seals. These seven seals represent the Holy Spirit because of the sevenfold grace of His gift. He is the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, counsel and strength, knowledge and piety. He is also the Spirit of the fear of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah speaks. Isaiah chapter eleven, verse two.
The root of David, which is the Savior, opens the seven seals of this book because the spiritual mysteries contained within it are revealed in Christ when the veil written about in the Old Testament is removed. The Apostle adds: "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." Second Corinthians chapter three, verse seventeen.
Which Lord? Certainly, the one in whom the veil is removed, which remains hidden when the Old Testament is read. The removal of the veil signifies the removal of the servitude contained in the letter of the law, allowing for the freedom ministered through the Spirit of the Lord. This happens when one transitions from literal interpretation to spiritual understanding, and from the servitude of the flesh to the freedom of the Spirit.
We see in these words that the Spirit of the Lord is called the Spirit of Christ. Hence, it follows: "But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Spirit of the Lord." Second Corinthians chapter three, verse eighteen.

244
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:26,436
Therefore, since the revelation of the face is made through Christ, and we are transformed from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord, the joint operation of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is shown.

245
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:30,720
Hence, what is said: by the Spirit of the Lord, undoubtedly shows the person of Christ.

246
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,285
Although He is the Spirit of Christ, together with the Savior, He accomplishes the revelation of the old reading.

247
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:39,880
Therefore, the fact that they work together shows the unity of substance.

248
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,410
The fact that He is called the Spirit of the Lord, because He proceeds from Him, is implied.

249
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,497
The reading clearly suggests that the Lord and Savior is signified in this passage.

250
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:51,624
Chapter Seven
Other Testimonies.

251
00:40:51,624 --> 00:41:07,061
Blessed Peter the apostle writes to the believers in his first letter:
"Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, searched and inquired carefully, searching what or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating" (First Peter 1:10-11).

252
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:18,205
The leader of the apostles, to whom the Savior says, "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church" (Matthew 16:18), does not hesitate to call the Holy Spirit, who spoke in the prophets, the Spirit of Christ.

253
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:24,033
Yet, some, puffed up with worldly dignity, presume to criticize what the apostles of Christ's Church have learned!

254
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:28,736
If the Holy Spirit does not proceed from Christ, then how is He called the Spirit of Christ?

255
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:36,659
He proceeds from Christ because He is said to be His, not by subjection or by a particular section, but because He proceeds substantially from His essence.

256
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:42,436
Also consider Blessed John, who agrees with this view and proclaims that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.

257
00:41:42,436 --> 00:41:53,784
He says in Revelation:
"And I saw in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes" (Revelation 5:6).

258
00:41:53,784 --> 00:42:07,791
Explaining this, he added: "These are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth."
No Catholic, I believe, will deny that the slain Lamb represents Christ, about whom John the Baptist said: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).

259
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:13,312
This Lamb of God was sacrificed for the sins of the world and rose again for the justification of the world.

260
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:18,833
This Lamb is said to have seven eyes, which, according to John's teaching, signify the seven spirits of God.

261
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:25,120
Not because there are seven distinct entities, but because of the sevenfold distribution of gifts; in substance, He is one.

262
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:37,326
Therefore, it is clear that when it says the lamb has seven eyes, it means that Christ possesses the Holy Spirit, not as a mere part or member of His body, but that the Holy Spirit is essentially in Him and also proceeds from Him.

263
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:50,293
We say that the Holy Spirit is in Him, not as in a place or a subject; for the Holy Spirit is not contained by Christ as something lesser, which is usually the case with things contained in places; the things that contain are greater than those contained.

264
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:54,971
We do not say that the Holy Spirit is in Christ in this way because He is equal, not lesser.

265
00:42:54,971 --> 00:43:08,394
Nor do we say that He is in Christ as in a subject; for He is not an accident, which cannot exist without its subject: but He is in Christ as consubstantial; just as we see heat in the brightness of fire: for fire both shines and heats, it illuminates and ignites.

266
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:18,208
The prophet Zechariah also says: "For behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch: for behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes" (Zechariah 3:8).

267
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:24,055
And further: "These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth" (Zechariah 4:10).

268
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:31,022
This stone is the Savior, of whom the Psalmist speaks: "The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone" (Psalm 118:22).

269
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:38,750
God the Father also calls Him His servant the Branch: servant because of His taking on human nature; the Branch, because He is the sun of righteousness.

270
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:43,632
And upon this stone, He says, the seven eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.

271
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:46,123
In the eyes, the Holy Spirit is to be understood.

272
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:52,174
The seven are for the reason previously mentioned, that although there is one Holy Spirit, the gifts of grace are many.

273
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:55,225
What does it mean for there to be seven eyes upon the stone?

274
00:43:55,225 --> 00:43:58,123
Clearly, it means that the Holy Spirit remains in Christ.

275
00:43:58,123 --> 00:44:04,683
And just as eyes are said to be in someone in whom they essentially are, so you should understand the Holy Spirit to be Christ's.

276
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:15,056
The same prophet also signified this under the figure of the lampstand, saying: "I saw, and behold a golden lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it" (Zechariah 4:2).

277
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:23,351
Behold the golden lampstand of Christ’s incarnation; golden because it is without blemish, without any mixture of sin, entirely radiant and splendid.

278
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:26,354
The lamp above His head represents the Divinity in the man.

279
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:29,865
For Christ’s head is God, says the Apostle in First Corinthians 11:3.

280
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:35,464
The seven lamps above it, that is, above the lampstand or His head, symbolize the fullness of the Holy Spirit.

281
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:48,646
This is in accordance with the prophecy of Isaiah: And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety, and He will be filled with the Spirit of the fear of the Lord (Isaiah 11:2).

282
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:53,939
Since the seven lamps of the Holy Spirit rest upon Christ, it shows that the Holy Spirit resides in Him.

283
00:44:53,939 --> 00:44:58,876
When He rests in Him by dwelling substantially, it is His Spirit in which He substantially rests.

284
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:01,369
Hence, it is rightly called the Spirit of Christ.

285
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:07,579
It should be noted that regarding this Spirit signified by the seven eyes, it is said that they roam over the whole earth.

286
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:15,111
And in Revelation, after mentioning the seven spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb, it added: Sent out into all the earth (Revelation 5:6).

287
00:45:15,111 --> 00:45:22,084
What Zechariah describes as roaming, John in Revelation describes as sent; the term mission suggesting the procession of the Holy Spirit.

288
00:45:22,084 --> 00:45:29,260
While being substantially in Christ, the Holy Spirit does not roam or get sent unless proceeding from Christ, not locally, but substantially.

289
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:35,316
To exist, He receives from both the Father and the Son, just as the Son essentially receives existence from the Father.

290
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:49,618
However, it does not reciprocate, so that although the Holy Spirit proceeds equally from the Son and the Father, the Son is not born equally from the Father and the Holy Spirit; for the birth is only from the Father, but the procession is from both the Father and the Son together.

291
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:58,193
The seven Spirits sent by God, as mentioned in the Apocalypse, are described by Zechariah as the seven eyes of the Lord that run throughout the whole earth.

292
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:01,136
This is because of the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit.

293
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:09,810
Through the apostles and their successors, these gifts have been spread among all nations, sanctifying the faithful who believe in Christ and cleansing them of their sins.

294
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:18,029
John also confirmed that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ when he said he saw one like the Son of Man in the midst of the seven lampstands Revelation 1:13.

295
00:46:18,029 --> 00:47:35,341
A few verses later, he said: "His eyes were like a flame of fire" Revelation 1:14.
Who is this Son of Man? Clearly, it is the Lord Jesus Christ, who often refers to himself as the Son of Man in the Gospel. For example, in the passage: "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?" Matthew 16:13.
Ezekiel also frequently hears himself called the Son of Man. The eyes of this Son of Man, which are said to shine like a flame of fire, signify the Holy Spirit, as fire from heaven appeared over the apostles.
By calling his eyes the Holy Spirit, it signifies that the Spirit is of Christ. The Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ because it proceeds from him and is essentially in him.
John also says, when speaking of the future glory of the saints, that neither the sun nor any heat will affect them. He adds: "For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water" Revelation 7:16-17.
What are these springs of living water? They are the streams of the Holy Spirit, by which the faithful are both cleansed and given life. Of these streams, the Savior says in the Gospel: "He who believes in me, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water" John 7:38, meaning the Holy Spirit, whom believers were to receive. This was first fulfilled in the apostles on the fiftieth day after the resurrection.
Therefore, the Lamb will lead them to the springs of living water because the streams of the Holy Spirit will refresh them, ensuring they never lose the eternal joys of life.

296
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:45,424
These sources of the waters of life should not be considered apart from Christ, for He Himself said to Philip:
"I am the life";
and:
"Whoever sees Me, sees the Father also"
(John 14:6, 9).

297
00:47:45,424 --> 00:47:53,466
Thus, whoever sees Christ also sees the Holy Spirit, who is in Christ; and to lead believers to the sources of the waters of life is to lead them to Him.

298
00:47:53,466 --> 00:47:59,615
Those who believe in Him and behold Him are always satisfied by the fountains of the Holy Spirit proceeding from Him.

299
00:47:59,615 --> 00:49:32,170
Blessed John also says in
(Revelation 8:5):
"And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth; and there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake."
This angel is Jesus Christ, who is read as the angel of great counsel. The censer represents His humanity; the altar, from whose fire the censer is filled, symbolizes the divinity of Christ; and the fire from the altar represents the Holy Spirit taken from Christ's divinity. Both the altar and the censer represent Christ.
The altar represents the place where the burnt offerings or sacrifices of the saints are offered, symbolized by the earthly altar. The offerings of the saints are not received unless they are placed on the altar of Christ. The censer is said to be because the prayers of the saints are received through it.
Alternatively, the censer can be seen as a gift of the Holy Spirit, as the Apostle testifies in
(Romans 8:26):
"We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us,"
making us intercede with inexpressible groanings.
The fire of the altar is the Holy Spirit, about whom the Savior said in
(Luke 12:49):
"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"
Therefore, the angel threw the censer filled with the fire of the altar to the earth; because, having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, the Savior poured out the grace of the Holy Spirit upon believers. Hence, it follows appropriately that there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake, according to what the Savior says in the Gospel:
"It is for your good that I am going away; unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you."

300
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:36,513
And when he comes, he will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment.

301
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:37,030
John 16:7.

302
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,300
Revelation talks about the fire of the altar, which the angel threw to the earth, causing thunderings.

303
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,416
This is what the Savior says:
I will send him to you; and when he comes, he will convict the world.

304
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:51,498
After the Holy Spirit comes, there will be thunderings and voices of preaching.

305
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:57,234
Fear will shake the hearts of mortals, miracles will shine, and earthquakes will shake the hardness of mortals.

306
00:49:57,234 --> 00:49:59,094
The whole world will recognize this.

307
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:03,900
The fire of the altar is the Holy Spirit of Christ, whom he promises to send to the apostles.

308
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:12,736
Revelation testifies that he sent him to the earth, clearly teaching that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Son and was sent by him to the apostles after his ascension.

309
00:50:12,736 --> 00:50:15,165
How is he sent by the Son unless by proceeding?

310
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:17,490
And he proceeds from him, whose Spirit he is.

311
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:21,934
Also in the same Revelation, John:
And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse.

312
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:26,740
He who sat on it was called faithful and true, and in righteousness, he judges and makes war.

313
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,548
His eyes were like a flame of fire.

314
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:29,427
Revelation 19:21.

315
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:34,387
The white horse represents the body of Christ, filled with purity and holiness, having no stain.

316
00:50:34,387 --> 00:50:44,463
Its rider symbolizes the divinity of Christ, ruling and sitting in the man he assumed, making one Son from the divinity of the Father and from the humanity containing the substance of the mother.

317
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:53,041
His eyes are like a flame of fire because the divinity and fiery splendor of the Holy Spirit reside in him, and from his fullness, the light of the eyes shines forth.

318
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:58,674
This figure signifies and clearly teaches the divinity of the Spirit proceeding from the divinity of the Son.

319
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:06,890
Just as the light of his eyes is said to be from whom they are the eyes, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, in whom he resides and from whom he proceeds.

320
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:12,024
Chapter Eight
Testimonies from the Gospel and Councils.

321
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:18,371
We believe that it has been sufficiently shown by divine testimonies of the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

322
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:23,498
Now, let's add two more testimonies from the Gospel, which will address those who contradict this belief.

323
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:27,502
When the woman was healed from the flow of blood, the Savior said: Who touched me?

324
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:34,777
But when everyone denied it, Peter and those with him said: Master, the crowds are pressing around you and crushing you, and you say: Who touched me?

325
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:38,781
And Jesus replied: Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.

326
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:41,809
What is this power that the Savior says has gone out from him?

327
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:49,572
Clearly, it is the grace of the Holy Spirit; for the Apostle says: To one is given the grace of healing through the same Spirit, to another, miraculous powers.

328
00:51:49,572 --> 00:51:53,625
So what does it mean for the Savior to say: I know that power has gone out from me?

329
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:58,850
It means: I know that the Spirit proceeds from me, who is the giver of healings and the worker of miracles.

330
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:04,416
He says that the Holy Spirit has gone out from him in the same way that he says elsewhere: I came from the Father.

331
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,736
For the Son coming from the Father means being born from the Father.

332
00:52:07,736 --> 00:52:11,643
Likewise, the Holy Spirit going out from the Son means proceeding from the same.

333
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:17,941
Also, in the same Gospel of blessed Luke: And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all.

334
00:52:17,941 --> 00:52:24,045
The power going out from Christ heals everyone because the Holy Spirit proceeding from him gives the grace of healing to all.

335
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:32,346
Therefore, let the critics, whether malicious or ignorant, stop reproaching the Church of Christ for confessing that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.

336
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:37,619
This is what the Gospels teach, what the apostles profess, and what the prophets do not remain silent about.

337
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:48,501
First, let them learn what the Church has learned from Christ, and as disciples of the Truth, confess the Catholic faith, so they are not deceived by arrogance or trapped by ignorance, fostering an old heresy.

338
00:52:48,501 --> 00:53:00,302
These errors lead to the madness of Arius, who denied the Son's equality with the Father and claimed the Holy Spirit is lesser than the Son, suggesting the Son was not born of the Father's substance and that the Holy Spirit is a mere creature.

339
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:07,149
Consider where your declaration leads, illustrious emperors, when you say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father but not from the Son.

340
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:11,229
You've never read this in divine writings or in the teachings of the Church fathers.

341
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:20,359
The holy council of Constantinople, refuting and condemning the madness of Arius, declared that the Son is consubstantial with the Father and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father.

342
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,398
Did it deny that He proceeds from the Son?

343
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:26,623
Or does it imply that if He proceeds from the Father, He does not proceed from the Son?

344
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:38,861
If you wish to be children of the Church and follow the doctrine of the Fathers, recognize that by saying the holy council gathered in Constantinople declared the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, it did not deny that He also proceeds from the Son.

345
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:51,050
Since the entire Trinity is consubstantial, and the Son is born of the Father, and the Holy Spirit is the love of both, no one can deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son unless they deny that the Son has the love by which He loves the Father.

346
00:53:51,050 --> 00:54:04,600
Since this is madness, it must be firmly and faithfully professed that the Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Father, and this love by which the Father loves the Son proceeds from the Father, and the love by which the Son loves the Father proceeds likewise from the Son.

347
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,008
This love is the Holy Spirit.

348
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:09,116
Therefore, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.

349
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:21,257
It is now time to prove the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son with the testimonies of the holy Fathers, so that those with different opinions may respect and be corrected, lest they fall into the pit of destruction through foolish obstinacy.
