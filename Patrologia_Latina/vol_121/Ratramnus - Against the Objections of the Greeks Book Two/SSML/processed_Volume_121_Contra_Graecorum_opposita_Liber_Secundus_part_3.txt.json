So why now do you criticize the Catholic faith and attempt to go against its teachings? Are you perhaps trying to revive Arius or Macedonius and bring their long-buried false doctrines back into the Church? Did your ancestors not know how the Roman Church spoke about the Holy Spirit? Yet they never separated themselves from the communion of the Roman See, knowing that what it holds and preaches is the truth of the Catholic faith and is not open to criticism because it is based on the authority of the Holy Scriptures.\n    </p>\n    <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n    <p>\n        Until the time of Arius, there was no confusion among believers about the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, nor was the term <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"hɔmoʊˈuːsɪən\">homoousion</phoneme> (same substance) preached. However, the power of that word was deeply ingrained in the minds of believers, as they believed that the all-powerful Son was in no way different from the Father, recalling well the Savior's words: <break time=\"300ms\"/> \"Whoever has seen me has seen the Father\" <break time=\"300ms\"/> (John 14:9).

Yet in the Apostles' Creed, nothing more was included than what we all know: that we must believe in God the Father almighty, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
