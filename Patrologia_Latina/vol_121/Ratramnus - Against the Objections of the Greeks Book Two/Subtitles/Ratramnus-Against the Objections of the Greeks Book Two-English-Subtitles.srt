Four Books Against the Objections of the Greeks
by Ratramnus, a Monk of Corbie
Book Two

2
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:12,647
Chapter One
Proving from the Fathers that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:19,709
We are discussing the procession of the Holy Spirit, which the Greek emperors claim proceeds only from the Father, denying it comes from the Son.

4
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:25,018
Because of this, they refuse to communicate with the Roman Church and reject the envoys of the apostolic see.

5
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,618
They accuse the Latin Church of error because it professes and believes that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

6
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:35,391
First, we observe laypeople disregarding ecclesiastical rules by imposing decrees on the faithful.

7
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:42,794
Those who are not authorized to establish statutes concerning ecclesiastical law, without consulting bishops, are attempting to establish laws of faith.

8
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:47,031
According to their decrees, some are received into communion while others are excluded.

9
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:56,138
If they wished to establish anything regarding their faith, it would have been appropriate to call a council of bishops, seek the statutes of the Fathers, and consult the holy scriptures.

10
00:00:56,138 --> 00:01:01,154
By common agreement, the bishops would then decide what should be followed and what should be rejected.

11
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:11,381
If it was found that certain beliefs or practices existed in some Churches or regions that needed to be changed, it should have first been communicated to them, understanding the reasons behind these practices.

12
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:14,401
Then, if just religion required it, judgment should be passed.

13
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:20,245
This should be done under their own governance and the provision of their empire, with Churches established accordingly.

14
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:27,258
Otherwise, what right do they have to judge or discuss matters of faith, custom, or doctrine in people or Churches not under their jurisdiction?

15
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:30,180
And if there is disagreement, should they be excommunicated?

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,491
Did the Savior grant the Greek emperors the power to bind and loose?

17
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:53,654
Did He tell them, "You are the light of the world?"
Matthew chapter five, verse fourteen: "You are the light of the world."
Did He command them to teach all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?
Matthew chapter twenty-eight, verse nineteen: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

18
00:01:54,335 --> 00:02:08,793
If you claim that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father and refuse to acknowledge that He also proceeds from the Son, while the entire Latin Church, or indeed the whole Catholic world, professes that He proceeds from both, how do you justify your opinion as superior and backed by truth?

19
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:13,497
Or do you believe that the truth of the Gospel has reached only you and resides solely with you?

20
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:20,407
The Apostle Paul describes himself as an apostle set apart for the Gospel of Christ, as mentioned in Romans, chapter fifteen, verse nineteen.

21
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,397
He spread the Gospel from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum.

22
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:29,669
He also traveled to Rome and Spain, covering the entire Roman world, either in person or through his writings, preaching Christ.

23
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:35,648
Does he claim that he preached Christ only to the Greeks, revealing the truth of the Gospel exclusively to Greek emperors?

24
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,393
The Gospel of Christ shines throughout the entire world.

25
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:42,607
The writings of the apostles are read, and the prophecies of the prophets are recited.

26
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:52,948
Through these, the teachers of the Churches, established by the apostles from the beginning, continually learn what to believe about the Holy Trinity, what to profess, and what to teach the people in their care.

27
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:57,897
They learn how to instruct them in morals, shape their way of life, and form their religious beliefs.

28
00:02:57,897 --> 00:03:09,463
Neither the holy scriptures, the teachings of the elders, the precepts of the apostles, nor the sayings and writings of any of the early Church fathers declare that the Greeks alone are to be the teachers of the entire Church of Christ.

29
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:17,549
Nor do they state that the emperors should learn from them what should be observed throughout the whole Church of Christ, whether in behavior, religion, or doctrine.

30
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:27,155
Recognizing such an idea as foolish and arrogant, the Roman Church should not be lightly criticized for preserving the traditions of its elders or for not adopting all the practices of the Greeks.

31
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:34,800
Because, whether it concerns the Holy Trinity or any religious observance, whatever it holds or practices has come from the teachings of Christ's disciples.

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,945
And what it believes, teaches, and practices is not contrary to or inconsistent with the holy scriptures.

33
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:46,439
So, you criticize us for saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, while you say He proceeds from the Father.

34
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,623
Chapter Two
The authority of councils addresses the objections of the Greeks.

35
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:58,756
First, we ask you to consider the authority of the elders, namely the Catholic bishops, by which you uphold the decree you strive so much to defend.

36
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:14,033
The Council of Nicaea, with 318 bishops gathered against Arius under the first Emperor Constantine, after dictating the Creed about the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, when it came to the Holy Spirit, said: We believe in the Holy Spirit: nothing more or less decreeing about His substance or procession.

37
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:23,671
So, where is the rule now, by which you think you are fortified or the Latins are bound, that you may say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, and the Romans may not say He proceeds from the Son?

38
00:04:23,671 --> 00:05:21,647
If you wish to add nothing beyond what the authority of the Council of Nicaea decreed, then remove "proceeding from the Father," because it is not contained in the Creed of the Council of Nicaea: and perhaps it is allowable to remove what was added by the Romans, "proceeding from the Son."
But if you answer and say that this was established in the Council of Constantinople with 150 bishops gathered there, we respond that it was not allowed to remove, add, or change anything in the Creed of the Council of Nicaea regarding the faith.
However, if you argue that it was not allowed to add anything to what was determined in that council about the consubstantiality of the Son, but because little was said about the Holy Spirit, it was allowed due to future questions of heretics according to the authority of the Holy Scriptures:
we respond that the same allowance was given to the Romans, due to future questions of heretics according to the authority of the Divine Scriptures.
For you cannot prove that the authority of the city of Constantinople is greater than that of the city of Rome, which is the head of all the Churches of Christ, as is proven by the testimony of your elders as well as ours.

39
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:27,570
But the authority of one hundred and fifty bishops is not so great that it can dictate to all the bishops of the whole world.

40
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,700
Therefore, what was allowed to them should also be allowed to the Roman Pontiff and all the Churches of Christ.

41
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:42,176
They also added to the aforementioned creed, stating that the Holy Spirit is to be worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son, who spoke through the holy prophets, and many other things.

42
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,105
By adding these, they did not prescribe to the Churches of Christ but set an example.

43
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:53,409
If anyone wanted to add anything according to the Holy Scriptures about the Holy Spirit, to refute heretics and strengthen the faith of believers, they could.

44
00:05:53,409 --> 00:06:21,467
But if you argue that what cannot be found written in the holy Gospels or other divine pages is this: the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, and therefore you do not want to accept what is not found written in the Holy Scriptures; just as the Arians did not want to accept that the Father and the Son are of the same substance because the sacred Scriptures did not contain this: tell us where you have read that the Council of Constantinople put in the creed about the Holy Spirit, saying he is to be worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son, and who spoke through the holy prophets.

45
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:38,292
But if you say that these are not found in the Holy Scriptures in plain words, but the power of understanding is contained in them, so that just as he is of the same substance with the Father and the Son, of one power, not a different majesty, and therefore to be worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son; grant the same to the Latin Churches.

46
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:52,668
Although the Gospels do not plainly say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, they show in many ways that the Spirit is of the Son, just as he is of the Father, and proceeds from the Son, just as he proceeds from the Father: which we believe has been sufficiently demonstrated in the previous little book.

47
00:06:52,992 --> 00:07:03,988
Given these circumstances, the Catholic faith, founded by the Savior and the apostles, has always held and preached that the Holy Spirit shares the same power and substance with the Father and the Son and proceeds from both.

48
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:08,259
So why now do you criticize the Catholic faith and attempt to go against its teachings?

49
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:14,052
Are you perhaps trying to revive Arius or Macedonius and bring their long-buried false doctrines back into the Church?

50
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:17,832
Did your ancestors not know how the Roman Church spoke about the Holy Spirit?

51
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:29,467
Yet they never separated themselves from the communion of the Roman See, knowing that what it holds and preaches is the truth of the Catholic faith and is not open to criticism because it is based on the authority of the Holy Scriptures.

52
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:37,960
Until the time of Arius, there was no confusion among believers about the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, nor was the term homoousion (same substance) preached.

53
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:50,381
However, the power of that word was deeply ingrained in the minds of believers, as they believed that the all-powerful Son was in no way different from the Father, recalling well the Savior's words: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9).

54
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:55,928
And they knew from John that Christ was the creator of everything: "All things were made through him" (John 1:3).

55
00:07:55,928 --> 00:08:04,274
Yet in the Apostles' Creed, nothing more was included than what we all know: that we must believe in God the Father almighty, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.

56
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:13,307
This faith was sufficient for the salvation of believers, and it was approved and commended throughout the world by the blood of many martyrs and the testimony of countless confessors.

57
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:24,451
But when Arius, the attacker of truth, began to go mad against the divinity of Christ and to hurl many blasphemies, the minds of the faithful were moved to piety, and they drew the weapons of truth against the error of impiety.

58
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:34,907
Together, they pierced the impious doctrine along with its author, which claimed that the Son of God was a creature and not begotten of the Father, and also blasphemed that the Holy Spirit was lesser than the Son.

59
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:44,141
After Macedonius rose up, agreeing with the Catholics about the Father and the Son, but not accepting the person of the Holy Spirit, Catholic bishops contended against him.

60
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:54,754
They proved that the Holy Spirit is one in the Holy Trinity, consubstantial with both the Father and the Son, proceeding from the Father, and to be worshipped and glorified together with the Father and the Son.

61
00:08:54,754 --> 00:09:07,794
Then, when Arian madness resurfaced, claiming it was incorrect to say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father because it seemed blasphemous—suggesting two Fathers, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit—the Church's teachers decided to repel this blasphemy.

62
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:11,433
They added to the creed that the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son.

63
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:23,007
If He were said to proceed only from the Father, it might be thought that the Son was not the Spirit, nor would He be called the Spirit of the Son, which is impious and blasphemous, and against evangelical and apostolic doctrine.

64
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:44,891
For if you say that the word "proceed" sufficiently distinguishes, so that the Holy Spirit is not thought to be the Son, know that it is also preached about the Son. For He Himself says in the Gospel of John:
John 8:42: "I came forth from God, and am here."
So, if the Son proceeds from God the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds as well, what will silence the Arians from blaspheming that the Holy Spirit is the Son of the Father?

65
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:50,063
Chapter Three
Testimonies from Athanasius and Gregory Nazianzen.

66
00:09:50,063 --> 00:10:00,087
Regarding this matter, the teachers of both the Latins and the Greeks have stated that the Son was begotten solely from the Father, but the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

67
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:08,715
They understood this through the teachings of the divine scriptures, recognizing that the Spirit is from both the Father and the Son, and therefore proceeds from both.

68
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:18,119
Hence, the blessed Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, who suffered much at the hands of the Arians for his steadfastness in the Catholic faith, was frequently exiled by their faction.

69
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:24,370
He assisted his bishop Alexander as a deacon at the Council of Nicaea and fought singularly against the madness of Arius.

70
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:33,360
In his book on the faith, which he published and proposed to be held by all Catholics, he said among other things:
The Father is made by no one, neither created nor begotten.

71
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,977
The Son is from the Father alone; not made, not created, but begotten.

72
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:42,144
The Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, not made, not created, not begotten, but proceeding.

73
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:58,729
The bishops of the Latins, confirming this truth of faith from the teachings of the doctors, and considering it a defense against the perverse dogma of Arianism, and understanding it to be derived from the holy Scriptures, added to the symbol of faith, saying of the Holy Spirit: Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.

74
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:06,996
This faith, from the times of Constantine, under whom the Council of Nicaea with 318 bishops was gathered, up to our times, has been held by the Western Church.

75
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:14,591
Nor has the Catholic Church of the Greeks renounced it, as it did not want to become alien to the doctrine of truth, as declared by their writings.

76
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:19,551
And now you accuse this faith, moved by some lightness or deceived by some error, I do not know.

77
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:23,116
Tell me, do you confess that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ?

78
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:30,917
If you deny it, the apostle Paul cries out against you, who says: If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him (Romans 8:9).

79
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:35,361
And Luke cries out, who says: And the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them (Acts 16:7).

80
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:42,284
And Peter cries out: Therefore, being exalted at the right hand of God, he has poured out this which you now see and hear (Acts 2:33).

81
00:11:43,007 --> 00:13:37,247
The Savior himself also cries out, speaking to his disciples: "If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you" John sixteen verse seven. Similarly, after the resurrection, he breathed on the disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John twenty verse twenty-two. All these things affirm that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.
Since you cannot deny this, you are compelled by necessity to admit, whether you like it or not, that the Spirit proceeds from the Son. You cannot claim he is a creature like Arius did, or that he does not exist like Macedonius suggested, as your profession states that he proceeds from the Father. When you say this, how can you try to deny that he proceeds from the Son? Since he is of the substance of both the Father and the Son, he cannot be of the substance of both unless he proceeds from both.
Let us hear what Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus, says in his sermon on the Holy Spirit, which he delivered before the people in the Church of Constantinople on Pentecost:
"The Holy Spirit," he said, "always was, and is, and will be, having neither beginning nor end, but co-eternal with the Father and the Son. For it is not fitting that either the Son should have ever been absent from the Father, or the Spirit from the Son."
By saying that the Holy Spirit is co-eternal with the Father and the Son, he refutes the Arians, who taught that he was a creature. By saying that he always was, and is, and will be, he confutes Macedonius, who denied his existence. But by professing that the Son was never absent from the Father, nor the Spirit from the Son, he refutes you, who deny that the Spirit proceeds from the Son.
If, according to your opinion, the Holy Spirit were to proceed only from the Father, he ought to have said that neither the Son nor the Holy Spirit were ever absent from the Father. But since he says that the Son was never absent from the Father, nor the Spirit from the Son, he clearly speaks of the Son as being born of the Father without any time interval, and the Spirit proceeding from the Son before all time. He did not, however, deny that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, since there was no question about that, but he said that the Spirit was never absent from the Son, which had come into question.

82
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:44,966
In the following passages, we'll talk about the Spirit:
The Spirit sanctifies but is not sanctified, makes gods but does not become God himself.

83
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:52,416
He is unchangeable, immutable, always present to himself, the Father, and the Son; invisible, timeless, of his own power, and of all power.

84
00:13:52,416 --> 00:14:00,831
When it is said that he is always present to himself, the Father, and the Son, it does not imply servitude, but rather that he is unchangeable and immutable.

85
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:11,819
He retains his own nature as well as the essence of the Father and the Son: his own nature because there is no change in him; immutable to the Father and the Son because he shares the same essence as them.

86
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,910
The Holy Spirit is of that same nature.

87
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:20,878
He is unchangeable and immutable to the Father, who is the source and origin of all things, and to the Son, from whom he proceeds.

88
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:23,719
He is not unlike the Son, nor of a different essence.

89
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:31,115
He is said to be of his own power and of all power because he exists in his own person and accomplishes whatever he wills in all creation.

90
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:35,082
Furthermore, he is life-giving, light and enlightening, good and goodness.

91
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:40,495
He is the Lord of all, sending apostles and inspiring where he wills, distributing gifts as he wills.

92
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:46,284
He is the Spirit of truth, the Spirit of wisdom; through whom the Father is known, and the Son is glorified.

93
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:50,679
We pass over many things, collecting only those that concern the present question.

94
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,182
The Spirit is said to be life, and the Son says of himself: I am the life John 14:6.

95
00:14:55,182 --> 00:15:03,704
The Spirit is said to be life-giving, and the Son says of himself: As the Father gives life to whom he wills, so the Son gives life to whom he wills John 5:21.

96
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:10,029
Therefore, if the Spirit is life, the Son is also life; and if the Spirit is life-giving, the Son is also life-giving.

97
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:12,280
They are of one essence and one operation.

98
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:20,963
But the Son is life from the Father, and the Spirit is life from the Son; thus the Son is life-giving from the Father, and the Spirit is life-giving from the Son.

99
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:27,020
The Spirit is also light and enlightening, and the Savior says of himself: I am the light of the world John 8:12.

100
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,059
The evangelist John says of the Son: Who enlightens every man coming into this world John 1:9.

101
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:39,819
Therefore, if both the Son and the Holy Spirit are light and both are illuminating, they share the same substance and operation.

102
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:47,146
The Holy Spirit receives light and illumination from the Son, as the Son himself testifies: "He will take from what is mine" (John 16:14).

103
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:51,393
However, He receives not because He lacks, but because He proceeds from the Son.

104
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:56,596
Similarly, the Spirit is good, and the Son says of Himself: "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:11).

105
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,144
No sane person will deny the goodness of Christ.

106
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:04,188
Good and good are not two separate goods, but one; just as there are not two gods, but one God.

107
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:07,214
The Deity does not multiply itself or increase in number.

108
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:12,098
Therefore, the good Spirit proceeds from the good Son, not by being born, but by proceeding.

109
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:18,575
If the Spirit proceeds only from the Father and not from the Son, how can the things of the Son also belong to the Spirit?

110
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,911
Or how does the Spirit receive from the Son?

111
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:32,538
As Saint Gregory says, the Holy Spirit is the Lord of all, demonstrating His omnipotence because He is the Lord of all things created by the Father through the Son, proceeding eternally from both the Father and the Son.

112
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:40,343
The Holy Spirit is also said to send the apostles, and the Savior tells them: "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves" (Matthew 10:16).

113
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:45,546
The operation of both the Son and the Holy Spirit is shown to be one, cooperating with each other.

114
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:52,607
This makes it clear that they do not consist of different substances, wills, or powers, as their operation is the same in all things.

115
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:59,137
The Son is referred to the Father, from whom He is born, and the Holy Spirit is referred to the Son, from whom He proceeds.

116
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:10,339
Blessed Gregory follows by saying of the Spirit: "He blows where he wills; distributing gifts as he wills." And of the Son: "He ascended on high, he took captivity captive, he gave gifts to men" (Ephesians 4:8).

117
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:19,981
The majesty of the Holy Spirit is shown to be equal to the Father and the Son in nature, greatness, power, and virtue—not subordinate, imperfect, or less powerful.

118
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:26,114
The Spirit distributes gifts just as the Son does, with the same gifts, at the same time, and to the same people.

119
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:30,835
This clearly shows the effect of a single operation and the affection of the same will.

120
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:38,813
The Son cannot be without the Holy Spirit, nor the Holy Spirit without the Son, as both are of one substance, and the Spirit proceeds from the Son.

121
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:41,309
The Spirit is also called the Spirit of Truth.

122
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,294
The Savior says of Himself: I am the truth (John 14:6).

123
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:51,891
Therefore, by saying that the Spirit is the Spirit of Truth, it is clearly taught that the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, who is the truth.

124
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:54,713
The Holy Spirit is also called the Spirit of Wisdom.

125
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:59,869
The Apostle Paul testifies that Christ is the power and wisdom of God (First Corinthians 1:24).

126
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:04,048
Thus, the Spirit of Wisdom is the Spirit of Christ, who is the wisdom of God.

127
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:09,854
This clearly shows that the Spirit is of Christ by calling it the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Wisdom.

128
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:15,824
Why then is it the Spirit of Christ, if it is the Spirit of the Lord of all, as the blessed Gregory testifies?

129
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,940
Surely because it proceeds from Christ.

130
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,910
If you deny this, you will admit that it is subordinate, and thereby either a creature or lesser than the Son.

131
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,492
Both of these are blasphemous and far removed from Catholic piety.

132
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:38,888
Therefore, it is said that what truth has is that the Spirit is of Christ; namely, both the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Wisdom, because it proceeds from Christ, that is, it proceeds from truth and wisdom.

133
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:44,478
It is added: Through whom the Father is known, and the Son is glorified, and by whom alone He is known.

134
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:50,285
The Son also says to the Father: Father, I have made your name known to the people you gave me (John 17:6).

135
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:57,991
If the Father is known through the Spirit, and the Son manifests the name of the Father to people, they are shown to be of a single operation.

136
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:05,566
He also says that the Son is glorified by the Holy Spirit, and the Son says:
"It is my Father who glorifies me"
(John 8:54).

137
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:09,663
And he speaks to the Father:
"Glorify me, Father, with yourself"
(John 17:5).

138
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:15,516
If the Spirit glorifies the Son, and the Father glorifies the Son, then the Father and the Spirit work as one.

139
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:19,879
And by working together, they show they have one will, one essence, and one power.

140
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:27,062
Therefore, if the Holy Spirit is known only by the Father and the Son, he certainly proceeds from both and is consubstantial with both.

141
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:32,384
Notice how it is said that the Son is glorified by the Spirit, just as the Son glorifies the Father.

142
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:34,725
But what does it mean to glorify the Father?

143
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:38,290
It means to make known to humans that he is begotten of the Father.

144
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,813
Similarly, the Son is glorified by the Spirit, showing that he proceeds from the Son.

145
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:50,635
Therefore, in many ways, the blessed Gregory proves that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son and is of one substance with the Father and the Son.

146
00:19:50,635 --> 00:20:46,771
Concluding, he says:
"What is the need for more words?
All that the Father is, so is the Son, except that the Father is unbegotten.
All that the Son is, so is the Holy Spirit, except that the Son is begotten."
What does this distinction and order of succession mean?
The Son is what the Father is, except that the Father is unbegotten.
The Holy Spirit is what the Son is, except that the Son is begotten.
He could have said, all that the Father is, so is the Son and the Holy Spirit, except that the Father is not begotten, nor proceeds from another.
But now he speaks of the Son being all that the Father is, and the Holy Spirit being all that the Son is, except the privilege of birth.
Evidently speaking thus, he shows that the Father is not from anyone, the Son is begotten only from the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Son.
But that he also proceeds from the Father, he said a little earlier, saying:
"And to the first origin of all, who is the Father,
as all things of the Only Begotten, so also all things of the Holy Spirit are referred."

147
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:57,306
By saying these things, he showed that everything belonging to the Son is connected to the Father, and everything belonging to the Holy Spirit also refers back to the primary origin of all things.

148
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:05,624
Even though the Spirit proceeds from the Son, the Son received this from the Father, so that by being born from the Father, the Holy Spirit would proceed from him.

149
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:23,383
So, everything that belongs to the Son belongs to the Father; and everything that belongs to the Holy Spirit also belongs to the Son; and thus to the Father, from whom the Son received that the Holy Spirit would proceed from him—not as created by the Father, but begotten; not diminished, but equal in power; not of another, but of the same nature.

150
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:30,732
Likewise, in the latter part: Since Jesus came to us in a bodily form, it was fitting that the Spirit should also appear to us in a bodily form.

151
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:37,162
When Christ ascended to him, he descended to us; he came as the Lord in power, but was sent as one who is not contrary to God.

152
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:47,981
This teacher showed the unified operation and will of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, indicating that since Jesus came to us in bodily form, it was fitting that the Holy Spirit should also appear to us in bodily form.

153
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:56,248
This shows the similarity of their will, with the Holy Spirit willing to show himself bodily to mortals because Jesus willed to show his coming bodily to mortals.

154
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:10,282
Because he proceeds from him, he is also of one will with him; he is not different in action from the Son, from whom he is not separated in nature; and he is always united in action with him, never lacking in coeternity, always cooperating with the one from whom he proceeds.

155
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:31,919
When he added, "And when Christ ascended to him, he descended to us," he did not want to show the diminution of the Son, but the assumption of humanity. Through this, Jesus ascended not only to the Holy Spirit but also to himself; because he who was made within all things from humanity, through Divinity was above all things.
He added, "Who indeed came as the Lord in power, but was sent as one who is not contrary to God."

156
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:36,125
Two things are mentioned: the Holy Spirit has come, and He has been sent.

157
00:22:36,125 --> 00:24:09,407
His coming is by His own power, hence it is said, "As the Lord." His being sent indicates He is from another, and it is said, "As one who is not contrary to the one who sends Him." The sending does not imply subordination, but procession.
He is sent by Christ, to whom Christ ascended; and He is sent as not contrary to God, that is, to Christ, who indeed is God, always united to His will. He is sent by Him because He proceeds from Him.
It is added: Therefore, after Christ, so that we may never be without one Advocate, that is, a defender or comforter. He is called another Advocate to recognize the equality of nature and power; for another means another self. Another self refers to someone of the same substance or nature, not someone different.
When Christ is called an Advocate, and the Holy Spirit is likewise called an Advocate, and the Spirit comes when Christ departs, it clearly shows that they have the same role and share the same name. They succeed each other mutually, as they are said to be of the same will and are shown to have the same operation. When Christ ascends, the Spirit descends, clearly sent by Christ, whose place He represents. This sending is a procession, not a diminishment or subjection.
Another, that is another self, is said of the Holy Spirit, demonstrating complete similarity: for another self cannot be said of someone different, but of someone of the same substance or nature. Therefore, it is shown that the Spirit proceeds from Him whose nature or substance He shares. The Spirit cannot be of the same nature or substance as the Son unless He proceeds from Him.
It is also added below: Therefore, God is fire, and the Holy Spirit is fire. It is written that God is a consuming fire, not indeed natural and corporeal, but spiritual and invisible.

158
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:13,475
So, God the Father is fire, God the Son is fire, and God the Holy Spirit is fire.

159
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:17,793
But God the Father is fire from no other fire because He takes His origin from no one.

160
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:21,006
God the Son is fire from the Father because He is born from Him.

161
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:24,923
And God the Holy Spirit is fire from the Son because He proceeds from the Son.

162
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:30,747
Therefore, by saying that God is fire and the Holy Spirit is fire, it shows the one substance of the entire Trinity.

163
00:24:30,747 --> 00:25:55,956
He indeed connects the persons of the Father and the Son by saying, "God is fire," and then adds the Holy Spirit by saying, "And the Holy Spirit is fire." But why did he place the persons of the Father and the Son together under the common name of God and prefer to distinguish the Holy Spirit separately? The reason is clear. He wanted to show by such a distinction that the Holy Spirit, who is fire, proceeds from the Father and the Son, who are also fire.
When Saint Gregory discussed such things about the Holy Spirit in the Church of Constantinople and wrote letters proving that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and proceeds from the Son, without denying or diminishing His procession from the Father, but equating His omnipotence and dominion with the Father and the Son in all things, was he rejected by the Church? Was his speech disapproved? Was he not received into communion by the citizens or the emperor? Certainly, this venerable doctor lived during the times of the Roman emperors Gratian and Theodosius the Great.
Since then, more than 500 years have passed up to our times, and never was the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son denied, nor was there any question among Catholics about this, except in your times now. Indeed, the profession of faith regarding the Holy Spirit remained the same and similar in both the Eastern and Western Churches. What has now caused this question to arise after so many centuries, you should see; however, there is no reason of either integrity or wisdom to justify why you have come to this, because by saying such things, you oppose the Catholic faith, resist the truth, and go against the holy scriptures.

164
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:59,087
Chapter Four
From Ambrose

165
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:06,914
Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, a man adorned with the splendor of all virtues, fought many battles against the Arians and suffered many persecutions from them.

166
00:26:06,914 --> 00:27:43,798
In the books he eloquently wrote on the Holy Spirit against Arian heresy and supported with the truth of the Gospel, he says (Book 1 on the Holy Spirit, Chapter 3):
"If you speak of Christ, you have indicated both God the Father, from whom the Son was anointed, and the Son Himself who was anointed, and the Spirit who anointed Him.
And if you speak of the Father, you have equally indicated His Son and the Spirit of His mouth, if you also comprehend this in your heart.
And if you speak of the Spirit, you have indicated both God the Father, from whom the Spirit proceeds, and the Son, because the Spirit is also of the Son."
Blessed Ambrose teaches that when one of them is named, whether the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit, the entire Trinity is comprehended, showing such a similarity of equality in the three that one term encompasses the three persons, although not by the distinction of voice, yet by the equality of unity.
As for his statement that the Spirit proceeds from the Father, there is no question here; for you agree with us on this.
But when he says that when the Son is named, the Spirit is also named because the Spirit is of the Son, here we are divided from you.
For you who refuse to profess that the Spirit proceeds from the Son also refuse to say that the Spirit is of the Son: for if He does not proceed from Him, it is not rightly said that He is His Spirit.
But He is called the Spirit of the Father because He proceeds from the Father.
Therefore, when the Son is named, the Holy Spirit is not simultaneously understood; for it cannot be shown that He is comprehended by the name of one of whom He is not the Spirit.
However, holy Ambrose says that the Spirit is of the Son, thus He proceeds from the Son.
In the following, he speaks similarly:
"He who denies the Holy Spirit also denies God the Father and the Son: for the Spirit of God is the same as the Spirit of Christ: no one should doubt that there is one Spirit."

167
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:54,037
The unity and consubstantiality of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is evident when it says: whoever denies the Spirit also denies the Father and the Son equally, because there is one Spirit of both.

168
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:59,951
It is from the Father, because it proceeds from the Father, and equally from the Son, because it proceeds from the Son.

169
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:01,840
It is not two Spirits, but one Spirit.

170
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,600
It is not said to be the Spirit of the Father and another Spirit of the Son, but one Spirit from both; therefore, it proceeds from both.

171
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,862
In Chapter 10, it states: the Spirit is not sent from a place, nor does it proceed from a place when it proceeds from the Son.

172
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:29,227
The Son himself says, "I came from the Father and have come." He clearly testifies that the Spirit proceeds from the Son. To ensure this procession is not measured by physical spaces, the Son excludes this notion by saying of the Father, "I came from the Father and have come" (John 8:42).

173
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:33,402
The Son proceeds from the Father, not by spatial distance, but by the exit of birth.

174
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:39,615
The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, neither by spatial distance nor by the exit of birth, but by the process of existence.

175
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:49,009
When speaking about the procession of the Son from the Father, it is said: neither does he depart from a place when he exits from the Father, nor are they separated like a body from a body.

176
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:52,538
When he is with the Father, he is not enclosed as a body within a body.

177
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:59,496
Similarly, the Holy Spirit, when proceeding from the Father and the Son, is not separated from the Father, nor is he separated from the Son.

178
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:09,188
This chief teacher and renowned confessor of Christ, by saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and also from the Son, prevented the Arians he was disputing against from blaspheming.

179
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:15,998
He ensured that those who claimed the Spirit was a creature and lesser not only than the Father but also than the Son, would not prevail.

180
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:25,342
By hearing that the Spirit proceeds from both, they would understand the Spirit to be consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and equally worthy of worship and glorification with them.

181
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:33,792
Later, it testifies to the Son saying: "Whoever loves me will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him" (John 14:23).

182
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:42,082
The Spirit comes just as the Father comes; because where the Father is, there is also the Son; and where the Son is, there is also the Holy Spirit.

183
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:50,194
What does it mean when it says that where the Father is, there is also the Son, if not that the Son is born from the Father, from whom He is never separated?

184
00:29:50,194 --> 00:29:53,810
And what does it mean where the Son is, there is also the Holy Spirit?

185
00:29:53,810 --> 00:30:01,302
It means that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, from whom He is never separated, showing the ineffable shared essence of the entire Trinity.

186
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:06,055
It testifies that the Son is always in the Father, and the Holy Spirit is always in the Son.

187
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:14,012
So, where the Father is, there is also the Son; and where the Son is, there is also the Holy Spirit, not divided by place, time, will, action, or essence.

188
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:20,315
Later, in chapter 12: Just as the Father gave the Son, and the Son gave Himself, understand that the Holy Spirit gave Him.

189
00:30:20,315 --> 00:30:25,843
For it is written: Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil (Matthew 4).

190
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:30,648
Therefore, the Spirit lovingly gave the Son: for there is one love of the Father and the Son.

191
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:37,261
When it says there is one love of the Father and the Son, it testifies that there is one Spirit of both; for the Spirit is love.

192
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:40,930
The Apostle says: For the fruit of the Spirit is love (Galatians 5:22).

193
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:52,244
Therefore, it is shown that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, whose love it is: for the love of the Father cannot exist unless it proceeds from the Father; because He does not receive love from elsewhere.

194
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:58,238
Nor can the love of the Son exist unless it proceeds from the Son: in the way that love loves, it proceeds from Him.

195
00:30:58,238 --> 00:31:02,836
As there is one love of the Father and the Son, there is one Spirit proceeding from both.

196
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:06,917
In the second book, chapter 12, it says: The Holy Spirit received from the Son.

197
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:11,774
However, He received through the unity of substance, just as the Son received from the Father.

198
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:15,804
By saying this, it clearly teaches that the Holy Spirit received from the Son.

199
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:21,177
And what He received, He received by proceeding, just as the Son received from the Father by being born.

200
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:30,343
Could the Holy Spirit have received anything from the Son that it did not have before, since it is of the same substance and possesses the same power as the Son?

201
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:32,763
Whatever the Son has, the Holy Spirit also has.

202
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:46,661
Saint Ambrose adds a testimony from the Gospel: He says, "He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you" (John 16:14).

203
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,853
He follows with: What could be clearer evidence of this unity?

204
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:54,331
What the Father has belongs to the Son; what the Son has, the Spirit has also received.

205
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:59,428
These words of Saint Ambrose clearly show that the Holy Spirit proceeds substantially from the Son.

206
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:06,480
He says: What the Father has belongs to the Son, that is, being substantially born of the Father, what is the Father's is also the Son's.

207
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:19,298
Similarly, the Holy Spirit, substantially proceeding from the Son, has received from the Son, so that whatever the Son has, the Spirit also has, that is, it is of the same substance as the Son, just as the Son is of the same substance as the Father.

208
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:40,609
Moreover, in the following: What the Son speaks, the Father speaks; and what the Father speaks, the Son speaks: and concerning the Spirit, the Son of God said: For he does not speak from himself, that is, not without my and the Father's communion (for the Spirit is not divided or separated), but he speaks what he hears (John 16:13): evidently hearing through the unity of substance and the property of knowledge.

209
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:51,110
While this Catholic teacher confesses that the Holy Spirit does not speak without the communion of the Father and the Son, it is evident that when the Spirit speaks, the Father speaks, and the Son speaks.

210
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:58,060
This testifies that the Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and of the same operation, neither divided nor separated.

211
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:09,436
And what he added: He speaks what he hears, implies his procession: for the Spirit does not hear the speech of the Father and the Son through certain intervening spaces or some openings, since he is of the same substance.

212
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:15,150
And just as the Son says: "All things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you" (John 15:15).

213
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:33,511
By being born from the Father and remaining in the Father's substance, not by receiving the Father's speech at intervals: just as the Spirit speaks what He hears, proceeding from the Father and the Son, because He remains substantially in both, and proceeds from both, He hears what He speaks through the unity of substance and the property of knowledge.

214
00:33:33,511 --> 00:35:02,781
The Son has everything from the Father, who said, "All that the Father has is mine" John sixteen, fifteen. What He received through the unity of nature, the Spirit received from Him through the same unity.
As the Lord Jesus Himself declares about His Spirit, saying: "Therefore I said, He will take what is mine and declare it to you" John sixteen, fourteen.
Saying that the Son has everything from the Father, and that the Spirit received everything from the Son through the unity of nature from the Father, doesn't He clearly declare that the Son is born from the Father, that is from the Father's substance, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, that is from the Son's substance?
Just as the Son received everything that belongs to the Father by being born, so too, the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Son, received whatever belongs to the Son.
Therefore, what the Spirit speaks is from the Son; what the Son gave is from the Father.
So, if what the Spirit speaks is from the Son, this teacher clearly testifies that whatever the Spirit has, He received from the Son, because He proceeds from Him; and if what the Son gave is from the Father, to whom did He give it?
Surely to the Holy Spirit who proceeds from Him: and if what He gave is from the Father, the Son received it from the Father by being born, so that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him.
He added: Thus, neither the Son nor the Spirit speaks anything on their own, because the Trinity speaks nothing outside itself.
The whole Trinity consists in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
However, the Son speaks nothing on His own, because He is not from Himself, but from the Father.
Similarly, the Spirit speaks nothing on His own, because He is not from Himself, but from the Son: only the Father is from no one.

215
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:11,523
Therefore, when the Son speaks, the whole Trinity speaks; and when the Spirit speaks, the whole Trinity speaks; and when the Father speaks, the whole Trinity speaks.

216
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:16,474
The Trinity speaks nothing outside itself, as it is neither divided nor separated from itself.

217
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:22,848
Also, in the third book of the same work, Chapter 1:
According to divinity, the Spirit is not above Christ but in Christ.

218
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:30,064
Just as the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are in the Father and the Son.

219
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:37,966
Blessed Ambrose, by saying that according to divinity the Spirit is not above Christ but in Christ, distinguishes Christ's humanity from His divinity.

220
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:48,501
In the Gospel, we read that the Holy Spirit came upon the Savior and remained upon Him; and the Father speaks to John: "The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him" (John 1:33).

221
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:59,036
Therefore, according to humanity, the Spirit came upon Christ and remained on Him; but according to divinity, the Spirit remains in Christ because He is equal to Him, sharing both substances with Him.

222
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:03,460
As it is written about the Father, He remains in the Son, and the Son in the Father.

223
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:14,259
The statement that the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ remain in the Father or the Son testifies to the unity of both Spirits, as they proceed from both and remain through consubstantiality in both.

224
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:27,796
He added: "For He remains in God, because He is from God," as it is written: "We have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit who is from God" (First Corinthians 2:12); and He remains in Christ because He received from Christ and is in Christ.

225
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:31,325
It is written again: "He will take from what is mine" (John 16:14).

226
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,064
So, where is the Spirit from God?

227
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:35,065
Clearly, because He proceeds from God.

228
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:37,014
And where did He receive from Christ?

229
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:39,279
Certainly, because He proceeds from Christ.

230
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,966
And where does He remain both in God and in Christ?

231
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,652
Absolutely, because He is consubstantial with both.

232
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:53,080
In the following chapters 7 and 8, speaking of the Antichrist, it says: "Whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the Spirit of His mouth" (Second Thessalonians 2:8).

233
00:36:53,975 --> 00:37:01,423
Here, grace is not acquired, but unity remains indivisible; because neither can Christ be without the Spirit, nor can the Spirit be without Christ.

234
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:04,210
For the unity of the divine nature cannot be separated.

235
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,770
Saint Ambrose also discusses the relationship between the humanity and divinity of Christ.

236
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:14,901
He clarifies that Christ isn't two separate beings—one human and one divine—but rather one perfect God and perfect human.

237
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:18,549
As a human, Christ became God by grace, but as God, He exists by nature.

238
00:37:18,549 --> 00:38:31,306
When Saint Ambrose said, "Whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the Spirit of His mouth," he emphasized that this grace is not acquired, thus highlighting the divine nature. The Spirit of the mouth that will destroy the Antichrist is understood to be the Holy Spirit, who is a person of the Holy Trinity. So, when he said, "Whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the Spirit of His mouth," it refers to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord Jesus.
It's also important to note that when it is said that the Spirit is the Spirit of the mouth of the Lord and now the Spirit of the mouth of the Lord Jesus, it clearly shows that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Jesus as well. This doesn't mean Jesus has a physical mouth in His divine nature, but that the Spirit proceeds from His substance. Just as the Spirit of the mouth of the Lord proceeds from the Father's substance, it is evident that the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son, as He is the Spirit of both.
Blessed Ambrose continues, showing that the unity of Christ and the Spirit remains indivisible. Neither Christ can be without the Spirit, nor the Spirit without Christ. Christ cannot be without the Spirit because He is consubstantial with Him, and the Spirit proceeds from Him. Similarly, the Spirit cannot be without Christ, as He is consubstantial with Christ and has received everything from Him. This emphasizes that the unity of the divine nature cannot be separated.

239
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:38,577
By saying this, he acknowledges that the nature of Christ is the nature of the Spirit, and the nature of the Spirit is the nature of Christ.

240
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:43,740
The bond of unity cannot be separated in any way, except that the Son is born, and the Spirit proceeds.

241
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,847
These do not create substance, but demonstrate a relationship.

242
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:50,657
He further explains: It is written that the sword of the Word is the Spirit.

243
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:55,318
Similarly, it is written that the sword of the Holy Spirit is the Word of God Ephesians 6:17.

244
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:04,742
After considering some assumptions, he concludes: Therefore, since the sword of the Word is the Holy Spirit, and the sword of the Holy Spirit is the Word, there is indeed a unity of power.

245
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,599
But what is the sword of the Word if not the Word itself?

246
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,656
And what is the sword of the Spirit if not the Spirit itself?

247
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:18,325
From this, we gather that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Word, whose sword it is, and the Word is the Spirit of the Holy Spirit, whose sword it is.

248
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:25,343
Neither the Word can be without the Holy Spirit, nor the Holy Spirit without the Word, because they operate as one and share the same power.

249
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:29,202
Since this is so, they cannot be separated in substance, nor divided in will.

250
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:34,315
Therefore, the Son and the Holy Spirit, being of one substance and one will, proceed from one another.

251
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:45,593
The Spirit proceeds from the Son, since the Son, born of the Father, gave everything he received by being born from the Father to the Spirit, not as to one lesser, nor as to an outsider, but as to one proceeding from himself.

252
00:39:45,593 --> 00:40:00,029
However, it must be noted that when it is said that the sword of the Holy Spirit is the Word, and the sword of the Word is the Holy Spirit, it does not imply a union of persons, but rather shows the coupling of substance, so that they are of one substance, though they are not one person.

253
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:05,442
One is from the other, namely the Spirit from the Son, but not the Son from the Spirit, but from the Father.

254
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:16,018
In this way, Saint Ambrose, in his reflections and debates on the Holy Spirit, did not appear ungrateful or heretical to the Greek emperors, namely Gratian and Theodosius the Great, in whose times he flourished.

255
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:20,630
They loved the holy man with all their hearts and always held him in the highest veneration.

256
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:27,613
His debates and tireless work for the Catholic faith defeated, conquered, and suppressed the Arians attacking the Church.

257
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:40,690
Now, listen, you emperors who strive to either defend the faith or imitate religion: by denying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, you have opposed Catholic bishops who have overthrown the Arians with their misguided beliefs about the Holy Spirit.

258
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:48,761
You have overturned the piety of your ancestors—namely, the Roman emperors—who always upheld this faith, fought for it, and cherished it with great reverence.

259
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,479
Chapter Five
From Didymus.

260
00:40:51,479 --> 00:41:02,433
Didymus of Alexandria, who was blinded from childhood but known for his spiritual insight, speaks in his book on the Holy Spirit as follows:
Whoever shares in the Holy Spirit immediately shares in both the Father and the Son.

261
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:12,363
And whoever has the love of the Father receives it from the Son through the Holy Spirit; and whoever partakes in the grace of Jesus Christ receives that same grace from the Father through the Holy Spirit.

262
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:16,452
From all of this, we see that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit work together as one.

263
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,864
Let’s examine this carefully.

264
00:41:17,864 --> 00:41:29,645
He says: Whoever shares in the Holy Spirit, and someone shares in the Spirit by partaking in Him, immediately shares in both the Father and the Son: for they have become a partaker of both the Father and the Son through sharing in the Spirit.

265
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:37,726
This shows that the Spirit is of the same essence as the Father and the Son, and so united that one cannot have the Spirit without also having the Father and the Son.

266
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:42,253
He adds: Whoever has the love of the Father receives it from the Son through the Holy Spirit.

267
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:48,825
Earlier, he showed only the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, but now he begins to teach about the procession of the Spirit.

268
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:54,569
He calls the love of the Father the Holy Spirit, as shown by what follows, saying it is given through the Holy Spirit.

269
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:58,220
The Holy Spirit does not give anything but His own gift when He gives love.

270
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:08,102
And it is written that love is God; therefore, when the Spirit gives love, He gives Himself, because He is love: but this love is said to be of the Father, because the Spirit is the Spirit of the Father.

271
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:10,000
And why is He the Spirit of the Father?

272
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,966
Because He proceeds from Him, not as one of the creatures, but as of the same substance as the Father.

273
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:20,710
Therefore, He is not said to be of the Father as created by Him, but as of the same substance and proceeding from Him.

274
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:27,574
He says that having the love of the Father is given by the Son through the Holy Spirit: so how does the Son give the gift of the Holy Spirit?

275
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:30,397
Clearly, as a collaborator with the Father and the Spirit.

276
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:35,532
But how can one give oneself an equal, or the gift of another, that is, the Holy Spirit?

277
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:41,439
Certainly, because love, which is from the Father and shared by the Son through the Holy Spirit, is also from the Son.

278
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,192
Whatever belongs to the Father also belongs to the Son.

279
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:48,397
But is the love, which is the Holy Spirit, so much the Son's, that it is a creature?

280
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:54,954
Not at all; rather, it is given by the Son because it proceeds from Him, and it is the Son's because it is consubstantial with Him.

281
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:58,158
It is added: And who is a partaker of the grace of Jesus Christ.

282
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:02,663
Here, he calls the grace of Jesus Christ what he previously called the love of the Father.

283
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:07,668
But what is it that he now calls the grace of Jesus Christ, known to be the gift of the Holy Spirit?

284
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:11,623
Without a doubt, he shows that it is shared by Jesus Christ, whose grace it is.

285
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:19,482
Just as the love of the Father is said to proceed from the Father, so the same love, called the grace of Jesus Christ, is known to proceed from Jesus Christ.

286
00:43:19,482 --> 00:43:24,387
However, anyone who has this same grace of Christ says it is given to him through the Holy Spirit.

287
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:32,997
Indeed, we see the whole Trinity working together and understand that the Holy Spirit, who is the love of the Father and the Son, proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

288
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:39,154
It follows: From all these things, it is clear that the same operation belongs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

289
00:43:39,154 --> 00:43:42,257
For those whose operation is the same, their will is also one.

290
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:44,860
And those whose will is one, their substance is one.

291
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,964
Hence, it is added: For those whose operation is one, their substance is also one.

292
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:53,069
Because those of the same substance are homousious, they have the same operations.

293
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:55,922
And those of another substance are dissonant and diverse.

294
00:43:55,922 --> 00:44:02,179
This shows that the Holy Spirit is of one substance with the Father and the Son, because it has the same operation with them.

295
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:08,436
It has been shown above that the Spirit is from the Father and the Son, because it proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

296
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:22,302
In the latter, it is said: For when he said, at the time of answering, undoubtedly the Son, that the disciples would be taught by the Spirit what they ought to answer, it follows: For I will give you a wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

297
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:22,852
Luke 21:15.

298
00:44:23,903 --> 00:44:32,400
This demonstrates that the wisdom given to the disciples by the Son is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, and that the teaching of the Holy Spirit is the teaching of the Lord.

299
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,077
But how is the wisdom given by the Son also the wisdom of the Holy Spirit?

300
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:40,897
It's because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, whose wisdom is also that of the Holy Spirit.

301
00:44:40,897 --> 00:44:45,021
And how can the teaching of the Holy Spirit be considered the teaching of the Lord?

302
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:51,083
It's because everything that belongs to the Holy Spirit also belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ, since it proceeds from Him.

303
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:55,406
Thus, it is stated: There is a unity of nature and will between the Spirit and the Son.

304
00:44:55,406 --> 00:45:01,269
This testifies that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, as the Spirit shares the same nature and will with the Son.

305
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:09,716
Otherwise, if the Spirit did not proceed from Him, it would not share the same will as the Son, since things that are separated in partnership are also separated in will.

306
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:25,815
It is also stated: And because it has been previously demonstrated that the Spirit is naturally united with the Only Begotten God and God the Father: the Son and the Father are one, according to the statement:
"I and the Father are one" (John 10:30); the Trinity is shown to be undivided and inseparable according to nature.

307
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:32,026
If the Spirit is naturally united with the Only Begotten God and God the Father, then it proceeds from the Only Begotten God.

308
00:45:32,026 --> 00:45:43,106
If it only proceeds from God the Father and not from the Only Begotten God, it is united with the Father by nature, but not with the Only Begotten God: for it cannot be united by nature to Him from whom it does not proceed.

309
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:51,454
But the author testifies that the Spirit is naturally united with the Only Begotten God:
therefore, he acknowledges that the Spirit proceeds from the Only Begotten God.

310
00:45:51,454 --> 00:46:01,491
And because he states that the Trinity is undivided and inseparable according to nature, he acknowledges that the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

311
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:14,162
If you teach that the Spirit only proceeds from the Father, then the Trinity is no longer undivided and inseparable, because the Spirit is divided from the Son, from whom it does not proceed: it is separated from the Only Begotten, whose Spirit it is not.

312
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:28,274
It is far from the belief of the Catholic Church to hold this impious opinion:
the Holy Trinity is undivided and inseparable by nature; the Father is from no one,
the Son is begotten from the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

313
00:46:28,274 --> 00:46:34,493
Another Gospel states:
"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you"
(Matthew 10:20).

314
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:48,216
So, if the Spirit of the Father speaks through the apostles, teaching them what to say,
and what is taught by the Spirit is wisdom, which we recognize as the Son,
it clearly shows that the Spirit shares the same nature with the Son and the Father, whose Spirit He is.

315
00:46:48,216 --> 00:46:50,478
Furthermore, the Father and the Son are one.

316
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:55,052
The author says that the wisdom the Spirit of the Father teaches the apostles
is the Son.

317
00:46:55,052 --> 00:47:01,940
If the wisdom is the Son, and the Holy Spirit speaks this wisdom, which is the Son, through the apostles,
He receives it from the Son.

318
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,328
But how does He receive it?

319
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:10,523
Certainly by proceeding, not by participating in something He did not have before:
for there was never a time when the Spirit lacked wisdom.

320
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:28,307
He received it from the Son to always be wise, proceeding from Him;
because He shares the same nature with both the Son and the Father, whose Spirit He is:
which he also referred to as the Spirit of the Son; whose wisdom the Spirit speaks, but as he mentioned earlier:
"For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father" (Matthew 10:20).

321
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:30,877
He further states: The Father and the Son are one.

322
00:47:30,877 --> 00:47:37,610
If the Father and the Son are one, then the Spirit, who is of the Father,
is also of the Son; and therefore, He proceeds from both.

323
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:59,506
After discussing many aspects of the consubstantiality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, he concluded:
From these points, it is clear, although the substance of the Trinity is undivided, that the Father is truly the Father of the Son,
and the Son is truly the Son of the Father, and the Holy Spirit is truly the Spirit of the Father and of God;
and moreover, the Spirit of wisdom and truth, that is, the Son of God.

324
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:13,282
If the Father is the Father of the Son because He begot Him, and the Son is the Son of the Father because He was begotten by Him, and the Holy Spirit is truly the Spirit of the Father because He proceeds from Him, then He is also the Spirit of wisdom and truth.

325
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:20,419
In other words, He is the Spirit of the Son of God because He proceeds from the Son, from truth, from wisdom, and from God, which is the Son.

326
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:29,226
For this reason, when it was said that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, it was added that He is the Spirit of God, intending to be understood as the person of the Son.

327
00:48:29,226 --> 00:48:34,692
To avoid any confusion, it was later clarified that the Spirit of wisdom and truth is indeed the Son of God.

328
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:40,463
Later, it was stated: We have frequently shown that the Spirit operates in the same way as the Father and the Son.

329
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:46,182
There is one substance in this operation, and the operation of those who share the same essence is not different.

330
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:52,762
The Spirit's operation is the same as that of the Father and the Son because He is consubstantial with both, proceeding from both.

331
00:48:52,762 --> 00:48:56,457
He cannot be part of the same operation if He does not proceed from both.

332
00:48:56,457 --> 00:49:09,566
The substance is divided among those from whom it does not proceed coherently, and He cannot be substantially united to either the Father or the Son in any other way, because as substance, the Spirit is received from both the Father and the Son by proceeding.

333
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:23,688
Furthermore, in discussing the Spirit of truth who is sent by the Father, if He is the Comforter, the Savior said: For He does not speak from Himself (John 16:13); that is, without me, and without my and the Father's will; because He is inseparable from my and the Father's will.

334
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:27,130
For this very reason, He subsists and speaks from the Father and me.

335
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,483
I speak the truth, that is, I inspire what He speaks, since He is the Spirit of truth.

336
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,804
Clearly, this teacher instructs us that the Holy Spirit comes from the Son.

337
00:49:35,804 --> 00:51:06,815
When he says, "He does not speak on His own," he shows that the Spirit is not acting independently. Explaining further, he says, "This means without me, and without my and the Father's will," indicating that the Spirit comes from both the Father and the Son, and does not act without their will.
By saying, "For this very thing which exists and speaks, I, the truth, speak," he shows that the Spirit's existence is from the Son. If, when the Spirit speaks, the truth speaks—that is, the Son—it demonstrates that what the Spirit communicates comes from the Son. Emphasizing this point more clearly, he adds, "I inspire what He speaks."
How does He inspire? Clearly, since the Spirit proceeds from Him and connects. Indeed, He is the Spirit of truth, which means He is the Spirit of the Son. All these points demonstrate that the Spirit is from the Son and is inspired by the Son, meaning He proceeds from Him. And since what the Spirit speaks and the Spirit's very existence come from the Son, it shows they are consubstantial and the Spirit proceeds from Him.
Therefore, the Father speaks, and the Son hears; or conversely, the Son speaks, and the Father hears. This signifies the same nature in the Father and the Son and their agreement. The Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of truth and the Spirit of wisdom, cannot hear something the Son says without already knowing it, as it is expressed by the Son.
Saying that the Father speaks and is heard by the Son demonstrates the Son's origin from the Father. Similarly, when the Son speaks and is heard by the Father, it implies that He was begotten by the Father. Because the Father and the Son share the same nature, they are also in complete agreement. So, when the Father speaks to the Son or the Son speaks to the Father, it reflects a unified will and harmony.

338
00:51:06,815 --> 00:51:12,796
The Holy Spirit, also known as the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Wisdom, is acknowledged as the Spirit of the Son.

339
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:23,286
It's said that He cannot hear anything from the Son that He doesn't already know because, being of the same substance as the Son and proceeding from the Son, what the Son speaks, the Holy Spirit also speaks.

340
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:27,746
The Spirit is essentially the utterance of the Son, as explained by the current teacher.

341
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:35,956
After stating that the Holy Spirit cannot hear anything from the Son that He doesn't know, it follows that the Spirit is the very thing that is spoken by the Son.

342
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:39,605
In other words, the utterance of the Son is the substance of the Spirit.

343
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:46,498
For it is said that since He is the very thing spoken, it is understood as the Spirit; what is spoken by the Son is what the Son speaks.

344
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:52,883
If what the Son speaks is the Holy Spirit, as this teacher asserts, it cannot be denied that the Spirit proceeds from the Son.

345
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:55,671
Indeed, the utterance of the Son proceeds from the Son.

346
00:51:55,671 --> 00:52:01,347
Therefore, since the Spirit is the same as what is spoken by the Son, the Spirit entirely proceeds from the Son.

347
00:52:01,347 --> 00:52:11,584
It adds: Finally, lest anyone should separate Him from the will and fellowship of the Father and the Son, it is written: For He will not speak on His own, but will speak only what He hears (John 16:13).

348
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:15,487
Similarly, the Savior says about Himself: I judge only as I hear (John 5:30).

349
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:24,305
The will of the Father is the will of the Son, and the fellowship of both is the Spirit of both, because love, which is the Spirit, unites the will of the Father and the Son.

350
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:32,414
Nor can the will of the Spirit be separated from the will of the Father and the Son; just as there is the fellowship of both, so there is the same will of both.

351
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:37,735
And just as the will of the Son is born from the Father, so the will of the Spirit proceeds from the Son.

352
00:52:37,735 --> 00:52:42,955
Hence it is said about the Spirit: For He will not speak on His own, but will speak only what He hears.

353
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:44,121
From whom does He hear?

354
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,351
Clearly from the Son, from whom He proceeds.

355
00:52:46,351 --> 00:52:51,672
And to hear the Spirit is to proceed from the Son, just as to hear the Son is to be born from the Father.

356
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:55,067
For to hear the Son and to be born are not different, but the same.

357
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:59,325
Likewise, to hear the Spirit and to proceed are not different, but one and the same.

358
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,589
And below: It is written: Whatever he does (no doubt the Father), the Son does likewise.

359
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:17,200
So, if the Father and the Son are working, not in the order of first and second, but at the same time doing the same and similar things, everything that is made exists: and the Son cannot do anything by himself because he cannot be separated from the Father.

360
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:27,757
Similarly, the Holy Spirit is in no way separated from the Son, because of the sharing of will and nature, and he is believed not to speak by himself; but according to the word and truth of God, he speaks everything.

361
00:53:27,757 --> 00:54:10,135
The Father and the Son do the same works, not at one time the Father and another time the Son, but at the same time together: and the Son cannot work separately, because he is not divided from the Father, since he is born from the Father and of the same substance as the Father: likewise, the Holy Spirit does not speak by himself separated from the Son; because proceeding from the Son, he shares the nature of the Son: and the will is the same as the Son's: for the will does not separate those whom nature joins, but according to the word and truth of God, he speaks everything; because proceeding from the word and truth, he understands what he speaks: for what proceeds is not different from the understanding of speaking, but the understanding of speaking is the existence of the proceeding, just as the proceeding of existence is the understanding of speaking.

362
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:21,915
And below: Just as we understood above when discussing incorporeal natures, so now we must understand that the Holy Spirit receives from the Son what is of his own nature, and this does not indicate a giver and a receiver, but one substance.

363
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:34,819
Indeed, the Son is also said to receive the same from the Father, which he himself subsists as: for the Son is not anything else except what is given to him by the Father, nor is the substance of the Holy Spirit anything other than what is given to him by the Son.

364
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:41,528
He confirms that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son and states that the Holy Spirit receives from the Son what is of His own nature.

365
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:48,136
This means that the nature of the Spirit comes from the Son, and receiving the Spirit from the Son is the same as proceeding from the Son.

366
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:53,021
He explains that the giver and the receiver should not be understood as being of different substances.

367
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:58,145
Instead, the Son gives so that the Spirit exists, and the Spirit receives so that it proceeds from the Son.

368
00:54:58,145 --> 00:55:02,119
He supports his view with the fact that the Son is said to receive from the Father.

369
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:08,105
The Son is not different from what He receives from the Father; rather, the Son's reception from the Father is His existence.

370
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:13,229
He further clarifies this by stating that the Son is nothing other than what is given to Him by the Father.

371
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:24,530
This means it is not permissible to separate what the Father gives to the Son from the substance of the Son, because the substance given by the Father is the Son’s, as He received everything that belongs to the Father through His birth.

372
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:30,612
Similarly, he acknowledges that the Holy Spirit does not have a different substance apart from what is given to Him by the Son.

373
00:55:30,612 --> 00:55:36,741
The Holy Spirit is not different from what the Son gives to the Spirit; the gift of the Son is the substance of the Holy Spirit.

374
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:45,169
This clearly shows that the Holy Spirit is from the Son, not as a part, but as the whole, which is the Son; because whatever belongs to the Son also belongs to the Holy Spirit.

375
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:51,107
The Holy Spirit receives from the Son, proceeding from Him as consubstantial, and having everything that belongs to the Son.

376
00:55:51,107 --> 00:56:02,839
Later on, he explains how he said, "He will take from what is mine," and immediately added, "Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said, ‘He will take from what is mine and declare it to you’" (John chapter 16, verses 13 and 14).

377
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:15,625
In a way, he is saying that although the Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, and God gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him, nevertheless, because everything the Father has is mine, and this very Spirit of the Father is mine, He will take from what is mine.

378
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:21,074
This statement teaches that the Spirit proceeds from the Son, just as it proceeds from the Father.

379
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:24,718
It is the Spirit of truth, specifically of Christ, who embodies the truth.

380
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:32,105
Because the Son has everything that belongs to the Father, this very Spirit of the Father testifies that it is from the Son and receives from the Son.

381
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:33,140
What does it receive?

382
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,553
It receives its existence by proceeding from Him.

383
00:56:35,553 --> 00:56:41,413
Consequently, the same Spirit is of God and of Christ, bringing and uniting those who have it to the Lord Jesus Christ.

384
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:47,126
Hence, it is later said:
"But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him" (Romans 8:9).

385
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:51,263
If it is the Spirit of God, it is also the Spirit of Christ, as the author confirms.

386
00:56:51,263 --> 00:56:57,025
There is no doubt that there are not two Spirits, one of the Father and one of the Son, but one and the same of both.

387
00:56:57,025 --> 00:57:03,821
And if the Spirit of Christ is the same as the Spirit of God the Father, just as it proceeds from the Father, so it proceeds from the Son.

388
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:08,795
It is not otherwise called the Spirit of God the Father, except that it proceeds from God the Father.

389
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:13,277
So it is not otherwise called the Spirit of Christ, except because it proceeds from Christ.

390
00:57:13,277 --> 00:57:16,921
For it is not a creature, to be possessed as inferior, but consubstantial.

391
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:23,225
Thus, when he adds that not having the Spirit of Christ means not being of Christ, he acknowledges that it proceeds from Christ.

392
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:25,884
Nor can one be of Christ who does not have His Spirit.

393
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:29,184
For in whom there is not the Spirit of Christ, there is not Christ.

394
00:57:29,184 --> 00:57:32,434
They are not separated by habitation, who are united by substance.

395
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:37,261
Hence, we learn that the relationship the Spirit has with Christ, it also has with God the Father.

396
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:42,185
For it cannot lack the relationship with those to whom it is consubstantial and from whom it exists.

397
00:57:42,185 --> 00:57:58,536
Further below: In the Epistle of Peter, the Holy Spirit is proven to be the Spirit of Christ:
searching and inquiring (that is, the prophets about whom he had spoken earlier) into what or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.

398
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:07,904
And shortly after:
This Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God, as it says: No one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God First Corinthians 2:11.

399
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:19,580
Therefore, he acknowledges the Spirit of Christ, who is the Spirit of God, and thus proceeds from both; because there is no other reason why it is called the Spirit of both: for it is equal and of the same substance.

400
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:25,364
Again, it speaks below: If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him Romans 8:9.

401
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:28,283
And it continues: But if Christ is in you Romans 8:10.

402
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:38,662
It very clearly shows that the Holy Spirit is inseparable from Christ; because wherever the Spirit is, there also is Christ: and wherever the Spirit of Christ departs, likewise Christ departs.

403
00:58:38,662 --> 00:59:00,014
This union of the Spirit and Christ, which it teaches, is not only of will, but also of substance, and not only of substance, but also of procession: for things that are separate in substance can be united by will; as when Christ speaks to the disciples: Behold, I am with you all the days Matthew 28:20; or as he said in the present passage, where the Spirit of Christ is, there also is Christ.

404
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:07,041
In those in whom the Spirit of Christ is, Christ also is equally present: they are together indeed, but by will, not by substance.

405
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:10,285
For God and man are not of one, but of different substances.

406
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:15,258
Again, they can be united in substance, and also joined by birth, as the Father and the Son.

407
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:20,285
Again, they are united in substance, not by birth, but by procession, the Son and the Spirit.

408
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:36,664
Therefore, when he says, wherever the Spirit is, there also is Christ; and wherever the Spirit of Christ departs, likewise Christ departs, he shows this union not only of will and substance, but also of procession; that the Spirit is not only of the same substance as Christ, but also proceeds from him.

409
00:59:36,664 --> 00:59:43,637
Again, taking up the Apostle's testimony later, he says: You have not received a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear Romans.

410
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:56,889
Romans 8:15 tells us that we refrain from vices, not like servants out of fear and terror of punishments, but because we have been given the Spirit of adoption—the Holy Spirit, also known as the Spirit of the Son, Christ, truth, and wisdom.

411
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:57,944
What does this mean?

412
00:59:57,944 --> 01:00:01,636
Truth and wisdom are Christ, as the Scripture confirms multiple times.

413
01:00:01,636 --> 01:00:08,651
Christ is undoubtedly the Son of the Father, which affirms the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, from Christ, from truth and wisdom.

414
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:11,499
They are not different Spirits but the same substance.

415
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:13,767
Wisdom, truth, and Christ proclaim the Son.

416
01:00:13,767 --> 01:01:18,691
Christ represents the human nature He assumed; He is truth because He said, "I am the truth." He is wisdom as Paul testifies in First Corinthians 1:30, that He was made wisdom for us by God.
What do these points conclude? Without a doubt, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, whose Spirit He is said to be. He cannot be a part of or subject to the Son. So, where does He come from? By procession or consubstantiality. Consubstantiality shows equality, and equality is not subjected but conferred. Therefore, the Spirit of the Son undoubtedly proceeds from the Son.
These points, briefly collected from the book of Didymus, should suffice. In Alexandria, holding such views about the Holy Spirit, neither the Greeks nor the emperors censured or suspended Didymus from communion. The emperors, reigning not only in Constantinople but also in Rome, understood that this was a Catholic doctrine—the apostolic faith—defeating heretic perfidy and affirming the doctrine of truth.
Now, modern emperors, establishing a new sect of error, consider whose faith you hold and who taught you the doctrine of Christ. You are shown not to be disciples of your predecessors who strengthened the Catholic faith and fought against false doctrines.

417
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:21,887
Chapter Six
From Paschasius.

418
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:36,166
Let's explore what the Roman Church thought about the Holy Spirit during those times, to prove that the teaching he preaches is not a new sect, but one that has long been endorsed by the Fathers, upheld throughout the entire body of the Church, and opposed to those who think differently.

419
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:42,413
We will show that it is wrongly criticized as if it were a new doctrine, when it has always been preached by our predecessors.

420
01:01:42,413 --> 01:02:34,570
Paschasius, an ancient teacher and deacon of the Roman see, following in the footsteps of Didymus of Alexandria, writes in his little book on the Holy Spirit (Book 1, Chapter 2):
"Do not probe into how God exists, whom it is clear exists as God.
Here the reasoning is hidden, the truth is not hidden.
Why do you ask how He is the companion and equal of the King, whom it is established is of royal honor and lineage?
The inquiry about the name is superfluous, where there is no doubt about the sublimity."
This is against the Arians, who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, unwilling to confess Him as consubstantial with the Father and the Son, but claimed He was a creature subject to the Son, as if lesser.
Truly refuting them, he preaches that the Holy Spirit is true God and consubstantial with the Father and the Son.
He also clarifies what he believes about the procession by adding:
"Therefore, since the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, he says: 'But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ' (Romans 8:9).

421
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:39,230
And in another place: 'He breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit''" (John 20:22).

422
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:50,534
He bears witness that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son; he strengthens his assertion both from the Apostle and from the Gospel, equally showing that the Spirit cannot be of Christ unless He proceeds from Him.

423
01:02:50,534 --> 01:03:06,400
Nor does Christ otherwise give the Spirit by breathing, except by sending Him from His own substance, since when He is called the Spirit of Christ, He is shown to have a relation to Christ, not as a servant (for He is not a creature), but as receiving existence by proceeding from Him, not by being created or generated.

424
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:12,828
Similarly, when he breathes into him by sending, he does not send a stranger, nor from anywhere other than his own nature.

425
01:03:12,828 --> 01:03:17,792
The process from the Son cannot be denied, as it is from the depths of his divinity that he sends.

426
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:22,757
He further adds, speaking of the same Spirit: Are you asking whether he is begotten or unbegotten?

427
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:27,518
The holy scriptures have said nothing about this, and it is wrong to break the divine silence.

428
01:03:27,518 --> 01:03:33,547
What God did not indicate in his scriptures, he did not want you to inquire about or know out of unnecessary curiosity.

429
01:03:33,547 --> 01:03:37,396
He judged that what pertains to your salvation should reach your conscience.

430
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:43,577
He speaks against those who, disparaging the person of the Holy Spirit in the Holy Trinity, did not accept that he is God.

431
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:48,288
They argue that if he were considered God, he would have to be either begotten or unbegotten.

432
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:53,202
If begotten, there would be two sons, and the Savior could no longer be called the only-begotten.

433
01:03:53,202 --> 01:04:00,040
This would contradict the Catholic faith, which confesses belief in God the Father Almighty and in Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son.

434
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,018
Conversely, if he were confessed as unbegotten, there would be two Fathers, which also contradicts the Catholic faith.

435
01:04:06,018 --> 01:04:08,348
For we believe in one God the Father Almighty.

436
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:19,391
To those contriving such perverse ideas, this Catholic teacher replies piously and cautiously, stating that the Holy Spirit should be called neither begotten nor unbegotten, as the holy scriptures do not speak of this.

437
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:26,889
Instead, it should be professed what they affirm, namely that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial with the Father and the Son, and proceeds from both.

438
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:40,211
In later writings, it is said: In the Acts of the Apostles, Peter, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, says: Therefore, being exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out what you see and hear.

439
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:40,718
Acts 2:33.

440
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:46,493
The Son is at the right hand, the Father is in God, and the Holy Spirit is designated by the property of his name.

441
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:52,460
This testimony confirmed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, who said it was poured out by Him.

442
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:58,669
He poured out what He contained within Himself, not as if confined to a place, but while substantially remaining in Himself.

443
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:04,476
He did not pour out in such a way as to empty Himself, like a vessel becomes empty when its contents are poured out.

444
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:08,331
This is the case with physical things; it is not the same with divine things.

445
01:05:08,331 --> 01:05:15,491
When either the Father or the Son pours out the Spirit, they do not empty themselves but share the grace of their gift without losing anything.

446
01:05:15,491 --> 01:05:27,607
And further down, presenting the Apostle's testimony:
"You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him" (Romans 8:9).

447
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:34,566
When he says the Spirit of God and consequently the Spirit of Christ, notice that he designates the person of Christ under the name of God.

448
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:43,578
Or if he signifies the Father, whose Spirit it is, under the name of God, behold the Spirit is declared to be, by the unity of substance, the Spirit of both the Father and the Son.

449
01:05:43,578 --> 01:05:48,985
Rightly, it is known to proceed from both, and in the bond of the Trinity is seen to have a distinct person.

450
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:52,290
Whoever does not have the Holy Spirit is shown not to have Christ.

451
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:59,299
Therefore, the Holy Spirit is God, who, if denied, also denies Christ, who said:
"No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6).

452
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:04,005
Whoever is empty of the Holy Spirit is not of Christ and has lost the way to reach the Father.

453
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:15,420
He showed with many reasons that the Holy Spirit is God, consubstantial with the Father and the Son, proceeding from both, and cannot be separated from the bond of the Trinity, being of the same nature as the Father and the Son.

454
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,075
He emphasizes that one cannot have Christ without having the Holy Spirit.

455
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:27,787
Since the Holy Spirit is God, whoever denies the Spirit consequently denies Christ, which would not happen if He did not remain in Christ and was not consubstantial with Him.

456
01:06:28,487 --> 01:06:38,086
To remain in Christ and be consubstantial with Him, the Spirit proceeding from Him demonstrates this: for it cannot proceed from Him unless it remains in Him and is consubstantially attached.

457
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:48,287
Since Christ is the way to the Father, whoever does not have the Spirit cannot have Christ as the way: for one cannot have one without the other, as they are neither divided in substance nor in dwelling.

458
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:56,377
Therefore, one who is empty of the Holy Spirit is also found empty of Christ; because whoever does not have the source is not inundated by the source's watering.

459
01:06:56,377 --> 01:07:00,548
By all these things, it is clearly shown that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Christ.

460
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:11,503
And later (chapter 11): Nothing in the Holy Spirit should be considered half-full, because it is compared to fullness: for He who is given as a pledge in place of God must not be believed to be anything other than God.

461
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:21,754
Whoever denies that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son considers the Holy Spirit half-full, and whoever does not attribute the procession to the Son denies that He is given as a pledge in place of God.

462
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:30,146
For God cannot be understood as full, to whom the consubstantiality of the Son is denied; nor can He represent the place of God, to whom the Son is not consubstantial.

463
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:44,317
But no Catholic feels this way; instead, they confess that God is full and consubstantial with the Father and the Son: they know that the Son proceeds from where He also takes substance; and He who is united in substance to the Father and the Son must necessarily proceed from both.

464
01:07:44,317 --> 01:07:55,121
Again, he adds, citing a chapter from the same Apostle to Titus: He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit, which He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ (Titus 3:5).

465
01:07:55,121 --> 01:08:00,950
Behold, even here under the manifest Trinity, the Father through the Son pours out the abundance of the Holy Spirit.

466
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:06,428
And, what is most noteworthy, he attributes the power of regeneration and renewal to the Holy Spirit Himself.

467
01:08:06,428 --> 01:08:13,463
The Father poured out the Holy Spirit on us abundantly through Jesus Christ: to show that He proceeds from both the Father and Jesus Christ.

468
01:08:14,015 --> 01:08:18,974
While it is poured out for us, the Father pours out the Holy Spirit because He is sent by the Father.

469
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:22,853
He pours out through Jesus Christ because He works with the Father in this act.

470
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:30,021
It is not said that the Father pours out through Jesus Christ as if Christ does not participate, for the Father and the Son are unified in action.

471
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:36,452
The Father pours out through Jesus Christ because when the Father pours out, Jesus Christ also pours out, since He is sent by both.

472
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:38,661
He proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

473
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:43,325
This author testifies to the power of the Holy Spirit, equal to that of the Father and the Son.

474
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:50,837
He states that the power of regeneration and renewal is attributed to the Holy Spirit to show that He possesses the same power as the Father and the Son.

475
01:08:50,837 --> 01:08:54,126
Thus, He is affirmed to be consubstantial and to proceed from both.

476
01:08:54,126 --> 01:09:00,803
Later, in chapter twelve, the Psalmist gives testimony, saying: "Where can I go from Your Spirit?" (Psalm one thirty-nine, verse seven).

477
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:05,958
This means, where can I hide from His presence, which is undoubtedly everywhere, both inside and outside?

478
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:11,653
And further, it is clearly understood: "Nor is there anyone who can hide from His heat" (Psalm nineteen, verse six).

479
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:21,276
His ineffable greatness enters, fills, and encompasses everything, and He is said to be sent by the Father and the Son, proceeding from their substance, and recognized as working as one with them.

480
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:25,056
By all these things, the majesty and procession of the Holy Spirit are shown.

481
01:09:25,056 --> 01:09:33,894
Since it is testified that no place is remote from the presence of the Holy Spirit, He is compared to the divinity of the Father and the Son, penetrating and containing all things.

482
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:43,467
Consequently, adding that no one is untouched by the heat of His fire, it is testified that this is also said of the Son: "Who enlightens every man coming into this world" (John one, verse nine).

483
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:50,095
This shows that He has the same power as the Son, since the Son enlightens every man, and no one is exempt from the heat of the Spirit.

484
01:09:50,831 --> 01:09:59,136
When it is said that He is sent by both the Father and the Son, and that He proceeds from their substance, it shows from whom the Spirit comes and whose power He possesses.

485
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:05,027
This indicates that He is God, equal to the Father and the Son in both power and substance, because He proceeds from both.

486
01:10:05,027 --> 01:10:16,856
Furthermore, when the Son says: The Advocate who proceeds from the Father (John 15:26), He does not say who is created by the Father, but proceeds from the Father, meaning from the fellowship of the Father’s power and the property of His nature.

487
01:10:16,856 --> 01:10:21,492
This statement shows that when He proceeds from the Father, He has no beginning with the Father.

488
01:10:21,492 --> 01:10:27,672
Do not think that He wanted to deny that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son because He said that He proceeds from the Father.

489
01:10:27,672 --> 01:10:33,756
Earlier, He said that He is sent by the Father and the Son, that He proceeds from their substance, and works as one with them.

490
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:38,970
Now, He also says that He proceeds from the fellowship of the Father’s power and the property of His nature.

491
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:44,909
Just as the Father and the Son are not separated in power or nature, they are not separated in the existence of the Spirit.

492
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:51,234
Since He is the Spirit of both, He proceeds from both, and those who are equal in nature and power are not separated by procession.

493
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:57,270
He says below: But what is it that the Son is said to be born of God the Father, and the Holy Spirit is indicated to proceed?

494
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:02,774
The difference between being born and proceeding is that one is born from one, while the other proceeds from both.

495
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:06,202
He also professes that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.

496
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:10,982
The reason given is that if we say He proceeds only from the Father, we risk endangering the faith.

497
01:11:10,982 --> 01:11:15,521
How can the Son be called the only begotten of the Father when the Spirit is also of the same?

498
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:19,818
And how can it be proven that He is not the Son, who exists from the Father like the Son?

499
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:24,115
Such blasphemy must be avoided to protect the Catholic faith from the attacks of enemies.

500
01:11:24,839 --> 01:11:31,645
It should be said, therefore, as our ancestors did:
The Son is born from the Father, the only one from the only one, and thus the only begotten.

501
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:35,237
But the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, yet not from the Father alone.

502
01:11:35,237 --> 01:11:39,679
If we confess that the Spirit proceeds only from the Father, we might seem to preach two Sons.

503
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:46,106
Therefore, this teacher, following the doctrine of his elders, passed down to his successors what he had received from his predecessors.

504
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:54,802
Although he proved that the Roman Church holds the same belief about the Holy Spirit as it does today, he did not show that it was ever divided from the Eastern Churches in such faith.

505
01:11:54,802 --> 01:11:58,063
Nor that it ever thought or taught differently about the Holy Spirit.

506
01:11:58,063 --> 01:12:01,324
But now it is astonishing what the discoverers of new doctrine argue.

507
01:12:01,324 --> 01:12:05,294
Why do they separate themselves from the communion that their ancestors always held?

508
01:12:05,294 --> 01:12:07,515
Why do they pass judgment before understanding?

509
01:12:07,515 --> 01:12:09,122
Why do they accuse before hearing?

510
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:12,194
This is not a judgment of fairness, but a prejudice of injustice.

511
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:25,757
But if they think it is enough that they know for sure that the Roman Church preaches that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and therefore do not want to inquire what they evidently know to be said,
let them know that they judge their ancestors along with the Romans.

512
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:32,185
While they wish to deprive the Romans of their communion, they equally excommunicate themselves from the society of their own ancestors.

513
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:37,194
They prove to communicate with no Catholic Church while they make themselves strangers to Roman communion.

514
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:41,495
Let them quickly consider whose evil deed this is, and not delay in correcting their error.

515
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:46,883
If they do not wish to communicate with the Romans, they fear being excommunicated from the whole Catholic Church.
