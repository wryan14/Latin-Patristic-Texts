With the conception, God is united with man, and the womb, which was small for the world, holds Him.

In sermone de Natali Domini, dum de\nmodestia Virginis, et mirabili Salvatoris conceptu\ndeclamaret, sic ait: Pronuntiato per angelum partu\ncoepit Verbum formari, conceptione colligitur in homine\nDeus, et eum sustinet venter cui parvus fuerat\nmundus, et intra breve virginei corporis spatium\npro nobis est incarnata majestas; fecunda viscera\n Verbo auctore tenduntur; completisque novem mensibus\nventer coelestem hominem fudit: natum Dominum\npublicat angelicus sermo. Diligenti descriptione\nquam brevissime prosecutus est, et principia\nconceptus, et constructionem soliditatis, et augmentum\ncorporis. Mensium quoque spatium quo intra\nsecreta ventris infantilis coaluit successus, inde progressus\nin auras, et in nativitatem Dei angelica conclamatio. Vide profecto quoniam et conceptum dicitur,\net concretum, et fusum, id est non per peregrinam\nirruptionem egressum, sed per vestibulum ventris\nvirginalis fusum. Item in alio sermone super eadem nativitate:\nNatus ergo Dominus noster ex carne quidem, sed\nnon ex corruptione carnali: natus ut homo, sed non\n genitus ut homo. Ita suscepit carnem, ut servaret\nmajestatis honorem; et sic segregavit puritatem\nnativitatis suae a colluvione concretionis humanae. Peregit quidem in ortu suo plenam hominis dispensationem,\nsed Dei tamen non deseruit dignitatem. Vides a docto viro et divinitatem Filii Dei, et humanae\nnativitatis ordinem designari. Dicit enim eum\nnatum ex carne, scilicet de membris et humanitate\nvirginis, lege quidem carnis, sed praeter corruptionem\ncarnis; utque manifestius quid dicitur animadvertas,\nait: Natus ut homo, sed non genitus\nut homo. Cerne quam plenissime nativitatis Christi\nmysterium reseravit: Ait namque: Natus ut\nhomo, sed non genitus ut homo.",
