What they do not want or cannot imitate, they maliciously criticize and tear down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Therefore, it happened that at a certain time, two clients of the bishop who was then presiding over the Church of Trier, named Rusticus, came to blessed Goar under the false pretense of piety. One was called Albuinus, and the other Adalwinus. They claimed they had come to seek what was necessary for the church lights of Saint Peter in the aforementioned city. While they were supposedly looking for supplies for physical light, they could not hide the darkness of their malicious intentions.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Aemulorum vexationes patitur\n9. Sed sicut bonorum hominum est aliorum actibus\nquos laude dignos aspexerint gratulari, et eis ad\nsuum uti profectum; ita contra reproborum mentes\nconantur semper recta electorum opera offuscare, et\n quae imitari nolunt aut etiam nequeunt, malivolo\ndetractionis ore et studio carpere. Unde accidit ut\nquodam tempore ad beatum Goaram duo sub falsa\nspecie pietatis clientes episcopi qui tunc Treverorum\npraesidebat Ecclesiae, Rustici nomine, venirent, quorum\nalter Albuinus, alter vocabatur Adalwinus , dicentes se ea quae ad luminaria ecclesiae\nB. Petri urbis jam dictae necessaria essent quaesitum\nvenisse. Qui dum corporei luminis fomenta\nrequirunt, vel magis se quaerere mentiuntur, quibus\nmalivolentiae tenebris caecati essent celare minime\npotuerunt.",
