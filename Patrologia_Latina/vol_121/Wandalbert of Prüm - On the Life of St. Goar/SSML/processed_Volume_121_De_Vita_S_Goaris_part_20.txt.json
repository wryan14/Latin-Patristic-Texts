He began to look around to see where his disciple, with whom he had come, might sit, or where he could hang his cowl. Then he saw in the corner of the house what looked like a wooden beam attached to the wall-it was actually a sunbeam coming through a small window. Approaching it, thinking it was a beam, he hung his cloak on it and instructed his disciple to stand nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    It is not surprising that a sunbeam took on the hardness of wood to serve a holy man, since all creation is subject to the will of the Creator who is devoutly served.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
