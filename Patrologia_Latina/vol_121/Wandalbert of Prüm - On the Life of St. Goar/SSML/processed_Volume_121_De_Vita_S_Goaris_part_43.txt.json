      "original_latin": "De Waltario homine nobili daemoniaco. 10. Waltarius quidam, homo secundum saeculum\nnobilis, qui nunc usque superest, cum vexationem\ngravissimam pateretur, et indubie spiritu daemonico\nageretur, insutus corio ad venerabilem tumulum est\ndeportatus; ubi cum aliquandiu jacuisset, protensis\nmanibus, seipsum suaque omnia sancto Goari magnae\nvocis professione subjecit, et optimam insuper\nvineam dedit, quae nunc usque in ejusdem Cellae\npossessione perdurat; continuoque ea quam diutissime\npassus fuerat amentia caruit. Is hodieque licet\nin libertate propria maneat, et interdum avaritiae\n aestu succensus (ut a multis incusatur) aliena quoque\ndiripiat, servum se tamen sancti Goaris, et ab\neo sanatum esse voce liberrima protestatur.",
