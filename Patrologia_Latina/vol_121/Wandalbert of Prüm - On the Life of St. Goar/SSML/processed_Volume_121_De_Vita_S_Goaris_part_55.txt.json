      "original_latin": "De ancilla cujusdam Hadebaldi bis sanata. 21. Item Hadebaldi cujusdam noti hominis ancilla,\nquae et caeca esset et muta, ad memoriam venerandam\npopulo teste sanata est. Sed cum his agnitis,\ndominus qui infirmam miserat, ad suum servitium\njam incolumem revocasset, mox in illam prior debilitas\nrediit. Coactus itaque evidenti miraculo ejus\ndominus manumissam ad locum reverti fecit; nec\n multo post sanitas quae collata ante fuerat, sed temeritate\nhominis praepedita, correcto domino ancillae\nest restituta; quae et reliquum vitae suae in eodem\nloco peregit. Denique adhuc ibi soror ejus degit, et\ncertissima rei geste testis assistit.",
