He was then possessed by a fierce demon. Tormented by it, he eventually returned the vineyard and was immediately cured. This example serves as a warning to others that it is not right for heirs, the children, to take away property dedicated to the church by their parents' vow.</p>\n</speak>",

Sed ut propositum persequar, Willigelmus\nquidam, qui nuncusque superest, cum vineam a\nmatre datam de jure et possessione ecclesiae S. Goaris\nsubtraxisset, saevo daemonio est mancipatus. Denique\nab eo vexatus vineam reddidit et curari continuo\nmeruit, ut hoc exemplo caeteri monerentur, voto\nparentum res juri ecclesiae mancipatas subtrahi ab\nhaeredibus filiis non oportere.",
