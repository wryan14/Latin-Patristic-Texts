Consider divinity and goodness as the essence of the act of benefiting and deifying, rather than something that can be mimicked by a super-god and super-good, through which we become divine and good.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        If this principle becomes the cause of deification, and the best is done for those who are deified and made excellent, then for every principal cause beyond the principalities, the essence of divinity and goodness reaches its peak. As much as it is inimitable and immeasurable, it surpasses all imitations and participations, as well as those who imitate and participate.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
