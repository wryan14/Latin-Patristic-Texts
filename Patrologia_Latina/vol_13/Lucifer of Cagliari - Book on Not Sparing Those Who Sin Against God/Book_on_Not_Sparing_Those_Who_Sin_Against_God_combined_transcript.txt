Book on Not Sparing Those Who Sin Against God
by Lucifer of Cagliari
When you, Emperor, were overcome by the servants of God from every side, you said you were suffering and being insulted by us against the warnings of the Holy Scriptures. You claimed we were disrespectful towards you, who should have been honored.
If any of God's worshippers spared apostates, what you're saying about us would be true.
Where should we begin to show that, just as you are being corrected by us now, all who have gone astray have been corrected by God's worshippers?
Where else but from the actions of Moses, God's servant.
We read in Exodus that Moses went up the mountain after receiving the covenant, and he killed many of them because of their guilt of idolatry.
Moses stood at the gates of the camp and said, "Whoever is for the Lord, come to me."
All the sons of Levi gathered around him, and he said to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Each man put on his sword and go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, killing his brother, friend, and neighbor."
The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand people fell that day.
Moses said to them, "You have consecrated yourselves to the Lord today, for each of you was against his own son and brother, and the Lord has blessed you this day" (Exodus 32:26-29).
We are insolent to you just as Moses was to that stubborn people.
They did not like what Moses said or did when they had already chosen not to serve the God who had freed them from Pharaoh's power, but instead served the calf that the fire had formed for them.
Similarly, you are no longer devoted to God but to the idolatry of Arius, and you resent being accused of error.
You call us disrespectful and say we have committed an unworthy act against you, the emperor of the Roman kingdom, by daring to say, "You are doing wrong, Constantius, by introducing idolatry into the church."
Moses, the most beloved of God among the prophets, pursued with the sword those whom you have chosen to imitate, and I am known to you as insolent because I said you have abandoned God and given yourself to idolatry?
The Holy Scripture cries out that the sons of Israel prostituted themselves with the daughters of Moab, ate sacrifices offered to idols, and worshipped those idols.
Because of this, Phinehas, the priest, was so zealous with his sword in the middle of the assembly that God was pleased, and it is written that the Lord's anger was appeased by this act, and He made Phinehas exceedingly esteemed.
"The Lord said to Moses, 'Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites by being as zealous among them as I am, so that in my zeal I did not put an end to them. Therefore, tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him. It will be a covenant of lasting priesthood for him and his descendants because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites'" (Numbers 25:10-13).
And you think we are disrespectful because we tell you the truth when you are wrong?
Do you believe that displeasing you means we do not please God?
But I ask you, Constantius, by what authority do you want us to abandon the path of the righteous patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs and follow this new path instituted by Arius and the devil?
Have you been warned in a dream and told not to let us follow the path of Christ that was followed by Abel, Enoch, Noah, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Job, the Judges, and the other kings, including David, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, all the prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and all who were found to have pleased God?
If this was told to you by the prince of demons, listen to what God has decided to do with you through the glorious prophet Moses: "If a prophet or one who foretells by dreams appears among you and announces to you a sign or wonder, and if the sign or wonder spoken of takes place, and the prophet says, 'Let us follow other gods'…"
Let's go after other gods, which you do not know; you should not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer, because the Lord your God is testing you to see if you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. You shall follow the Lord your God, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and listen to His voice, and serve Him, and hold fast to Him. But that prophet or that dreamer shall be put to death because they have spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God.
(Deuteronomy 13:1). Do you understand what you are commanded to endure? Whether you claim to be warned by a dream or wish to set yourself up as a prophet, you are an enemy of God if you want us to abandon the apostolic faith and accept one that denies the only Son of God. All those I have mentioned became so great and honorable because they believed in the only Son of God.
Indeed, whoever does not believe in the Son does not have the Father; but whoever believes in the Son has both the Father and the Son.
(First John). Since this is the voice of blessed John, who is in harmony with the choir of the holy apostles, you should understand that, just as the apostles believed, so did the patriarchs and prophets believe beforehand, and so do all who are honored for their faith.
You cannot prove to me that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed differently than John and all his fellow apostles. If the apostles did not believe as the patriarchs did, why does blessed Paul call everyone to the faith of Abraham? But you may argue: I rebuke you for being insolent and disrespectful to the emperor, and you bring up the matter of faith. Thus, I aim to prove you sacrilegious and show that you have strayed from the path of truth.
I appear disrespectful to you because I tell you that you have abandoned the way of all God's worshippers and embraced the path held by those who served and continue to serve fantasy instead of God. Accept what God decreed through Moses about you who persuade me to depart from God:
If your brother, son, daughter, wife, or close friend secretly says, 'Let us go and serve other gods,' which you do not know, neither you nor your ancestors, from the gods of the nations around you or those far away, you shall not yield to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him. You shall report him immediately: Your hand shall be the first to put him to death, and then the hand of all the people. You shall stone him to death because he sought to turn you away from the Lord your God.
(Deuteronomy 13:6). You say you do not understand the command to kill you for inviting me to abandon God. You claim Lucifer is insulting you. Will you deny inviting us to embrace idolatry? If you think you can deny it, the writings of your bishops, your fellow blasphemers, will convict you. The letters you read and gave to the bishops in Rome, to strengthen your blasphemy everywhere, will convict you. Do you not realize the darkness of your errors? Do you not see the way to ruin?
When you see why Achar, one of the people, acted against divine commands and stole a portion of the spoils from Jericho, he was punished with death. Consider what will happen to you, who deny the eternal divine majesty of the only Son of God. Learn what happened to Achar and finally take care of your salvation. Return to God's church, from which the serpent, who deceived Adam and Eve, has driven you away through the Arians.
And the Lord was with Joshua, and His name was known throughout the land.
(Joshua 6:27). And the children of Israel were negligent and acted deceitfully concerning the accursed things, and the Lord was angry with the children of Israel. Joshua sent men to Ai, which is near Bethel, saying, 'Consider Ai.' And the men went up and observed Ai. They returned to Joshua and said to him.
Not all the people should go up, but rather two or three thousand men should go up and destroy the city, so you do not lead the entire people there, for they are few.
And about three thousand men went up with him, but they fled from the men of Ai. The men of Ai killed thirty-six of them, pursued them from the gate, and crushed them on the slope. The hearts of the people melted and became like water.
Joshua tore his clothes and fell on his face before God until evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads. Joshua said:
I pray, Lord, why have you brought this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan.
What can I say now that Israel has turned its back on its enemies? The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about this, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?
The Lord said to Joshua:
Stand up! Why are you on your face? Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.
That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.
In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the Lord chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the Lord chooses shall come forward man by man.
Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the Lord and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!'
Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. Then Joshua said to Achan,
My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.
Achan replied,
It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the Lord. Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. Joshua said,
Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today.
Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. Over Achan, they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger.
Joshua 7:1.
Consider, Constantine, what kind of example you are going to perish by, unless you take care of yourself, and what eternal punishments you will suffer. Achan received such consequences for breaking the commandments; you can understand what you deserve here since you are an apostate. If he was punished so severely for having taken from the devoted things, how much more will you undoubtedly be punished more severely, having become a curse by denying the Son of God! We are wicked in your eyes, proud, stubborn, and insolent because we say to you,
You have committed sacrilege.
Children of God, being a denier; because we say, consider yourself,
snatch your soul from the snares of the devil.
What new thing do we bishops do if we tell you what you deserve to hear? When we find that most holy Samuel, God's priest, said these words to King Saul, which you will read below: Sorrows and groans will be brought to you. Because you made the word of the Lord of no importance, the Lord will make you of no importance so that you will not reign.
First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse twenty-three:
And again:
Because you made the word of the Lord of no importance, God will reduce you to nothing, so that you will not be king over Israel.
First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse twenty-six:
And below:
The Lord will tear your kingdom from Israel from your hand today, and give it to your neighbor who is better than you.
First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse twenty-eight:
If he said these things to Saul because he ignored the commandments of the Lord, why do you think we could not freely say to you that you are sacrilegious, who, unless you turn yourself to God, will be reduced to nothing by Him? If we had not urged you, if we had not provoked you to make amends, you would rightly say that you are hated by us.
Or when you hear us say, Repent, emperor, correct your ways so that you may find a place for mercy, I think you ought to consider that you are loved by us, cherished by us; and you, in that, curse us. Why do we remain in the apostolic faith, returning evil for good? We are not surprised if you, since you depart from the will of God and do not cease to fulfill the desire of the devil, ask God for good things to happen to you and wish to represent evil; since it is inherent in you to do evil, as you have made the transition from good to evil, that is, to the devil.
If you persecute us who love you, wishing all the best for you, it is not surprising nor new, since even that prophet and priest of the Lord, Samuel, was persecuted by Saul. He was persecuted by him through whom he had been anointed as king, and whose prayers were directed to the Lord with constant supplication for the safety of this persecutor.
If you do not believe that we, God's priests, grieve for you, because you have drunk so deeply of the darkness of errors, that you are thus slaying yourself, believe God speaking to Samuel for Saul: How long will you mourn for Saul? Behold, I expel him so that he will not reign over Israel.
First Samuel chapter sixteen, verse one:
And above:
And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying: I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not kept my words. And Samuel was grieved and cried out to the Lord all night and before dawn.
First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse ten:
When Samuel, the priest, did these things for the safety of King Saul, yet Saul later persecuted Samuel, not knowing, poor man, that he was persecuting the prophet and priest of the Lord: so too you, not knowing what you are doing, persecute us, who wish you to please God, and love those who drag you with them to eternal death, to the perpetual offense of the Lord: you are indignant why you hear the truth, when you see that Samuel the priest of the Lord did not flatter the king's mind.
What else was fitting for our predecessors or for us to do? Why do we tell you the truth, and you consider us proud? What have you heard from us? Surely that you are a murderer: if we lie, then we are rightly called offensive, then proud by you: but if we speak the truth, we are not offensive, but those who imitate those who, by not flattering those entrusted to them, but by healthily warning them, have deserved to be beloved by God.
When the king of Israel sent to kill the prophet Elisha, if you had not read that Elisha said to those who were with him, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head, you would rightly accuse me of insults. The prophet, full of the Holy Spirit, called the king of Israel the son of a murderer, that is, the son of the devil, not because he called his carnal father a murderer, but the devil, whose son he showed himself to be by his actions, as you now reveal yourself to be, and he showed himself to be by persecuting God's servants, daring to kill the prophets of His mercy.
The devil incites your hearts to do all these things. Understand that this is so by the Lord saying to the Jews in the Gospel: You are from the devil.
You are of your father and you want to fulfill your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning. John 8:44.
The Prophet, full of the Holy Spirit, calls the king of Israel a son of a murderer, that is, of the devil. And you think we are insulting you because we say you are a killer of God’s servants, a butcher of our bodies, a man of all wickedness, a destroyer of religion, a denier of the only Son of God? We say what we see you doing; we proclaim what you are. You call us insolent because we speak the truth about you.
Please tell me, why did the king of Israel deserve to hear such things from the Lord? Because you did what was right before me and followed my heart and soul, the sons of Ahab: your sons will sit on the throne of Israel up to the fourth generation. 2 Kings 10:30. Tell me, why did he deserve to hear this from God? Because he spared God's enemies? Or because he pursued them with the sword? Or because he killed the idolatrous son of Ahab and his forty sons? He also had Queen Jezebel killed and thrown to the dogs, and he exterminated all the servants of Baal, along with all the priests and prophets of shame, with the sword, and destroyed their idols, pleasing God.
What should we have done about you to avoid being accused of insulting you, whom we see following the ways of Ahab and Jezebel? It is not new for you to act against God, to attack His house, to persecute His priests, those through whom He warns you to seek repentance while there is still time, to pull yourself away from evil. Before you, there were others like you in sacrilege, serving idols and abandoning the God of their fathers.
In the second book of Chronicles, King Amaziah of Judah was warned by God through a prophet not to take the sons of Israel, whom he had hired for a hundred thousand talents of silver, with him to war, because God had forsaken Israel since they had abandoned Him and served idols. The king obeyed the prophet’s words and believed the warning was from God.
What did he do next? After he subdued his enemies, he thought to take their idols and bring them to his kingdom to worship them. When the man of God told him it was wrong to abandon God and worship the idols of the nations, the king fiercely persecuted the Lord’s prophet. You see, when you turn to apostasy, you always have the same spirit to persecute those who wish you well.
And it happened, as the holy scripture says, after Amaziah struck down the Edomites, he brought the gods of Mount Seir, set them up as his gods, worshipped them, and offered sacrifices to them. The anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent a prophet, who said to him: Why have you sought the gods of the people who could not deliver their own people from your hand? And as the prophet spoke, Amaziah said to him: Have we made you the king’s counselor? Beware lest you be struck down. 2 Chronicles 25:14, following. You see, Constantius, how foolish you become once you decide to serve the devil and forget the Almighty God, setting up idolatry in defiance of God.
As he said: Have we made you the king’s counselor? Beware lest you be struck down. 2 Chronicles 25:16; so do you say: Did I choose you as my counselors, saying that I should not do as I please, that I should not follow the path Arius followed? Do you not see how Arius perished and how divine justice was carried out upon him?
Meanwhile, because you say we insult you, see how this man of God did not spare your fellow sacrilegious king, but after being told, Be silent lest you be struck down, said to him: I know that the Lord God will destroy you for doing this and not listening to my advice. In what way do you find us insolent? Isn’t it because we tell you: We know that unless you turn back to God, the Lord will condemn you to eternal punishment?
The one who is about to be condemned. This is an insult, this is all injury, because it is said to you by God's bishops that you will be destroyed forever unless you correct your ways.
That king did not believe the man of God.
What happened to him immediately is stated in the Holy Scripture thus:
And in the time when Amaziah turned away from the Lord, they conspired against him. And he fled from Jerusalem to Lachish, and they killed him in Lachish.
So also the deeds of your evils could have preserved, protected, and defended you, just as it did him, who said to the man of God speaking for his salvation:
Have I made you the king's counselor? Be silent so you are not beaten.
It is not our first act if we tell you, who are erring and resisting God's ordinance, struggling to establish new ways:
You are wrong not to follow the path by which all worshippers of God have reached the heavenly kingdoms.
You have read that King Uzziah was rebuked by the priests of the Lord for daring to do what was forbidden:
And he entered, says the Scripture, into the temple of the Lord to offer incense on the altar; and Uzziah the priest entered after him, and with him the priests of the Lord, thirty valiant men, and they confronted King Uzziah, and said to him:
It is not lawful for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have trespassed, and it will not be an honor for you from the Lord God.
Do you say those priests of the Lord were insulting to that king or not?
If they were not insulting, neither should we seem so to you, since you hear from us similar words to those he heard:
It is not lawful for you, Constantius, to associate with the people of God as an Arian.
It is not lawful for you, the promoter of the Arian heresy of idolatry, the denier of the only Son of God, to judge the priests of God, pretending to be a Christian when you are a forerunner of the Antichrist.
It will not be good for you to remove the priests of God and appoint adversaries of His, namely your fellow sacrilegious.
When you hear these things, you become angry with us; Uzziah the king was also angry with those priests of the Lord:
But note that they, dedicated to God, maintained the honor of their position perpetually, while Uzziah was immediately stained with the eternal disgrace of leprosy.
And Uzziah was angry, and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and leprosy appeared on his forehead in the sight of the priests in the house of the Lord.
These things are so, and do you think that as a defiant transgressor, you do not incur offense with Him who has commanded us to perpetually represent the duties of His priests to His glory?
What is this pride of ours, Constantius, or what arrogance?
If, because we see you to be diseased, pestilent, indeed an Arian, we consider that you have the leprosy that Arius had, because we urge you to withdraw from the people of God, just as those priests of the Lord compelled Uzziah to leave the temple, because we thus compel you to give honor to God.
For if the priests of God expelled Uzziah from the temple of God because they remembered the divine command that lepers were forbidden to enter the temple before purification, how much more should we justly expel you from the church of Christ, from the house of the Lord, because it is not lawful for a heretic to associate with Catholics, the insane with the sane, one filled with unclean spirits with those in whom the Spirit of God dwells!
What kind of insult is this if the priests of the Lord, burning with that zeal which has always characterized our predecessors, say to you things that are beneficial to both our salvation and yours?
You say Lucifer is impudent.
Impudent because I urge you to reject the leprosy of Arius, and through this faith, which the most blessed apostles preached and which we hold (as you see), you have gained health for your mind, and you rejoice eternally that you have been delivered from the snares of the devil and sought by God.
You, who accuse us of great arrogance, have found it written what King Josiah of Judah did to your fellow-sacrilegious, to those like you today, how he even persecuted many of them after death, burning their bones with fire.
But it befitted that king so much.
With zeal to pursue the enemies of God; it was unworthy of us bishops, us priests of God, to resist you, who introduced idolatry into the church. He killed your sacrilegious ones with the sword, and even persecuted the relics long buried, desiring to be found the most faithful worshiper of God. We, on the other hand, should not have resisted you with a word, you, the friend of God's enemy, you, most beloved of those converted to the apostasy of angels, you who have become through this blasphemy an enemy of God.
Therefore, take in the fourth book of Kings, what Josiah, the servant of the Lord, king of Judah, accomplished because of those things done against your defiled ones. And finally stop saying about us, “They are proud and defiant.” He did, it says, what was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father David, and did not turn aside to the right or to the left  Second Kings chapter 22, verse 2. Likewise below, after he rebuilt the houses of the Lord, and the priest sent the book of the law to the king: And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes  Second Kings chapter 22, verse 11.
And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying: Go, inquire of the Lord for me and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book to do according to all that is written concerning us. So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.
And she said to them: Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Tell the man who sent you to me, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read; because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, and have provoked me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall you say to him: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: Concerning the words which you have heard, because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard how I spoke against this place and its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the Lord. Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants. And they brought back word to the king.
Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him  Second Kings chapter 23, verse 1. And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the Lord.
And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people joined in the covenant.
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel. And he deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the constellations and all the host of heaven.
And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people. And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes who were in the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.
The tribes of Judah and he defiled the holy places where the priests of Agaba burned incense as far as Rasaba; and he tore down their high places. And furthermore:
He defiled Phem which was in Cepenam (Fourth Kings 23:10), because they led each of their sons and daughters into the fire of Moloch. The kings of Judah had placed statues at the entrance of the house of the Lord at the pasture, where he placed three horses, which he burned in Faradin and the fountain of the sun in the house of the Lord, which the kings of Israel had built for that high place of Baal, and to all the army of heaven. The sanctuaries were on the roofs of the upper buildings, which Ahaz, king of Judah, had made; and the sanctuaries which Manasseh made in the two buildings of the house of the Lord, the king tore them down and expelled them from there, and threw their ashes into the Kidron Valley. The high places which they had made facing Jerusalem, which was to the right of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, the idol, and Milcom, the idol of the Ammonites, the king defiled. He shattered the monuments and filled their places with human bones. The sanctuary which was in Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam, son of Nebat, had made, in which he had made Israel sin, and that high sanctuary he tore down, shattered its stones, and ground them into dust, and burned their groves. King Josiah returned, and saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. He took the bones from the tomb, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word that the man of God had spoken, when Jeroboam stood by the altar on the feast day.
Do you recognize, Constantius, what was done by a king who was a worshipper of God? And we rebuke you for introducing idolatry into the church because we strike with words. Do you say that Lucifer insults you? If you had been a man of that time, you might have been killed by the sword, or, if you had already died, even your bones, as those of a sacrilegious person, would have been reduced to nothing by fire. He strikes the guilty of such a great crime with the sword, and should we not wound you even with words? Do you see meanwhile in this place too, in the city of God, in the house of the Lord, and in His temple, that you have introduced your sacrilegious kings and idolatry, which Josiah, the most devoted king to God, exterminated. Do you not think that you have undertaken this work against God? Do not say: If I were acting wrongly, God would have already taken vengeance on me; but rather, I beseech you to see that you are captured and held by the devil, living in his power, just like those kings whose work King Josiah pursued.
Why do we abhor your blasphemies, why do we resist your wicked conspiracies, do we seem injurious to you? Just as to the Jews, whose imitators you are, the most holy prophets and the most blessed apostles seemed insulting and proud. In the book of the prophet Amos:
And Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying: Amos conspires against me in the midst of the house of Israel; the land cannot bear all his words. Therefore, this is what Amos says: Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile from their land. Amaziah said to Amos: Go away, flee to the land of Judah, and there eat your bread, and there prophesy. But do not prophesy anymore at Bethel, because it is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom. Amos answered and said to Amaziah: I was not a prophet nor a prophet’s son, but I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamore trees. The Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel. Now therefore hear the word of the Lord: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Jacob. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in an unclean land, and Israel will surely go into exile from their native land.
When you see these things done by him, who wanted to announce truth and correction to his erring people, why do you call us insolent, why do you call us insulting, because we tell you the truth about your errors? Because we do not listen to your voice saying, Do not believe as the patriarchs believed.
Ah, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, but do you believe how Arius delivered it? In what matters are we found proud before you? Except in this, that we abhor your sacrileges and avoid your orders like swords and poisons.
This is not the first time we have done this: all those who have already pleased God, holding the faith we preach, did this. None of His servants feared to face death for God; none of His followers thought about the kinds of torments you tyrants inflict but kept His commands in mind. Thus, Tobias is found glorious and esteemed before the Lord, as he did not fear the edict of your king, but only the Almighty God.
Believe what Tobias himself says: When Sennacherib, the king, fled from Judah because of the defense the Lord made against him, due to his blasphemies, and he killed many of the children of Israel in his rage: I was taking their bodies and burying them: and it was reported to the king that I was burying them, and he sought to kill me. I fled, and all my possessions were seized, and I had nothing left but my wife Anna and my son Tobias. And after forty-five days, his sons killed that king, and his son Arcedonossar reigned in his place there. And when I came home, my wife Anna and my son Tobias were restored to me.
On the feast day of Pentecost, which is holy from the weeks, I had a good meal, and I reclined to eat. A table was set for me, and I saw many dishes. I said to my son Tobias: Go and bring any poor person you find among our captive brothers in Nineveh, who still have God in their whole heart; bring them, and let them eat this meal with me. I will wait for you, son, until you come. And Tobias went out to seek a poor captive among our brothers, and returned and said to me: Father. And I said: What is it, son? And he said to me: Behold, one of our nation has been strangled and thrown out.
And I left my meal before tasting anything; I took him from the street to a place with me, until sunset, to bury him. I returned, washed, and ate my meal with mourning, remembering the words of the prophet Amos, which he spoke in Bethel, saying: Your feast days will turn into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I wept. And after sunset, I went and dug, and buried him. All my neighbors mocked me, saying: How does this man not fear? He has already been sought to be killed for this matter, and he fled, and now he begins again to bury the dead.
Therefore, seeing that the servants of God have never feared your tyrannical cruelty, nor can they fear it now, but have kept and keep the Lord's commands, how do you dare to judge us as insolent? Surely because, with God's help, we tread your power like mud: this is not done by our strength, but granted by His mercy whom you deign to curse in us.
God says to the prophet Ezekiel: Son of man, I am sending you to the house of Israel, because they have embittered Me, they and their fathers to this very day. And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: Whether they listen or fear, for they are a rebellious house, they shall know that a prophet has been among them. And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor tremble at their faces, for they are rebellious and will swarm around you, and you live among scorpions; do not fear their words, nor be terrified at their faces, for they are a rebellious house: and you shall speak My words to them, whether they listen or fear, for they are a rebellious house.
We appear rebellious to you, just as this prophet dedicated to God alone appeared to those whose darkness you follow. Thus, Ezekiel seemed rebellious to your co-apostatizing Jews, and proud to the kings of Israel because he fulfilled the Lord's commands.
Andata, who spoke to them what God had commanded him to speak.
You rightly call us proud, we, through whom God wanted all His commands to be delivered to the knowledge of the believing peoples.
Rightly, I say, you designate us, the priests of God, as arrogant if we tell you what God wanted to be said to you.
You hate those who love you, you persecute those who wish you well, but we cannot fear the gnashing of your torture.
For you hear the Lord say:
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and do not be terrified by their faces, for they will become furious, and they will rush upon you, and you dwell among scorpions: do not fear their words, and do not be terrified by their faces, for they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 2:6.
We cannot, I say, fear the threats of your power, because your scorpion-like forces are nothing against us, whom you see protected by God's power, whom you notice God is the defender and protector of.
Therefore, we will not stop bringing you the Lord's commands, fearing only Him alone, who says:
Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them, for you are not being sent to a people of difficult speech or a foreign language, but to the house of Israel; not to many nations of strange speech or difficult language, whose words you would not understand.
And if I had sent you to such people, they might have listened to your words: but the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they do not want to listen to me; for all the house of Israel is stubborn and hard-hearted.
And behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your determination strong against their stubbornness, and you will be as firm as a rock; do not fear them, nor be dismayed by their faces, because they are a rebellious house.
Ezekiel 3:4.
Who among us can fear you, seeing us solidified and strengthened by God's power to stand firm against your rebellion, immovable like strong rocks against the swelling sea?
Hence, you judge us to be your enemies because we urge you to become a servant of God from a scorpion.
Now indeed, it cannot be doubted that you are one of the scorpions, as you heard from the Lord through the prophet:
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, nor be terrified by their faces, for they will become furious, and they will rush upon you in a circle, and you dwell among scorpions.
Ezekiel 2:6.
Hence, we are offensive to you because you see that we call you a scorpion.
If God had not said you are a scorpion, you would rightly call me insulting: now your actions reveal that you are a scorpion, and it is in vain that you shout you are being insulted by us.
God calls you a scorpion, and you are angry with me for calling you by that name?
What insult is this, if it is said to you: Unless you turn to God, you will always be one of the scorpions, one of the vast enemies of God?
Go through the rest of the prophet Ezekiel, and dare to call me insolent, proud, insulting, and obstinate:
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, I have set you as a watchman for the house of Israel, and you will hear a word from my mouth, and you will warn them from me.
When I say to the wicked: You will surely die; and you do not warn him, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; that wicked person will die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul.
And if a righteous person turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die: because you have not warned him, he will die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done will not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.
Nevertheless, if you warn the righteous person, that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning; and you will have delivered your soul.
Ezekiel 3:16-21.
What do you say to this, Constantius? Should the priests of God remain silent and hide the divine commands from them? Or is it fitting to reveal to you all the commands of the Lord?
Will we bear the will of God entrusted to us for you? Or will we deny it to ourselves to be slaughtered by you? For indeed, the Lord says He will demand your blood from me. However, if you do not obey God, whose divine commandments we bring to you, you will die in your own wicked sin, and your soul's salvation will no longer be required of us; because we were not terrified by your threats but feared only Him who commands that no one should be feared except Himself.
For indeed, to rescue yourself from your wicked paths, we would convene in the name of the Lord God. Should I, the emperor, appear to insult you, what should I do at a time when I judge you born to turn us, the servants of God, from the way of truth?
When Nebuchadnezzar sent Holofernes, the chief of his army, and besieged Jerusalem, what did Judith pray to God for? Was it not to destroy the enemies of Israel? Did she say: Guard those who rise against your house? Lord God of my father Simeon, who gave a sword in vengeance against foreigners who violated the womb of a virgin in defilement, and exposed the thigh in completion, and defiled the womb in reproach: for you said: It will not be so, and you did it; therefore you gave their leaders to slaughter, their bed that received the beloved to blood, and struck down their servants above the powerful, above their thrones: and you gave their women as spoils, and their daughters into captivity, and all the spoils into the division of the beloved children, who were zealous for your zeal, and abhorred the defilement of your race, and called upon you for help: My God, hear me, a widow. For you did these things before with them, and those after, and now, and those yet to come.
For all your ways are prepared, your creation in providence. Behold, the Assyrians are filled with their power, and are exalted with horse and rider, and gloried in the strength of foot soldiers, trusted in shields, and drawn bow, and slings, and did not know that you are the Lord, who breaks wars, Lord is your name. Throw down their strength, eternal one, crush their fullness with your power, and bring down their pride in your wrath: for they planned to defile your holy things, to defile the tabernacle of your rest, the honor of your name, to seize the horn of your altar with iron.
Look upon their pride: give strength to my widow's hand as I have thought, and strike their mouths with the lips of my persuasion in the leader, and the leader over his servant: crush his substance in the widow's hand. For your strength is not in multitude, nor your power, nor your gift in the strong: but you are the God of the humble, the help of the weak, the support of the infirm, the savior of the desperate, even the God of my father, and the God of Israel's inheritance. Lord, ruler of heaven and earth, creator of waters, king of all creation, hear my plea, give cunning and persuasion in their wound, and in their bruise, who planned hard things against your covenant and holy house, and the heights of Zion, and the house of the retention of your children over every nation and tribe.
Let them know that you are the God of all power and strength, and there is no other high defender of the race of Israel but you.
What will your prudent mind consider in response to these things? Will you be able to say after this prayer poured out against the enemies of religion that we oppose you in a disordered manner, because we say to you, Either correct your wicked ways and do not take pleasure in the power of your empire, or recognize that you will come to nothing?
What else do we, the servants of God, His priests of divine greatness, do today but what they did, whom we desire to be found imitators of? For I think it worthy not to abandon the people entrusted to us in this great persecution inflicted by you, but to encourage them, because indeed He who has us is able to deliver them from the hands of their enemies, that you are not to be feared as an enemy of God's house; it should be noted that you are nothing, for indeed our God and Lord, all-powerful, will bring everything to nothing.
Let all your wicked efforts be against his house. What harm is being done to you by us? What insult is being inflicted on the Roman Emperor by the priests of the living God if they ask you to either obtain eternal life or tell you that because you have taken up arms against the house of God, unless you correct yourself, you will perish in great destruction?
For what reason do we bring forth the destruction of all the enemies of God's house to you? Is it not so that either you, terrified by the fear of God, change yourself or, when you have made yourself punished forever, we can triumph safely on every side? Because neither can your blood be required from us by God, nor can we see the destruction of the adversaries of his church. Persist in your injustice, and you will find what follows such great merits.
You say that Lucifer was inflated with pride because he tells you the truth. What would you have me do at this time, when you, a precursor of the antichrist, raised arms against the house of God to kill us? At the time when you stood as a denier of the only Son of God? Should I have kept quiet and let you, a wolf, come to devastate God's flock? Or do you think it was worthy that we, the pastors, should meet you with dry throats prepared to be devoured by us?
It was enough for that woman, Judith, desirous to please God, to kill the enemy with her own hand, and should we not have resisted you with even a word as pastors instituted by the Lord? The Lord says in the Gospel according to John, chapter 10, verse 11: A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. A hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.
What then should we have done to not appear disrespectful to you? We recognized you as a wolf; we saw you stretching out your hands to the Lord's sheep, and we observed you trying to tear apart all who call upon the Lord's name at one time. Would it have been appropriate to show ourselves as hired hands, not shepherds? To the blessed Peter, he says: Feed my lambs (John 21:16). And again: Feed my sheep (John 21:17).
And you, coming as a wolf, want those found to be successors of the blessed Peter to act as hired hands? Those whom he had long promised through Jeremiah to his people, saying: And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding; and he did not say: I will give you Emperor Constantius, who can turn you into prey for the devil (Jeremiah 3:15).
You say we act wrongly because we resist your sacrilege with the protection of God's power. Let us see what those, who remembered that no one should be feared except God, did at the time when your fellow tyrant Antiochus persecuted our religion. But first, you should know what that person, whom you resemble, wrote; so you may understand that those servants of God, whom we wish to be found among, resisted Antiochus's sacrilege, just as we resist you with God's favor.
The Holy Scripture says in the First Book of Maccabees: And the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people and that each should give up his laws. And all the Gentiles accepted the command of the king; many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the Sabbath. And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, directing them to follow customs foreign to their land, to forbid burnt offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane Sabbaths and feasts, to defile the sanctuary and the priests, to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals, to leave their sons uncircumcised, and to defile themselves with every kind of impurity and abomination, so that they would forget the law and change all the ordinances. And whoever did not obey the command of the king was to die. According to all these words, he wrote to his whole kingdom and appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to offer sacrifice city by city. Many of the people joined them, everyone who forsook the law, and they did evil in the land.
Here is the translated text as requested:
Things going wrong in the land First Maccabees 1:43 and following. And below, same book, verse 57:
And they built the abomination of desolation on the altar, and in the cities of Judah around, they constructed altars. At the entrances of houses and in the streets, they were burning incense. They found the books of the law, tore them up, and burned them with fire. Whoever was found with the book of the covenant, and anyone who consented to the law, the king's decree put them to death. In their power, they did these things to Israel, those who were found each month in the cities. On the twenty-fourth day of the month, they sacrificed on the altar that was on top of the altar. The women who had circumcised their sons, they killed according to the commandment. They hung the infants from their necks, and in their houses, those who had circumcised them.
Many in Israel were resolute and strong in their resolve. They chose to die rather than be defiled by food or profane the holy covenant. Great anger came upon Israel during those days. And same book, chapter 2, verse 1:
Matathias, son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, rose up from Jerusalem, and he had five sons. Further below, same book, verse 6:
They saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and in Israel. He said: Woe is me, why have I been made to see the destruction of my people, the destruction of the holy city? They sat there while it was given into the hands of enemies, the sanctuary into the hands of strangers. Further below, same book, verse 11:
All her adornment is taken away. She has become a slave from being free. Behold, our sanctuary, our beauty, and our glory are laid waste and polluted by the nations. Why should we still live? Matathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly. Those sent by the king came, and they compelled apostasy in the city of Modein to sacrifice, and many Israelites joined them. Matathias and his sons gathered together. Those sent by the king answered and said to Matathias:
You are a leader and noble and great in this city, and strengthened by sons. Now come first and do the king's commandment, as all the nations and the men of Judah and those left in Israel have done. You and your sons will be friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.
Matathias answered in a loud voice and said:
If all the nations that are in the king's house obey him, so that each one departs from the service of his fathers, and they have chosen to follow his commands, I and my sons will follow the covenant of our fathers. May the Lord be merciful to us. We will not forsake the law and its statutes. We will not listen to the word of the king, nor will we turn from our service to the right or to the left.
As he finished speaking these words, a Jewish man came forward in the sight of all to sacrifice in Modein according to the king's commandment. Matathias saw this, and was zealous, and his heart trembled. He brought forth his wrath according to judgment, and running to the altar, he killed him. The king's man who forced him to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and he destroyed the altar. He was zealous for the law, as Phinehas did to Zimri son of Salu. Matathias cried out in the city with a loud voice saying:
Whoever is zealous for the covenant, follow me. He and his sons fled to the mountain, and they left whatever they had in the city.
What have we done to you that you should say: Lucifer has insulted me? He killed the king's servant with the sword, and also him whom he saw of his people complying with the king's edict rather than God's. I, because I resist you and yours with words and say, I do not forsake the apostolic and evangelical faith, I believe as our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed. Therefore, I am guilty of insults before you. If you had been in the hands of Matathias, this zealous man of God, or in the hands of Phinehas, to whom God bore witness in the book of Numbers through Moses, and you attempted to live in the manner of foreigners, without a doubt they would have killed you with the sword.
Because I wound that spirit of yours, soaked with the blood of Christians, with my words, you accuse me of insults. Why, emperor, do you not take revenge on me? Why do you not defend your honor and avenge yourself on a beggar? Why are you not acting sufficiently? Not because you are unwilling, but because you have not yet been given the power by Him, whose servant I am, to speak these words to you freely, which seem wrong to me according to your wicked deeds.
When you see that we have renounced all the wealth of your kingdom, and your father too, and promised that we will not abandon our faith under any circumstances, you will understand that we greatly pity you. Because while you usually devour those who displease you with the sword, you spare us. I believe it is for the sake of compassion, and we can feel this from your leniency. Indeed, I could gather from your excessive kindness that you have killed no one.
You say, "He is proud." Why do I seem proud to you? Surely because you hear from me that you are doing what the enemies of God's religion have always done. It is my duty to tell you this, heretic. Or are you not a heretic? If you are a heretic, why do you accuse me of being injurious to you, when I do what God has commanded me to do?
The most holy prophet Jeremiah spoke to God: Jeremiah 1:17: "But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them."
Since this is so, and we are urged by the necessity of the duty imposed on us by God to say to you whatever God commands us to say, it remains that you either obey God's commands, convened by me, His servant and priest, or prove from the Holy Scriptures, perhaps because you are a king, that it is not lawful for me to address you in the name of the Lord to correct yourself. If you cannot prove to me that it is forbidden, but rather you begin to find that it is commanded, that I should rebuke, reprimand, and exhort you, and pray for you, and admonish you, and provoke you to please God, why do you say that I am insulting you?
For indeed, He has given us, His priests, the power to rebuke, teach you who are entrusted to us, as He said: Jeremiah 1:17-19: "Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. Behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the Lord."
What were the things Jeremiah said to the kings of Judah, its princes, and the people of the land? Surely these things because they had forsaken the Lord and sacrificed to foreign gods. These things you have done and are doing: you have abandoned the apostolic and evangelical faith, adopted the Arian heresy, and are forcing everyone to become idolaters, servants of God.
Because you dare these things, you call proud those who desire to consult for your salvation. God says to Jeremiah 1:17: "But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them."
And you, Emperor Constantius, are indignant because we tell you, who are erring: Return to the way of salvation, abandon the error invented by Arius through the devil's instigation? God commands that He alone be feared; He has ordered that no one besides Him should be dreaded; and you have decreed things to be fulfilled that take away the fear of the Lord and make you feared?
God says to Jeremiah 1:18: "Behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the Lord."
And do you think you can be feared by any of God's servants? Why do you call me arrogant, proud? Why do you call me insulting? Surely because I have found you, by your deeds, to be one of those about whom the blessed John says: First John 2:18: "You have heard that the Antichrist is coming; even now many antichrists have come."
Thus you designate us as guilty of insults, as if we were the first to resist you introducing your idolatry into God's Church. You have read in the First Book of Maccabees: "And the man said..."
In his last moments, he said:
If we all act as our brothers did, and do not fight against the nations for our lives and our laws, then they will quickly destroy us from the land.
And they thought on that day, saying:
Whoever comes to fight us on the Sabbath, we will fight against him, and we will not all die as our brothers did in hiding.
Then a strong assembly from Israel gathered to them, everyone who was willing to follow the law, and all who fled from evil joined them, and they became their strength.
They established power and struck down sinners in their anger, and wicked men in their indignation, and the rest fled to the nations to save themselves.
Matathias and his friends went around and destroyed the altars and circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel with strength, and they pursued the sons of pride, and their work prospered in their hands, and they recovered the law from the hands of the nations and kings, and they did not give power to the sinner.
1 Maccabees 2:40 and following.
What does your mind, wounded by the poisons of Arius, think?
What can be conceived against our defense, your heart cut by the serpent's bites?
You should notice that they acted in this way; should we have remained silent while you uttered blasphemies to the people divinely entrusted to us?
And it says, Matathias and his friends went around (same verse 45), and destroyed the altars, and circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel with strength, and they pursued the sons of pride, and their work prospered in their hands, and they recovered the law from the hands of the nations and kings, and they did not give power to the sinner.
When those who acted this way became most beloved by God, would it be right for us, by flattering you and running with you in your crime, to become most hated by God as you are?
If we seem offensive to you because we cannot accept your idolatry, give one example, I ask, where a worshiper of God has spared an adversary of His religion.
In the second book of Ezra, when opponents tried to prevent the rebuilding of the house, temple, and city in Jerusalem for the Lord, God of heaven prospered us, and we, His servants, will arise and build, but you have no share or claim in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 2:20.
And later, the opponents said:
Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble?
Nehemiah 4:2.
And this is what His servant Ezra says to God:
Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from Your sight.
Nehemiah 4:4-5.
What have we said about you like this?
The witness whom Ezra prayed to, and whom I also pray to, and the whole blessed church established throughout the world prays, that my wishes for you are to correct your errors and become one of us.
Observe meanwhile how God's people neither feared their adversaries nor ceased praying against the enemies of God's house, so that the strength of the opponents of God's religion would be brought to nothing.
So also the most holy Moses says in the song of Exodus to God:
Let fear and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they will be as still as a stone, till Your people pass by, O Lord, till the people you bought pass by.
Exodus 15:16.
Such words they spoke to God for those committed to them: because we say to you, Either turn to God, or be certain that God will bring all your empty pride to nothing, we seem insolent to you.
Observe still what the most holy Matathias, devoted to God, did after such illustrious deeds, and what he said to his sons at the end of his life, and see if we priests of God act rightly against you.
The Holy Scripture says:
The days of Matathias' death approached, and he said to his sons: Now pride has been strengthened, and punishment, and the time...
Destruction, and the wrath of indignation. Now, children, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers. Remember the works of the fathers, which they did in their times, and you will receive great glory and an eternal name.
Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was counted to him as righteousness? Joseph, in his time of distress, kept the commandment, and became the lord of Egypt. Phinehas, our father, in his zeal, received the covenant of an eternal priesthood. Joshua, when he fulfilled the word, became a leader in Israel. Caleb, when he testified in the assembly, received an inheritance. David, in his mercy, obtained the throne of the kingdom forever. Elijah, in his zeal for the law, was taken up to heaven. Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, believing, were delivered from the flame. Daniel, in his simplicity, was delivered from the mouth of the lions. And so, think through each generation, because all who hope in Him will not be weakened.
Do not fear the words of a sinful man, for his glory is in filth and worms. Today he is exalted; tomorrow he will not be found because he has returned to his earth, and his thoughts will perish. Children, be strong and prevail in the law, for in it you will be glorious. And look, your brother Simeon, I know he is a man of counsel; listen to him, he will be a father to you. And Judas Maccabeus, strong in body from his youth, will be your chief in the army, and he will fight the battle. You will bring to yourselves all those who follow the law and avenge the people, repay the nations, and focus on the precept of the law.
So when you see that he gave such commands to his children and ordered them to do what he himself also did, since he teaches that thus patriarchs, prophets, and all the righteous have pleased God, what did you want us to do, you dark one, so as not to appear rebellious? Should we have yielded to you, dead, while we are alive, servants of God, allies of the devil?
When you see this Mattathias saying to his children:  And so think through each generation, because all who hope in Him will not be weakened. And do not fear the words of a sinful man, for his glory is in filth and worms: today he is exalted, and tomorrow he will not be found, because he has returned to his earth, and his thoughts will perish.
Should we appear injurious to you, should we spare you who destroy the house of God, you who are here today, and tomorrow will be in worms and filth, and should we bring this offense to God, by which we would deserve to be reduced to nothing with you? Know after this, what even the children of this most religious Mattathias did, if they feared the hand of your executioner, if they saw his army before their eyes, and not our Lord, whom we believe to be all-powerful, believing they stood against the enemy with all their strength.
And Judas, who was called Maccabeus, his son, rose up in his place. All his brothers helped him, and all who joined his father; and he fought the battle of Israel with joy. He expanded the glory of his people, wore armor like a giant, girded his war gear, and organized battles, protecting the camp with a sword. He became like a lion in his works, and like a lion's cub roaring for prey. He pursued the wicked, searched, and burned those who disturbed his people. The wicked were subdued by his fear, and all workers of iniquity were troubled, and salvation was made prosperous in his hand.
He enraged many kings and delighted Jacob by his works, and his memory is in blessing forever. He walked through the cities of Judah, destroyed all the impious from it, and turned away anger from Israel. He was named to the farthest part of the land and gathered those who were perishing. Those so zealous against the enemies of the house of God; should we not have risen against you, lest we be called reckless? But you would rightly call me reckless if we had not rightly despised your sacrilegious decree. Look at what your wretched ones have commanded.
They will be leaders of the Jews against the apostles, and you will find that the blessed chorus of apostles did not act rashly but sought to advise both you and us.
Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
A man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they placed daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms from those entering the temple.
When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked for alms.
Peter, looking intently at him with John, said, "Look at us."
He looked at them, expecting to receive something from them.
Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
Taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.
Leaping up, he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.
All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized that he was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.
Acts Chapter 3, verse 1 and following.
Acts Chapter 4, verse 1:
While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came up to them, annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
They arrested them and put them in custody.
Acts Chapter 4, verse 13:
Seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and realizing that they were uneducated, ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
They saw the man who had been healed standing with them and had nothing to say in opposition.
When they had ordered them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying, "What shall we do with these men? For it is evident to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.
But to prevent this from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak any more to anyone in this name."
So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."
And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people. For all were praising God for what had happened.
The man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
After being released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and elders had said to them.
When they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, 'Why did the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed.'
For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
If you have gathered all this, if you have thoroughly understood our entire prescription, will you still dare to call us rash?
For you see that neither the blessed apostles yielded to the leaders of the Jews nor succumbed to their threats, but rather boldly carried out what was entrusted to them for the benefit of all.
The people of God were not only unafraid of the threats of unbelievers, but they were also encouraged to speak confidently and defend the truth.
God deemed it worthy to grant His apostles this confidence.
So if this was done by the blessed apostles and the people dedicated to God, and they were not called stubborn or insolent by God for standing against His enemies, how can you call us proud, insolent, and disrespectful?
Though we are sinners, we still hold the holy faith of the apostles and those people who believed in the one Son of God.
Are we proud because we, like the apostles, disregard your voice?
Because we, as soldiers of Christ, consider your threats sacrilegious?
Because we preach the true Son of God, just as the most blessed apostles did?
To you, we seem as insolent, rude, and proud as the most holy apostles seemed to the Jews.
If the apostles were still alive today, you could say these things to them that you now dare to say to us.
We always found that your blasphemous scribes, Pharisees, leaders, and the high priest of the Jews commanded them not to teach or preach the one Son of God.
Yet, what did they do?
Take what is written, so your heart, fed by darkness, might be led to see the truth:
By the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people; they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
But no one else dared to join them, though the people held them in high esteem.
More believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were added, so much so that they brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by, and they were healed.
Crowds from the neighboring cities of Jerusalem brought the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
The high priest and all his associates, who were members of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
They arrested the apostles and put them in public jail.
But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying, "Go, stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life."
When they heard this, they entered the temple courts at daybreak and began to teach.
When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there, so they went back and reported, "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."
At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles.
They did not use force because they feared that the people would stone them.
Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.
"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."
Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than human beings" (Acts 5:12).
If it is necessary to obey God and not humans, why do you call us stubborn and injurious when you see us obeying God's commands?
When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death, the scripture says (Acts 5:33).
You also keep us in custody and threaten to kill us because you are possessed by the same spirit that held and still holds the Jews captive.
If you are not held by this unclean spirit, why do you forbid us from confessing and preaching the one Son of God?
The angel of God led the apostles out of the prison of your desperate Jews: Go, teach in the temple.
You took the words of this life, and you thought that by throwing the priests of the Church of God into prison, we would stop preaching the word of life.
Meanwhile, I ask you to answer, what is the difference between you and your fellow, whom the people of Sirmium call Photinus?
Please explain what the difference is.
Look, if back then the leaders, the high priest, and the whole council of the Jews had said to the apostles, "Do you want to bring this man's blood upon us?", Photinus also professes that the Son of God was just a man, saying he did not exist before the blessed Mary.
This is also your profession, that before everything, that is, before the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything in them, he was the Son of God, but that he came from nothing and was a creature.
What do you think is the difference between you and Paul of Samosata, or your fellow disciple, except that you say "before everything" and he says "after everything"?
The truth is, you both share the same mindset of cruelty and disbelief, to the point of saying that God does not have a true Son.
On the other hand, see how the holy church believes.
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born of the Father, that is, from the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father, which the Greeks call ὁμοούσιον, through whom all things were made, whether in heaven or on earth, who for us humans and for our salvation came down, was incarnate, became man, suffered, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will come to judge the living and the dead.
We also believe in the Holy Spirit.
You see, this is the apostolic and evangelical faith, which always defends that the Son has reigned and will reign with the Father, and which acknowledges the perfect divine Trinity having one substance.
Otherwise, what would be the difference between the church and you heretics or Jews if the blessed church did not believe this way?
The holy faith, so that you may know what the Lord's church punishes in you, has said and says about you: Those who say, "There was a time when he was not," and "Before he was born, he was not," and that he was made from things that do not exist, or from another substance, saying that the Son of God is changeable and convertible, are anathematized by the Catholic and apostolic church.
Because of this holy faith, the apostles were thrown into prison, received chains, and were tortured every hour, so they would not reveal the truth to the world, yet they wanted to preach even if they would be killed.
And you say we are very stubborn people because we follow the apostles' way, because we tell you that you are wrong?
What did blessed John the Baptist do to Herod?
Herod the tetrarch was rebuked by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things Herod did, he added this above all: he locked John in prison.
Why did Herod lock John up? Certainly because his deeds were being criticized.
So you, too, treat the servants of God this way, because we tell you: Don't do what you do, don't be a murderer, don't persecute the Lord's church, don't reject the apostolic faith, but instead accept the heretical one, don't introduce idolatry into the church.
We think we say these things especially for your salvation, which if you refuse to heed, without a doubt you will seek eternal death for yourself, just as Herod did.
For indeed, Herod could not harm John, whether by throwing him into prison or by killing him, since you see that John was a friend of God, and Herod was an enemy of God.
Seeking to harm us, who desire to grant you eternal salvation, you persecute us by all means: but your authority's power will not be able to harm the servants of the only Son of God, because you will be found to be one of those whom he subjected to us believers, saying: "See, I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy".
Enemies: and nothing will harm you  (Luke 10:19).
You who say that I speak the truth to you, do you want me to be found proud? Do you want me to be like the servant who received one talent and hid it, and then presented only that to his master? Because he did not multiply it through trade like his fellow servants, he deserved to lose even that one talent and to hear:  “You wicked and lazy servant”  (Matthew 25:26). Or do you want me to be like the one who presented a quantity multiplied ten times, to whom it was said:  “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master”  (Matthew 25:21)? But how can I hear this if, fearing you, I do what pleases you? Look in the Gospel to see what the Lord wants us to do, and stop calling us arrogant.
A certain rich man went to a distant country to receive a kingdom and then return. He called ten servants and gave them ten talents and said to them:  “Engage in business until I come.”  But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying:  “We do not want this man to reign over us.”  When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what they had gained by doing business. The first came and said:  “Lord, your talent has made ten talents more.”  And he said to him:  “Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in little, you shall have authority over ten cities.”  The second came and said:  “Lord, your mina has made five talents.”  And he said to him:  “And you are to be over five cities.”  Another came and said:  “Lord, here is your talent, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.”  He said to him:  “I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow. Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?”  And he said to those who stood by:  “Take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has ten talents.”  I tell you, that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slaughter them before me”  (Luke 19:12).
If you do not change, you will be one of those who were ordered to be killed. Do I seem proud to you because I do not want you to be killed, because I desire that the quantity entrusted to me, which I want to multiply, also includes you? Because we wrestle with you in this way, we seem like enemies to you, we who constantly pray for your safety, following the command of the blessed apostle. Therefore, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth  (First Timothy 2:1). We seem like enemies to you because we want you to come to the knowledge of the truth; you call me insulting because I speak what is beneficial for your and my salvation. But this assertion of yours, which claims I am wronging you, shows you to be unwise. For if you were wise, you would never have been found sacrilegious, and having been corrected by the authority of sacred writings, you would have already shown yourself to be a changed man. But now, because you are unwise, you say to the bishop who tells you:  “Emperor, take care of your salvation, for you are weighed down by great burdens of your sins,”  you say,  “You are insulting me.”
I testify before God, says the apostle to Timothy, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing out of partiality but maintaining fairness  (First Timothy 5:21); and you call him insulting who rebukes you for being caught in such great sins, asking why you committed them, and now prays that you may save yourself from these evils while there is still a chance.
Be the kind of person whom God does not punish among those He calls wicked and treacherous, as He says:
"I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me"
Isaiah 1:2.
You might think I am being arrogant because I wish for you to be among those whom the only Son of God invites to His kingdom, saying:
"Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world"
Matthew 25:34.
You feel insulted because the truth is being told to you; yet the glorious apostle commands otherwise, saying:
"Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear"
First Timothy 5:20.
Should I listen to you, who says:
"Let me destroy God's religion, turn His servants to the antichrist, let me establish all in this sacrilege,"
or to the blessed apostle who instructs me to rebuke you publicly for your sins? But if you think I should have spared you because you are the emperor, then you are mistaken.
For you hear the apostle say:
"Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear"
First Timothy 5:20.
And you say,
"You should have spared me specifically because I am the emperor of the Roman Empire."
Where did I omit this testimony?
I testify before God and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism
First Timothy 5:21.
You think I am disrespectful because I did not place your commands above God's commands.
In the Acts of the Apostles, I read that the blessed apostles were taken by those with whom you share not only disbelief but also cruelty, and they were commanded not to teach in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But let us see what the scripture says about whether the apostles obeyed the enemies of God's only Son or whether they zealously fulfilled their mission.
It says,
"They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go. The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah"
Acts 5:40-42.
When the holy scripture relates that the blessed apostles acted in this way, should we remain silent to the leaders of God's churches while you, a blasphemer, a murderer, and a destroyer of God's religion, strengthen your heresy?
The holy scripture speaks of the apostles not fearing the beatings or threats from the sons of perdition, but always teaching.
Should we then, because of your ephemeral rule, be broken in spirit, allowing you to fulfill all your wicked plans?
You consider us defiant because we tell you the truth.
Similarly, your fellow blasphemers judged the most blessed Stephen because he said to them:
"You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it"
Acts 7:51-53.
When the Jews heard this, were they justly or unjustly enraged against the holy martyr Stephen? If unjustly, then you too are unjust in your anger against those who wish to save you.
Notice that you are standing against God's church just as the Jews did then and still do now; you are stiff-necked, uncircumcised in heart and ears.
Just as they could not endure hearing the truth and rushed to kill God's servant, you too rush to kill us who speak the plain and manifest truth to you.
As the divine scripture says,
"When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him"
Acts 7:54.
And further:
"Yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him"
Acts 7:57-58.
Thus, you, with your heart raging and your teeth gnashing, are against us for no other reason except that we call you a persecutor of God’s house, a destroyer of God’s religion, a shedder of the blood of Christ’s servants, and justly call you a sacrilegious person, a blasphemer, a heretic, indeed one who fights against the apostolic and evangelical faith.
We do nothing hateful to God by saying these things about you, in the manner I am confronting you, acting on what we understand you to be.
We have found others like you acting similarly against the glorious ones.
While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'
Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
So, being sent by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of the Lord in the synagogues of the Jews.
They had John as their assistant.
When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus, which means 'Son of Jesus,' who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man.
He summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said,
'You son of the devil, full of all deceit and fraud, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time.'
Immediately, mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
We believe this testimony will not cause you to say,
'Lucifer insults me, the emperor.'
What does it matter to me what you are, when I say to you these things that you have heard from the apostle, who was recognized as a false prophet?
In the same way, I consider you, Emperor Constantius, to be like the Jewish false prophet Bar-Jesus, as the glorious Paul and Barnabas encountered.
Just as he was found to be contrary to the name of the Lord, so are you; just as he resisted the truth, so do you; just as he did not want people to believe in God’s only Son, so do you.
When you hear that the proconsul was an intelligent man, eager to be instructed by the blessed apostles to find the way of truth, and that the one you imitate resisted the apostles to prevent the proconsul from believing in God’s Son, it is clear that you are like that Jewish false prophet.
Furthermore, when the Holy Scripture says that Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, delivered that rebuke, you must understand that the Jewish false prophet was filled with an unclean spirit.
Just as he, driven by an opposing spirit, contradicted, so you, driven by the adversary’s instigation, are found to resist.
You must then consider yourself no different from Bar-Jesus, the Jewish false prophet.
Therefore, since you understand yourself to be another Bar-Jesus, the Jewish false prophet, whenever your sacrilegious mouth declares,
'God does not have a true Son,'
do not be offended if we say to you what was said by the apostle to your predecessor, the Jewish false prophet:
'Full of all deceit and fraud, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?'
If you are troubled by these words, which were said to him whose path you follow to death, you show yourself to be very foolish, wanting to be what that Jewish false prophet was, yet not wanting to be called by the names he was called.
Again, I urge and implore you, as I advise, to look out for yourself, lest eternal punishment befall you.
He deserved to be blinded because he tried to resist. Look at the evils that can come to a murderer, a sacrilegious person, and a destroyer of God's religion, both in this life and forever. Take in these things that can show you that we are not insolent but truthful.
The seven glorious brothers resisted Antiochus, just as we now resist you. You read what the fourth brother said to your tormentor, who calls me insolent because I tell you that unless you turn to God, you will perish forever. He said: "It is better to be given over to death by men, expecting hope from God to be resurrected again by him. For you, there will be no resurrection to life"  Second Book of Maccabees 7:14.
If you hear from us, tyrant, that you will not receive the resurrection to life if you remain in this disbelief, that you will be resurrected not to rest but to eternal punishment, where is the insult? The fifth brother, when he was brought forward and tormented, said to the king: "You have power among men because you are mortal, you do what you want. But do not think that our race has been abandoned by God; wait patiently, and you will see how great his power is, how it will torment you and your descendants" Second Book of Maccabees 7:16.
Do you think that because a servant of God spoke with such firmness against your fellow tyrant, he was injurious? Would you judge a worshiper of God as a worshiper of the devil? Would you deny that he spoke the truth and was not arrogant? You should not judge me as insolent because I tell you that we are not abandoned by God, for whom I endure these things, while you, unless corrected, will come to nothing with your mortal glory.
Consider what the sixth brother said, and you will find that we resist your stormy attacks just as they did: "Do not be mistaken in vain" Second Book of Maccabees 7:18; for we suffer these things because of our own sins, offending our God, and we have received a deserved warning. But do not think you will escape unpunished when you have tried to fight against God.
My letters of modesty and books written in plain language prove that I have often said that our sins have brought us into the hands of you, the forerunner of the Antichrist. Still, you fight against God, and therefore, unless you take care, you will indeed be like that Antiochus, destined for eternal punishment, while the Lord will be merciful to us.
You are upset because we reveal who you are and what you deserve, to be trampled on by all the soldiers of Christ as the shadow of the Antichrist: who, you ask, could trample on me? Those whom you imprison, deprive of their heritage, exile, torture, and kill for confessing they are Christians. You think we are arrogant because we pray for all entrusted to us to trample on the devil's head and reduce your sacrilegious attempts to nothing through the power of their sufferings for Christ, the only Son of God.
Is that glorious mother of the seven brothers also insolent to you because she encouraged her sons to conquer your predecessor Antiochus, saying: "I do not know how you appeared in my womb, nor did I give you breath and life, nor did I shape each of your limbs. But indeed, the Creator of the world, who formed human birth and examines all origins, will, with mercy, give you back both spirit and life, as you now despise yourselves for his laws" Second Book of Maccabees 7:22. This religious mother did not cease to say these things to her sons, loving them strongly until she saw all of them killed.
Should we, whom the prophet foretold would be shepherds for his flock, saying, "And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding" Jeremiah 3:15, have remained silent, not to appear insolent to you, the rabid wolf coming to slaughter God's sheep? The woman so inflamed her sons' hearts with love for God that she gained victories through their deaths by the sword. And you think it was fitting for us to tell Christ's soldiers: Do not take up arms against Constantius, the devil's minion, do not resist the temple of all demons?
Do whatever he commands. But what is this stubbornness of ours, if we strive to fulfill the duty assigned to us by God, if we are found to be imitators of that woman? You want to please the devil, whose work you are found to celebrate; we do not. You want to be most acceptable to God by acting against this. If you are still moved by why you are called what you are by us, even consider what was proclaimed by that seventh son of this woman against Antiochus:
But Antiochus, thinking he was being scorned, despised the voice that rebuked him. When the youngest son was still left, not only did he encourage him with words, but he also swore that he would make him rich and happy, transfer him from his homeland, and give him necessary things.
But since the young man did not heed these promises, he called his mother and urged her to counsel the boy for his salvation.
After many exhortations, she agreed to persuade her son. So, leaning towards him, she mocked the cruel tyrant and said in her native language: "Son, have pity on me who carried you in my womb for ten months, nursed you for three years, raised you, and brought you to this age. I beg you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth, and everything in them, and realize that God made them out of nothing, and similarly, he made the human race."
"Do not fear this executioner, but being worthy of your brothers, embrace death, so that I may receive you with your brothers in the mercy of that God."
When she had said these things, the young man said: "What are you waiting for? I do not obey the king's command, but I obey the law given to us by Moses. You, however, who have become the inventor of all evil against the Hebrews, will not escape the hand of God."
"For if, because of our rebuke and correction, our Lord was briefly angry with us while we were alive, he will be reconciled again with his servants; but you, oh wicked one, and most disgraceful of all men, do not vainly exalt yourself with empty appearances against his servants: for you have not yet escaped the judgment of the omnipotent and all-seeing God."
"For our fathers, having sustained a little pain now, fell under the covenant of eternal life with God: but you will pay the just penalties of your pride by the judgment of God."
"As for me, like my brothers, I surrender both soul and body for the laws of our fathers, invoking God to be merciful to our nation sooner, and for you, with torments and whips, to confess that he alone is God."
"The omnipotent has established his wrath upon me and my brothers, which has justly come upon our entire race."
What, Constantius, have you heard from us more than what has been spoken by this faithful servant of God?
If he said to the attendants of Antiochus, "What are you waiting for? I do not obey the king's command, but I obey the law given to us by Moses," we say the same to you: "What do you think we can do to comply with the will of Constantius, the precursor of the Antichrist? As we are Christians, we will always be."
If he said to Antiochus, "You who have become the inventor of all evil against the Hebrews, will not escape the hand of God," we have said and are saying the same to you, for no one has ever been a greater persecutor of the sacred law of God than you, and you will not escape the hand of God.
If Antiochus heard that the Lord was briefly angry with his people for the sake of reproof and correction and would again be reconciled with his servants, you hear the same from us.
If it was said to the king, "You, oh wicked one, and most disgraceful of all men, do not vainly exalt yourself with empty hope against his servants: for you have not yet escaped the judgment of the omnipotent God," you hear the same from us.
Indeed, you are the wickedest and most disgraceful of all men, who perform these acts to make us apostates to your cause, but in vain, as you are inflated with empty hope by the devil against us, the servants of God: for you will not be able to fulfill your evil plans, nor escape the judgment of the all-seeing, all-powerful God.
You hear from us, just as Antiochus heard from that illustrious young man: "Our brothers, having endured a little, have fallen under the covenant of eternal life with God."
They have fallen, but you will face the just punishment for your pride from the judgment of God (Deuteronomy 32:36). You hear from us that we are ready to be killed by you, the executioner, for God, just as you have already killed our brothers.
We are prepared to surrender our souls and bodies for Jesus Christ, the true and only Son of God. We trust in His tireless mercy, believing that He will soon rescue His entire flock from you, a ravenous wolf, and from you, a rabid dog. If you do not change your ways, you will always face torment.
What more can I say to you, whether through scripture or in person? I want you to refute me, you tyrant of our time. If I called you an executioner, so did that righteous young man and his mother call Antiochus, your counterpart.
If I called you the inventor of all wickedness and said that you cannot escape the hand of God, if I called you wicked and the most heinous among men because you will not escape the judgment of the all-seeing, all-powerful God, and you will pay the just penalties in His judgment, all these things have already been said by that religious young man to your colleague Antiochus.
You call me insulting because you see names worthy of your deeds applied to you, the same names our predecessors, worshippers of the living God, have applied to your fellow tyrants.
The blessed apostle Peter says,  "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world" (First Peter 5:8).
If you think I am insulting because you hear that what you are doing is evil, how am I found resisting the devil according to the apostle's command?
Behold, this dragon, leading you to all drunkenness with his wine, has sent it into the entire flock of God, so that using your royal aid, you make everyone drunk as you are: insane, mad, and demented.
Who has made you as drunk as the vine of Sodom and the vineyard of Gomorrah, so that you do not see yourself as fornicating as the Jews have fornicated? In what, I say, will we resist the devil if we do not confront you, through whom he has armed himself to devour us?
If the sober do not tell the drunk, the healthy do not tell the sick, the whole do not tell the wounded, the seeing do not tell the blind, the standing do not tell the fallen, the pious do not tell the impious, the sheep of God do not tell the ravenous wolf, the most merciful and loving do not tell the cruel executioner, the savage murderer, those who glorify God do not tell the blasphemer, the worshippers of God do not tell the sacrilegious, Christians do not tell the heretical Arian: Depart, servant of our adversary, give honor to God?
How will we resist the devil if we spare you, the net of his will, if your drunkenness, that is insanity, is not declared to all, if finally you are not revealed to the whole world for your cruelty towards us? From these actions, it is clear that you are not a servant of Christ but plainly a slave to him who, like a roaring lion, is against us.
Therefore, we seem petulant to you because we tell you that you have become drunk with that wine, making you as mad as those who are led to complete drunkenness; those to whom and for whom it is said:  "They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?" (Deuteronomy 32:5).
And further:  "Jacob drank the wine, and ate, and was satisfied, and kicked: he waxed fat, and grew thick, and wide, and he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation" (Deuteronomy 32:14).
"They provoked me to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they me to anger. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. Of the Rock that begat thee, thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee" (Deuteronomy 32:17-18).
Thus, your betrayal of God and following of idolatry is proven by your treachery which you proclaim.  But now I believe I must bring you to see that it is not us, but you, for whom I say these things, who are injurious and petulant.
And the proud, but truthful, fearing no one except God. The most blessed Apostle John, dearest, says, "Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out." 1 John 4:1.
You clearly appear to me to be one of these false prophets. For by denying the only Son of God, you declare that you have nothing but the spirit of the antichrist in your sacrilegious mouth. Hence, it follows that you cannot listen to us speaking of the divine eternity of the only Son of God, as the spirit that remains in you is of the antichrist, who cannot endure it and does not want to be cast out of you, but desires to remain in you until it sees you taken to those places where it will be forever.
It grieves because it loses you, its most faithful delight, who obeys all its desires. Dearest, he says, "Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God; because many false prophets have gone into the world. By this, you will understand the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit that destroys Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist." 1 John 4:3.
And further down: "They are from the world; therefore, they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them. We, however, are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this, we understand the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." 1 John 4:6.
It is clear, Constantius, that you carry the spirit of the antichrist and are driven by the spirit of error. Just as those who said that the only Son of God did not take human form from the womb of the blessed Virgin, who did not believe he was incarnate and made man, are proven to have the spirit of error and are called antichrists, so you Arians, by denying that the only Son of God was truly born of the Father, that is, from the substance of the Father, reject that he is the true Son and that he has always reigned with the Father, never having been without the Father, nor the Father without the Son, and by refusing to believe that they share one deity, show that you are filled with the spirit of the antichrist.
For no one who has the Spirit of God can say, "There was a time when he was not," and "He was made from nothing," about the only Son of God, believing instead that he has reigned with the Father from the beginning and will reign without end. Therefore, when you say that he is not the true Son of God, when finally you attempt to destroy the belief that he is of the same substance with the Father, as the Greeks say, and as we Romans say, you show yourselves to be among those false prophets and are pronounced among the antichrists.
You should not judge me as insulting because I call you driven by an unclean spirit, or a forerunner of the antichrist; for it is your own mouth that reveals this about you. For no one who has the Spirit of God can assert what you Arians claim, nor can any of your various sects of heretics. You deny that God has a true Son, say he is adopted, and believe that by not understanding, you are not one of those antichrists that John spoke of. It is clear that you are led by an opposing spirit.
Hence, we do not believe you when you say about the Son, "He was made from nothing." For we know that such claims can only come from the spirit of false prophets, the forerunner of the antichrist, a minion and slave of demons. We could not believe you when you said this, given that the Holy Spirit has spoken through the prophets about the only Son of God, declaring him to be the true Son of God, eternal and co-eternal with the Father, never without the Son, and the Father never without the Son, and the blessed apostles reported the same.
Since the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, who was in the prophets, also remained in the apostles, and because the Holy Paraclete Spirit is in the Church of God, and you are placed outside the Church of God, not remaining in you, you are proven to have the spirit of the antichrist; an unclean spirit that does not want you to see what we are bringing forward.
Your heretical order is enveloped in the darkness of errors, shrouded in blind fog, so you cannot escape its traps. You judge us to be disrespectful because we declare what we see you to be.
Behold, even in the Gospel according to Matthew, I find that the Lord said: "Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves" (Matthew 10:16); you seem to me to be one of those wolves, indeed the most ferocious of all wolves roaring against God's flock.
For who, denying the only Son of God, would not rejoice and boast when they see you ravaging Christ's flock in such a way? I consider you one of those unbelievers, one of those faithless ones to whom it is said: "Brood of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things" (Matthew 12:34).
If the things you speak, Constantine, are good, then you must have a good treasure. I am insolent because I tell you that darkness dwells in your heart; hence, from your very dark senses, you dare to bring forth unclean and dark things.
Behold, if you listen to what was said to blessed Peter by the Lord, you will undoubtedly call me insolent. The most holy Matthew says: "While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, 'Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.' Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed Him. But Jesus said to him, 'Friend, why have you come?' Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. But Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'" (Matthew 26:47).
You must call me insolent when you hear that if you use the sword, you will perish by the sword. Or have you not used the sword against Christians? If you have killed no one with the sword, if you have pursued no one to death, why would a confession that God's only Son is the true Son, or holding to apostolic and evangelical faith, or refusing to be Arian, not cause you to perish by the sword? For you hear it said to blessed Peter by God's only Son, that everyone who uses the sword will perish by the sword.
I am insolent because I told you: Christians are not allowed to kill, because it is worthy for Christians to suffer, not to commit wrongs. You should not kill those claiming to be Christians for Christ. These are the commands the Lord has given us; if they are kept, then we will continue to be Christians. Instead, you deem it worthy to persecute His servants with the sword, and we can no longer call you a Christian, but clearly a robber or a gladiator.
Meanwhile, since we have recited how your fellow, Judas Iscariot, betrayed the Lord, let us thoroughly examine the causes of his sacrilege and yours in this place, and you will find that you and Judas Iscariot are one. He betrayed the Lord to the Jews because he did not believe, just as your contemporary Sirmium, who was called and is called unworthy Photinus, does not now believe.
You betrayed Him, indeed to the whole world, so that all might deny His divinity. Who among you is greater in wickedness? I believe it is you. For every sin against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come (Matthew 12:32). And you have become the betrayer of His divinity, making it so that all could deny Him.
As far as you are concerned, you have betrayed Him, about whom you have also written books, and you have placed preachers of your kind intention everywhere. So that all might deny that He is truly the Son of God, you have caused the apostolic and evangelical faith described at Nicaea to be judged against you heretics.
And you have made your blasphemy be called Catholic.
And yet this Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that he had brought about his own destruction, driven by repentance,
returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders,
saying: I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.
But they said: What is that to us? You see to it.
And throwing down the silver coins in the temple, he withdrew; and went and hanged himself.
(Matthew 27:3)
He repented at one moment and returned the price he had received; what about you?
Who, after being made guilty by his servants, not only did not repent, but grew even more stubborn;
what about you?
Who is giving all the wealth of your kingdom to strengthen your sacrilege, who, unable to corrupt some people from the truth in any other way, have corrupted many with your vast riches, who enriched a certain number of the needy so much that they might compare to your companions in wealth.
Judas, after realizing his crime, ended his life by hanging:
you, who deserve greater punishment for the magnitude of your crime, what will you do when you realize too late that you have done wrong?
When your eyes, now unable to see because of the heretical poison, start to see?
Yet, if you are willing to believe, it is necessary that what you do out of ignorance be forgiven, just as it was forgiven to the blessed Apostle Paul:
but if not, you will descend to the infernal night like Judas, then you will say to those who compelled you to do these things, that is to your fellow heretics: I have sinned with you,
denying the only Son of God; I have sinned by giving you authority to deny His eternal mercy.
Then, when you start to recognize the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which we rightly confess to be eternal,
when you see that the greatness and power are one in the Father, in His only Son, and in the Holy Paraclete Spirit, where will those be who urged you to commit this sacrilege, so that you can say to them:
I repent, because I ran with you, enemies of God, because I was with you in persecuting God's house?
They will undoubtedly be with you in hell.
Where will the riches of your kingdom be then, which serve not for your salvation, but for your eternal destruction?
We indeed wish that God deigns to reveal the truth to you, hostile to your own salvation,
and that you emerge from such dangers.
However, it is not hard to estimate how much more prominent you are in crime than Judas Iscariot, since you have summoned the whole world to deny His divinity;
Judas, however, betrayed the Lord only to those who did not yet believe in Him; you, on the contrary, have dared to provoke even those who already believed to deny His divinity.
Judas did not force anyone to perish with him,
but you, with a military force, fight against us, whom you know to believe as the patriarchs, prophets,
apostles, and martyrs believed; indeed,
it is not hard to weigh the difference between you and Judas.
You call me insolent because
I want neither myself nor those entrusted to me to be harmed by your pestilential doctrine, because I say that you are full of disease, and therefore must be avoided by God's servants, lest we too become diseased and perish in this same plague of yours.
As the Apostle said to the Corinthians: I wish you would bear with me a little in my folly, but indeed you do bear with me.
For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy.
For I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
But I fear,
lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
(Second Corinthians 11:1)
Therefore, I seem to you to be insolent,
because I fear that through your blasphemies you will corrupt the chastity we have in Christ Jesus,
because we fear lest, as your dearest serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, you will seduce us away from God,
and make us guilty of death.
You call me stubborn because
I say you are a deceitful worker, a pseudo-Christian.
These words were not first uttered by me against you.
For you hear the blessed Apostle designate you as a deceitful worker, a pseudo-apostle: for such pseudo-apostles are deceitful workers, transforming themselves.
In the apostles of Christ. And no wonder: for even Satan transforms himself as an angel of light. So it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
Hence, you see me as arrogant, because I say, knowing you from your actions, that you are one of those whom the Holy Spirit, through the apostle, has foretold would become like this. If you are not a deceitful worker, prove me wrong. For I know that you pretend to be a Christian, while being an Arian, and you want to make us all servants of the one whose ally you are.
Indeed, we see in some cases that you feign piety, while you practice all impiety towards us Christians. If you are not a deceitful worker, how did you, pretending peace, try to destroy every church of God, to dissolve the peace given to it through the only Son? For I could not have the peace of the Lord from then on, since I did what you commanded me against the Lord's command. From then on, indeed, I would have started to deny the only Son of God, as you deny.
If you were not transformed into the apostles of Christ, who, as if all the care of the church truly belongs to you, are so concerned, evidently, that no Catholic bishop may govern any church anywhere, and that no one may be left who can confess himself a Christian. You remove Catholic bishops, ordain heretics, and write horrendous threats, lest a sedition arise. Surely, anyone who does not know better, seeing you do these things, would think you are a Christian. But we, who know, being instructed by the blessed apostle, that Satan has transformed himself as an angel of light, who does all these things against the holy church through you, cannot wonder if we see you as his minister, if we see you transformed as a minister of righteousness, urging righteousness.
If only you would turn to this so that you could be believed to be a servant of God, so that you could be judged and understood as a Christian. How often have we told you that you could not be a denier of God's only Son unless you were full of the opposing spirit, and you are accustomed to say that we wrong you. Although I have already proven this matter in many places, with unclean spirits instigating your hearts, you come against the family of God.
Take what happened in the Acts of the Apostles. As we were going to prayer, a certain girl with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and us, and cried out saying, "These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation." And she did this for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities, and brought them to the magistrates, saying, "These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city; and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe." Then the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods. And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. But at midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.
And the keeper of the prison, awakening from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners had fled. But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here." Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. And he brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
What must I do to be saved?
They answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your household will be saved."
They then spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his house.
He took them at that same hour of the night and washed their wounds; then he and his entire household were baptized.
He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and they celebrated with his whole household because he believed in the Lord.
So, when that spirit of Python heard the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, it immediately fled from his house, stirring up the entire city against the preachers of the Majesty of the only Son of God, just as those impure spirits have stirred you and yours against us, His servants.
Do not doubt that you are driven by the same spirits that incited the people against Paul and Silas when they rose against you, seeing you become a persecutor of God's religion, like that crowd that had not yet believed in the only Son of God.
They acted that way because they were without God's spirit, as you also prove to be.
You cannot have the Holy Spirit unless you believe in the only Son of God.
This is evident from the jailer who, though he was one of the resistant people, believed and was then guided by the Holy Spirit, as Paul and Silas were.
He embraced their way because he saw the prison doors open on their own.
Likewise, unless you believe in the only Son of God as we do, you will only have the spirit of our adversary.
The jailer asked the glorious Paul and Silas, "What must I do to be saved?"
They answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your household will be saved" (Acts 16:30).
Therefore, it is clear you are not saved because you have not yet believed in the Lord Jesus.
You cannot claim to believe in Him since you are persecuting Him.
Do you think you are not persecuting Him through us?
If you are not persecuting Him through us, why does He say to Saul, "Why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads" (Acts 9:4)?
What was Saul doing to hear this from the Lord?
He was doing what you are doing: denying the only Son of God, just as you do.
Paul was a persecutor then, but later he began to endure persecution.
He persecuted Christians not because they believed as you do that He was made from nothing and was the true Son but because they confessed Him as the only Son of God, believed in the unity of the Father and the Son, and that their divinity and power were one.
Paul abhorred these beliefs, thinking Christians were in error.
But when he was enlightened by the one he denied, he recognized from the books of Moses and all the prophets' writings and immediately began to defend the beliefs he had once attacked.
These were the beliefs held by those he persecuted before he believed.
But who was so foolish, like you Arians or Photinus of Sirmium, called the Scotinus, to believe in a creature who was once not, who was created from nothing?
It is clear that you all do not believe as the glorious Church does and are led by an adverse spirit.
You cannot be freed from this adverse spirit unless you believe that He is truly the Son of God.
You say the bishops insult you.
Why do you think we are insulting?
Is it because we say, "Why do you pretend to be a Christian?"
You seem to be an Arian and an enemy of God's religion.
Hence, we seem injurious to you and yours.
But consider what the blessed apostle instructed us bishops to do against you wolves: "You know that from the first day I came to Asia, how I was with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility and tears and through the trials that came upon me from the plots of the Jews, how I did not shrink from declaring anything profitable to you, and teaching you publicly and from house to house" (Acts 20:18-20).
Jews and Greeks, testifying repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. And now, behold, I am bound by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit warns me in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me in Jerusalem. But I consider my life worth nothing to me, as long as I may finish my course and the ministry of the word that I received from the Lord, to testify the gospel of the grace of God to Jews and Greeks. And now I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of the Lord Jesus, will no longer see my face. Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men, for I did not hesitate to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of the Lord, which He bought with His own blood. I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number, men will arise and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. Therefore, be on your guard, remembering that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
Seeing these commands of the apostle, what do you order me to do, so as not to appear disrespectful to you? Do you order me to be silent and allow you, one of those designated savage wolves, to ravage God's flock in any way? We see you wolves, whom the Holy Spirit has chosen to reveal through the apostle, trying to seize the entire flock of God; and we, the overseers whom the Holy Spirit has appointed to shepherd God's church, are told by the blessed apostle that we must spare you the wolf, we must respect your royal diadem, your earrings and right-hand bracelets, and honor the distinguished garments you consider important, while despising the Creator and Ruler of all things?
Who is more foolish than you to say: I suffer injury from Lucifer, the emperor from a poor man? You do not even deign to say from a bishop, because you have been recognized as a wolf and have deserved rejection. You thought to burden me with such envy as to claim that a servant of God was disrespectful to you, the emperor. If you think we are injurious, hear what the blessed Paul replied to the chief priest who forbade him to preach the only Son of God. The scripture says that Paul, looking intently at the council, said: Brothers, I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God up to this day. But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike Paul on the mouth. Then Paul said to him: God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck.
Therefore, if the sacred law cannot judge the blessed Paul as disrespectful because he said this to an unjust judge, neither can you justly call me arrogant for speaking the truth to you and telling you what you are. You designate me guilty of disrespect, but please tell me, to whom can you complain about me? If to God, how can you complain to Him whom you do not know? How can you, being a stranger to His house? If you complain to yourself, what can a man do, who can harm God's servants in no way? If you torture us, we are more cared for; if you torment us, we are more refreshed; if you kill us, we live more. You say I am disrespectful because I dare to call you the precursor of the antichrist. If your actions do not show you to be this, consider with great care the book of the most holy prophet Daniel, and you will find yourself to be one of those foretold persecutors of God's religion.
In the first year of Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans, Daniel had a dream, and visions of his head while on his bed, and he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. And four great beasts came up out of the sea, each different from the other. The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. And it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it. And behold, another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.
Then he said to him: Get up and eat a lot of meat. After this beast, I saw another one, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back and four heads, and it was given authority.
After this, I saw a fourth beast, terrifying, amazing, and extremely strong: it had iron teeth that devoured and crushed, and whatever was left, it trampled with its feet. This beast was greater than the other beasts I had seen before, and it had ten horns. As I was looking at the horns, another smaller horn came up among them, and three of the earlier horns were uprooted before it: it had human eyes and a mouth speaking great things. I watched until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like pure wool, and his throne was flames of fire, its wheels burning fire. A river of fire flowed out before him, thousands upon thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
I watched then because of the great words the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. The dominion of the other beasts was taken away, but they were allowed to live for a period of time. I continued watching in the visions of the night, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
My spirit was troubled within me, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this. So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: 'The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.'
Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.
But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'
(Daniel 7:1)
I should have only included the part that describes who you are like among the beasts through your actions: but so you would know you will be in that hell where that beast was cast, as the glorious Daniel mentions, unless you correct yourself, and how those you persecute will reign forever in the kingdom of the Lord, we include all this so that you might reflect on it. Also, I decided to apply the entire revelation to this, so you could at least satisfy yourself by reading it. Tyrants who persecute the religion of God have been called beasts; I wish to clear myself in front of your conscience poisoned by Arian dogma, before you who are not religious.
But not a destroyer of religion as you claim, nor am I being insulting by calling you a wild beast or savage creature, since you see that you are called such names according to your actions. Moreover, it is clear that you bear the resemblance of that fourth beast and desire to fulfill what it was foretold to accomplish. It is written about the antichrist, to whom you are similar or are judged to be:
"He will speak words against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High God, and will intend to change times and law, and the saints will be given into his hand."
(Daniel 7:25)
You have already done and are doing these things. For when you say, "The Son of God is not the true God, but was made out of nothing," you speak words against God. Christians, while we assert the divinity of the Father and His only Son, and you attack this defense of ours, claiming that the Son once was not and was made out of nothing, surely you prove yourself either to be the antichrist or at least his precursor. For you cannot be understood as anything else but either the precursor of the antichrist or the antichrist himself, who dares to call the apostolic and evangelical faith heretical and tries to vindicate your blasphemy as the catholic faith.
You feel wronged because we call you a beast: you are found to be devising to change the faith, which is to make us believe differently from how the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs believed, but you have established that we should believe as your lost Arius did. And you say it is not right to call you a beast, when the most holy prophet said you would act this way? You, Constantius, are no less in unbelief than the antichrist: for you do not cease devouring the servants of God with iron teeth.
What more is there to say? The antichrist will do nothing except deny the only Son of God: this is what your most unclean mind, fed by stupidity, does. But no matter how fiercely you rage, your times will pass, and those will come in which you will see yourself, unless you reconsider, placed in that fiery river, and then you will see those whom you have fiercely persecuted because they do not want to perish with you. Not in the place of torment where you will be, but with the holy angels, always giving thanks and praises to God, while you are in that flaming liquid.
Do not be surprised that the glorious Daniel designated you as a beast, when the blessed Paul said about your fellow Cretans:
"Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
(Titus 1:12)
And further: "Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth."
(Titus 1:13)
Hence we bishops seem injurious to you because we rebuke and reprimand you, asking why you dared to turn away from the truth, why you wanted to cling to the blasphemies and commandments of men, forsaking God's commandments, and why, finally, you have abandoned God and embraced idolatry. Hence, I seem to be your enemy because I wish you to walk according to the apostle's precept and not according to the commands of Arius and the Jews.
Against our most just allegations, seeing yourself overcome by the truth, you are accustomed to say: "The sacred scriptures command kings and all those living in high positions to be subject to you; and you dare to hurl such things at me, Lucifer?"
You see these things, you understand such commands that require you to be honored; but those that command you to act, you pretend not to know, those that the Lord commands to obey the priests, those that urge you to exhibit yourself as one among all your fellow servants, not claiming to be superior to anyone if you wish to be found a servant of God.
The blessed apostle said to Titus: "Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you."
(Titus 2:15)
If you are a Christian, because you are one of those for whom he said: "Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you," surely you should listen to me rebuking you with all authority, not despise me. Then you will be a Christian if you do not despise me urging you to persevere as a Christian.
If you despise him, you will no longer be found among Christians. Because if you were a Christian, you wouldn't despise the one whom God has appointed to instruct His people, and the one to whom the Apostle said:
"Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you"
Titus
2:15.
For what do I urge you, if not to avoid being a murderer, to not persecute the house of God? To stop torturing, proscribing, deporting, imprisoning, slaughtering, and variously destroying and killing those whom you see as Christians? To stop blaspheming the only Son of God? To accept the apostolic faith, which you call heretical, this faith of ours which the bishops described against you and all heretics at Nicaea? To be a believer like us, and to reject the idolatry taught by your master Arius? To proclaim yourself as a Christian, not an Arian? To stop falsely accusing God's priests of crimes?
This is my correction, this is my rebuke. The Apostle tells me to rebuke you with all authority, and you say:
"Lucifer wrongs me."
And you do not say:
"God's priest admonishes and urges me according to the commands of the sacred law, so that I may lead a life most acceptable to God."
For as you say we owe you obedience, know that we recognize ourselves as debtors not only to you, but to all those in high positions representing us in their duties. For the Apostle says:
"Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people. For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life"
Titus
3:1-7.
Therefore, he reminds us that we ought to be engaged in good works, not evil. If it is a good work to kill someone absent, to kill someone proclaiming his innocence without a hearing, to punish with you the one whom we know to be innocent, neglecting all regard for mercy; if it is a good work to deny the only Son of God, if it is a work acceptable to God to abandon the apostolic faith and accept heresy, you would rightly say that I am acting against the commands of the sacred scriptures.
I add that the Apostle mentioned those rulers and authorities who had not yet believed in the only Son of God; certainly, by our humility and gentleness, and long patience in adversity, and utmost obedience in fitting matters, they would be provoked to believe.
But if you, because you are an emperor, pretending to be one of us, force us to abandon God and accept idolatry, should we comply with you, lest the commands of the Apostle seem to have been overlooked? And yet you, who pretend to be a Christian, try to make Christians what you are yourself, that is, apostates. You, who still remain foolish and unbelieving in your malice, in which the Apostle says we also were before knowledge, before receiving the sacred apostolic faith.
What were we to do but fulfill what was lawful? Or when you, a blasphemous murderer, say:
"Kill those who believe in the only Son of God, be persecutors of His house with me, deny Him with me, reject the apostolic faith, accept my heresy, of which I have been a lover with all the strength of my heart";
who is more unfortunate than you, that no one would avoid you? Wouldn't one flee from you, recognizing you as a temple of demons, urging these things?
Because you hear this, you say:
"I suffer wrong from Lucifer, a miserable man, and indeed an emperor";
your blasphemous and defiled speech does not follow:
"I hear what I deserve from Lucifer, the priest of the Lord."
To the Galatians, the chosen vessel says,
"I am astonished that you are so quickly..."
Quickly you are turning away from Him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel, which is not another, except there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.
And do you think you can be judged by me as anything other than accursed? When I find you preaching differently than what the blessed apostles handed down. Therefore, when you hear from me that I consider you accursed for preaching differently than the apostles, if you call me injurious, know you are lying, carrying a human trait; if indeed you see me saying you are accursed because the blessed apostle has already called you accursed.
You judge me injurious because I call you foolish: but how can I rightly be called injurious by you when it is clear I speak the truth, saying you are foolish? If the Galatians hear, "O foolish Galatians," from the blessed apostle, why do you think you should not be called foolish?
For if they were called foolish because they obeyed false brothers, listening to the suggestions of your serpents, thinking they had to keep the Sabbaths and circumcision, how much more rightly are you called foolish, who have denied the only Son of God! Because I say to you, "Rescue yourself from the rabid Arian dogs," you say I am injurious; but perhaps you do not know that the deniers of the only Son of God are called dogs, fat bulls, sons of iniquity, an adulterous and whorish seed, sons of perdition, and an evil seed.
If you flee being called thus by God, hear through Isaiah himself speaking to your fellow blasphemers, the Jews: "Come here, sons of iniquity, an adulterous and whorish seed. In whom have you delighted, and against whom have you opened your mouth and stuck out your tongue? Are you not children of perdition, an evil seed?"
And in another place: "See that all are blind, they have not known understanding, all are mute dogs, unable to bark, dreaming in bed, loving to sleep: and greedy dogs, unable to be satisfied, and they are wicked without understanding, following all their ways."
Who are these to whom these things are said, or for whom are they said? Surely those whom the only Son of God, through the mouth of David, accuses in Psalm 22, saying: "Many bulls have surrounded me; fat bulls have encircled me. They opened their mouths against me, like a lion tearing and roaring."
And further down: "Many dogs have surrounded me, the assembly of the wicked has enclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet."
When you see your teachers in sacrilege called calves, fat bulls, and dogs, you cannot judge me injurious for calling you by the names they were called and are called: for you are not less in wickedness, daring to say: "There was a time when He was not," and "He was made out of nothing," so that you should not be called by fitting names.
But do you wish not to be called by these names? Change your ways, correct your errors, as the blessed Paul and the others from that faithless people corrected theirs. Because I say to you: Rescue yourself from the assembly of the wicked, you think I am injurious.
Why? Surely because I profess to be a Christian, because I do not want to abandon God and follow your idolatry. We are not the first to be called injurious and arrogant by you sacrilegious people; for all those who resisted the fatal edicts of your tyrants were also called thus. To pass over others, I will return again to King Antiochus in the conclusion of the speech.
Did he judge those who resisted him as injurious and arrogant or not? Without a doubt, because he considered them injurious and arrogant, he persecuted those dedicated to God with such cruelty unto death.
So, it remains for you to see what else Antiochus did to those whom you already know about. If you can rightly say that they were proud and disrespectful to Antiochus, then you can say the same about us. For we suffer from you the same things they suffered from Antiochus. We proclaim our faith and religion just as they did. We profess to serve the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, just as they confessed.
Scripture says, the king sent an old Athenian to compel the Jews to abandon their ancestral laws and to stop using God's laws, to defile the temple in Jerusalem and rename it as the temple of Jupiter Olympius, and to rename the temple in Garizim according to the people who lived there, as the temple of Jupiter Hospitaller. The worst and most grievous of all evils was the uprising. For the temple was filled with revelries of the Gentiles, who consorted with prostitutes, and women approached the holy places, bringing in things that were not allowed. The altar was filled with unlawful things prohibited by the laws. Neither were the Sabbaths celebrated nor the holy days of the ancestors observed.
And further, they were led by bitter necessity every single month on the king’s birthday. It was a pity. When the sacred rites of Bacchus were celebrated, they were compelled to go around with ivy wreaths for Bacchus. A decree went out to the nearby Greek cities, suggested by the Ptolemies, to implement the same measures against the Jews and to show no mercy to those who refused to adopt Greek customs, to kill them. So he came to witness the misery. Two women were reported to have circumcised their sons, and their infants were hung from their breasts. After being publicly paraded through the city, they were thrown down from the wall. Others nearby ran to caves to secretly celebrate the Sabbath. When this was discovered, they were burned because they feared to seek help on the glorious holy day.
What do you think the worshipers of God should have done then? Should they have pleased God or Antiochus? If you think they should not have pleased Antiochus, then neither should we please you. Because although you use different means, you still desire to take us away from God and join us to the devil, just as he wanted them to. This cruelty is carried out by you, being so fierce and unjust to those who resist your accursed decree. Therefore, as often said, you should regret your error, acknowledging yourself as a murderer and blasphemer, and return to the house of God. Otherwise, you will blame yourself when you begin to see yourself in the place where all your fellow tyrants are now.
