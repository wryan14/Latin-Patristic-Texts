But that prophet or that dreamer shall be put to death because they have spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God.

    (Deuteronomy 13:1). Do you understand what you are commanded to endure? Whether you claim to be warned by a dream or wish to set yourself up as a prophet, you are an enemy of God if you want us to abandon the apostolic faith and accept one that denies the only Son of God. All those I have mentioned became so great and honorable because they believed in the only Son of God.

    You cannot prove to me that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed differently than John and all his fellow apostles. If the apostles did not believe as the patriarchs did, why does blessed Paul call everyone to the faith of Abraham?

Thus, I aim to prove you sacrilegious and show that you have strayed from the path of truth.

    And the Lord was with Joshua, and His name was known throughout the land.

    (Joshua 6:27). And the children of Israel were negligent and acted deceitfully concerning the accursed things, and the Lord was angry with the children of Israel. Joshua sent men to Ai, which is near Bethel, saying, 'Consider Ai.' And the men went up and observed Ai. They returned to Joshua and said to him.
  </p>



  <p>
    Not all the people should go up, but rather two or three thousand men should go up and destroy the city, so you do not lead the entire people there, for they are few.
  </p>
  <p>
    And about three thousand men went up with him, but they fled from the men of Ai. The men of Ai killed thirty-six of them, pursued them from the gate, and crushed them on the slope. The hearts of the people melted and became like water.

    Joshua tore his clothes and fell on his face before God until evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they put dust on their heads. Joshua said: 
    <s>

  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord said to Joshua: 
    <s>
      Stand up! Why are you on your face? Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.

    <s>
      That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
    </s>
    <s>
      Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.

    <s>
      In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the Lord chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the Lord chooses shall come forward man by man.

    <s>
      Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the Lord and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!'

  </p>
  <p>
    Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. Then Joshua said to Achan, 
    <s>
      My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Achan replied, 
    <s>
      It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the Lord. Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. Joshua said, 
    <s>
      Why have you brought this trouble on us? The Lord will bring trouble on you today.
    </s>
    Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. Over Achan, they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger. 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒəˈwɑʃuə">Joshua</phoneme> 7:1.

  <p>
    Consider, Constantine, what kind of example you are going to perish by, unless you take care of yourself, and what eternal punishments you will suffer. Achan received such consequences for breaking the commandments; you can understand what you deserve here since you are an apostate. If he was punished so severely for having taken from the devoted things, how much more will you undoubtedly be punished more severely, having become a curse by denying the Son of God! We are wicked in your eyes, proud, stubborn, and insolent because we say to you, 
    <s>

    What new thing do we bishops do if we tell you what you deserve to hear? When we find that most holy Samuel, God's priest, said these words to King Saul, which you will read below: Sorrows and groans will be brought to you. Because you made the word of the Lord of no importance, the Lord will make you of no importance so that you will not reign.

    <s>First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse twenty-eight:</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    If he said these things to Saul because he ignored the commandments of the Lord, why do you think we could not freely say to you that you are sacrilegious, who, unless you turn yourself to God, will be reduced to nothing by Him? If we had not urged you, if we had not provoked you to make amends, you would rightly say that you are hated by us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Or when you hear us say, Repent, emperor, correct your ways so that you may find a place for mercy, I think you ought to consider that you are loved by us, cherished by us; and you, in that, curse us. Why do we remain in the apostolic faith, returning evil for good? We are not surprised if you, since you depart from the will of God and do not cease to fulfill the desire of the devil, ask God for good things to happen to you and wish to represent evil; since it is inherent in you to do evil, as you have made the transition from good to evil, that is, to the devil.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you persecute us who love you, wishing all the best for you, it is not surprising nor new, since even that prophet and priest of the Lord, Samuel, was persecuted by Saul. He was persecuted by him through whom he had been anointed as king, and whose prayers were directed to the Lord with constant supplication for the safety of this persecutor.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not believe that we, God's priests, grieve for you, because you have drunk so deeply of the darkness of errors, that you are thus slaying yourself, believe God speaking to Samuel for Saul: How long will you mourn for Saul? Behold, I expel him so that he will not reign over Israel.

    <s>First Samuel chapter fifteen, verse ten:</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    When Samuel, the priest, did these things for the safety of King Saul, yet Saul later persecuted Samuel, not knowing, poor man, that he was persecuting the prophet and priest of the Lord: so too you, not knowing what you are doing, persecute us, who wish you to please God, and love those who drag you with them to eternal death, to the perpetual offense of the Lord: you are indignant why you hear the truth, when you see that Samuel the priest of the Lord did not flatter the king's mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    What else was fitting for our predecessors or for us to do? Why do we tell you the truth, and you consider us proud? What have you heard from us? Surely that you are a murderer: if we lie, then we are rightly called offensive, then proud by you: but if we speak the truth, we are not offensive, but those who imitate those who, by not flattering those entrusted to them, but by healthily warning them, have deserved to be beloved by God.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the king of Israel sent to kill the prophet Elisha, if you had not read that Elisha said to those who were with him, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head, you would rightly accuse me of insults. The prophet, full of the Holy Spirit, called the king of Israel the son of a murderer, that is, the son of the devil, not because he called his carnal father a murderer, but the devil, whose son he showed himself to be by his actions, as you now reveal yourself to be, and he showed himself to be by persecuting God's servants, daring to kill the prophets of His mercy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The devil incites your hearts to do all these things. Understand that this is so by the Lord saying to the Jews in the Gospel: You are from the devil.
  </p>


    
        <p>
            You are of your father and you want to fulfill your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning. <sub alias="John">John</sub> 8:44.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Prophet, full of the Holy Spirit, calls the king of Israel a son of a murderer, that is, of the devil. And you think we are insulting you because we say you are a killer of God’s servants, a butcher of our bodies, a man of all wickedness, a destroyer of religion, a denier of the only Son of God? We say what we see you doing; we proclaim what you are. You call us insolent because we speak the truth about you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please tell me, why did the king of Israel deserve to hear such things from the Lord? Because you did what was right before me and followed my heart and soul, the sons of Ahab: your sons will sit on the throne of Israel up to the fourth generation. <sub alias="Second Kings">2 Kings</sub> 10:30. Tell me, why did he deserve to hear this from God? Because he spared God's enemies? Or because he pursued them with the sword? Or because he killed the idolatrous son of Ahab and his forty sons? He also had Queen Jezebel killed and thrown to the dogs, and he exterminated all the servants of Baal, along with all the priests and prophets of shame, with the sword, and destroyed their idols, pleasing God.
        </p>

        <p>
            What should we have done about you to avoid being accused of insulting you, whom we see following the ways of Ahab and Jezebel? It is not new for you to act against God, to attack His house, to persecute His priests, those through whom He warns you to seek repentance while there is still time, to pull yourself away from evil. Before you, there were others like you in sacrilege, serving idols and abandoning the God of their fathers.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the second book of Chronicles, King Amaziah of Judah was warned by God through a prophet not to take the sons of Israel, whom he had hired for a hundred thousand talents of silver, with him to war, because God had forsaken Israel since they had abandoned Him and served idols. The king obeyed the prophet’s words and believed the warning was from God.
        </p>

        <p>
            What did he do next? After he subdued his enemies, he thought to take their idols and bring them to his kingdom to worship them. When the man of God told him it was wrong to abandon God and worship the idols of the nations, the king fiercely persecuted the Lord’s prophet. You see, when you turn to apostasy, you always have the same spirit to persecute those who wish you well.
        </p>

        <p>
            And it happened, as the holy scripture says, after Amaziah struck down the Edomites, he brought the gods of Mount Seir, set them up as his gods, worshipped them, and offered sacrifices to them. The anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent a prophet, who said to him: Why have you sought the gods of the people who could not deliver their own people from your hand? And as the prophet spoke, Amaziah said to him: Have we made you the king’s counselor? Beware lest you be struck down. <sub alias="Second Chronicles">2 Chronicles</sub> 25:14, following. You see, Constantius, how foolish you become once you decide to serve the devil and forget the Almighty God, setting up idolatry in defiance of God.
        </p>

        <p>
            As he said: Have we made you the king’s counselor? Beware lest you be struck down. <sub alias="Second Chronicles">2 Chronicles</sub> 25:16; so do you say: Did I choose you as my counselors, saying that I should not do as I please, that I should not follow the path Arius followed? Do you not see how Arius perished and how divine justice was carried out upon him?
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, because you say we insult you, see how this man of God did not spare your fellow sacrilegious king, but after being told, Be silent lest you be struck down, said to him: I know that the Lord God will destroy you for doing this and not listening to my advice. In what way do you find us insolent? Isn’t it because we tell you: We know that unless you turn back to God, the Lord will condemn you to eternal punishment?
        </p>

    <s>And in the time when Amaziah turned away from the Lord, they conspired against him. And he fled from Jerusalem to Lachish, and they killed him in Lachish.</s>

    <s>You have read that King Uzziah was rebuked by the priests of the Lord for daring to do what was forbidden:</s>
    <s>And he entered, says the Scripture, into the temple of the Lord to offer incense on the altar; and Uzziah the priest entered after him, and with him the priests of the Lord, thirty valiant men, and they confronted King Uzziah, and said to him:</s>
    <s>It is not lawful for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have trespassed, and it will not be an honor for you from the Lord God.</s>
    <s>Do you say those priests of the Lord were insulting to that king or not?</s>
    <s>If they were not insulting, neither should we seem so to you, since you hear from us similar words to those he heard:</s>
    <s>It is not lawful for you, Constantius, to associate with the people of God as an Arian.</s>
    <s>It is not lawful for you, the promoter of the Arian heresy of idolatry, the denier of the only Son of God, to judge the priests of God, pretending to be a Christian when you are a forerunner of the Antichrist.</s>
    <s>It will not be good for you to remove the priests of God and appoint adversaries of His, namely your fellow sacrilegious.</s>
    <s>When you hear these things, you become angry with us; Uzziah the king was also angry with those priests of the Lord:</s>
    <s>But note that they, dedicated to God, maintained the honor of their position perpetually, while Uzziah was immediately stained with the eternal disgrace of leprosy.</s>
    <s>And Uzziah was angry, and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and leprosy appeared on his forehead in the sight of the priests in the house of the Lord.</s>
    <s>These things are so, and do you think that as a defiant transgressor, you do not incur offense with Him who has commanded us to perpetually represent the duties of His priests to His glory?</s>
    <s>What is this pride of ours, Constantius, or what arrogance?</s>
    <s>If, because we see you to be diseased, pestilent, indeed an Arian, we consider that you have the leprosy that Arius had, because we urge you to withdraw from the people of God, just as those priests of the Lord compelled Uzziah to leave the temple, because we thus compel you to give honor to God.</s>
    <s>For if the priests of God expelled Uzziah from the temple of God because they remembered the divine command that lepers were forbidden to enter the temple before purification, how much more should we justly expel you from the church of Christ, from the house of the Lord, because it is not lawful for a heretic to associate with Catholics, the insane with the sane, one filled with unclean spirits with those in whom the Spirit of God dwells!</s>
    <s>What kind of insult is this if the priests of the Lord, burning with that zeal which has always characterized our predecessors, say to you things that are beneficial to both our salvation and yours?</s>
    <s>You say Lucifer is impudent.</s>
    <s>Impudent because I urge you to reject the leprosy of Arius, and through this faith, which the most blessed apostles preached and which we hold (as you see), you have gained health for your mind, and you rejoice eternally that you have been delivered from the snares of the devil and sought by God.</s>
    <s>You, who accuse us of great arrogance, have found it written what King Josiah of Judah did to your fellow-sacrilegious, to those like you today, how he even persecuted many of them after death, burning their bones with fire.</s>

    <p>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying: Go, inquire of the Lord for me and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book to do according to all that is written concerning us. So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.</p>
    
    <p>And she said to them: Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Tell the man who sent you to me, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read; because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, and have provoked me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.</p>
    
    <p>But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall you say to him: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: Concerning the words which you have heard, because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard how I spoke against this place and its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the Lord. Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants. And they brought back word to the king.</p>
    
    <p>Then the king sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him <break time="500ms"/> <lang xml:lang="en-US">Second Kings chapter 23, verse 1</lang>. And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the Lord.</p>
    
    <p>And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people joined in the covenant.</p>
    
    <p>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel. And he deposed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the high places at the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, and to the constellations and all the host of heaven.</p>
    
    <p>And he brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron and beat it to dust and cast the dust of it upon the graves of the common people. And he broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes who were in the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the Asherah.</p>

        The tribes of Judah and he defiled the holy places where the priests of Agaba burned incense as far as Rasaba; and he tore down their high places. And furthermore:
    </p>
    <p>
        He defiled Phem which was in Cepenam (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɔrθ">Fourth</phoneme> Kings 23:10), because they led each of their sons and daughters into the fire of Moloch. The kings of Judah had placed statues at the entrance of the house of the Lord at the pasture, where he placed three horses, which he burned in Faradin and the fountain of the sun in the house of the Lord, which the kings of Israel had built for that high place of Baal, and to all the army of heaven. The sanctuaries were on the roofs of the upper buildings, which Ahaz, king of Judah, had made; and the sanctuaries which Manasseh made in the two buildings of the house of the Lord, the king tore them down and expelled them from there, and threw their ashes into the Kidron Valley. The high places which they had made facing Jerusalem, which was to the right of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, the idol, and Milcom, the idol of the Ammonites, the king defiled. He shattered the monuments and filled their places with human bones. The sanctuary which was in Bethel, the high place which Jeroboam, son of Nebat, had made, in which he had made Israel sin, and that high sanctuary he tore down, shattered its stones, and ground them into dust, and burned their groves. King Josiah returned, and saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. He took the bones from the tomb, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word that the man of God had spoken, when Jeroboam stood by the altar on the feast day.

        Do you recognize, Constantius, what was done by a king who was a worshipper of God? And we rebuke you for introducing idolatry into the church because we strike with words. Do you say that Lucifer insults you? If you had been a man of that time, you might have been killed by the sword, or, if you had already died, even your bones, as those of a sacrilegious person, would have been reduced to nothing by fire. He strikes the guilty of such a great crime with the sword, and should we not wound you even with words? Do you see meanwhile in this place too, in the city of God, in the house of the Lord, and in His temple, that you have introduced your sacrilegious kings and idolatry, which Josiah, the most devoted king to God, exterminated. Do you not think that you have undertaken this work against God? Do not say: If I were acting wrongly, God would have already taken vengeance on me; but rather, I beseech you to see that you are captured and held by the devil, living in his power, just like those kings whose work King Josiah pursued.

        Why do we abhor your blasphemies, why do we resist your wicked conspiracies, do we seem injurious to you? Just as to the Jews, whose imitators you are, the most holy prophets and the most blessed apostles seemed insulting and proud. In the book of the prophet Amos:
    </p>
    <p>
        And Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying: Amos conspires against me in the midst of the house of Israel; the land cannot bear all his words. Therefore, this is what Amos says: Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile from their land. Amaziah said to Amos: Go away, flee to the land of Judah, and there eat your bread, and there prophesy. But do not prophesy anymore at Bethel, because it is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom. Amos answered and said to Amaziah: I was not a prophet nor a prophet’s son, but I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamore trees. The Lord took me from following the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel. Now therefore hear the word of the Lord: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not preach against the house of Jacob. Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be measured and divided up, and you yourself will die in an unclean land, and Israel will surely go into exile from their native land.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you see these things done by him, who wanted to announce truth and correction to his erring people, why do you call us insolent, why do you call us insulting, because we tell you the truth about your errors? Because we do not listen to your voice saying, Do not believe as the patriarchs believed.
    </p>


  <p>
    Ah, prophets, apostles, and martyrs, but do you believe how Arius delivered it? In what matters are we found proud before you? Except in this, that we abhor your sacrileges and avoid your orders like swords and poisons.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not the first time we have done this: all those who have already pleased God, holding the faith we preach, did this. None of His servants feared to face death for God; none of His followers thought about the kinds of torments you tyrants inflict but kept His commands in mind. Thus, Tobias is found glorious and esteemed before the Lord, as he did not fear the edict of your king, but only the Almighty God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Believe what Tobias himself says: When Sennacherib, the king, fled from Judah because of the defense the Lord made against him, due to his blasphemies, and he killed many of the children of Israel in his rage: I was taking their bodies and burying them: and it was reported to the king that I was burying them, and he sought to kill me. I fled, and all my possessions were seized, and I had nothing left but my wife Anna and my son Tobias. And after forty-five days, his sons killed that king, and his son Arcedonossar reigned in his place there. And when I came home, my wife Anna and my son Tobias were restored to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the feast day of Pentecost, which is holy from the weeks, I had a good meal, and I reclined to eat. A table was set for me, and I saw many dishes. I said to my son Tobias: Go and bring any poor person you find among our captive brothers in Nineveh, who still have God in their whole heart; bring them, and let them eat this meal with me. I will wait for you, son, until you come. And Tobias went out to seek a poor captive among our brothers, and returned and said to me: Father. And I said: What is it, son? And he said to me: Behold, one of our nation has been strangled and thrown out.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I left my meal before tasting anything; I took him from the street to a place with me, until sunset, to bury him. I returned, washed, and ate my meal with mourning, remembering the words of the prophet Amos, which he spoke in Bethel, saying: Your feast days will turn into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I wept. And after sunset, I went and dug, and buried him. All my neighbors mocked me, saying: How does this man not fear? He has already been sought to be killed for this matter, and he fled, and now he begins again to bury the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, seeing that the servants of God have never feared your tyrannical cruelty, nor can they fear it now, but have kept and keep the Lord's commands, how do you dare to judge us as insolent? Surely because, with God's help, we tread your power like mud: this is not done by our strength, but granted by His mercy whom you deign to curse in us.
  </p>
  <p>
    God says to the prophet Ezekiel: Son of man, I am sending you to the house of Israel, because they have embittered Me, they and their fathers to this very day. And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: Whether they listen or fear, for they are a rebellious house, they shall know that a prophet has been among them. And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor tremble at their faces, for they are rebellious and will swarm around you, and you live among scorpions; do not fear their words, nor be terrified at their faces, for they are a rebellious house: and you shall speak My words to them, whether they listen or fear, for they are a rebellious house.
  </p>
  <p>
    We appear rebellious to you, just as this prophet dedicated to God alone appeared to those whose darkness you follow. Thus, Ezekiel seemed rebellious to your co-apostatizing Jews, and proud to the kings of Israel because he fulfilled the Lord's commands.
