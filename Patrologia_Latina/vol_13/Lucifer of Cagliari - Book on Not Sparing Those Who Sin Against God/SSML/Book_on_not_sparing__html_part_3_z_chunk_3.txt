    Look upon their pride: give strength to my widow's hand as I have thought, and strike their mouths with the lips of my persuasion in the leader, and the leader over his servant: crush his substance in the widow's hand. For your strength is not in multitude, nor your power, nor your gift in the strong: but you are the God of the humble, the help of the weak, the support of the infirm, the savior of the desperate, even the God of my father, and the God of Israel's inheritance. Lord, ruler of heaven and earth, creator of waters, king of all creation, hear my plea, give cunning and persuasion in their wound, and in their bruise, who planned hard things against your covenant and holy house, and the heights of Zion, and the house of the retention of your children over every nation and tribe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let them know that you are the God of all power and strength, and there is no other high defender of the race of Israel but you.
  </p>
  <p>
    What will your prudent mind consider in response to these things? Will you be able to say after this prayer poured out against the enemies of religion that we oppose you in a disordered manner, because we say to you, Either correct your wicked ways and do not take pleasure in the power of your empire, or recognize that you will come to nothing?
  </p>
  <p>
    What else do we, the servants of God, His priests of divine greatness, do today but what they did, whom we desire to be found imitators of? For I think it worthy not to abandon the people entrusted to us in this great persecution inflicted by you, but to encourage them, because indeed He who has us is able to deliver them from the hands of their enemies, that you are not to be feared as an enemy of God's house; it should be noted that you are nothing, for indeed our God and Lord, all-powerful, will bring everything to nothing.
  </p>


  
    <p>Let all your wicked efforts be against his house. What harm is being done to you by us? What insult is being inflicted on the Roman Emperor by the priests of the living God if they ask you to either obtain eternal life or tell you that because you have taken up arms against the house of God, unless you correct yourself, you will perish in great destruction?</p>
    <p>For what reason do we bring forth the destruction of all the enemies of God's house to you? Is it not so that either you, terrified by the fear of God, change yourself or, when you have made yourself punished forever, we can triumph safely on every side? Because neither can your blood be required from us by God, nor can we see the destruction of the adversaries of his church. Persist in your injustice, and you will find what follows such great merits.</p>
    <p>You say that Lucifer was inflated with pride because he tells you the truth. What would you have me do at this time, when you, a precursor of the antichrist, raised arms against the house of God to kill us? At the time when you stood as a denier of the only Son of God? Should I have kept quiet and let you, a wolf, come to devastate God's flock? Or do you think it was worthy that we, the pastors, should meet you with dry throats prepared to be devoured by us?</p>
    <p>It was enough for that woman, Judith, desirous to please God, to kill the enemy with her own hand, and should we not have resisted you with even a word as pastors instituted by the Lord? The Lord says in the Gospel according to John, chapter 10, verse 11: A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. A hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and runs away; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.</p>
    <p>What then should we have done to not appear disrespectful to you? We recognized you as a wolf; we saw you stretching out your hands to the Lord's sheep, and we observed you trying to tear apart all who call upon the Lord's name at one time. Would it have been appropriate to show ourselves as hired hands, not shepherds? To the blessed Peter, he says: Feed my lambs (John 21:16). And again: Feed my sheep (John 21:17).</p>
    <p>And you, coming as a wolf, want those found to be successors of the blessed Peter to act as hired hands? Those whom he had long promised through Jeremiah to his people, saying: And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding; and he did not say: I will give you Emperor Constantius, who can turn you into prey for the devil (Jeremiah 3:15).</p>
    <p>You say we act wrongly because we resist your sacrilege with the protection of God's power. Let us see what those, who remembered that no one should be feared except God, did at the time when your fellow tyrant Antiochus persecuted our religion. But first, you should know what that person, whom you resemble, wrote; so you may understand that those servants of God, whom we wish to be found among, resisted Antiochus's sacrilege, just as we resist you with God's favor.</p>
    <p>The Holy Scripture says in the First Book of Maccabees: And the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people and that each should give up his laws. And all the Gentiles accepted the command of the king; many even from Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and profaned the Sabbath. And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, directing them to follow customs foreign to their land, to forbid burnt offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings in the sanctuary, to profane Sabbaths and feasts, to defile the sanctuary and the priests, to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals, to leave their sons uncircumcised, and to defile themselves with every kind of impurity and abomination, so that they would forget the law and change all the ordinances. And whoever did not obey the command of the king was to die. According to all these words, he wrote to his whole kingdom and appointed inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to offer sacrifice city by city. Many of the people joined them, everyone who forsook the law, and they did evil in the land.</p>

  <p><w role="vernacular">Things going wrong in the land</w> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="wʌn">First</phoneme> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="mækəˈbiːz">Maccabees</phoneme> 1:43 and following. And below, same book, verse 57:</p>

  <p>And they built the abomination of desolation on the altar, and in the cities of Judah around, they constructed altars. At the entrances of houses and in the streets, they were burning incense. They found the books of the law, tore them up, and burned them with fire. Whoever was found with the book of the covenant, and anyone who consented to the law, the king's decree put them to death. In their power, they did these things to Israel, those who were found each month in the cities. On the twenty-fourth day of the month, they sacrificed on the altar that was on top of the altar. The women who had circumcised their sons, they killed according to the commandment. They hung the infants from their necks, and in their houses, those who had circumcised them.</p>

  <p>Many in Israel were resolute and strong in their resolve. They chose to die rather than be defiled by food or profane the holy covenant. Great anger came upon Israel during those days. And same book, chapter 2, verse 1:</p>

  <p>Matathias, son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, rose up from Jerusalem, and he had five sons. Further below, same book, verse 6:</p>

  <p>They saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and in Israel. He said: Woe is me, why have I been made to see the destruction of my people, the destruction of the holy city? They sat there while it was given into the hands of enemies, the sanctuary into the hands of strangers. Further below, same book, verse 11:</p>

  <p>All her adornment is taken away. She has become a slave from being free. Behold, our sanctuary, our beauty, and our glory are laid waste and polluted by the nations. Why should we still live? Matathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned greatly. Those sent by the king came, and they compelled apostasy in the city of Modein to sacrifice, and many Israelites joined them. Matathias and his sons gathered together. Those sent by the king answered and said to Matathias:</p>

  <p>You are a leader and noble and great in this city, and strengthened by sons. Now come first and do the king's commandment, as all the nations and the men of Judah and those left in Israel have done. You and your sons will be friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.</p>

  <p>Matathias answered in a loud voice and said:</p>

  <p>If all the nations that are in the king's house obey him, so that each one departs from the service of his fathers, and they have chosen to follow his commands, I and my sons will follow the covenant of our fathers. May the Lord be merciful to us. We will not forsake the law and its statutes. We will not listen to the word of the king, nor will we turn from our service to the right or to the left.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking these words, a Jewish man came forward in the sight of all to sacrifice in Modein according to the king's commandment. Matathias saw this, and was zealous, and his heart trembled. He brought forth his wrath according to judgment, and running to the altar, he killed him. The king's man who forced him to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and he destroyed the altar. He was zealous for the law, as Phinehas did to Zimri son of Salu. Matathias cried out in the city with a loud voice saying:</p>

  <p>Whoever is zealous for the covenant, follow me. He and his sons fled to the mountain, and they left whatever they had in the city.</p>

  <p>What have we done to you that you should say: Lucifer has insulted me? He killed the king's servant with the sword, and also him whom he saw of his people complying with the king's edict rather than God's. I, because I resist you and yours with words and say, I do not forsake the apostolic and evangelical faith, I believe as our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed. Therefore, I am guilty of insults before you. If you had been in the hands of Matathias, this zealous man of God, or in the hands of Phinehas, to whom God bore witness in the book of Numbers through Moses, and you attempted to live in the manner of foreigners, without a doubt they would have killed you with the sword.</p>


    <p>
        Because I wound that spirit of yours, soaked with the blood of Christians, with my words, you accuse me of insults. Why, emperor, do you not take revenge on me? Why do you not defend your honor and avenge yourself on a beggar? Why are you not acting sufficiently? Not because you are unwilling, but because you have not yet been given the power by Him, whose servant I am, to speak these words to you freely, which seem wrong to me according to your wicked deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you see that we have renounced all the wealth of your kingdom, and your father too, and promised that we will not abandon our faith under any circumstances, you will understand that we greatly pity you. Because while you usually devour those who displease you with the sword, you spare us. I believe it is for the sake of compassion, and we can feel this from your leniency. Indeed, I could gather from your excessive kindness that you have killed no one.
    </p>
    <p>
        You say, "He is proud." Why do I seem proud to you? Surely because you hear from me that you are doing what the enemies of God's religion have always done. It is my duty to tell you this, heretic. Or are you not a heretic? If you are a heretic, why do you accuse me of being injurious to you, when I do what God has commanded me to do?
    </p>
    <p>
        The most holy prophet Jeremiah spoke to God: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛrɪˌmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> 1:17: "But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them."
    </p>
    <p>
        Since this is so, and we are urged by the necessity of the duty imposed on us by God to say to you whatever God commands us to say, it remains that you either obey God's commands, convened by me, His servant and priest, or prove from the Holy Scriptures, perhaps because you are a king, that it is not lawful for me to address you in the name of the Lord to correct yourself. If you cannot prove to me that it is forbidden, but rather you begin to find that it is commanded, that I should rebuke, reprimand, and exhort you, and pray for you, and admonish you, and provoke you to please God, why do you say that I am insulting you?
    </p>
    <p>
        For indeed, He has given us, His priests, the power to rebuke, teach you who are entrusted to us, as He said: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛrɪˌmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> 1:17-19: "Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. Behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
        What were the things <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛrɪˌmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> said to the kings of Judah, its princes, and the people of the land? Surely these things because they had forsaken the Lord and sacrificed to foreign gods. These things you have done and are doing: you have abandoned the apostolic and evangelical faith, adopted the Arian heresy, and are forcing everyone to become idolaters, servants of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because you dare these things, you call proud those who desire to consult for your salvation. God says to <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛrɪˌmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> 1:17: "But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them."
    </p>
    <p>
        And you, Emperor Constantius, are indignant because we tell you, who are erring: Return to the way of salvation, abandon the error invented by Arius through the devil's instigation? God commands that He alone be feared; He has ordered that no one besides Him should be dreaded; and you have decreed things to be fulfilled that take away the fear of the Lord and make you feared?
    </p>
    <p>
        God says to <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛrɪˌmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> 1:18: "Behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you to deliver you, declares the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
        And do you think you can be feared by any of God's servants? Why do you call me arrogant, proud? Why do you call me insulting? Surely because I have found you, by your deeds, to be one of those about whom the blessed John says: First John 2:18: "You have heard that the Antichrist is coming; even now many antichrists have come."
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus you designate us as guilty of insults, as if we were the first to resist you introducing your idolatry into God's Church. You have read in the First Book of Maccabees: "And the man said..."
    </p>


  <p>
    In his last moments, he said: 
    
      If we all act as our brothers did, and do not fight against the nations for our lives and our laws, then they will quickly destroy us from the land.
    
    
      And they thought on that day, saying: 
      Whoever comes to fight us on the Sabbath, we will fight against him, and we will not all die as our brothers did in hiding.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      Then a strong assembly from Israel gathered to them, everyone who was willing to follow the law, and all who fled from evil joined them, and they became their strength.
    
    
      They established power and struck down sinners in their anger, and wicked men in their indignation, and the rest fled to the nations to save themselves.
    
    
      Matathias and his friends went around and destroyed the altars and circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel with strength, and they pursued the sons of pride, and their work prospered in their hands, and they recovered the law from the hands of the nations and kings, and they did not give power to the sinner.
    
    
      <sub alias="First Maccabees">1 Maccabees</sub> 2:40 and following.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      What does your mind, wounded by the poisons of Arius, think? 
      What can be conceived against our defense, your heart cut by the serpent's bites?
    
    
      You should notice that they acted in this way; should we have remained silent while you uttered blasphemies to the people divinely entrusted to us?
    
    
      And it says, Matathias and his friends went around (same verse 45), and destroyed the altars, and circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel with strength, and they pursued the sons of pride, and their work prospered in their hands, and they recovered the law from the hands of the nations and kings, and they did not give power to the sinner.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      When those who acted this way became most beloved by God, would it be right for us, by flattering you and running with you in your crime, to become most hated by God as you are?
    
    
      If we seem offensive to you because we cannot accept your idolatry, give one example, I ask, where a worshiper of God has spared an adversary of His religion.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      In the second book of Ezra, when opponents tried to prevent the rebuilding of the house, temple, and city in Jerusalem for the Lord, God of heaven prospered us, and we, His servants, will arise and build, but you have no share or claim in Jerusalem.
    
    
      <sub alias="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</sub> 2:20.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      And later, the opponents said: 
      Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble?
    
    
      <sub alias="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</sub> 4:2.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      And this is what His servant Ezra says to God: 
      Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from Your sight.
    
    
      <sub alias="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</sub> 4:4-5.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      What have we said about you like this? 
      The witness whom Ezra prayed to, and whom I also pray to, and the whole blessed church established throughout the world prays, that my wishes for you are to correct your errors and become one of us.
    
    
      Observe meanwhile how God's people neither feared their adversaries nor ceased praying against the enemies of God's house, so that the strength of the opponents of God's religion would be brought to nothing.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      So also the most holy Moses says in the song of Exodus to God: 
      Let fear and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they will be as still as a stone, till Your people pass by, O Lord, till the people you bought pass by.
    
    
      <sub alias="Exodus">Exodus</sub> 15:16.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    
      Such words they spoke to God for those committed to them: because we say to you, Either turn to God, or be certain that God will bring all your empty pride to nothing, we seem insolent to you.
    
    
      Observe still what the most holy Matathias, devoted to God, did after such illustrious deeds, and what he said to his sons at the end of his life, and see if we priests of God act rightly against you.
    
    
      The Holy Scripture says: 
      The days of Matathias' death approached, and he said to his sons: Now pride has been strengthened, and punishment, and the time...

<p>Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was counted to him as righteousness? Joseph, in his time of distress, kept the commandment, and became the lord of Egypt. Phinehas, our father, in his zeal, received the covenant of an eternal priesthood. Joshua, when he fulfilled the word, became a leader in Israel. Caleb, when he testified in the assembly, received an inheritance. David, in his mercy, obtained the throne of the kingdom forever. Elijah, in his zeal for the law, was taken up to heaven. Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael, believing, were delivered from the flame. Daniel, in his simplicity, was delivered from the mouth of the lions. And so, think through each generation, because all who hope in Him will not be weakened.</p>

<p>Do not fear the words of a sinful man, for his glory is in filth and worms. Today he is exalted; tomorrow he will not be found because he has returned to his earth, and his thoughts will perish. Children, be strong and prevail in the law, for in it you will be glorious. And look, your brother Simeon, I know he is a man of counsel; listen to him, he will be a father to you. And Judas Maccabeus, strong in body from his youth, will be your chief in the army, and he will fight the battle. You will bring to yourselves all those who follow the law and avenge the people, repay the nations, and focus on the precept of the law.</p>

<p>So when you see that he gave such commands to his children and ordered them to do what he himself also did, since he teaches that thus patriarchs, prophets, and all the righteous have pleased God, what did you want us to do, you dark one, so as not to appear rebellious? Should we have yielded to you, dead, while we are alive, servants of God, allies of the devil?</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>When you see this Mattathias saying to his children: <break time="200ms"/> And so think through each generation, because all who hope in Him will not be weakened. And do not fear the words of a sinful man, for his glory is in filth and worms: today he is exalted, and tomorrow he will not be found, because he has returned to his earth, and his thoughts will perish.</p>

<p>Should we appear injurious to you, should we spare you who destroy the house of God, you who are here today, and tomorrow will be in worms and filth, and should we bring this offense to God, by which we would deserve to be reduced to nothing with you? Know after this, what even the children of this most religious Mattathias did, if they feared the hand of your executioner, if they saw his army before their eyes, and not our Lord, whom we believe to be all-powerful, believing they stood against the enemy with all their strength.</p>

<p>And Judas, who was called Maccabeus, his son, rose up in his place. All his brothers helped him, and all who joined his father; and he fought the battle of Israel with joy. He expanded the glory of his people, wore armor like a giant, girded his war gear, and organized battles, protecting the camp with a sword. He became like a lion in his works, and like a lion's cub roaring for prey. He pursued the wicked, searched, and burned those who disturbed his people. The wicked were subdued by his fear, and all workers of iniquity were troubled, and salvation was made prosperous in his hand.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>He enraged many kings and delighted Jacob by his works, and his memory is in blessing forever. He walked through the cities of Judah, destroyed all the impious from it, and turned away anger from Israel. He was named to the farthest part of the land and gathered those who were perishing. Those so zealous against the enemies of the house of God; should we not have risen against you, lest we be called reckless? But you would rightly call me reckless if we had not rightly despised your sacrilegious decree. Look at what your wretched ones have commanded.</p>

            They will be leaders of the Jews against the apostles, and you will find that the blessed chorus of apostles did not act rashly but sought to advise both you and us.
        
        
            Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.
        
        
            A man who had been lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they placed daily at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms from those entering the temple.
        
        
            When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked for alms.
        
        
            Peter, looking intently at him with John, said, "Look at us."
        
        
            He looked at them, expecting to receive something from them.
        
        
            Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
        
        
            Taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.
        
        
            Leaping up, he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.
        
        
            All the people saw him walking and praising God, and they recognized that he was the one who used to sit asking for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.

            While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came up to them, annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
        
        
            They arrested them and put them in custody.
        
        
            <sub alias="Acts 4:13">Acts Chapter 4, verse 13</sub>:
        
        
            Seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and realizing that they were uneducated, ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
        
        
            They saw the man who had been healed standing with them and had nothing to say in opposition.
        
        
            When they had ordered them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying, "What shall we do with these men? For it is evident to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable sign has been done through them; we cannot deny it.
        
        
            But to prevent this from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak any more to anyone in this name."
        
        
            So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
        
        
            But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."
        
        
            And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people. For all were praising God for what had happened.
        
        
            The man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
        
        
            After being released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and elders had said to them.
        
        
            When they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, 'Why did the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed.'
        
        
            For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
        
        
            And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
        
        
            When they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
            If you have gathered all this, if you have thoroughly understood our entire prescription, will you still dare to call us rash?
        
        
            For you see that neither the blessed apostles yielded to the leaders of the Jews nor succumbed to their threats, but rather boldly carried out what was entrusted to them for the benefit of all.
        
    </p>


<p>
The people of God were not only unafraid of the threats of unbelievers, but they were also encouraged to speak confidently and defend the truth.
God deemed it worthy to grant His apostles this confidence.
So if this was done by the blessed apostles and the people dedicated to God, and they were not called stubborn or insolent by God for standing against His enemies, how can you call us proud, insolent, and disrespectful?
Though we are sinners, we still hold the holy faith of the apostles and those people who believed in the one Son of God.
</p>

<p>
Are we proud because we, like the apostles, disregard your voice?
Because we, as soldiers of Christ, consider your threats sacrilegious?
Because we preach the true Son of God, just as the most blessed apostles did?
To you, we seem as insolent, rude, and proud as the most holy apostles seemed to the Jews.
</p>

<p>
If the apostles were still alive today, you could say these things to them that you now dare to say to us.
We always found that your blasphemous scribes, Pharisees, leaders, and the high priest of the Jews commanded them not to teach or preach the one Son of God.
Yet, what did they do?
Take what is written, so your heart, fed by darkness, might be led to see the truth:
</p>

<p>
By the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were performed among the people; they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
But no one else dared to join them, though the people held them in high esteem.
More believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were added, so much so that they brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by, and they were healed.
Crowds from the neighboring cities of Jerusalem brought the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
</p>

<p>
The high priest and all his associates, who were members of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
They arrested the apostles and put them in public jail.
But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying, "Go, stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life."
</p>

<p>
When they heard this, they entered the temple courts at daybreak and began to teach.
When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there, so they went back and reported, "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."
At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles.
They did not use force because they feared that the people would stone them.
</p>

<p>
Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.
"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."
Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than human beings" (Acts 5:12).
</p>

<p>
If it is necessary to obey God and not humans, why do you call us stubborn and injurious when you see us obeying God's commands?
When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death, the scripture says (Acts 5:33).
You also keep us in custody and threaten to kill us because you are possessed by the same spirit that held and still holds the Jews captive.
If you are not held by this unclean spirit, why do you forbid us from confessing and preaching the one Son of God?
</p>

<p>
The angel of God led the apostles out of the prison of your desperate Jews: Go, teach in the temple.
</p>


  
    <p>
      You took the words of this life, and you thought that by throwing the priests of the Church of God into prison, we would stop preaching the word of life.

      Meanwhile, I ask you to answer, what is the difference between you and your fellow, whom the people of Sirmium call Photinus? 
      <break time="500ms"/>
      Please explain what the difference is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look, if back then the leaders, the high priest, and the whole council of the Jews had said to the apostles, "Do you want to bring this man's blood upon us?", Photinus also professes that the Son of God was just a man, saying he did not exist before the blessed Mary.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      This is also your profession, that before everything, that is, before the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything in them, he was the Son of God, but that he came from nothing and was a creature.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      What do you think is the difference between you and Paul of Samosata, or your fellow disciple, except that you say "before everything" and he says "after everything"?
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, you both share the same mindset of cruelty and disbelief, to the point of saying that God does not have a true Son.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      On the other hand, see how the holy church believes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, born of the Father, that is, from the substance of the Father, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, of one substance with the Father, which the Greeks call <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ho.moˈu.si.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>, through whom all things were made, whether in heaven or on earth, who for us humans and for our salvation came down, was incarnate, became man, suffered, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will come to judge the living and the dead.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      We also believe in the Holy Spirit.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      You see, this is the apostolic and evangelical faith, which always defends that the Son has reigned and will reign with the Father, and which acknowledges the perfect divine Trinity having one substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, what would be the difference between the church and you heretics or Jews if the blessed church did not believe this way?
      <break time="500ms"/>
      The holy faith, so that you may know what the Lord's church punishes in you, has said and says about you: Those who say, "There was a time when he was not," and "Before he was born, he was not," and that he was made from things that do not exist, or from another substance, saying that the Son of God is changeable and convertible, are anathematized by the Catholic and apostolic church.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      Because of this holy faith, the apostles were thrown into prison, received chains, and were tortured every hour, so they would not reveal the truth to the world, yet they wanted to preach even if they would be killed.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      And you say we are very stubborn people because we follow the apostles' way, because we tell you that you are wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      What did blessed John the Baptist do to Herod?
      <break time="500ms"/>
      Herod the tetrarch was rebuked by him for Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evil things Herod did, he added this above all: he locked John in prison. 
      <break time="500ms"/>
      Why did Herod lock John up? Certainly because his deeds were being criticized.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      So you, too, treat the servants of God this way, because we tell you: Don't do what you do, don't be a murderer, don't persecute the Lord's church, don't reject the apostolic faith, but instead accept the heretical one, don't introduce idolatry into the church.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      We think we say these things especially for your salvation, which if you refuse to heed, without a doubt you will seek eternal death for yourself, just as Herod did.
    </p>
    <p>
      For indeed, Herod could not harm John, whether by throwing him into prison or by killing him, since you see that John was a friend of God, and Herod was an enemy of God.
      <break time="500ms"/>
      Seeking to harm us, who desire to grant you eternal salvation, you persecute us by all means: but your authority's power will not be able to harm the servants of the only Son of God, because you will be found to be one of those whom he subjected to us believers, saying: "See, I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy".

        You who say that I speak the truth to you, do you want me to be found proud? Do you want me to be like the servant who received one talent and hid it, and then presented only that to his master? Because he did not multiply it through trade like his fellow servants, he deserved to lose even that one talent and to hear: <break time="500ms"/> “You wicked and lazy servant” <break time="500ms"/> (Matthew 25:26). Or do you want me to be like the one who presented a quantity multiplied ten times, to whom it was said: <break time="500ms"/> “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much.

Look in the Gospel to see what the Lord wants us to do, and stop calling us arrogant.

    <p>
        A certain rich man went to a distant country to receive a kingdom and then return.

You knew that I was a severe man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow. Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?” <break time="500ms"/> And he said to those who stood by: <break time="500ms"/> “Take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has ten talents.” <break time="500ms"/> I tell you, that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.

        If you do not change, you will be one of those who were ordered to be killed. Do I seem proud to you because I do not want you to be killed, because I desire that the quantity entrusted to me, which I want to multiply, also includes you? Because we wrestle with you in this way, we seem like enemies to you, we who constantly pray for your safety, following the command of the blessed apostle. Therefore, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth <break time="500ms"/> (First Timothy 2:1). We seem like enemies to you because we want you to come to the knowledge of the truth; you call me insulting because I speak what is beneficial for your and my salvation. But this assertion of yours, which claims I am wronging you, shows you to be unwise. For if you were wise, you would never have been found sacrilegious, and having been corrected by the authority of sacred writings, you would have already shown yourself to be a changed man. But now, because you are unwise, you say to the bishop who tells you: <break time="500ms"/> “Emperor, take care of your salvation, for you are weighed down by great burdens of your sins,” <break time="500ms"/> you say, <break time="500ms"/> “You are insulting me.”

      In the Acts of the Apostles, I read that the blessed apostles were taken by those with whom you share not only disbelief but also cruelty, and they were commanded not to teach in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

    But let us see what the scripture says about whether the apostles obeyed the enemies of God's only Son or whether they zealously fulfilled their mission. 

      It says, 
      
        "They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and let them go. The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah"

    When the holy scripture relates that the blessed apostles acted in this way, should we remain silent to the leaders of God's churches while you, a blasphemer, a murderer, and a destroyer of God's religion, strengthen your heresy? 
    
      The holy scripture speaks of the apostles not fearing the beatings or threats from the sons of perdition, but always teaching. 
    
    Should we then, because of your ephemeral rule, be broken in spirit, allowing you to fulfill all your wicked plans? 

      You consider us defiant because we tell you the truth. 
      Similarly, your fellow blasphemers judged the most blessed Stephen because he said to them: 
      
        "You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him—you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it"
