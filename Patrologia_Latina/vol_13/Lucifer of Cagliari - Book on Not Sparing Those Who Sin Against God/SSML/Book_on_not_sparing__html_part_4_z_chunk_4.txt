    When the Jews heard this, were they justly or unjustly enraged against the holy martyr Stephen? If unjustly, then you too are unjust in your anger against those who wish to save you. 
    <s>
      Notice that you are standing against God's church just as the Jews did then and still do now; you are stiff-necked, uncircumcised in heart and ears. 
    </s>
    Just as they could not endure hearing the truth and rushed to kill God's servant, you too rush to kill us who speak the plain and manifest truth to you.

        Thus, you, with your heart raging and your teeth gnashing, are against us for no other reason except that we call you a persecutor of God’s house, a destroyer of God’s religion, a shedder of the blood of Christ’s servants, and justly call you a sacrilegious person, a blasphemer, a heretic, indeed one who fights against the apostolic and evangelical faith. 
        We do nothing hateful to God by saying these things about you, in the manner I am confronting you, acting on what we understand you to be. 
        We have found others like you acting similarly against the glorious ones. 
        While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        <s>'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'</s> 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them off. 
        So, being sent by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 
        When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of the Lord in the synagogues of the Jews. 
        They had John as their assistant. 
        When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus, which means 'Son of Jesus,' who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. 
        He summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
        But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said,
        <break time="500ms"/>
        <s>'You son of the devil, full of all deceit and fraud, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord? 
        Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time.'</s> 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        Immediately, mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand. 
        Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. 
        We believe this testimony will not cause you to say, 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        <s>'Lucifer insults me, the emperor.'</s> 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        What does it matter to me what you are, when I say to you these things that you have heard from the apostle, who was recognized as a false prophet? 
        In the same way, I consider you, Emperor Constantius, to be like the Jewish false prophet Bar-Jesus, as the glorious Paul and Barnabas encountered. 
        Just as he was found to be contrary to the name of the Lord, so are you; just as he resisted the truth, so do you; just as he did not want people to believe in God’s only Son, so do you. 
        When you hear that the proconsul was an intelligent man, eager to be instructed by the blessed apostles to find the way of truth, and that the one you imitate resisted the apostles to prevent the proconsul from believing in God’s Son, it is clear that you are like that Jewish false prophet. 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        Furthermore, when the Holy Scripture says that Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, delivered that rebuke, you must understand that the Jewish false prophet was filled with an unclean spirit. 
        Just as he, driven by an opposing spirit, contradicted, so you, driven by the adversary’s instigation, are found to resist. 
        You must then consider yourself no different from Bar-Jesus, the Jewish false prophet. 
        Therefore, since you understand yourself to be another Bar-Jesus, the Jewish false prophet, whenever your sacrilegious mouth declares,
        <break time="500ms"/>
        <s>'God does not have a true Son,'</s> 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        do not be offended if we say to you what was said by the apostle to your predecessor, the Jewish false prophet:
        <break time="500ms"/>
        <s>'Full of all deceit and fraud, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?'</s> 
        <break time="500ms"/>
        If you are troubled by these words, which were said to him whose path you follow to death, you show yourself to be very foolish, wanting to be what that Jewish false prophet was, yet not wanting to be called by the names he was called. 
        Again, I urge and implore you, as I advise, to look out for yourself, lest eternal punishment befall you.
    


<p>
He deserved to be blinded because he tried to resist. Look at the evils that can come to a murderer, a sacrilegious person, and a destroyer of God's religion, both in this life and forever. Take in these things that can show you that we are not insolent but truthful.
</p>
<p>
The seven glorious brothers resisted Antiochus, just as we now resist you. You read what the fourth brother said to your tormentor, who calls me insolent because I tell you that unless you turn to God, you will perish forever. He said: "It is better to be given over to death by men, expecting hope from God to be resurrected again by him. For you, there will be no resurrection to life" <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɛkənd">Second</phoneme> Book of Maccabees 7:14. 
</p>
<p>
If you hear from us, tyrant, that you will not receive the resurrection to life if you remain in this disbelief, that you will be resurrected not to rest but to eternal punishment, where is the insult? The fifth brother, when he was brought forward and tormented, said to the king: "You have power among men because you are mortal, you do what you want. But do not think that our race has been abandoned by God; wait patiently, and you will see how great his power is, how it will torment you and your descendants" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɛkənd">Second</phoneme> Book of Maccabees 7:16. 
</p>
<p>
Do you think that because a servant of God spoke with such firmness against your fellow tyrant, he was injurious? Would you judge a worshiper of God as a worshiper of the devil? Would you deny that he spoke the truth and was not arrogant? You should not judge me as insolent because I tell you that we are not abandoned by God, for whom I endure these things, while you, unless corrected, will come to nothing with your mortal glory.
</p>
<p>
Consider what the sixth brother said, and you will find that we resist your stormy attacks just as they did: "Do not be mistaken in vain" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɛkənd">Second</phoneme> Book of Maccabees 7:18; for we suffer these things because of our own sins, offending our God, and we have received a deserved warning. But do not think you will escape unpunished when you have tried to fight against God.
</p>
<p>
My letters of modesty and books written in plain language prove that I have often said that our sins have brought us into the hands of you, the forerunner of the Antichrist. Still, you fight against God, and therefore, unless you take care, you will indeed be like that Antiochus, destined for eternal punishment, while the Lord will be merciful to us.
</p>
<p>
You are upset because we reveal who you are and what you deserve, to be trampled on by all the soldiers of Christ as the shadow of the Antichrist: who, you ask, could trample on me? Those whom you imprison, deprive of their heritage, exile, torture, and kill for confessing they are Christians. You think we are arrogant because we pray for all entrusted to us to trample on the devil's head and reduce your sacrilegious attempts to nothing through the power of their sufferings for Christ, the only Son of God.
</p>
<p>
Is that glorious mother of the seven brothers also insolent to you because she encouraged her sons to conquer your predecessor Antiochus, saying: "I do not know how you appeared in my womb, nor did I give you breath and life, nor did I shape each of your limbs. But indeed, the Creator of the world, who formed human birth and examines all origins, will, with mercy, give you back both spirit and life, as you now despise yourselves for his laws" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɛkənd">Second</phoneme> Book of Maccabees 7:22. This religious mother did not cease to say these things to her sons, loving them strongly until she saw all of them killed.

<p>
Should we, whom the prophet foretold would be shepherds for his flock, saying, "And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɛrəˈmaɪə">Jeremiah</phoneme> 3:15, have remained silent, not to appear insolent to you, the rabid wolf coming to slaughter God's sheep? The woman so inflamed her sons' hearts with love for God that she gained victories through their deaths by the sword. And you think it was fitting for us to tell Christ's soldiers: Do not take up arms against Constantius, the devil's minion, do not resist the temple of all demons?
</p>


    <p>
        Do whatever he commands. But what is this stubbornness of ours, if we strive to fulfill the duty assigned to us by God, if we are found to be imitators of that woman? You want to please the devil, whose work you are found to celebrate; we do not. You want to be most acceptable to God by acting against this. If you are still moved by why you are called what you are by us, even consider what was proclaimed by that seventh son of this woman against Antiochus:
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>
            But Antiochus, thinking he was being scorned, despised the voice that rebuked him. When the youngest son was still left, not only did he encourage him with words, but he also swore that he would make him rich and happy, transfer him from his homeland, and give him necessary things.

            But since the young man did not heed these promises, he called his mother and urged her to counsel the boy for his salvation.

        <s>
            After many exhortations, she agreed to persuade her son. So, leaning towards him, she mocked the cruel tyrant and said in her native language: "Son, have pity on me who carried you in my womb for ten months, nursed you for three years, raised you, and brought you to this age. I beg you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth, and everything in them, and realize that God made them out of nothing, and similarly, he made the human race."

        <s>
            If he said to Antiochus, "You who have become the inventor of all evil against the Hebrews, will not escape the hand of God," we have said and are saying the same to you, for no one has ever been a greater persecutor of the sacred law of God than you, and you will not escape the hand of God.

  <p>They have fallen, but you will face the just punishment for your pride from the judgment of God (Deuteronomy 32:36). You hear from us that we are ready to be killed by you, the executioner, for God, just as you have already killed our brothers.</p>
  <p>We are prepared to surrender our souls and bodies for Jesus Christ, the true and only Son of God. We trust in His tireless mercy, believing that He will soon rescue His entire flock from you, a ravenous wolf, and from you, a rabid dog. If you do not change your ways, you will always face torment.</p>
  <p>What more can I say to you, whether through scripture or in person? I want you to refute me, you tyrant of our time. If I called you an executioner, so did that righteous young man and his mother call Antiochus, your counterpart.</p>
  <p>If I called you the inventor of all wickedness and said that you cannot escape the hand of God, if I called you wicked and the most heinous among men because you will not escape the judgment of the all-seeing, all-powerful God, and you will pay the just penalties in His judgment, all these things have already been said by that religious young man to your colleague Antiochus.</p>
  <p>You call me insulting because you see names worthy of your deeds applied to you, the same names our predecessors, worshippers of the living God, have applied to your fellow tyrants.</p>
  <p>The blessed apostle Peter says, <break time="500ms"/> "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world" (First Peter 5:8).</p>
  <p>If you think I am insulting because you hear that what you are doing is evil, how am I found resisting the devil according to the apostle's command?</p>
  <p>Behold, this dragon, leading you to all drunkenness with his wine, has sent it into the entire flock of God, so that using your royal aid, you make everyone drunk as you are: insane, mad, and demented.</p>
  <p>Who has made you as drunk as the vine of Sodom and the vineyard of Gomorrah, so that you do not see yourself as fornicating as the Jews have fornicated? In what, I say, will we resist the devil if we do not confront you, through whom he has armed himself to devour us?</p>
  <p>If the sober do not tell the drunk, the healthy do not tell the sick, the whole do not tell the wounded, the seeing do not tell the blind, the standing do not tell the fallen, the pious do not tell the impious, the sheep of God do not tell the ravenous wolf, the most merciful and loving do not tell the cruel executioner, the savage murderer, those who glorify God do not tell the blasphemer, the worshippers of God do not tell the sacrilegious, Christians do not tell the heretical Arian: Depart, servant of our adversary, give honor to God?</p>
  <p>How will we resist the devil if we spare you, the net of his will, if your drunkenness, that is insanity, is not declared to all, if finally you are not revealed to the whole world for your cruelty towards us? From these actions, it is clear that you are not a servant of Christ but plainly a slave to him who, like a roaring lion, is against us.</p>
  <p>Therefore, we seem petulant to you because we tell you that you have become drunk with that wine, making you as mad as those who are led to complete drunkenness; those to whom and for whom it is said: <break time="500ms"/> "They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?" (Deuteronomy 32:5).</p>
  <p>And further: <break time="500ms"/> "Jacob drank the wine, and ate, and was satisfied, and kicked: he waxed fat, and grew thick, and wide, and he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation" (Deuteronomy 32:14).</p>
  <p>"They provoked me to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they me to anger. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. Of the Rock that begat thee, thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee" (Deuteronomy 32:17-18).</p>
  <p>Thus, your betrayal of God and following of idolatry is proven by your treachery which you proclaim. <break time="500ms"/> But now I believe I must bring you to see that it is not us, but you, for whom I say these things, who are injurious and petulant.</p>


  <p>
    And the proud, but truthful, fearing no one except God. The most blessed Apostle John, dearest, says, <s>"Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out."</s> <sub alias="First John">1 John</sub> 4:1.
  </p>
  <p>
    You clearly appear to me to be one of these false prophets. For by denying the only Son of God, you declare that you have nothing but the spirit of the antichrist in your sacrilegious mouth. Hence, it follows that you cannot listen to us speaking of the divine eternity of the only Son of God, as the spirit that remains in you is of the antichrist, who cannot endure it and does not want to be cast out of you, but desires to remain in you until it sees you taken to those places where it will be forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    It grieves because it loses you, its most faithful delight, who obeys all its desires. Dearest, he says, <s>"Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God; because many false prophets have gone into the world. By this, you will understand the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit that destroys Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist."</s> <sub alias="First John">1 John</sub> 4:3.
  </p>
  <p>
    And further down: <s>"They are from the world; therefore, they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them. We, however, are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this, we understand the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."</s> <sub alias="First John">1 John</sub> 4:6.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is clear, Constantius, that you carry the spirit of the antichrist and are driven by the spirit of error. Just as those who said that the only Son of God did not take human form from the womb of the blessed Virgin, who did not believe he was incarnate and made man, are proven to have the spirit of error and are called antichrists, so you Arians, by denying that the only Son of God was truly born of the Father, that is, from the substance of the Father, reject that he is the true Son and that he has always reigned with the Father, never having been without the Father, nor the Father without the Son, and by refusing to believe that they share one deity, show that you are filled with the spirit of the antichrist.
  </p>
  <p>
    For no one who has the Spirit of God can say, <s>"There was a time when he was not,"</s> and <s>"He was made from nothing,"</s> about the only Son of God, believing instead that he has reigned with the Father from the beginning and will reign without end. Therefore, when you say that he is not the true Son of God, when finally you attempt to destroy the belief that he is of the same substance with the Father, as the Greeks say, and as we Romans say, you show yourselves to be among those false prophets and are pronounced among the antichrists.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should not judge me as insulting because I call you driven by an unclean spirit, or a forerunner of the antichrist; for it is your own mouth that reveals this about you. For no one who has the Spirit of God can assert what you Arians claim, nor can any of your various sects of heretics. You deny that God has a true Son, say he is adopted, and believe that by not understanding, you are not one of those antichrists that John spoke of. It is clear that you are led by an opposing spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, we do not believe you when you say about the Son, <s>"He was made from nothing."</s> For we know that such claims can only come from the spirit of false prophets, the forerunner of the antichrist, a minion and slave of demons. We could not believe you when you said this, given that the Holy Spirit has spoken through the prophets about the only Son of God, declaring him to be the true Son of God, eternal and co-eternal with the Father, never without the Son, and the Father never without the Son, and the blessed apostles reported the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, who was in the prophets, also remained in the apostles, and because the Holy Paraclete Spirit is in the Church of God, and you are placed outside the Church of God, not remaining in you, you are proven to have the spirit of the antichrist; an unclean spirit that does not want you to see what we are bringing forward.
  </p>


  <p>
    Your heretical order is enveloped in the darkness of errors, shrouded in blind fog, so you cannot escape its traps. You judge us to be disrespectful because we declare what we see you to be.

  <p>
    Behold, even in the Gospel according to Matthew, I find that the Lord said: "Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves" (Matthew 10:16); you seem to me to be one of those wolves, indeed the most ferocious of all wolves roaring against God's flock.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For who, denying the only Son of God, would not rejoice and boast when they see you ravaging Christ's flock in such a way? I consider you one of those unbelievers, one of those faithless ones to whom it is said: "Brood of vipers, how can you speak good things when you are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things" (Matthew 12:34). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the things you speak, Constantine, are good, then you must have a good treasure. I am insolent because I tell you that darkness dwells in your heart; hence, from your very dark senses, you dare to bring forth unclean and dark things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Behold, if you listen to what was said to blessed Peter by the Lord, you will undoubtedly call me insolent. The most holy Matthew says: "While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, 'Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.' Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed Him. But Jesus said to him, 'Friend, why have you come?' Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. But Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'" (Matthew 26:47).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must call me insolent when you hear that if you use the sword, you will perish by the sword. Or have you not used the sword against Christians? If you have killed no one with the sword, if you have pursued no one to death, why would a confession that God's only Son is the true Son, or holding to apostolic and evangelical faith, or refusing to be Arian, not cause you to perish by the sword? For you hear it said to blessed Peter by God's only Son, that everyone who uses the sword will perish by the sword.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am insolent because I told you: Christians are not allowed to kill, because it is worthy for Christians to suffer, not to commit wrongs. You should not kill those claiming to be Christians for Christ. These are the commands the Lord has given us; if they are kept, then we will continue to be Christians. Instead, you deem it worthy to persecute His servants with the sword, and we can no longer call you a Christian, but clearly a robber or a gladiator.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meanwhile, since we have recited how your fellow, Judas Iscariot, betrayed the Lord, let us thoroughly examine the causes of his sacrilege and yours in this place, and you will find that you and Judas Iscariot are one. He betrayed the Lord to the Jews because he did not believe, just as your contemporary Sirmium, who was called and is called unworthy Photinus, does not now believe. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You betrayed Him, indeed to the whole world, so that all might deny His divinity. Who among you is greater in wickedness? I believe it is you. For every sin against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come (Matthew 12:32). And you have become the betrayer of His divinity, making it so that all could deny Him.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As far as you are concerned, you have betrayed Him, about whom you have also written books, and you have placed preachers of your kind intention everywhere. So that all might deny that He is truly the Son of God, you have caused the apostolic and evangelical faith described at Nicaea to be judged against you heretics.

        <s>You call me stubborn because</s>
        <s>I say you are a deceitful worker, a pseudo-Christian.</s>
        <s>These words were not first uttered by me against you.</s>
        <s>For you hear the blessed Apostle designate you as a deceitful worker, a pseudo-apostle: for such pseudo-apostles are deceitful workers, transforming themselves.</s>
    </p>


    
        <p>
            In the apostles of Christ. And no wonder: for even Satan transforms himself as an angel of light. So it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, you see me as arrogant, because I say, knowing you from your actions, that you are one of those whom the Holy Spirit, through the apostle, has foretold would become like this. If you are not a deceitful worker, prove me wrong. For I know that you pretend to be a Christian, while being an Arian, and you want to make us all servants of the one whose ally you are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Indeed, we see in some cases that you feign piety, while you practice all impiety towards us Christians. If you are not a deceitful worker, how did you, pretending peace, try to destroy every church of God, to dissolve the peace given to it through the only Son? For I could not have the peace of the Lord from then on, since I did what you commanded me against the Lord's command. From then on, indeed, I would have started to deny the only Son of God, as you deny.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you were not transformed into the apostles of Christ, who, as if all the care of the church truly belongs to you, are so concerned, evidently, that no Catholic bishop may govern any church anywhere, and that no one may be left who can confess himself a Christian. You remove Catholic bishops, ordain heretics, and write horrendous threats, lest a sedition arise. Surely, anyone who does not know better, seeing you do these things, would think you are a Christian. But we, who know, being instructed by the blessed apostle, that Satan has transformed himself as an angel of light, who does all these things against the holy church through you, cannot wonder if we see you as his minister, if we see you transformed as a minister of righteousness, urging righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
            If only you would turn to this so that you could be believed to be a servant of God, so that you could be judged and understood as a Christian. How often have we told you that you could not be a denier of God's only Son unless you were full of the opposing spirit, and you are accustomed to say that we wrong you. Although I have already proven this matter in many places, with unclean spirits instigating your hearts, you come against the family of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take what happened in the Acts of the Apostles. As we were going to prayer, a certain girl with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling. She followed Paul and us, and cried out saying, "These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation." And she did this for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities, and brought them to the magistrates, saying, "These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city; and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe." Then the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods. And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. But at midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the keeper of the prison, awakening from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners had fled. But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, "Do yourself no harm, for we are all here." Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. And he brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
        </p>
    


  <p>
    <s>
      What must I do to be saved?

      They answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you and your household will be saved."

      They then spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his house.

      So, when that spirit of Python heard the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, it immediately fled from his house, stirring up the entire city against the preachers of the Majesty of the only Son of God, just as those impure spirits have stirred you and yours against us, His servants.

    Jews and Greeks, testifying repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. And now, behold, I am bound by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit warns me in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me in Jerusalem. But I consider my life worth nothing to me, as long as I may finish my course and the ministry of the word that I received from the Lord, to testify the gospel of the grace of God to Jews and Greeks. And now I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom of the Lord Jesus, will no longer see my face. Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men, for I did not hesitate to proclaim to you the whole will of God.

    Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of the Lord, which He bought with His own blood. I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number, men will arise and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. Therefore, be on your guard, remembering that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears. 

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Seeing these commands of the apostle, what do you order me to do, so as not to appear disrespectful to you? Do you order me to be silent and allow you, one of those designated savage wolves, to ravage God's flock in any way? We see you wolves, whom the Holy Spirit has chosen to reveal through the apostle, trying to seize the entire flock of God; and we, the overseers whom the Holy Spirit has appointed to shepherd God's church, are told by the blessed apostle that we must spare you the wolf, we must respect your royal diadem, your earrings and right-hand bracelets, and honor the distinguished garments you consider important, while despising the Creator and Ruler of all things? 

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Who is more foolish than you to say: I suffer injury from Lucifer, the emperor from a poor man? You do not even deign to say from a bishop, because you have been recognized as a wolf and have deserved rejection. You thought to burden me with such envy as to claim that a servant of God was disrespectful to you, the emperor. If you think we are injurious, hear what the blessed Paul replied to the chief priest who forbade him to preach the only Son of God. The scripture says that Paul, looking intently at the council, said: Brothers, I have lived my life with a clear conscience before God up to this day. But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near him to strike Paul on the mouth. Then Paul said to him: God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Therefore, if the sacred law cannot judge the blessed Paul as disrespectful because he said this to an unjust judge, neither can you justly call me arrogant for speaking the truth to you and telling you what you are. You designate me guilty of disrespect, but please tell me, to whom can you complain about me? If to God, how can you complain to Him whom you do not know? How can you, being a stranger to His house? If you complain to yourself, what can a man do, who can harm God's servants in no way? If you torture us, we are more cared for; if you torment us, we are more refreshed; if you kill us, we live more. You say I am disrespectful because I dare to call you the precursor of the antichrist. If your actions do not show you to be this, consider with great care the book of the most holy prophet Daniel, and you will find yourself to be one of those foretold persecutors of God's religion.

    In the first year of Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans, Daniel had a dream, and visions of his head while on his bed, and he wrote down the dream: I, Daniel, saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. And four great beasts came up out of the sea, each different from the other. The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. And it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man's heart was given to it. And behold, another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.
  


  <p>
    Then he said to him: Get up and eat a lot of meat. After this beast, I saw another one, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back and four heads, and it was given authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    After this, I saw a fourth beast, terrifying, amazing, and extremely strong: it had iron teeth that devoured and crushed, and whatever was left, it trampled with its feet. This beast was greater than the other beasts I had seen before, and it had ten horns. As I was looking at the horns, another smaller horn came up among them, and three of the earlier horns were uprooted before it: it had human eyes and a mouth speaking great things. I watched until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat: his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like pure wool, and his throne was flames of fire, its wheels burning fire. A river of fire flowed out before him, thousands upon thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
  </p>
  <p>
    I watched then because of the great words the horn was speaking; I watched until the beast was killed and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. The dominion of the other beasts was taken away, but they were allowed to live for a period of time. I continued watching in the visions of the night, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. He was given authority, glory, and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
    My spirit was troubled within me, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. I approached one of those standing there and asked him the meaning of all this. So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: 'The four great beasts are four kings that will rise from the earth. But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.'
