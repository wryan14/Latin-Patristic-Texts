    Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be handed over to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.'

    I should have only included the part that describes who you are like among the beasts through your actions: but so you would know you will be in that hell where that beast was cast, as the glorious Daniel mentions, unless you correct yourself, and how those you persecute will reign forever in the kingdom of the Lord, we include all this so that you might reflect on it. Also, I decided to apply the entire revelation to this, so you could at least satisfy yourself by reading it. Tyrants who persecute the religion of God have been called beasts; I wish to clear myself in front of your conscience poisoned by Arian dogma, before you who are not religious.
  </p>


  <p>
    But not a destroyer of religion as you claim, nor am I being insulting by calling you a wild beast or savage creature, since you see that you are called such names according to your actions. Moreover, it is clear that you bear the resemblance of that fourth beast and desire to fulfill what it was foretold to accomplish. It is written about the antichrist, to whom you are similar or are judged to be:
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>"He will speak words against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High God, and will intend to change times and law, and the saints will be given into his hand."</s>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <s>(Daniel 7:25)</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    You have already done and are doing these things. For when you say, <s>"The Son of God is not the true God, but was made out of nothing,"</s> you speak words against God. Christians, while we assert the divinity of the Father and His only Son, and you attack this defense of ours, claiming that the Son once was not and was made out of nothing, surely you prove yourself either to be the antichrist or at least his precursor. For you cannot be understood as anything else but either the precursor of the antichrist or the antichrist himself, who dares to call the apostolic and evangelical faith heretical and tries to vindicate your blasphemy as the catholic faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    You feel wronged because we call you a beast: you are found to be devising to change the faith, which is to make us believe differently from how the patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and martyrs believed, but you have established that we should believe as your lost Arius did. And you say it is not right to call you a beast, when the most holy prophet said you would act this way? You, Constantius, are no less in unbelief than the antichrist: for you do not cease devouring the servants of God with iron teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
    What more is there to say? The antichrist will do nothing except deny the only Son of God: this is what your most unclean mind, fed by stupidity, does. But no matter how fiercely you rage, your times will pass, and those will come in which you will see yourself, unless you reconsider, placed in that fiery river, and then you will see those whom you have fiercely persecuted because they do not want to perish with you. Not in the place of torment where you will be, but with the holy angels, always giving thanks and praises to God, while you are in that flaming liquid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not be surprised that the glorious Daniel designated you as a beast, when the blessed Paul said about your fellow Cretans:
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>"Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."</s>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <s>(Titus 1:12)</s>

  <p>
    And further: <s>"Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth."</s>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <s>(Titus 1:13)</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence we bishops seem injurious to you because we rebuke and reprimand you, asking why you dared to turn away from the truth, why you wanted to cling to the blasphemies and commandments of men, forsaking God's commandments, and why, finally, you have abandoned God and embraced idolatry. Hence, I seem to be your enemy because I wish you to walk according to the apostle's precept and not according to the commands of Arius and the Jews.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against our most just allegations, seeing yourself overcome by the truth, you are accustomed to say: <s>"The sacred scriptures command kings and all those living in high positions to be subject to you; and you dare to hurl such things at me, Lucifer?"</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    You see these things, you understand such commands that require you to be honored; but those that command you to act, you pretend not to know, those that the Lord commands to obey the priests, those that urge you to exhibit yourself as one among all your fellow servants, not claiming to be superior to anyone if you wish to be found a servant of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blessed apostle said to Titus: <s>"Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you."</s>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <s>(Titus 2:15)</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a Christian, because you are one of those for whom he said: <s>"Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you,"</s> surely you should listen to me rebuking you with all authority, not despise me. Then you will be a Christian if you do not despise me urging you to persevere as a Christian.
  </p>


  <p>
    If you despise him, you will no longer be found among Christians. Because if you were a Christian, you wouldn't despise the one whom God has appointed to instruct His people, and the one to whom the Apostle said: 
    <s>
      "Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you" 
      <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtaɪtəs">Titus</phoneme> 
      <sub alias="chapter">2</sub>:<sub alias="verse">15</sub>.
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For what do I urge you, if not to avoid being a murderer, to not persecute the house of God? To stop torturing, proscribing, deporting, imprisoning, slaughtering, and variously destroying and killing those whom you see as Christians? To stop blaspheming the only Son of God? To accept the apostolic faith, which you call heretical, this faith of ours which the bishops described against you and all heretics at Nicaea? To be a believer like us, and to reject the idolatry taught by your master Arius? To proclaim yourself as a Christian, not an Arian? To stop falsely accusing God's priests of crimes? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is my correction, this is my rebuke. The Apostle tells me to rebuke you with all authority, and you say: 
    <s>
      "Lucifer wrongs me." 
      And you do not say: 
      "God's priest admonishes and urges me according to the commands of the sacred law, so that I may lead a life most acceptable to God."
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For as you say we owe you obedience, know that we recognize ourselves as debtors not only to you, but to all those in high positions representing us in their duties. For the Apostle says: 
    <s>
      "Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people. For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life" 
      <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtaɪtəs">Titus</phoneme> 
      <sub alias="chapter">3</sub>:<sub alias="verses">1-7</sub>.
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Therefore, he reminds us that we ought to be engaged in good works, not evil. If it is a good work to kill someone absent, to kill someone proclaiming his innocence without a hearing, to punish with you the one whom we know to be innocent, neglecting all regard for mercy; if it is a good work to deny the only Son of God, if it is a work acceptable to God to abandon the apostolic faith and accept heresy, you would rightly say that I am acting against the commands of the sacred scriptures. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I add that the Apostle mentioned those rulers and authorities who had not yet believed in the only Son of God; certainly, by our humility and gentleness, and long patience in adversity, and utmost obedience in fitting matters, they would be provoked to believe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But if you, because you are an emperor, pretending to be one of us, force us to abandon God and accept idolatry, should we comply with you, lest the commands of the Apostle seem to have been overlooked? And yet you, who pretend to be a Christian, try to make Christians what you are yourself, that is, apostates. You, who still remain foolish and unbelieving in your malice, in which the Apostle says we also were before knowledge, before receiving the sacred apostolic faith.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What were we to do but fulfill what was lawful? Or when you, a blasphemous murderer, say: 
    <s>
      "Kill those who believe in the only Son of God, be persecutors of His house with me, deny Him with me, reject the apostolic faith, accept my heresy, of which I have been a lover with all the strength of my heart"; 
      who is more unfortunate than you, that no one would avoid you? Wouldn't one flee from you, recognizing you as a temple of demons, urging these things? 
    </s>
    Because you hear this, you say: 
    <s>
      "I suffer wrong from Lucifer, a miserable man, and indeed an emperor"; 
      your blasphemous and defiled speech does not follow: 
      "I hear what I deserve from Lucifer, the priest of the Lord."
    </s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To the Galatians, the chosen vessel says, 
    <s>
      "I am astonished that you are so quickly..."
    </s>
  </p>


<p>Quickly you are turning away from Him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel, which is not another, except there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>And do you think you can be judged by me as anything other than accursed? When I find you preaching differently than what the blessed apostles handed down. Therefore, when you hear from me that I consider you accursed for preaching differently than the apostles, if you call me injurious, know you are lying, carrying a human trait; if indeed you see me saying you are accursed because the blessed apostle has already called you accursed.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>You judge me injurious because I call you foolish: but how can I rightly be called injurious by you when it is clear I speak the truth, saying you are foolish? If the Galatians hear, "O foolish Galatians," from the blessed apostle, why do you think you should not be called foolish?</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>For if they were called foolish because they obeyed false brothers, listening to the suggestions of your serpents, thinking they had to keep the Sabbaths and circumcision, how much more rightly are you called foolish, who have denied the only Son of God! Because I say to you, "Rescue yourself from the rabid Arian dogs," you say I am injurious; but perhaps you do not know that the deniers of the only Son of God are called dogs, fat bulls, sons of iniquity, an adulterous and whorish seed, sons of perdition, and an evil seed.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>If you flee being called thus by God, hear through Isaiah himself speaking to your fellow blasphemers, the Jews: "Come here, sons of iniquity, an adulterous and whorish seed. In whom have you delighted, and against whom have you opened your mouth and stuck out your tongue? Are you not children of perdition, an evil seed?"</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>And in another place: "See that all are blind, they have not known understanding, all are mute dogs, unable to bark, dreaming in bed, loving to sleep: and greedy dogs, unable to be satisfied, and they are wicked without understanding, following all their ways."</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>Who are these to whom these things are said, or for whom are they said? Surely those whom the only Son of God, through the mouth of David, accuses in Psalm 22, saying: "Many bulls have surrounded me; fat bulls have encircled me. They opened their mouths against me, like a lion tearing and roaring."</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>And further down: "Many dogs have surrounded me, the assembly of the wicked has enclosed me. They pierced my hands and my feet."</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>When you see your teachers in sacrilege called calves, fat bulls, and dogs, you cannot judge me injurious for calling you by the names they were called and are called: for you are not less in wickedness, daring to say: "There was a time when He was not," and "He was made out of nothing," so that you should not be called by fitting names.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>But do you wish not to be called by these names? Change your ways, correct your errors, as the blessed Paul and the others from that faithless people corrected theirs. Because I say to you: Rescue yourself from the assembly of the wicked, you think I am injurious.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>Why? Surely because I profess to be a Christian, because I do not want to abandon God and follow your idolatry. We are not the first to be called injurious and arrogant by you sacrilegious people; for all those who resisted the fatal edicts of your tyrants were also called thus. To pass over others, I will return again to King Antiochus in the conclusion of the speech.</p>
<break time="500ms"/>
<p>Did he judge those who resisted him as injurious and arrogant or not? Without a doubt, because he considered them injurious and arrogant, he persecuted those dedicated to God with such cruelty unto death.</p>


  <p>
    So, it remains for you to see what else Antiochus did to those whom you already know about. If you can rightly say that they were proud and disrespectful to Antiochus, then you can say the same about us. For we suffer from you the same things they suffered from Antiochus. We proclaim our faith and religion just as they did. We profess to serve the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, just as they confessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scripture says, the king sent an old Athenian to compel the Jews to abandon their ancestral laws and to stop using God's laws, to defile the temple in Jerusalem and rename it as the temple of Jupiter Olympius, and to rename the temple in Garizim according to the people who lived there, as the temple of Jupiter Hospitaller. The worst and most grievous of all evils was the uprising. For the temple was filled with revelries of the Gentiles, who consorted with prostitutes, and women approached the holy places, bringing in things that were not allowed. The altar was filled with unlawful things prohibited by the laws. Neither were the Sabbaths celebrated nor the holy days of the ancestors observed.
  </p>
  <p>
    And further, they were led by bitter necessity every single month on the king’s birthday. It was a pity. When the sacred rites of Bacchus were celebrated, they were compelled to go around with ivy wreaths for Bacchus. A decree went out to the nearby Greek cities, suggested by the Ptolemies, to implement the same measures against the Jews and to show no mercy to those who refused to adopt Greek customs, to kill them. So he came to witness the misery. Two women were reported to have circumcised their sons, and their infants were hung from their breasts. After being publicly paraded through the city, they were thrown down from the wall. Others nearby ran to caves to secretly celebrate the Sabbath. When this was discovered, they were burned because they feared to seek help on the glorious holy day.
  </p>
  <p>
    What do you think the worshipers of God should have done then? Should they have pleased God or Antiochus? If you think they should not have pleased Antiochus, then neither should we please you. Because although you use different means, you still desire to take us away from God and join us to the devil, just as he wanted them to. This cruelty is carried out by you, being so fierce and unjust to those who resist your accursed decree. Therefore, as often said, you should regret your error, acknowledging yourself as a murderer and blasphemer, and return to the house of God. Otherwise, you will blame yourself when you begin to see yourself in the place where all your fellow tyrants are now.
