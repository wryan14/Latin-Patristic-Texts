Three letters to Symprionian the Novatian
by Pacian

Letter One On the Catholic Name. Pacianus to his brother Sympronian, greetings.

If your intention is not material but spiritual, as I believe, my lord, that makes you examine the faith of the Catholic truth from us: you should have first indicated which different beliefs you were following.
You, who seem to be starting far from the stream, were not holding the source and origin of the principal Church: you should have revealed what reason primarily separated you from the unity of our body.
For those parts that need healing must be exposed.
Now, with the letter's heart closed, so to speak, we do not see which parts of us should be treated first.
For such great heresies have arisen from the Christian head, that even the list of their names is immense.
To pass over the heretics of the Jews, like Dositheus the Samaritan, the Sadducees, and Pharisees: how many have emerged in the times of the apostles, it is too long to count: Simon the magician, Menander, Nicholas, and others whom obscure fame hides.
Why, in later times, Ebion, Apelles, Marcion, Valentinus, and Cerdon: not long after them, the Cataphrygians and Novatians, to pass over the new swarms?
Who then must I first refute in writing?
The very names, if you wish, a sheet will not contain: except that from your writings, condemning repentance everywhere, you declare that you agree with the Phrygians.
But in these very cases, my dearest lord, the error is so manifold and diverse, that not only this one thing in them which is against repentance, but rather many Lernaean heads must be cut off.
They rely on many authorities: for I believe, even the Greek Blastus is theirs.
Theodotus and Praxeas have also taught your people.
Those very Phrygians who falsely claim to be inspired by Leucius, boast that they were instructed by Proculus.
Following Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla, what multiple controversies they have stirred about the Paschal day, about the Paraclete, about the apostles, about the prophets: and many other things, like this one about the Catholic name and the pardon of repentance.

Why, if we wish to discuss all these matters, a present guide is needed. If I were to explain only these things you write about and it was not enough, still, because we must answer those who are curious, for your sake, we will briefly discuss the matters you have written about.
If you want to know more about our beliefs, you should express your own views more clearly. By asking obscurely, you do not make us unsure whether you are asking questions or provoking us.
Meanwhile, concerning the present matters, above all, I ask you not to lend authority to error because, as you say, there is no one in the whole world who could refute you or persuade you otherwise. For even if we are unskilled, the Spirit of God is most skilled. And if we are unfaithful, God is faithful, who cannot deny Himself Second Epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, verse 13.
Moreover, it was not permitted to argue with the priests of God for a long time. The Apostle says, "We have no such custom, nor do the churches of God" First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 16.
After one correction Epistle to Titus, chapter 3, verse 10, as you know, the contentious person is rejected. But who can persuade someone against their will? Therefore, brother, it is not their fault but yours if no one has persuaded you of what was best. For even today, it is in your power to disregard our writings if you prefer to refute them rather than accept them.
Moreover, many resisted both the Lord Himself and His apostles; and the truth could not persuade anyone unless they agreed with it by their own faith. Thus, sir, we did not write with the confidence that we could persuade someone who resists, but with the faith that we would not deny the path of good peace to someone who is willing. If that is your mind and heart, there is no struggle with the Catholic name.
For if our people achieve this through God, there is no need to question it, given divine authority. If through man, once it is usurped, it must be exposed. Then, if it is a good name, it does not receive hatred; if bad, it lacks envy.
I hear that the Novatians are named after Novatus or Novatian. Yet I accuse the sect, not the name. Nor did anyone object to the name Montanus or the Phrygians.

But, you may say, during the time of the apostles, no one was called Catholic. Fine, let it be so, or at least allow that. When heresies arose after the apostles and tried to tear apart and divide the dove of God and the queen with various names, didn't the apostolic people need a name to distinguish their unity from the errors of those who sought to divide the undefiled virgin of God?
Wasn't it proper for the main body to be identified with its own name? If I were to enter a populous city today and find Marcionites, Apollinarians, Cataphrygians, Novatians, and others who call themselves Christians, how would I recognize the congregation of my people if it were not called Catholic?
Come now, who gave such names to these other groups? Why does each city, each nation, have its own designation? If someone questions the name Catholic, they wouldn't know the reason for their own name if I asked where it came from. Surely, it is not borrowed from man, something that has endured through so many ages. This Catholic name does not echo Marcion, Apelles, or Montanus, nor does it take heretics as its authors.
The Holy Spirit has taught many of us, whom God sent from heaven to the apostles as the Paraclete and teacher. Reason, as Paul says, and honesty, and, as he says, nature itself, have taught many things.
What? Do not the apostolic men, the first priests, and the most blessed martyr and teacher Cyprian, carry authority for us? Do we wish to teach the teacher? Are we wiser than him, and are we inflamed by the spirit of the flesh against him, whom noble blood and the crown of the most glorious passion produced as a witness of the eternal God?
What of the many priests of those times, whom one peace, along with Cyprian, unified throughout the whole world? What of the many aged bishops, many martyrs, many confessors? Come now. If they were not suitable authors by claiming this name, will we be suitable by denying it? And will our authority overshadow that of the fathers? Will the sanctity of the saints yield to our correction, and will apostolic antiquity be erased by the decaying times filled with vices?

And yet, don't worry, brother: Christian is my name, but Catholic is my surname. The former identifies me; the latter describes me. By this, I am approved; by that, I am signified.
If we need to explain the meaning of the word Catholic, derived from the Greek and translated into Roman: Catholic means where there is unity, or as the more learned believe, the obedience of all to the commandments of God.
Hence the Apostle says: "If you are obedient in everything" Second Corinthians 2:9.
And again: "For just as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one, many will be made righteous" Romans 5:19.
Therefore, one who is Catholic is also obedient. One who is obedient is also a Christian: thus, a Catholic is a Christian.
Therefore, our people are distinguished from heretics when they are called Catholic.
If Catholic means unity everywhere, as the elders believe, David himself indicates this by saying: "The queen stood in gold of Ophir, in clothing interwoven with gold" Psalm 45:9, meaning one in all.
And in the Song of Songs, the Bridegroom says: "My dove is one, my perfect one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen one of her who bore her" Song of Solomon 6:9.
And again: "With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king" Psalm 45:15.
And still: "The maidens, without number" Song of Solomon 6:8.
Therefore, one in all, and one above all. If you seek the reason for the name, it becomes clear.
As for penance, may God grant that it is not necessary for any of the faithful. May no one, after the help of the sacred font, fall into the pit of death. May priests not be forced to offer delayed consolation or teach it, lest they open a path to sin while comforting the sinner with remedies.
But we reveal this indulgence of our God to the wretched, not the blessed, not before sin, but for the uncovering of sins. It is not medicine for the healthy, but we announce it to those who are ill.

If spiritual evils have no power over those who are baptized, if the deceit of the serpent, which first led humans astray and imprinted so many marks of damnation on their descendants, has left the world, if we have already begun to reign, if no sin sneaks into our eyes, hands, or minds, then let this gift of God be discarded, let His help be rejected, let there be no confession, no groans heard; let proud righteousness scorn every remedy.
But if the Lord has provided these things for His people; if He has given rewards to those who stand and remedies to those who fall, then stop accusing divine mercy, or erasing so many titles of heavenly clemency with the objection of severity, or forbidding the Lord’s free gifts with unyielding harshness.
We do not grant these from our own. Turn to me, says the Lord, with fasting, weeping, and mourning; tear your hearts Joel chapter 2, verse 12. And again: Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts, and let them turn to the Lord, and they will receive mercy Isaiah chapter 45, verse 7. Likewise, the Prophet cries out in this way: For God is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and who relents from sending calamity Joel chapter 2, verse 13.
Does the serpent have such long-lasting venom, and Christ does not have a remedy? The devil kills in the world, and Christ cannot help here? Certainly, be reluctant to sin, but do not be reluctant to repent. Be ashamed to be in danger, but do not be ashamed to be saved. Who would snatch a plank from a shipwrecked person to prevent them from escaping? Who would begrudge healing wounds? Does not David say: Every night I flood my bed with tears, I drench my couch with weeping Psalm chapter 6, verse 7. And again: I acknowledge my sin, and I did not cover my iniquity Psalm chapter 32, verse 5. And still: I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin Psalm chapter 32, verse 5. Did not the Prophet respond for Bathsheba’s repentance after the guilt of murder and adultery: The Lord has taken away your sin Second Samuel chapter 12, verse 13. Did not confession free the Babylonian king after so many acts of idolatry?

And what does the Lord say? Is it not that the one who falls will rise again, and the one who turns away will return?
(Jeremiah 8:4)
What do those parables of the Lord mean?
The woman finds the coin and rejoices; the shepherd brings back the wandering sheep; the father runs to meet the returning son, who had squandered all his wealth and lived with prostitutes and sinners, and he explains to the jealous brother, "This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found."
(Luke 15:32)
What about the man wounded on the road, passed by the Levite and the priest? Is he not cared for?
Consider what the Spirit says to the churches:
(Revelation 2)
He accuses the Ephesians of forsaking their first love; charges the Thyatirans with adultery; rebukes the Sardians for their inactivity, the Pergamons for teaching errors; and criticizes the Laodiceans for their wealth, yet invites all to repentance with amends.
What does the Apostle say to the Corinthians when he says:
"I fear that when I come, I may find many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin, and debauchery in which they have indulged."
(Second Corinthians 12:21)
And again, to the Galatians:
"If someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently, but watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."
(Galatians 6:1)
Does the head of the household only keep silver and gold vessels? Does he not also honor clay and wooden ones, some of which are repaired and restored?
Now I rejoice, says the Apostle, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance.
(Second Corinthians 7:9)
And again:
"Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret."
(Second Corinthians 7:10)
But one could not repent. No one commands labor without reward:
"The worker deserves his wages."
(Matthew 10:10; Luke 10:7)
God never threatens a penitent unless He forgives the penitent. You might say, only God can do this. That's true, but what He does through His priests is His power.

What does He say to the Apostles? "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19; John 20:23). Why would He say this if they were not allowed to bind and loose people? Or is this permission only for the Apostles? If so, is it also only for them to baptize, give the Holy Spirit, and cleanse the sins of the nations? Because all of this was commanded to the Apostles alone.
But if the power to loosen bonds and administer the sacraments is given in one place, then it has either been passed down to us through the form and power of the Apostles, or none of it has been revoked. "I laid the foundation, but someone else builds on it" (First Corinthians 3:10). Therefore, those who build on it, build on what the Apostles' teaching has founded. Hence, even bishops are called Apostles, as Paul explains about Epaphroditus: "My brother and fellow worker, but your apostle" (Philippians 2:25).
If the power of washing and chrism, and the greater and far-reaching charisms, descends from the bishops, then the right to bind and loose also comes down to them. Even if we claim this right rashly because of our sins, God will not deny it to those who hold the chair of the Apostles and are holy; He even granted them the name of His Only Son.
I would write more, brother, if I were not pressed by the urgency of the returning messenger, and if I did not wish to reserve more detailed remarks for you in person or for a full confession of your purpose. Let no one despise the bishop because of human consideration. Remember that the Apostle Peter called our Lord the Bishop; "But now you have returned," he said, "to the Bishop and Shepherd of your souls" (First Peter 2:25). What will be denied to the bishop, in whom the name of God works? He will indeed give an account if he does anything wrongly or judges corruptly and impiously. Nor is it prejudged against God that the works of a bad builder should be undone; meanwhile, if that administration is holy, it continues as an assistant to God's works.

Look, the Apostle writes to the laypeople: If you give something to anyone, I also give it.
For what I have given, if I have given anything, I have given it for you in the presence of Christ; so that it is not possessed by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
(2 Corinthians 2:10-11)
If the Apostle says he has given what the laypeople give, how can what the bishop has done be rejected?
Therefore, neither baptism, nor the forgiveness of sins, nor the renewal of the body is granted by his holy authority; because nothing is commanded by personal usurpation, and all of it flows from apostolic right.
I know, brother, that this same permission for repentance is not given to everyone indiscriminately, nor is it granted before either the interpretation of the divine will or perhaps a visitation occurs.
With great weight and great balance, after many groans and the shedding of tears, after the prayers of the whole church, true repentance is not denied in such a way that no one prejudges Christ, the Judge.
If you write more openly about what you think, brother, you will be instructed more fully.

Letter Two About the Letters of Sympronian.
Bishop Pacianus greets his brother Sympronian.

In addressing a lengthy question, I'll aim to be as brief as possible.
Brother, I won't respond to your disguised verbal attacks with malice.
We are commanded to pray for those who persecute us and to bless those who curse us.
Matthew 5:44.
Deceit is like a fox, but force is like a lion: both very far from human behavior.
But deceit is more deserving of hatred.
When you believe you can do more harm, you ask as if ignorant; when you think you are teaching, you pretend to be learning.
The old Pharisees called the Lord "Rabbi" when they posed the riddles of the law; they called Him "Master" when they claimed all teaching for themselves.
Whatever you do, brother, you will know it all simply from me.
I prefer to be seen as unskillful rather than malicious.
I'd rather be judged foolish than cunning.
So, before I explain the reason for our faith (which troubles you), let's address a few points from your letters that you raised for discussion.
II. You say you were refreshed by my earlier letters, yet immediately add that I responded with bitterness.
If bitter things refresh you, I don't know what sweet things would do; unless, like in medicine, the bitter often heals more than the sweet.
But please, review my letters to see if they were sprinkled with any gall, any prideful or unpleasant responses.
You say I mentioned many heresies that no one asked about.
Well, what does it matter to you if you weren't a heretic?
When you raised a question about our faith and said you wanted to be taught, I wrote that ignorance has many causes, especially in your case, so you could reveal them, and I wouldn't have to struggle with addressing many issues.
I responded calmly about the Catholic name.
For I said it doesn't matter to anyone else what someone else is called.
And if you demanded the force of the name, whatever marvelous thing it might be, whether one among all or one above all, or what I haven't said before, the son of the king, that is, the Christian people.
Certainly, it wasn't given to us to fall through such great ages.

I'm glad that even though you've preferred others, you still agree with us about the name. What if you denied it? Nature would cry out. Or if you still doubt, let's be silent. Both of us, as we are called, will be what we are by the testimony of the ancient name.
However, if you insist more stubbornly, see that a virtuous man might shout at you:
Why do you ask my name? It is wonderful
(Judges 13:18). Then you added indeed, from where Catholics draw this name, it should not be reproached; for neither should it be imputed to the Valentinians if they are named from Valentinus, nor to the Phrygians if from Phrygia, nor to the Novatians if from Novatian.
Here you are deeply disturbed, and as if pricked by a sharp point, you rise up; for in anger you shout:
Does it harm the holy man Cyprian
that his people have an apostate name, or Capitoline, or Syndrean? You insult; and behold, I am not moved. Were we called by any of these names? Ask the world, brother, and the whole course of years; whether this name has clung to us, or whether Cyprian's people were called anything other than Catholic.
I have never heard any of these names. Now see, if anyone could be called by a name that he does not know was imposed on him. What then? These are curses, not names; and the curses of the angry, the curses of the insolent. As many names as you want, I can call you too, if it were allowed to be angry. Do you call Cyprian holy, and his people apostate? How? If the root is holy, so are the branches (Romans 11:16).
Am I an apostate, or is it Novatus? Novatus, I say, betrayed his father, abandoned the Church, and his wife gave birth in vain? Am I an apostate, or is it Novatian, whom a letter falsely called a bishop in his absence; who, with no one consecrating him, took the seat draped in linen? But these things later: meanwhile, tell me yourselves what you are called. Do you deny that the Novatians are called after Novatian? Whatever name you impose, it will always stick.
Search all the annals (if it seems proper), and trust all the ages: you will answer Christian. When I inquire about the sect, you will not deny being Novatian.

But I'm not blaming your Novatian name, which you've concealed so many times with evasive words and hidden in some secret place.
Just admit it: there's no crime in the name.
Why do you hide when asked repeatedly?
Why are you ashamed of the name?
When you first wrote, I thought you were a Cataphrygian.
Do you confess in the second letter? Do you envy my name and avoid your own?
See what causes the shame that makes you avoid what it is called.
What are you criticizing and doing?
As if we had come to a rhetorician, or as if we should handle art or explain verses of Virgil?
When I named several heretics, I added: And those whom obscure fame conceals.
And where do you think this comes from, a verse of Virgil, if you did not know Virgil at all?
But I deny that I placed the verse in order.
For I said: Those whom obscure fame conceals; as it is customary for speakers to say something from the abundance of human speech that has been said before.
But you repeated the verse in its order and structure.
Did you love Virgil so much that you thought it wrong to break his verse?
And yet I learned it from a young age.
Is it surprising if I fell into what I knew?
Brother, you show such effort, now reading what you once blushed to read from others?
You should accuse a Latin-speaking person educated in Latin as much as you would accuse a Greek-speaking Greek, a Parthian-speaking Parthian, or a Punic-speaking Phoenician: the Medes, Egyptians, and Hebrews have their own languages according to the abundance of the Lord, who modulated it into 120 tongues.
A bishop spoke a poetic verse.
What about the Apostle Paul?
Does he feel ashamed when he spoke and confirmed that Athenian verse?
For in the Acts of the Apostles it says; For some of your own poets have said: For we are also his offspring: forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God (Acts 17:28-29).
And again he said to Titus: One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons (Titus 1:12-13).
And he adds: This testimony is true.
Thus we sin by example: we are not rhetoricians, but we believe in any voice, the abundance of God.

Latium, Egypt, Athens, Thracians, Arabs, Spaniards all acknowledge God; the Holy Spirit understands every language.
Why do you say, "I will protect my writings with lively cedar because of the decayed enemies of the Muses."?
Which Muses do you mean? Are you referring to those who invented letters and wrote papers that moths pursued?
Tell me, brother, did the Muses discover letters? Is not everything through the Lord, and everything from God?
Besides those 120 languages, was there another language of the Muses? Hesiod lied about that on Helicon, but for the study of the Athenians, for whom, as the Apostle says, "They spent their time doing nothing but talking" (Acts 17:21).
We, with the Apostle as our witness (First Corinthians 14:10, 18), embrace all kinds of voices, all types of languages inspired by God.
However, I forgive you, brother, if you presume anything from your author, and you combine Novatian's philosophy, through which he suffered shipwreck in religion, with Hesiod's authority.
Nevertheless, you should remember the Apostle, who said: "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy" (Colossians 2:8).
How is it that you think Catholics should be blamed if kings or empires have ever persecuted you?
Conversely, should it not be blamed on you whenever Catholics endured the persecution of kings? Even our pagan princes persecuted us.
You endured the hatred of Christians? But our people suffered even more.
Let the one who did this consider with what mind, with what spirit; whether he sought peace or discord.
But even if some of them sinned, does it nullify the faith of God (Romans 3:3)? Do not think it was our complaint.
But when Christian princes began to rise through our faith; the princes themselves, favoring the Catholic, that is, their own side, were moved by their own grief; unless perhaps Daniel should be blamed for being avenged by Darius; or the most holy woman Esther, when the king's leader was killed for her; or the three youths, because for their sake after the trial by flames, the Babylonian king threatened the profane and unbelievers.
Did not Peter confound Simon, with the judge as a witness?

Isn't Paul, with the support of Sergius, the one who blinds Elymas? He would have been vindicated in Jerusalem if he had held onto any faith. Don't you know that the powers themselves serve the innocent and work for the good of the holy fathers?
As the Apostle says: Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it, through the Lord: For he is God's servant to you for good (Romans 13:3, 4).
Yet, I have not complained about anyone, nor have I sought revenge. I don't think the Novatians hinder me, whose smallness and weakness I could boast about if I wished. Look, no one accuses your people to the emperor, and you are alone. However, we all must stand before the judgment seat of God (Romans 14:10; Second Corinthians 5:19). One thing I know, the Novatians would complain if their cause were pleasing to any princes.
You say it is more useful to conquer than to please. But those led by the desire to conquer advance through contention. The Apostle indeed says: If anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God (First Corinthians 9:16).
On the contrary, concerning the effort to please: I try to please everyone in every way, not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved (First Corinthians 10:33).
But you, while thinking of your own advantage and not those of your brothers, prefer to crush by conquering rather than revive by pleasing. To overcome evil with good is reasonable; however, to want to win in any matter is insane presumption. This is not from Apostolic law, but from Greek customs, where it is thought that all the practices of the Lacedaemonians are driven by the desire to conquer.
Even that filthy pig and insane tiger, what else do they want but to conquer rather than to please? You write that you are free; and thus contentious things delight you. But I, occupied with Catholic matters, received your letters after nearly thirty days, and they were repeated after another forty.
You say I am angry; far from it. I believe I am stirred up like a bee, which sometimes defends honey with its sting. But review the letters from both sides; you will see whether we are filling the page with stings or flowers.

Of course, the Apostle, as mentioned in Titus 1:11, points out those who need to be silenced. But pay attention. We, like doves, fight more with words than with teeth. If only it were true that you wanted to be taught! I would already be offering you the Holy Spirit's anointing oils with my own hands. Do you love me? I know I have not hurt you. But you would truly love me if you did not think differently and kindly approached my work.
Are you surprised that I like the letters of Cyprian? Why wouldn't I admire the blessed martyr and Catholic priest? You bring up Novatian to me? I hear he was a philosopher of his time; I am not surprised he strayed from the Church of the living God. I recognize that he abandoned the root of the old law and the source of the old people, envied Cornelius, sided with Novatus's madness, and became a bishop without legitimate consecration. Thus, he was not truly made through the letters of those pretending to be Confessors, who would tear apart the members of one mother.
I will prove all this to you, brother, through the confession of your own people and their writings. This philosopher of yours, trying to establish his own wisdom, as the Apostle says in Romans 10:3, is not subject to the wisdom of God; because through his own wisdom, the world did not recognize God's wisdom.
You think that Novatian suffered and that Cyprian said something about it. My opponent came before me; see how clearly I respond. Novatian never suffered martyrdom, nor is this heard or read from the words of the most blessed Cyprian. You have his letters in which he often mentions Cornelius, the bishop of the city whom Novatian envied at that time, resisting hostile leaders, often confessing and being harassed, made leader of many Confessors and many Martyrs, and gloriously crowned with them while Novatian was still alive and even carefree. Indeed, he left the Church of Christ so as not to be burdened by the labor of confession. Driven by envy, he could not endure Cornelius's episcopate; then he committed himself to Novatus, mocked by the letters of a few. Cyprian's letters will teach you all these things about Novatian.

Moreover, even if Novatian suffered something, he was not killed; and even if he was killed, he was not crowned. Why not? Because he was outside the peace of the Church, outside harmony, outside that mother of which a martyr must be a part.
Listen to the Apostle:
"And if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing" (First Corinthians 13:2-3).
Cyprian, however, suffered in harmony with everyone, in common peace, among the group of Confessors, and often confessed during repeated persecutions. He was tormented with much laceration and finally was given the saving chalice. This was to be crowned.
Therefore, let Novatian keep his letters to himself; his arrogance, his pride. While he lifts himself up high, he is struck down; while sparing no one, he is poured out.
Behold, he who blocks the path of salvation for his brothers with unyielding rigidity! Behold, he who confidently claims to carry himself openly and to purify the Lord's threshing floor!
Have mercy on yourself, brother Sympronian, and do not let Novatian deceive you with this front. Do not consider him more just because he despises others in comparison to himself. Often boldness lies about confidence; and to those desperate sinners, a false image of a good conscience flatters.
On the contrary, all humility is innocence, even that which is indebted, even that which is sinful, even that which soothes its soul with the sinner.
"Blot me out," says Moses (Exodus 32:32), "from the book you have written; so that sinners may not perish."
The Apostle says,
"I wished that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood" (Romans 9:3).
Surely both intercede for sinners; and because of this, neither Moses nor Paul offended God. Is Novatian better than these? A corrector of the Prophets? A teacher of the Apostles? Does he now seem with Christ like the same Moses? Is he now elevated to the third heaven like Paul? Is he now heard alone, neglecting all others?
This should suffice as a response to your letters.

Because you discussed at length about not doing penance, or doing it before baptism, and filled your treatise with many examples, I will respond to each point thoroughly.
I will not remain silent about which faith is truer.
As you have generously commanded our attention, please afford the same opportunity to my treatise.
Perhaps the Lord will grant that, as we have offered ourselves to you with patience, we may also gain some benefit from your patience.
May the Lord be pleased to guard and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian and Catholic, and be in harmony with us.
Amen.

Letter Three Against the writings of the Novatians. Bishop Pacianus greets his brother Sympronian.

The entire treatise of the Novatians, which you have sent to me, my brother Sympronian, revolves around this: that it is not allowed to repent after baptism; that the Church cannot forgive mortal sin, and that it perishes by receiving sinners. A noble honor, a unique authority, great steadfastness; to reject the guilty, to avoid the touch of sinners, and to wrongly trust in their own innocence. Who advocates this, brother? Moses, Paul, or Christ?
Moses wishes to be blotted out of the book for the sake of blasphemers (Exodus 32:32); Paul wishes to be accursed for his brothers (Romans 9:3); and the Lord himself prefers to suffer for the unjust. None of these, you say. Who then? Novatian commanded this. Someone immaculate and pure, who had not heard of Novatus, who had never deserted the Church, who was made bishop by bishops, consecrated by the ordinary right, and followed a vacant chair in the Church?
What does it matter to you, you say; Novatian taught this. But when, brother, and in what times? Immediately after the Lord's passion? After the reign of Decius, nearly 300 years after the Lord's passion. What then? Did he follow prophets like the Cataphrygians, or someone like Apelles; or did he receive such authority himself? Did he speak in tongues? Did he prophesy? Could he raise the dead? He ought to have possessed some of these things to introduce a new law of the gospel.
And if the Apostle cries out against it: Even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse (Galatians 1:8). Novatian understood it this way, you say: but Christ taught this. So from Christ up to the reign of Decius, no one understood? After Decius, every bishop was impatient; all others were lax, preferring to associate with the lost and to perish with the wretched, wounded by another's wound? With Novatian as avenger, justice is liberated; under his authority, whatever erred is corrected.
Come, you say, let us contend with examples and fight with reason.

Until now, I have been at ease, content with the peace of the Church's tradition and the congregation's ancient practices. I have neither learned to engage in discord nor sought out arguments.
After you separated yourself from the rest of the body and divided from the mother, you began to delve into books, constantly searching and probing every hidden thing. You disturb whatever is peaceful.
Our ancestors did not voluntarily engage in disputes; our security is straightforward. What fortified argument have you brought from your side? I do not know what Novatian did, what Novatus committed, what Evaristus exaggerated, or what Nicostratus proclaimed.
While I disregard your weapons, I am unaware of them; see if you can contend with unarmed truth. Nevertheless, let us wait to see what you object to and what you will say. Could pure truth or innocent simplicity stand up?
You propose, and rightly so, that the Church is a people renewed by water and the Holy Spirit, without denying the name of Christ, the temple and house of God, the pillar and foundation of truth, as mentioned in First Timothy 3:15, a holy virgin with the most chaste thoughts, the bride of Christ from His bones and flesh, as stated in Ephesians 5:30, having no spot or wrinkle, from Ephesians 5:27, upholding the complete rights of the Gospels.
Who among us denies this? Indeed, we even add that the Church is a queen in a gold-embroidered and colorful robe, as described in Psalm 45:10, a fruitful vine on the sides of the Lord's house, as mentioned in Psalm 128:3, the mother of countless young maidens, as in Song of Solomon 6:7, a unique, beautiful dove, perfect and the mother of her children, as stated in Song of Solomon 6:8, the mother of all, built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:20, a great house enriched with a diversity of vessels.
But these are our matters for later; for now, let us see yours.
The Church is a people reborn of water and the Holy Spirit. Go ahead. Who has closed the fountain of God? Who has taken away the Spirit? Indeed, with us, the water is living, the very one that springs from Christ. You, separated from the everlasting fountain, from where are you generated? The Holy Spirit has not departed from the principal mother; how has it reached you?

Unless he perhaps followed a discordant path, abandoning many priests and content with an unconsecrated seat, he loved the worn-out pool of a fake spring.
Where does your congregation receive the Spirit if it is not anointed by a priest?
Where does the water come from if it has separated from the source?
Where is the renewal if it has lost the foundation of peaceful marriage?
The Church is a people who do not deny the name of Christ. Do we not have among us confessors proven by chains, fires, and swords?
You might say, "There were, but they perished by accepting the deniers."
Should I remain silent that Novatian, while he was still in the Church, wrote, advised, and read a letter about accepting deniers or the lapsed?
Meanwhile, who can you persuade that the whole Church collapsed because the lapsed were accepted?
That by admitting the repentant, the admitting congregation became deniers?
And if some congregation was more lenient, did the others who did not approve of this act but followed custom and peace, lose the Christian name?
Hear the voice of Jeremiah:
"In those days, they shall no longer say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,' but everyone shall die for their own sin" (Jeremiah 31:29-30).
Nor is the Lord silent in Ezekiel:
"As the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. Everyone shall die for their own sin" (Ezekiel 18:4).
And further down:
"The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him" (Ezekiel 18:20).
You yourself provide that example:
"Even if these three men, Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in it, they would not deliver sons or daughters; they alone would be saved" (Ezekiel 14:16).
Behold, those who are in the midst of sinners are saved, but they cannot save others.
You bind the entire world with the chains of a few; you condemn the whole Church with the weakness of a small portion.
What about all the saints with you, whom Novatus educated, Evaristus chose, Nicostratus taught, and Novatian instructed?

You have rejected thorns and thistles; you don't have weeds among your crops; your grains are already cleaned: the cleaner will come to you without a winnowing fan.
Are you the only one who will not have chaff?
Come on, say the rest: The Church is the body of Christ. Certainly a body, not just a limb: a body gathered from many parts and members into one, as the Apostle says: For the body is not one member, but many.
Therefore, the Church is a complete body, both solid and spread throughout the whole world. Like a city, whose parts are united; not like you Novatians, a certain isolated fragment and lump, separated from the rest of the body.
The Church is the temple of God: certainly a large temple, a great house, indeed having golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and clay ones, some for honor, many indeed magnificent for various uses of different works destined.
The Church is a holy virgin, with the purest senses, the bride of Christ. A virgin; it is true: but also a mother. A bride; it is evident: but also a wife and spouse taken from her husband: therefore bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh.
For David said of her: Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the sides of your house: your children like olive shoots around your table.
Therefore, this virgin has many offspring and countless progeny, filling the whole world, always buzzing with populous swarms. This mother's care and tender affection for her children is great: the good are honored, the proud are chastised, the sick are cared for: no one perishes, no one is despised: the secure offspring are retained under the mother's indulgence.
The Church is without spot or wrinkle: that is, it does not have heresies, not Valentinians, not Cataphrygians, not Novatians. For in these are certain stained and wrinkled folds, envying the adornments of precious garments.
Moreover, the sinner and penitent is not a blemish of the Church; because as long as he sins and does not repent, he is placed outside the Church.

When one stops sinning, they are already healed. But a heretic tears apart the garment of the Lord, the Church of Christ, by disrupting, corrupting, and wrinkling it. For when, he says, there are divisions and arguments among you, are you not worldly and walking according to human ways? First Corinthians 3:3.
Their talk spreads like gangrene. Second Timothy 2:17. This is the stain on unity, this is the wrinkle. Finally, when the Apostle speaks about these things, he proposes the love of Christ and affection. Just as Christ, he says, loved the Church and gave himself up for her. Ephesians 5:25. So that he might exclude heretics, because they did not know how to love.
But why is this important to a miserable penitent? Because he desires both to love and to be loved. The Church is the guardian of the complete laws of the Gospels. Complete, indeed, because it is whole and full. Where rewards are given to the faithful, where tears are not denied to the miserable, where the sick are healed, where arrogant health and proud justice claim nothing for themselves, where diligent charity endures in everything, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things. First Corinthians 13:7.
Hence the Apostle’s saying: Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with indignation? Second Corinthians 11:29. Where the whole brotherhood bears its burdens together, suffering in mutual compassion. All bearing with one another in love, striving earnestly to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Ephesians 4:3. This will be the Church, brother Sympronian; this will be the people reborn in Christ through water and the Holy Spirit.
You say, I do not know whether a sin can be forgiven by bishops, since the Lord said: Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. Matthew 10:33. Why then did your Novatian, who was not even falsely a priest with episcopal authority, long before Cornelius became bishop of Rome, before he envied Cornelius’s priesthood, suggest this? You have the testimony of Cyprian; Cyprian whom you could never defame.

In one place, he wrote to Antonianus like this:
It was also mentioned that Novatian was writing at the time, and he recited what he had written with his own voice.
Moses, who was then a confessor and now already a martyr, was signing so that peace might be given to those who had fallen, were weak, and in their final moments.
These letters were sent throughout the whole world and brought to the attention of all the churches.
What do you say, brother Sympronian?
Novatian wrote this, and to add to the service of pure will, he also recited what was written.
His right hand is a witness, the hand that wrote it is a witness: the tongue that read it is a witness.
Cornelius, for whose sake all this envy erupted, was not yet a bishop.
Much later, with many fellow bishops, with many confessors, and immediately with martyrs, as Cyprian himself writes, he agreed to the counsel of the elders that it was permissible to give peace.
If the way to repentance is to be denied, Novatian is at fault, who wrote, advised, and read this.
Where then was the impatient rigor?
Where was that fierce judgment?
If no one had preferred Cornelius to you, the authority of the writer would remain.
Now the whole opinion is displeasing, now weapons are being thrown at us, supplied by those whose authority strengthened the cause of those weapons.
When did this very heresy of Novatian begin?
Listen, please, and notice the whole order of your error.
Cornelius, already made a bishop in Rome by sixteen bishops, had taken the place of the vacant chair, and with the chastity he possessed in his virginity, he endured frequent persecutions from an angry ruler.
Then, by chance, a certain presbyter Novatus from Africa, after defrauding widows in the Carthaginian church, robbing orphans, denying church money, casting his father out of the house and leaving him to die of hunger without burial, striking his pregnant wife's womb with a kick causing her to miscarry, came to Rome.
And while in Carthage, with the brothers in the church pressing, and the day of his trial approaching, he hid.

Not long after, Novatian, anxious about the bishopric of Cornelius (since he had hoped for it himself), gathered some supporters, as often happens in these situations. He encouraged the doubtful and urged them to hope for something great. Among them were some who had escaped the storm of persecution. Cornelius, however, incited envy over the issue of receiving the lapsed. Novatian sent their letters to him, and from the authority of these letters, while the bishop was already seated in Rome, he assumed the title of another bishop, violating the unique authority of the priesthood. He accused Cornelius of communing with the lapsed and claimed innocence for himself. Against him, I must defend myself; against him, I must assert my honor; against him, I must clear my name.
But you might say, “Why do you bishops approve such things?” Let someone else defend Novatian. This cause may seem inexcusable to others, but it may be pleasing to you. To you, anyone who is guilty is innocent. Do not accuse another of a crime for which you cannot be freed. Come, we bishops must owe our entire honor because we have received the name of the apostles and are marked by the designation of Christ. You say, “The Lord denies the denier,” yet you do not want to acknowledge him who denies. Who acknowledges the denier? The one who drives to repentance, rebukes, shows the crime, opens the wounds, reminds them of eternal punishments, and corrects by the destruction of the flesh. This is to chastise, not to acknowledge.
The Lord says to us, “You are the salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13). Therefore, by saying this, we rightly season, and whoever hears will not be worthless. You see that we do not trample on the Lord’s judgment, but approve it. We do not reject severity but reveal His will. But you say, “You forgive sins to the penitent, whereas you are only allowed to remit sin in baptism.” Not to me indeed, but to God alone, who grants forgiveness in baptism and does not reject the tears of the penitent. Moreover, what I do, I do not by my own right, but by the Lord’s: “We are God's co-workers,” he says, “you are God’s building” (First Corinthians 3:9).

And again: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
First Corinthians 3:6-7.
Therefore, whether we baptize, urge repentance, or grant forgiveness to those who repent, we do all this with Christ as the author.
You need to see whether Christ can do this, whether Christ has done this.
If forgiveness of sins could be given to those who repent, you say, then baptism was not necessary.
What a foolish comparison!
Baptism is the sacrament of the Lord's passion; the forgiveness for the repentant is the merit of the one who confesses.
Anyone can obtain the former, because it is the gift of God’s grace; that is, a free gift.
However, the latter is the work of the few who rise after a fall, who recover after wounds, who are helped by tearful prayers, who come back to life after the death of the flesh.
You wrongly claim that I have misused the example that God said: I prefer the repentance of a sinner to their death.
Ezekiel 33:11.
What if I had added the words of Isaiah: When you turn and groan, then you will be saved and you will know where you have been?
Isaiah 30:15, according to the Septuagint.
What if I had added this from Revelation: Remember where you have fallen from, and repent, and do the works you did at first?
Revelation 2:5.
You will say these were spoken to the nations before baptism.
Listen to the Apostle: We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law.
Romans 3:19.
Therefore, the condition of repentance will not apply to those who lived without the law.
Even if they repented, they did so freely by faith, not bound by the law’s obligation to repent.
So you will say that even the Jews who repented before baptism cannot repent after baptism.
Who taught you this, brother Sympronianus?
Who persuaded you that someone who has repented before should not repent afterward?
But we will look into this later.
In the meantime, if repentance is closed off to the Jews after baptism because they fulfilled it before, at least concede that the nations who did not know the law of repentance before should repent afterward.
But even concerning the Jews, I do not want you to be mistaken.

They repented earlier because they had corrupted the old baptism and, after betraying their faith, they repented. Listen to the Apostle:
"I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ"
(First Corinthians 10:1-4).
Therefore, they had violated this baptism and thus repented.
Let us see then what you say:
"If God often commands a person to repent, you say, He often allows a person to sin."
What are you saying? Does the one who often shows the remedy for a crime reveal the crime? Just as a doctor who heals frequently teaches to be wounded? God does not want a person to sin even once, and yet He frees them from sin.
And surely, when He frees, He does not teach sin; just as the one who rescues from a fire does not show the fire; nor does the one who saves a shipwrecked person from rocks drive them onto the rocks. It is one thing to be freed from danger, another to be driven to danger.
And perhaps I would allow this to be believed if repentance were considered a delight, which imposes such labor, demands the destruction of the flesh, constant tears, and eternal groans. Would the healed person want to cut themselves again, to be burned again? Would they want to sin again and repent again, when it is written:
"Do not add sin, lest something worse happens to you"
(John 5:14)?
And furthermore:
"I will not have mercy on the one who sins constantly"
(Sirach 12:3).
But if, as you say, one is driven to sin by the medicine of repentance shown; what then will the one do to whom repentance itself is closed off; to whom, with the remedy in despair, the whole wound is covered; to whom, entirely, the path of life is denied?
In baptism, you say, we die once, as the Apostle says:
"Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too may walk in newness of life"
(Romans 6:3-4).
What is surprising?

The Apostle taught that we should strive to be new, so that no one would sin; but if someone did sin, they should repent. The one who was whole should live, and the one who was healed should also live: the innocent would receive a crown, and the penitent would obtain pardon. One would get a reward, the other would receive healing.
Finally, the same Apostle says: "For if while we were still sinners, Christ died for us; much more, now that we are justified by his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath" (Romans 5:9-10). From the wrath, indeed, that was due to sinners. If he did not let the Gentile people perish, much more will he not allow the redeemed to be extinguished. He will not cast away those whom he has redeemed at a great price; for the loss of his servants is not trivial to him. Indeed, he who rises will not die again, as it is written (Romans 14:4). But he himself is an advocate with the Father; he himself intercedes for our sins, a not insignificant patron of the wretched, a more than adequate intercessor.
Answer, brother, can the devil oppress the servants of God, or can Christ not absolve them? You say Peter's repentance happened before the Lord's passion? No one proposed this to you. And yet Peter had already been baptized: for the Lord had said to him: "He who has bathed once does not need to wash again" (John 13:10). However, he later received Christ's remedy, but he repented beforehand; and he was considered holy before he received the remedy. And his repentance would not have been written down if it had not been beneficial. It says, "He wept bitterly" (Matthew 26:75). Do you not want to do what Peter did? Do you not want what benefited Peter to benefit us?
Come, did not my Thomas doubt the resurrection after the Lord's resurrection? Was he not accused of disbelief by the Lord when the marks of the nails, the pierced hands, and the wound in the side were shown to him, when the Lord said to him: "Do not be unbelieving, but believing" (John 20:27)? What then? Did he blush to repent? Did he not humble himself? Did he not immediately confess his God and Lord? Does not this confession commend him?

You've cleverly addressed the argument I presented about the power given to bishops: that whatever they bound on earth would be bound in heaven. You claim this applies not to the faithful but to the catechumens, suggesting it was permissible to release or bind the sins of those yet to be baptized.
You combine chapters from two Evangelists to make them seem like one. You add that John completed what Matthew had less fully pursued because the Lord said in Matthew:
"Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19);
He fulfilled it in John by saying:
"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:23);
So this forgiving or binding seemed to pertain to the nations to be baptized, because the first Evangelist spoke of the nations, and the latter completed it concerning binding and loosing.
What do you say? Did the two Evangelists report half-thoughts and incomplete ideas? Were they lacking in words or reasoning with each other, or did the Holy Spirit not fully complete everything, carrying out the proposed senses and defining the sayings fully?
No one overrides a confirmed testament of a man: will a different tablet change the tablet of God? Why this desire to win, that you dare such things? What about the fact that the Lord said before His passion in Matthew itself:
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19)?
The Lord predicted this in Matthew and made no mention of the nations there. Why then do you add the chapter of John to where He placed His own, and in such a way that separates it from the nations? If He had wanted it to pertain to the nations, He could have joined what He Himself placed.
Therefore, you have everything you seek in Matthew. Why didn't you read everything, you who teach the bishop? Repeat the first part of this command.

According to Matthew, a little earlier, the Lord spoke to Peter individually to establish unity from one person, and soon after, He gave the same command to all. However, He begins with Peter:
"And I say to you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven"
Matthew 18:19.
Tell me, brother; did He say this only about the gentiles: "On this rock I will build my Church"? Does He call unbaptized people the Church? Is a man not yet reborn the body of Christ? What do I loose for the gentiles, which is not bound? For if it is not considered, it is not bound. What do I bind, which I have no right to constrain? A gentile man is free from the Law.
Now see the opposite, whether both apply to the baptized. Forgiveness is granted because he was held by sin; he is bound by anathema because he was freed by faith and released by grace. But if I concede that this power of loosing or binding applies to the gentiles, I will much more prove it pertains to the baptized. For if one who had no bond could be loosed or bound, how much more one who is held by the laws of faith?
You say Matthew wrote: "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone"
Matthew 18:15; and immediately adds the Lord’s words: "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven," so it seems to pertain to a brother's offense.
Come on, don't you see what He says above: "If your brother sins against you"; but here He adds: "Amen I say to you, whatever you bind on earth, etc." This command was given to one, but this was released to many: the former he looses to whom it is admitted; the latter, the Church: the former, without a priest, without brothers; the latter is obtained by all. "Whatever you bind," He says; absolutely nothing is excluded. "Whatever," He says: whether great or small.

Please pay attention to what Peter is told below:
That sins against a man must be forgiven seventy-seven times, to show that other sins can be forgiven even once.
However, he who sins against Peter offends the Lord, as it is shown to Samuel: "It is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me" (First Samuel 8:7).
Therefore, it is allowed for the Church to forgive at least once, which is commanded to us many times over.
Now, let's return to the wandering sheep, the lost coin, and the younger son.
When I briefly mentioned these examples in my previous writing, you repeated them in full, teaching and showing that the lost coin, the sheep, and the younger son refer to tax collectors and sinners; that is, to humble people, not to the image of the Christian community nor to the form of the faithful.
I am glad to be taught; however, I am distressed that the understanding is not there.
For what should I assert?
Whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law.
(Romans 3:19)
Certainly, I agree that this was primarily said to the former people, but in the form of the faithful, but in the image of the future, as the Apostle says:
"These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come."
(First Corinthians 10:11)
And again: "The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming."
(Hebrews 10:1)
Surely you agree that these teachings were for tax collectors and sinners, that is, humble people, and therefore, the younger ones.
So tell me, is the Christian people itself younger?
Has it not been grafted into the root?
Has it not been joined together as members?
Built, as it is written, on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
(Ephesians 2:20)
Is God the God of Jews only?
Is he not the God of Gentiles too?
Yes, of Gentiles too.
Since there is one God who justifies the ungodly by faith and through faith.
(Romans 3:29-30)
Surely that humble people, whom God compared to the lost coin, the younger son, and the little sheep, was the Church: from which came the whole crowd of believers, from which came the Christian people.

Our bodies are also connected to this body, along with all the parts of the believers, so that we may come together into the good olive tree from the wild olive tree of the Gentiles, as the Apostle says:
"Partakers of its richness" (Romans 11:17).
And so we all may be one in Christ, Jew and Greek, slave and free (Galatians 3:28).
If, therefore, we are one body with those humble ones, what was said to the humble of old was said to us as well:
and thus it was announced to the whole body, whatever was preached about a part of the body.
Let me make it clearer: those later people, that poor and ordinary group, were the image of the Church—a humble and modest soul, freed by Christ.
The Lord came to save this, did not leave it in hell:
this is the sheep that is carried back on the shoulders:
that is, by the effort and strength of patience.
This is the coin that is sought: and, having been found, is shown to the neighbors.
Do you see how its form fits the likeness of the repentant?
Do you see mercy extending up to this time?
Do you see that whatever was said to the nascent Church pertains to the fullness of the Church?
Therefore, the Lord added:
"There will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need repentance" (Luke 15:7).
For if all those things were written to remind us;
to whom then will that humble sinful people be compared, if not to the repentant people?
And if the figures recur in order, the ninety-nine healthy ones are the whole Church;
the one that strays is the portion of the delinquents:
and the coin that was lost is that poor sinner:
the son returning after his wrongs is considered similar to the redeemed.
Now you see rightly placed by me, when I was dealing with the care of the repentant, that the Lord said:
"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" (Matthew 9:12).
Rightly also:
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" (Matthew 5:4).
Whatever was said about publicans and sinners will pertain to all the sick and all the wretched.
You say it is written only of the martyrs:
"Blessed are those who mourn."

Does no one besides them mourn their sins? Doesn't David cry out, "I will wash my bed every night" (Psalm 6:7)? And again, "For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears" (Psalm 102:10).
Doesn't Jacob say, "The years of my life have been hard" (Genesis 47:9)? Doesn't the Apostle say to Timothy, "Longing to see you, remembering your tears" (Second Timothy 1:4)? Yet he wasn't speaking about a martyr.
What now? Do miserable penitents have dry eyes? And do those who are sorrowful for their sins not know how to weep? Do we, who partake and are faithful, have no tears? Does anyone among us delight in rejoicing while the world rejoices?
You Novatians, are you already satisfied, made rich, and have begun to reign without us (First Corinthians 4:8)?
So, isn't everyone who is wretched deserving of pity? After this, you propose and say it is written by the Lord: "Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come" (Matthew 12:31-32).
Either I am mistaken, or this example works against you. For if every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, you see that repentance is not denied forgiveness. Therefore, every sin, including blasphemy.
You have an addition according to Luke: "And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him" (Luke 12:10). What more is there to say about God's mercy and the leniency of His judgment?
Is your eye envious because the head of the household is generous (Matthew 20:15)? Is he not allowed to do what he wants? Indeed, who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master, he stands or falls. And God is able to make him stand (Romans 14:4).
But you say, whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven (Matthew 12:32). You are accustomed to reading all the scriptures thoroughly: why did you not read here what it means to be "in the Spirit"?

You mentioned earlier that when the Lord cast out demons with a word and performed many miracles with special power, the Pharisees said:
"He does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
Matthew 12:24.
This means they sinned against the Holy Spirit by blaspheming the works done through the Holy Spirit.
In other sins, we either err out of ignorance, are broken by fear, or are overcome by the weakness of the flesh.
This blindness is not seeing what you see and attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, calling the glory of the Lord, by which the devil himself is overcome, the power of the devil.
This is what will not be forgiven: the rest, for those who truly repent, Brother Symproniane, are forgiven.
After this, you discuss the branches and the vine as follows:
The Lord says in John:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes."
John 15:1-2.
You see, therefore, that fruit is required in the branches, that is, good works of repentance, as John says:
"Produce fruit in keeping with repentance."
Matthew 3:8.
You see the branches being pruned, which are the losses of the flesh, the losses of joy, the losses of wealth, and the labors of life; these are the proper actions of those who repent. You also see the Lord's gardening, who does not lose even the branches but prunes and gathers them, some clearly for the fire, others for planting and nurturing new vineyards.
The priest Eli, you say, speaks and says:
"If a man sins against another man, they can intercede for him; but if a man sins against God, who will intercede for him?"
First Samuel 2:25.
John likewise says:
"If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying that he should pray about that."
First John 5:16.
You see this all pertains to ongoing sins, not to those who have sinned at some point and have begun to repent before anyone prays for them.
It is lengthy to replicate examples. Consider all the sins the Lord threatens: you will see they are present.

If past righteousness does not benefit the righteous person during their time of iniquity, then past iniquity will not harm the wicked person during their time of righteousness.
Ezekiel chapter 18, verse 24.
For it is written:
"Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to God, and they will receive mercy."
Isaiah chapter 55, verse 7.
And if God has punished past sins and established a penalty and punishment for things done and omitted, does He not have the power to change His decision?
Did He not save Rahab, King Nebuchadnezzar, the Gibeonites, the Ninevites, and Zoar from the foretold destruction?
Did not Joel the prophet say,
"Return to the Lord your God with fasting, weeping, and mourning; for He is merciful, patient, and long-suffering, full of compassion, and willing to relent from sending calamity.
And who knows if He will turn and relent and leave behind a blessing?"
Joel chapter 2, verses 12 to 14.
Therefore, whenever you find a penalty established for sinners, you will understand it either as established for those persisting in sin or as leaving God the freedom to change His decision if you repent and turn to better ways.
You still say that it is written:
"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you."
Matthew chapter 5, verse 29.
Moses explained what this means in Deuteronomy:
"If your brother (for these are our eyes and hands), or your daughter, or the wife who is in your embrace, or your closest friend entices you, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' whom you have not known."
Deuteronomy chapter 13, verse 6.
He then added below:
"You shall kill him; your hand should be the first against him to put him to death."
Deuteronomy chapter 13, verse 9.
You see, therefore, it is not said about those who repent, but about those who not only persist in wickedness themselves but also do not cease to scandalize us.
These people, no matter how dear they are, must be abandoned; no matter how useful, they must be deserted.
You further propose that the apostle Paul said:
"Remove the evil person from among yourselves."
First Corinthians chapter 5, verse 13.
Certainly, it is persistent evil, but repentance is not evil, as David says:
"It is good to confess to God."
Psalm 111, verse 2.

However, he who repents is not with me, nor among the saints, nor is he united in peace.
But the Apostle says:
If anyone who is called a brother is a fornicator, an idolater, a greedy person, an abusive person, a drunkard, or a swindler, do not even eat with such a person
First Corinthians 5:11.
You see, it is not without reason that it is said, "and is," referring to someone who has not yet repented, who has not yet ceased to be wicked.
And it is certainly said together about the greedy, the drunkards, and the abusive.
Answer, brother, is there no such person among you, in your peace?
Therefore, it is from there, and what God cries through Isaiah:
The unjust and sinners will perish together
Isaiah 1:28;
those who do not repent, who do not seek mercy, to whom God says again through the same Isaiah:
Even if your sins are like scarlet, I will make them white as snow; if they are red as crimson, I will make them like wool
Isaiah 1:18.
However, as you say, the Apostle condemned the wrongdoer.
For in the first letter to the Corinthians, he says:
Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit and have already judged him who has committed this act.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are assembled, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord
First Corinthians 5:3-5.
Note, brother, first, that he does not condemn those with whom this man associates: only he who has committed such an act is handed over to Satan, only he is excluded, while the peace of the saints is preserved.
Do you condemn all churches for one sinner?
Then you see, this same incestuous sinner is not handed over to death but to Satan, for correction, for discipline, for repentance.
Finally, he says, for the destruction of the flesh, but not the soul, not even the spirit: only for the destruction of the flesh, that is, the trials, the distresses of the flesh, the loss of limbs, as he says elsewhere about the undisciplined:
Such people will experience tribulation in the flesh
First Corinthians 7:28.
Do you want to know this?
In the second letter to the Corinthians, Paul himself absolves this same impious person.

Because he himself says: "For such a one, the punishment by the majority is sufficient; so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps he be swallowed up with too much sorrow. Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him" (Second Corinthians 2:6-8). Further on: "If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven, if there was anything to forgive, I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us" (Second Corinthians 2:10).
Do you see the Apostle's forgiveness, even moderating his own judgments? Do you see the gentle kindness that is far removed from your arrogance? It is far different from the stance of Novatian, who truly considers the common life and salvation of all.
But even against us, you have turned into a harsh critic. You say, according to the heavenly law, that it is not permitted to break one of the commandments and not to mix lambs with wolves, and that any agreement in a crime is wrong; and therefore, whoever touches pitch will be defiled (Ecclesiasticus 13:1); and there should be no fellowship between light and darkness, or between the temple of God and idols, or between Christ and Belial (Second Corinthians 6:14-15).
Therefore David says: "When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and with adulterers, you have been a partaker" (Psalm 50:18).
You finally say that we break the Lord's commandments. Do we bend a single jot of the Law; or rather Novatian, who has violated all the laws of the Church and all the bonds of unity, who, after so many years of peace and so many covenants of sanctity, has brought forth new laws, new institutions, new rites, pretending to have the secret of justice with an unyielding face? Have we welcomed wolves into the Church, who avoid the faces of heretics; or rather Novatian, who, being ravenous wolves themselves, fear slightly more miserable little sheep? Do we consent to evil, do we touch pitch, do we cling to darkness, do we join with idols and Belial; or rather those who received Evaristus, who received Nicostratus, and the others who departed from the Church, tainted in speech, hand, and morals?

We encounter adulterers and thieves; or those who valued Novatus over their own life and well-being; after intercepting the money of orphans and widows; the wretched parent and the murderer of his wife's offspring, not only not repenting but even boasting?
But Paul the Apostle said: Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands. First Timothy 5:21. He also teaches; either slowly, or after repentance, not to be denied.
After the destruction of Jericho, Achan son of Carmi was killed because of the theft of a garment. Come on; all of you, kill the thieves of our money and books entirely; and rage against the bones of Novatus. Take up again that yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear. Acts 15:10.
Why do you delay, Novatians, demanding an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Deuteronomy 19:21. Seeking a soul, restoring the practice of Circumcision and the Sabbath? Kill the thieves, stone the insolent. Do you not read in the Gospel that the Lord even spared the confessing adulteress. John 8:11. Whom no one condemned: that He absolved the sinner who washed His feet with her tears: that He liberated Rahab in the city of Jericho among the Phoenicians: that He absolved Tamar from the judgment of the patriarch: that, even with Sodom perishing, He did not destroy the daughters of Lot; and would have saved the sons-in-law if they had believed in the impending destruction.
Come on; do you not hold to saying with David to the Lord: With those who hated peace, I was peaceful. Psalm 119:7. And not to be silent about Solomon's saying: A brother helping a brother will be exalted. Proverbs 18:9.
What about the Apostle? Brothers, even if a man is caught in any wrongdoing; you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourselves lest you also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ. Galatians 6:1, 2. And that which I already mentioned: For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh. Romans 9:3. And again: I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some. First Corinthians.

Chapter 9, Verse 22:
This means sharing the groans with the wounded, the labor with the sick, the death with the dying, and connecting your own state with the fall of brothers. It involves giving up some of your own health to provide medicine to those who are failing.
Chapter 21:
What good does it do to harden your faces with pride and harshness, to rule with arrogance, to turn away from the miserable, and to close your ears and eyes?
Have you never fallen? Is there no blemish in your mind? Is there no speck in your eyes? Who can boast of having a pure heart or being free from sins? Proverbs 20:9 according to the Septuagint.
I believe you are just, kind, and temperate, with all your limbs healthy and your whole body untouched, needing no doctor or medicine. Enter now into heaven; pass through the gates of paradise, with the sword withdrawing. Close off your gifts from the many who confess the one God.
If things are far different from the unrelenting harshness of reality and your cruelty lies, you now understand, Novatians, that God can have mercy.
You now understand that medicine, even if late, can be available to brothers who confess their past sins. You now understand that the one neglected by the Levite and priest can be healed through Christ.
You now understand that the prayers of the Church should not be denied to the humble. You now understand that the hands of priests should be extended to pitiable brothers.
But we understand, as you reproach, that the Church of God, the dove, is not bitter with bile, not violent with the tearing of claws, even with small and weak feathers.
We also know that the well of living water and the sealed fountain are not tainted by the stain of a heretic's pool, and that the enclosed garden is full of both large and small herbs, both common and precious.
Even the eight souls from the ark, among whom was Ham, and the thousands of birds and beasts in pairs and sevens, both clean and unclean. We consider the dry fountains and clouds stirred by whirlwinds to be the barrenness of heretics and the force of insane voices.

We do not promise freedom, as we ourselves are slaves to punishment. But having confessed our own crimes, we also encourage others to confess and believe in Him who justifies the ungodly by faith (Romans 3:26),
who reverses the judgment imposed against wickedness (Joel 2:13, according to the Septuagint).
We also take heed of false prophets and ravenous wolves as we guard against you (Matthew 7:15).
Indeed, we think that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses just as you oppose the Catholics. Thus, the Apostle says:
"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth: men of corrupt minds and disapproved by God; but they will not progress further, for their folly will be plain to all, as it was with those two" (Second Timothy 3:8-9).
It is clear that this was said about you, who could neither progress further nor conceal your folly.
He who is baptized by the dead gains nothing (Ecclesiasticus 34:30);
indeed, he who is washed by a heretical source, and likewise he who is anointed with the oil of a sinner, that is, who is filled with an unclean spirit. Therefore, you will be sons of blood. For you do not desire the peace of the brethren, but their blood. Your belief is false faith. The adulterous woman is the heretical congregation: for the Catholic Church, from the beginning, has not left her husband's bed and chamber, nor desired foreign or strange lovers. You have painted an exiled form with a new color; you have separated your bed from the ancient marriage;
you have departed from the body of the one-bedded mother, adorned with new ways of pleasing and new enticements of corruption. For when you propose blessed Cyprian as a contrary witness to me, because in the Epistle concerning the Lapsed, he says that Moses and Daniel and Job prayed for sinners and did not obtain, as the Lord says:
"Even if these three men, Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in their midst, they would not save sons or daughters, but only they themselves would be saved" (Ezekiel 14:20).
If only, if only you would rely on Cyprian as a witness, if only you would agree with such wholesome sentences.

For when he urged those who had fallen to repentance, who did not want to repent, saying they had received peace from confessors or martyrs, he taught and showed that not even those patriarchs could obtain it for the unrepentant.
Indeed, who can free someone unwilling?
Who can humble themselves for the proud?
Who can intercede for the unrepentant?
When he said this, he urged them to the remedies of repentance.
The man of such gravity and merit did not speak against himself, but he taught that prayers should be poured out by sinners and that confession should be cherished.
Yet the examples of Cyprian move you, as he recalls that even Moses and the other saints did not obtain what they asked for on behalf of sinners.
What? Don't you see that Moses couldn't obtain it for certain people?
When he returned to the people, what did he hear in the camp?
The voices of drunkards and the singing of idolaters echoed.
The people were still persisting in wickedness, still remaining in the very crime, and did not know how to repent.
But who among us told you that Moses did not obtain it?
For God had indeed said to him, "He has sinned against me, I will blot him out of my book" (Exodus thirty-two, thirty-three).
However, he said this with the authority of a judge and the power of the Lord; but see how quickly he reversed the sentence that was passed against the people's malice.
Listen.
The prophet immediately says: "And Moses prayed before the Lord his God, 'Why, Lord, do you let your anger burn against your people?' and the rest" (Exodus thirty-two, eleven).
And further down: "And the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened" (Exodus thirty-two, fourteen).
Do you see that God's anger was appeased?
Do you see that the offense was placated?
And he did not pray for the people, nor did he repent for what he had done.
But Noah, you say, and Daniel, and Job could not save their sons and daughters.
This is because they would ask for those who do not pray; if they intercede for those persisting in crime; if they do not defend individuals, if not a few, but many thousands.
However, Noah saved his household from the public ruin; and Job received back all that he had lost; and Daniel, by his prayer, repelled the sword that was imminent for the wise men of Babylon.

Certainly, for the safety of the town, Lot prays, and Paul prays for the passengers of the ship. Thus, those who know how to repent are freed from justice. Finally, I see what is written: "They alone will be saved" (Ezekiel 14:20). Who are they? They are those who intercede for sinners and plead for such people without punishment. And why do you condemn the Church? Why do you forbid interceding for those who repent, if it is also permitted to pray for those who are not allowed to obtain it?
Therefore, read my Cyprian more diligently: read the whole letter about the Lapsed. Read another which he gave to Antonianus, where Novatian is urged by all examples. Then you will know what he pronounces about the care of the penitent. I speak of Cyprian, who opposes your views and upholds the Catholic rights. Tertullian, after his heresy for you have taken much from it you will hear in his own letter, and in that very one which he published as a Catholic, confessing that the Church can forgive sins.
Therefore, you see that the Church is a queen in a golden and variegated garment (Psalm 45:10) composed undoubtedly of many bodies and many peoples of various kinds. This picture is not of one color, nor does such diversity shine in one appearance. One part of the garment covers, another arranges. Some adhere to the chest, some are drawn to the hem, and among the very edges, it becomes dirty. Some are compared to the purple of martyrs; others to the virginal silk. Some are sewn in with a folding hem, or repaired by inserting a needle. For one is like this, another is like that (First Corinthians 7:7); and yet one queen is composed in all.
Therefore, the same fruitful and wealthy vine, having many branches, is extended with many clusters. Did none of these suffer from the cold of winter? Did it not endure harsh hail? Did it not withstand scorching summers? This gem is harsher on the branches, that one is stronger, another purer. This one spreads itself in fruits, this one overflows only in leaves. Yet everywhere the vine is beautiful. This is the mother of young women, whose number is beyond counting (Song of Solomon 6:7).
Finally, if you can count the Catholic flocks, and reckon the swarms of our people on your fingers.

Not only the things that are spread all over the world, filling every region, but also those things, Brother Sympronian, that are near you in the neighboring city.
Think about how many of our people you see alone, how many of my people you encounter by yourself.
Aren’t you like tiny drops compared to great fountains?
Aren’t you like a drop in the ocean, being absorbed?
Tell me, are these young women from your people, or do you alone bring them forth?
This queen, chosen and perfected for her mother, is ours, I say.
Nothing is chosen unless it is better and greater than something else; nothing can be perfect unless it is complete.
Now consider this: is this particularly built upon the foundation of the prophets and apostles, with Jesus Christ himself as the cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20)?
If it started before you, if it believed before you, if it did not leave the original foundations, if it did not move away, if it did not separate from the rest of the body, establishing its own teachers and unique instruments, if it argued anything unusual, if it discovered any new law, if it declared a rejection of peace to its own body—then it clearly seems to have departed from Christ, then it would have stood apart from the prophets and apostles.
Therefore, this will be a great house, rich with the diversity of all kinds of vessels, where pure gold shines, and malleable silver gleams; indeed, it also honors wooden and earthen vessels as it is written (Second Timothy 2:20).
A great house serves many purposes, requiring different works.
It does not only seek silver, nor does it only delight in golden adornment.
Often, a great house is more fitting with simplicity; among noble pursuits, small things can also be delightful.
No craftsman despises his works or thinks that what he created is worthless.
And why do you think Christ suffered for sinners, except that he did not want to lose anything he himself formed?
Why do you think he still intercedes for the wretched today, except that he does not reject the humble and despised; he will not lose any of those he has received; even if they are compared to wood and clay, he arranges all the vessels in his house accordingly?

Finally, brother Symproniane, don't hesitate to join the many. Be willing to disregard the remnants of the Novatians and your doubts. Consider the Catholic congregations and the people of the Church spread so widely.
Where there is one, you will say, there I am too; and where there are two, there is the Church. Where there is one, let there be harmony; where there are two, let there be peace. Where there is one, there is the Church; how much more so where there are many?
He says, "Two are better than one: and a threefold cord is not quickly broken" (Ecclesiastes 4:12).
Listen to David: "I will praise your name in a great assembly" (Psalms 35:18). And again: "I will praise you in a mighty throng" (Psalms 35:18). And: "The Mighty One, God, the Lord, has spoken, and summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting" (Psalms 50:1).
What about the seed of Abraham, compared to the stars and the grains of sand, content with your poverty? "All the nations of the earth will be blessed in you" (Genesis 22:18). Tell me; does Novatian fulfill these? God did not redeem so little with His own blood, and Christ is not so poor.
Recognize now, brother, the Church of God expanding its tents and fastening its tent pegs to the right and to the left. Understand that from the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised (Psalms 113:3).
See, see, I beg you, while the Novatians struggle with words, the Catholic riches are spread across the world.
Concerning everything you consulted me about, I have instructed you. I have omitted nothing from the proposed topics or sentences. I have responded to the very points and words. If you sought with a consulting spirit, it has been shown lovingly: if with a challenging spirit, it has been debated promptly.
I will append another letter when there is time, in which I will not refute yours but present ours. If you read kindly and without disdain, perhaps it will not harm. Meanwhile, in this, I ask that you review each thing carefully. Everything quickly read is quickly passed over. If you desire better gifts and bear a soul of good learning, you will not easily disdain such truths.
May the Lord deign to keep and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian in spiritual harmony. Amen.
