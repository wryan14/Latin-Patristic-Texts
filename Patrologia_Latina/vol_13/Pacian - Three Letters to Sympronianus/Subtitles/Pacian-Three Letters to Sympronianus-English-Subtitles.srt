00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,648
Three letters to Symprionian the Novatian
by Pacian

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:09,336
Letter One On the Catholic Name. Pacianus to his brother Sympronian, greetings.

3
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:20,108
If your intention is not material but spiritual, as I believe, my lord, that makes you examine the faith of the Catholic truth from us: you should have first indicated which different beliefs you were following.

4
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:30,420
You, who seem to be starting far from the stream, were not holding the source and origin of the principal Church: you should have revealed what reason primarily separated you from the unity of our body.

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,973
For those parts that need healing must be exposed.

6
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:38,384
Now, with the letter's heart closed, so to speak, we do not see which parts of us should be treated first.

7
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:43,796
For such great heresies have arisen from the Christian head, that even the list of their names is immense.

8
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:56,610
To pass over the heretics of the Jews, like Dositheus the Samaritan, the Sadducees, and Pharisees: how many have emerged in the times of the apostles, it is too long to count: Simon the magician, Menander, Nicholas, and others whom obscure fame hides.

9
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,370
Why, in later times, Ebion, Apelles, Marcion, Valentinus, and Cerdon: not long after them, the Cataphrygians and Novatians, to pass over the new swarms?

10
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,412
Who then must I first refute in writing?

11
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:14,938
The very names, if you wish, a sheet will not contain: except that from your writings, condemning repentance everywhere, you declare that you agree with the Phrygians.

12
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:24,791
But in these very cases, my dearest lord, the error is so manifold and diverse, that not only this one thing in them which is against repentance, but rather many Lernaean heads must be cut off.

13
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,824
They rely on many authorities: for I believe, even the Greek Blastus is theirs.

14
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:31,428
Theodotus and Praxeas have also taught your people.

15
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:37,044
Those very Phrygians who falsely claim to be inspired by Leucius, boast that they were instructed by Proculus.

16
00:01:37,044 --> 00:01:50,624
Following Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla, what multiple controversies they have stirred about the Paschal day, about the Paraclete, about the apostles, about the prophets: and many other things, like this one about the Catholic name and the pardon of repentance.

17
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,885
Why, if we wish to discuss all these matters, a present guide is needed.

18
00:01:54,885 --> 00:02:05,128
If I were to explain only these things you write about and it was not enough, still, because we must answer those who are curious, for your sake, we will briefly discuss the matters you have written about.

19
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:09,675
If you want to know more about our beliefs, you should express your own views more clearly.

20
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:14,471
By asking obscurely, you do not make us unsure whether you are asking questions or provoking us.

21
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:24,364
Meanwhile, concerning the present matters, above all, I ask you not to lend authority to error because, as you say, there is no one in the whole world who could refute you or persuade you otherwise.

22
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:27,562
For even if we are unskilled, the Spirit of God is most skilled.

23
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:33,258
And if we are unfaithful, God is faithful, who cannot deny Himself Second Epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, verse 13.

24
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:37,255
Moreover, it was not permitted to argue with the priests of God for a long time.

25
00:02:37,255 --> 00:03:42,560
The Apostle says, "We have no such custom, nor do the churches of God" First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 11, verse 16.
After one correction Epistle to Titus, chapter 3, verse 10, as you know, the contentious person is rejected. But who can persuade someone against their will? Therefore, brother, it is not their fault but yours if no one has persuaded you of what was best. For even today, it is in your power to disregard our writings if you prefer to refute them rather than accept them.
Moreover, many resisted both the Lord Himself and His apostles; and the truth could not persuade anyone unless they agreed with it by their own faith. Thus, sir, we did not write with the confidence that we could persuade someone who resists, but with the faith that we would not deny the path of good peace to someone who is willing. If that is your mind and heart, there is no struggle with the Catholic name.
For if our people achieve this through God, there is no need to question it, given divine authority. If through man, once it is usurped, it must be exposed. Then, if it is a good name, it does not receive hatred; if bad, it lacks envy.
I hear that the Novatians are named after Novatus or Novatian. Yet I accuse the sect, not the name. Nor did anyone object to the name Montanus or the Phrygians.

26
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,922
But, you may say, during the time of the apostles, no one was called Catholic.

27
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,106
Fine, let it be so, or at least allow that.

28
00:03:49,106 --> 00:04:02,567
When heresies arose after the apostles and tried to tear apart and divide the dove of God and the queen with various names, didn't the apostolic people need a name to distinguish their unity from the errors of those who sought to divide the undefiled virgin of God?

29
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,123
Wasn't it proper for the main body to be identified with its own name?

30
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:17,806
If I were to enter a populous city today and find Marcionites, Apollinarians, Cataphrygians, Novatians, and others who call themselves Christians, how would I recognize the congregation of my people if it were not called Catholic?

31
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:20,448
Come now, who gave such names to these other groups?

32
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:23,394
Why does each city, each nation, have its own designation?

33
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:29,439
If someone questions the name Catholic, they wouldn't know the reason for their own name if I asked where it came from.

34
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,756
Surely, it is not borrowed from man, something that has endured through so many ages.

35
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:39,090
This Catholic name does not echo Marcion, Apelles, or Montanus, nor does it take heretics as its authors.

36
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,678
The Holy Spirit has taught many of us, whom God sent from heaven to the apostles as the Paraclete and teacher.

37
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:49,300
Reason, as Paul says, and honesty, and, as he says, nature itself, have taught many things.

38
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,554
What?

39
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:55,498
Do not the apostolic men, the first priests, and the most blessed martyr and teacher Cyprian, carry authority for us?

40
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,123
Do we wish to teach the teacher?

41
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:06,470
Are we wiser than him, and are we inflamed by the spirit of the flesh against him, whom noble blood and the crown of the most glorious passion produced as a witness of the eternal God?

42
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,159
What of the many priests of those times, whom one peace, along with Cyprian, unified throughout the whole world?

43
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,258
What of the many aged bishops, many martyrs, many confessors?

44
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:15,715
Come now.

45
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:20,337
If they were not suitable authors by claiming this name, will we be suitable by denying it?

46
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:23,080
And will our authority overshadow that of the fathers?

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,989
Will the sanctity of the saints yield to our correction, and will apostolic antiquity be erased by the decaying times filled with vices?

48
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:35,432
And yet, don't worry, brother: Christian is my name, but Catholic is my surname.

49
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:38,168
The former identifies me; the latter describes me.

50
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,794
By this, I am approved; by that, I am signified.

51
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:52,994
If we need to explain the meaning of the word Catholic, derived from the Greek and translated into Roman: Catholic means where there is unity, or as the more learned believe, the obedience of all to the commandments of God.

52
00:05:52,994 --> 00:07:18,669
Hence the Apostle says: "If you are obedient in everything" Second Corinthians 2:9.
And again: "For just as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one, many will be made righteous" Romans 5:19.
Therefore, one who is Catholic is also obedient. One who is obedient is also a Christian: thus, a Catholic is a Christian.
Therefore, our people are distinguished from heretics when they are called Catholic.
If Catholic means unity everywhere, as the elders believe, David himself indicates this by saying: "The queen stood in gold of Ophir, in clothing interwoven with gold" Psalm 45:9, meaning one in all.
And in the Song of Songs, the Bridegroom says: "My dove is one, my perfect one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen one of her who bore her" Song of Solomon 6:9.
And again: "With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king" Psalm 45:15.
And still: "The maidens, without number" Song of Solomon 6:8.
Therefore, one in all, and one above all. If you seek the reason for the name, it becomes clear.
As for penance, may God grant that it is not necessary for any of the faithful. May no one, after the help of the sacred font, fall into the pit of death. May priests not be forced to offer delayed consolation or teach it, lest they open a path to sin while comforting the sinner with remedies.
But we reveal this indulgence of our God to the wretched, not the blessed, not before sin, but for the uncovering of sins. It is not medicine for the healthy, but we announce it to those who are ill.

53
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:42,565
If spiritual evils have no power over those who are baptized, if the deceit of the serpent, which first led humans astray and imprinted so many marks of damnation on their descendants, has left the world, if we have already begun to reign, if no sin sneaks into our eyes, hands, or minds, then let this gift of God be discarded, let His help be rejected, let there be no confession, no groans heard; let proud righteousness scorn every remedy.

54
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:58,974
But if the Lord has provided these things for His people; if He has given rewards to those who stand and remedies to those who fall, then stop accusing divine mercy, or erasing so many titles of heavenly clemency with the objection of severity, or forbidding the Lord’s free gifts with unyielding harshness.

55
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,844
We do not grant these from our own.

56
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:06,510
Turn to me, says the Lord, with fasting, weeping, and mourning; tear your hearts Joel chapter 2, verse 12.

57
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:15,489
And again: Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts, and let them turn to the Lord, and they will receive mercy Isaiah chapter 45, verse 7.

58
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:23,880
Likewise, the Prophet cries out in this way: For God is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and who relents from sending calamity Joel chapter 2, verse 13.

59
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,210
Does the serpent have such long-lasting venom, and Christ does not have a remedy?

60
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,310
The devil kills in the world, and Christ cannot help here?

61
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,837
Certainly, be reluctant to sin, but do not be reluctant to repent.

62
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:38,151
Be ashamed to be in danger, but do not be ashamed to be saved.

63
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:42,480
Who would snatch a plank from a shipwrecked person to prevent them from escaping?

64
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,297
Who would begrudge healing wounds?

65
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:50,444
Does not David say: Every night I flood my bed with tears, I drench my couch with weeping Psalm chapter 6, verse 7.

66
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:55,308
And again: I acknowledge my sin, and I did not cover my iniquity Psalm chapter 32, verse 5.

67
00:08:55,308 --> 00:09:02,096
And still: I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my sin Psalm chapter 32, verse 5.

68
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:10,808
Did not the Prophet respond for Bathsheba’s repentance after the guilt of murder and adultery: The Lord has taken away your sin Second Samuel chapter 12, verse 13.

69
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:14,816
Did not confession free the Babylonian king after so many acts of idolatry?

70
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:17,117
And what does the Lord say?

71
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:21,881
Is it not that the one who falls will rise again, and the one who turns away will return?

72
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,825
(Jeremiah 8:4)
What do those parables of the Lord mean?

73
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:46,504
The woman finds the coin and rejoices; the shepherd brings back the wandering sheep; the father runs to meet the returning son, who had squandered all his wealth and lived with prostitutes and sinners, and he explains to the jealous brother, "This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found."
(Luke 15:32)
What about the man wounded on the road, passed by the Levite and the priest?

74
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:47,575
Is he not cared for?

75
00:09:47,575 --> 00:10:04,918
Consider what the Spirit says to the churches:
(Revelation 2)
He accuses the Ephesians of forsaking their first love; charges the Thyatirans with adultery; rebukes the Sardians for their inactivity, the Pergamons for teaching errors; and criticizes the Laodiceans for their wealth, yet invites all to repentance with amends.

76
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:31,843
What does the Apostle say to the Corinthians when he says:
"I fear that when I come, I may find many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin, and debauchery in which they have indulged."
(Second Corinthians 12:21)
And again, to the Galatians:
"If someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently, but watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."
(Galatians 6:1)
Does the head of the household only keep silver and gold vessels?

77
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:36,393
Does he not also honor clay and wooden ones, some of which are repaired and restored?

78
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:42,602
Now I rejoice, says the Apostle, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance.

79
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:51,488
(Second Corinthians 7:9)
And again:
"Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret."
(Second Corinthians 7:10)
But one could not repent.

80
00:10:51,488 --> 00:11:00,106
No one commands labor without reward:
"The worker deserves his wages."
(Matthew 10:10; Luke 10:7)
God never threatens a penitent unless He forgives the penitent.

81
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:02,033
You might say, only God can do this.

82
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,405
That's true, but what He does through His priests is His power.

83
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,738
What does He say to the Apostles?

84
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:14,859
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19; John 20:23).

85
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,547
Why would He say this if they were not allowed to bind and loose people?

86
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,801
Or is this permission only for the Apostles?

87
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:26,026
If so, is it also only for them to baptize, give the Holy Spirit, and cleanse the sins of the nations?

88
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:28,895
Because all of this was commanded to the Apostles alone.

89
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:39,294
But if the power to loosen bonds and administer the sacraments is given in one place, then it has either been passed down to us through the form and power of the Apostles, or none of it has been revoked.

90
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:43,392
"I laid the foundation, but someone else builds on it" (First Corinthians 3:10).

91
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:47,644
Therefore, those who build on it, build on what the Apostles' teaching has founded.

92
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:55,123
Hence, even bishops are called Apostles, as Paul explains about Epaphroditus: "My brother and fellow worker, but your apostle" (Philippians 2:25).

93
00:11:55,123 --> 00:12:03,473
If the power of washing and chrism, and the greater and far-reaching charisms, descends from the bishops, then the right to bind and loose also comes down to them.

94
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:12,745
Even if we claim this right rashly because of our sins, God will not deny it to those who hold the chair of the Apostles and are holy; He even granted them the name of His Only Son.

95
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:23,400
I would write more, brother, if I were not pressed by the urgency of the returning messenger, and if I did not wish to reserve more detailed remarks for you in person or for a full confession of your purpose.

96
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,525
Let no one despise the bishop because of human consideration.

97
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:34,721
Remember that the Apostle Peter called our Lord the Bishop; "But now you have returned," he said, "to the Bishop and Shepherd of your souls" (First Peter 2:25).

98
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,051
What will be denied to the bishop, in whom the name of God works?

99
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:42,815
He will indeed give an account if he does anything wrongly or judges corruptly and impiously.

100
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:51,473
Nor is it prejudged against God that the works of a bad builder should be undone; meanwhile, if that administration is holy, it continues as an assistant to God's works.

101
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:57,002
Look, the Apostle writes to the laypeople: If you give something to anyone, I also give it.

102
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:06,064
For what I have given, if I have given anything, I have given it for you in the presence of Christ; so that it is not possessed by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.

103
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:12,566
(2 Corinthians 2:10-11)
If the Apostle says he has given what the laypeople give, how can what the bishop has done be rejected?

104
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:23,471
Therefore, neither baptism, nor the forgiveness of sins, nor the renewal of the body is granted by his holy authority; because nothing is commanded by personal usurpation, and all of it flows from apostolic right.

105
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:33,813
I know, brother, that this same permission for repentance is not given to everyone indiscriminately, nor is it granted before either the interpretation of the divine will or perhaps a visitation occurs.

106
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:44,309
With great weight and great balance, after many groans and the shedding of tears, after the prayers of the whole church, true repentance is not denied in such a way that no one prejudges Christ, the Judge.

107
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,916
If you write more openly about what you think, brother, you will be instructed more fully.

108
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:52,434
Letter Two About the Letters of Sympronian.

109
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:55,944
Bishop Pacianus greets his brother Sympronian.

110
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:59,293
In addressing a lengthy question, I'll aim to be as brief as possible.

111
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:02,642
Brother, I won't respond to your disguised verbal attacks with malice.

112
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:06,661
We are commanded to pray for those who persecute us and to bless those who curse us.

113
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:07,283
Matthew 5:44.

114
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:11,207
Deceit is like a fox, but force is like a lion: both very far from human behavior.

115
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:13,073
But deceit is more deserving of hatred.

116
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:18,958
When you believe you can do more harm, you ask as if ignorant; when you think you are teaching, you pretend to be learning.

117
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:41,016
The old Pharisees called the Lord "Rabbi" when they posed the riddles of the law; they called Him "Master" when they claimed all teaching for themselves.
Whatever you do, brother, you will know it all simply from me.
I prefer to be seen as unskillful rather than malicious.
I'd rather be judged foolish than cunning.
So, before I explain the reason for our faith (which troubles you), let's address a few points from your letters that you raised for discussion.

118
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:41,159
II.

119
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,088
You say you were refreshed by my earlier letters, yet immediately add that I responded with bitterness.

120
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:52,786
If bitter things refresh you, I don't know what sweet things would do; unless, like in medicine, the bitter often heals more than the sweet.

121
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:58,145
But please, review my letters to see if they were sprinkled with any gall, any prideful or unpleasant responses.

122
00:14:58,145 --> 00:15:00,920
You say I mentioned many heresies that no one asked about.

123
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,695
Well, what does it matter to you if you weren't a heretic?

124
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:14,605
When you raised a question about our faith and said you wanted to be taught, I wrote that ignorance has many causes, especially in your case, so you could reveal them, and I wouldn't have to struggle with addressing many issues.

125
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:16,662
I responded calmly about the Catholic name.

126
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:20,107
For I said it doesn't matter to anyone else what someone else is called.

127
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:29,820
And if you demanded the force of the name, whatever marvelous thing it might be, whether one among all or one above all, or what I haven't said before, the son of the king, that is, the Christian people.

128
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,930
Certainly, it wasn't given to us to fall through such great ages.

129
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:38,378
I'm glad that even though you've preferred others, you still agree with us about the name.

130
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:40,620
What if you denied it? Nature would cry out.

131
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,607
Or if you still doubt, let's be silent.

132
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:47,041
Both of us, as we are called, will be what we are by the testimony of the ancient name.

133
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:52,494
However, if you insist more stubbornly, see that a virtuous man might shout at you:
Why do you ask my name?

134
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,073
It is wonderful
(Judges 13:18).

135
00:15:54,073 --> 00:16:06,966
Then you added indeed, from where Catholics draw this name, it should not be reproached; for neither should it be imputed to the Valentinians if they are named from Valentinus, nor to the Phrygians if from Phrygia, nor to the Novatians if from Novatian.

136
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:17,362
Here you are deeply disturbed, and as if pricked by a sharp point, you rise up; for in anger you shout:
Does it harm the holy man Cyprian
that his people have an apostate name, or Capitoline, or Syndrean?

137
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,349
You insult; and behold, I am not moved.

138
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,235
Were we called by any of these names?

139
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:29,337
Ask the world, brother, and the whole course of years; whether this name has clung to us, or whether Cyprian's people were called anything other than Catholic.

140
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,274
I have never heard any of these names.

141
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:35,656
Now see, if anyone could be called by a name that he does not know was imposed on him.

142
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:36,166
What then?

143
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,497
These are curses, not names; and the curses of the angry, the curses of the insolent.

144
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:44,472
As many names as you want, I can call you too, if it were allowed to be angry.

145
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:47,020
Do you call Cyprian holy, and his people apostate?

146
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,224
How?

147
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:50,078
If the root is holy, so are the branches (Romans 11:16).

148
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,861
Am I an apostate, or is it Novatus?

149
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:56,499
Novatus, I say, betrayed his father, abandoned the Church, and his wife gave birth in vain?

150
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:04,448
Am I an apostate, or is it Novatian, whom a letter falsely called a bishop in his absence; who, with no one consecrating him, took the seat draped in linen?

151
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:08,219
But these things later: meanwhile, tell me yourselves what you are called.

152
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:11,124
Do you deny that the Novatians are called after Novatian?

153
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,519
Whatever name you impose, it will always stick.

154
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,309
Search all the annals (if it seems proper), and trust all the ages: you will answer Christian.

155
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,571
When I inquire about the sect, you will not deny being Novatian.

156
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:29,443
But I'm not blaming your Novatian name, which you've concealed so many times with evasive words and hidden in some secret place.

157
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,694
Just admit it: there's no crime in the name.

158
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:33,638
Why do you hide when asked repeatedly?

159
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,275
Why are you ashamed of the name?

160
00:17:35,275 --> 00:17:38,140
When you first wrote, I thought you were a Cataphrygian.

161
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,981
Do you confess in the second letter?

162
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,976
Do you envy my name and avoid your own?

163
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:45,301
See what causes the shame that makes you avoid what it is called.

164
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:47,092
What are you criticizing and doing?

165
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:51,900
As if we had come to a rhetorician, or as if we should handle art or explain verses of Virgil?

166
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,839
When I named several heretics, I added: And those whom obscure fame conceals.

167
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,596
And where do you think this comes from, a verse of Virgil, if you did not know Virgil at all?

168
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,847
But I deny that I placed the verse in order.

169
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:10,827
For I said: Those whom obscure fame conceals; as it is customary for speakers to say something from the abundance of human speech that has been said before.

170
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:13,590
But you repeated the verse in its order and structure.

171
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,324
Did you love Virgil so much that you thought it wrong to break his verse?

172
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:19,268
And yet I learned it from a young age.

173
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,519
Is it surprising if I fell into what I knew?

174
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,867
Brother, you show such effort, now reading what you once blushed to read from others?

175
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:41,571
You should accuse a Latin-speaking person educated in Latin as much as you would accuse a Greek-speaking Greek, a Parthian-speaking Parthian, or a Punic-speaking Phoenician: the Medes, Egyptians, and Hebrews have their own languages according to the abundance of the Lord, who modulated it into 120 tongues.

176
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:43,106
A bishop spoke a poetic verse.

177
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:44,538
What about the Apostle Paul?

178
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:48,068
Does he feel ashamed when he spoke and confirmed that Athenian verse?

179
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:56,867
For in the Acts of the Apostles it says; For some of your own poets have said: For we are also his offspring: forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God (Acts 17:28-29).

180
00:18:56,867 --> 00:19:04,796
And again he said to Titus: One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons (Titus 1:12-13).

181
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,637
And he adds: This testimony is true.

182
00:19:06,637 --> 00:19:11,701
Thus we sin by example: we are not rhetoricians, but we believe in any voice, the abundance of God.

183
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:18,946
Latium, Egypt, Athens, Thracians, Arabs, Spaniards all acknowledge God; the Holy Spirit understands every language.

184
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:48,006
Why do you say, "I will protect my writings with lively cedar because of the decayed enemies of the Muses."?
Which Muses do you mean? Are you referring to those who invented letters and wrote papers that moths pursued?
Tell me, brother, did the Muses discover letters? Is not everything through the Lord, and everything from God?
Besides those 120 languages, was there another language of the Muses? Hesiod lied about that on Helicon, but for the study of the Athenians, for whom, as the Apostle says, "They spent their time doing nothing but talking" (Acts 17:21).

185
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:54,950
We, with the Apostle as our witness (First Corinthians 14:10, 18), embrace all kinds of voices, all types of languages inspired by God.

186
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:04,568
However, I forgive you, brother, if you presume anything from your author, and you combine Novatian's philosophy, through which he suffered shipwreck in religion, with Hesiod's authority.

187
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:12,591
Nevertheless, you should remember the Apostle, who said: "See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy" (Colossians 2:8).

188
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:17,580
How is it that you think Catholics should be blamed if kings or empires have ever persecuted you?

189
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,466
Conversely, should it not be blamed on you whenever Catholics endured the persecution of kings?

190
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,369
Even our pagan princes persecuted us.

191
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,273
You endured the hatred of Christians?

192
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:28,021
But our people suffered even more.

193
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:33,319
Let the one who did this consider with what mind, with what spirit; whether he sought peace or discord.

194
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,382
But even if some of them sinned, does it nullify the faith of God (Romans 3:3)?

195
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,131
Do not think it was our complaint.

196
00:20:39,131 --> 00:21:01,504
But when Christian princes began to rise through our faith; the princes themselves, favoring the Catholic, that is, their own side, were moved by their own grief; unless perhaps Daniel should be blamed for being avenged by Darius; or the most holy woman Esther, when the king's leader was killed for her; or the three youths, because for their sake after the trial by flames, the Babylonian king threatened the profane and unbelievers.

197
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:04,487
Did not Peter confound Simon, with the judge as a witness?

198
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:08,646
Isn't Paul, with the support of Sergius, the one who blinds Elymas?

199
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:12,391
He would have been vindicated in Jerusalem if he had held onto any faith.

200
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:17,677
Don't you know that the powers themselves serve the innocent and work for the good of the holy fathers?

201
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,577
As the Apostle says: Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.

202
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,834
Do you want to be unafraid of the authority?

203
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:30,300
Do what is good, and you will have praise from it, through the Lord: For he is God's servant to you for good (Romans 13:3, 4).

204
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,738
Yet, I have not complained about anyone, nor have I sought revenge.

205
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:38,869
I don't think the Novatians hinder me, whose smallness and weakness I could boast about if I wished.

206
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,307
Look, no one accuses your people to the emperor, and you are alone.

207
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:47,387
However, we all must stand before the judgment seat of God (Romans 14:10; Second Corinthians 5:19).

208
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:52,057
One thing I know, the Novatians would complain if their cause were pleasing to any princes.

209
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:54,725
You say it is more useful to conquer than to please.

210
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:58,112
But those led by the desire to conquer advance through contention.

211
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:05,090
The Apostle indeed says: If anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God (First Corinthians 9:16).

212
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:14,686
On the contrary, concerning the effort to please: I try to please everyone in every way, not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved (First Corinthians 10:33).

213
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:21,819
But you, while thinking of your own advantage and not those of your brothers, prefer to crush by conquering rather than revive by pleasing.

214
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:27,053
To overcome evil with good is reasonable; however, to want to win in any matter is insane presumption.

215
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:35,109
This is not from Apostolic law, but from Greek customs, where it is thought that all the practices of the Lacedaemonians are driven by the desire to conquer.

216
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:40,189
Even that filthy pig and insane tiger, what else do they want but to conquer rather than to please?

217
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:43,730
You write that you are free; and thus contentious things delight you.

218
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:50,400
But I, occupied with Catholic matters, received your letters after nearly thirty days, and they were repeated after another forty.

219
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,042
You say I am angry; far from it.

220
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:56,301
I believe I am stirred up like a bee, which sometimes defends honey with its sting.

221
00:22:56,301 --> 00:23:01,843
But review the letters from both sides; you will see whether we are filling the page with stings or flowers.

222
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:07,651
Of course, the Apostle, as mentioned in Titus 1:11, points out those who need to be silenced.

223
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:11,283
But pay attention. We, like doves, fight more with words than with teeth.

224
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,771
If only it were true that you wanted to be taught!

225
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:17,901
I would already be offering you the Holy Spirit's anointing oils with my own hands.

226
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:18,648
Do you love me?

227
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,991
I know I have not hurt you.

228
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:24,519
But you would truly love me if you did not think differently and kindly approached my work.

229
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,156
Are you surprised that I like the letters of Cyprian?

230
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,191
Why wouldn't I admire the blessed martyr and Catholic priest?

231
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,585
You bring up Novatian to me?

232
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:36,809
I hear he was a philosopher of his time; I am not surprised he strayed from the Church of the living God.

233
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:46,164
I recognize that he abandoned the root of the old law and the source of the old people, envied Cornelius, sided with Novatus's madness, and became a bishop without legitimate consecration.

234
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:52,781
Thus, he was not truly made through the letters of those pretending to be Confessors, who would tear apart the members of one mother.

235
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:57,757
I will prove all this to you, brother, through the confession of your own people and their writings.

236
00:23:57,757 --> 00:24:08,157
This philosopher of yours, trying to establish his own wisdom, as the Apostle says in Romans 10:3, is not subject to the wisdom of God; because through his own wisdom, the world did not recognize God's wisdom.

237
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:11,839
You think that Novatian suffered and that Cyprian said something about it.

238
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,526
My opponent came before me; see how clearly I respond.

239
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:19,701
Novatian never suffered martyrdom, nor is this heard or read from the words of the most blessed Cyprian.

240
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:35,225
You have his letters in which he often mentions Cornelius, the bishop of the city whom Novatian envied at that time, resisting hostile leaders, often confessing and being harassed, made leader of many Confessors and many Martyrs, and gloriously crowned with them while Novatian was still alive and even carefree.

241
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:39,654
Indeed, he left the Church of Christ so as not to be burdened by the labor of confession.

242
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:46,072
Driven by envy, he could not endure Cornelius's episcopate; then he committed himself to Novatus, mocked by the letters of a few.

243
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:49,307
Cyprian's letters will teach you all these things about Novatian.

244
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:56,278
Moreover, even if Novatian suffered something, he was not killed; and even if he was killed, he was not crowned.

245
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:56,701
Why not?

246
00:24:56,701 --> 00:25:02,945
Because he was outside the peace of the Church, outside harmony, outside that mother of which a martyr must be a part.

247
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:17,338
Listen to the Apostle:
"And if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing" (First Corinthians 13:2-3).

248
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:25,276
Cyprian, however, suffered in harmony with everyone, in common peace, among the group of Confessors, and often confessed during repeated persecutions.

249
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:29,456
He was tormented with much laceration and finally was given the saving chalice.

250
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:30,673
This was to be crowned.

251
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:34,801
Therefore, let Novatian keep his letters to himself; his arrogance, his pride.

252
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:39,563
While he lifts himself up high, he is struck down; while sparing no one, he is poured out.

253
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:44,114
Behold, he who blocks the path of salvation for his brothers with unyielding rigidity!

254
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:49,352
Behold, he who confidently claims to carry himself openly and to purify the Lord's threshing floor!

255
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:54,432
Have mercy on yourself, brother Sympronian, and do not let Novatian deceive you with this front.

256
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,771
Do not consider him more just because he despises others in comparison to himself.

257
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:04,804
Often boldness lies about confidence; and to those desperate sinners, a false image of a good conscience flatters.

258
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:12,688
On the contrary, all humility is innocence, even that which is indebted, even that which is sinful, even that which soothes its soul with the sinner.

259
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:26,129
"Blot me out," says Moses (Exodus 32:32), "from the book you have written; so that sinners may not perish."
The Apostle says,
"I wished that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood" (Romans 9:3).

260
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:30,997
Surely both intercede for sinners; and because of this, neither Moses nor Paul offended God.

261
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,584
Is Novatian better than these?

262
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:34,066
A corrector of the Prophets?

263
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,442
A teacher of the Apostles?

264
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:38,035
Does he now seem with Christ like the same Moses?

265
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:40,627
Is he now elevated to the third heaven like Paul?

266
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,009
Is he now heard alone, neglecting all others?

267
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,654
This should suffice as a response to your letters.

268
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:54,935
Because you discussed at length about not doing penance, or doing it before baptism, and filled your treatise with many examples, I will respond to each point thoroughly.

269
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:57,402
I will not remain silent about which faith is truer.

270
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:02,051
As you have generously commanded our attention, please afford the same opportunity to my treatise.

271
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:08,407
Perhaps the Lord will grant that, as we have offered ourselves to you with patience, we may also gain some benefit from your patience.

272
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:14,621
May the Lord be pleased to guard and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian and Catholic, and be in harmony with us.

273
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:14,858
Amen.

274
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:18,718
Letter Three Against the writings of the Novatians.

275
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:22,055
Bishop Pacianus greets his brother Sympronian.

276
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:34,748
The entire treatise of the Novatians, which you have sent to me, my brother Sympronian, revolves around this: that it is not allowed to repent after baptism; that the Church cannot forgive mortal sin, and that it perishes by receiving sinners.

277
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:42,740
A noble honor, a unique authority, great steadfastness; to reject the guilty, to avoid the touch of sinners, and to wrongly trust in their own innocence.

278
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,202
Who advocates this, brother?

279
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:45,403
Moses, Paul, or Christ?

280
00:27:45,403 --> 00:27:55,798
Moses wishes to be blotted out of the book for the sake of blasphemers (Exodus 32:32); Paul wishes to be accursed for his brothers (Romans 9:3); and the Lord himself prefers to suffer for the unjust.

281
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:56,999
None of these, you say.

282
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:57,469
Who then?

283
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:58,723
Novatian commanded this.

284
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:09,326
Someone immaculate and pure, who had not heard of Novatus, who had never deserted the Church, who was made bishop by bishops, consecrated by the ordinary right, and followed a vacant chair in the Church?

285
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:12,355
What does it matter to you, you say; Novatian taught this.

286
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:14,288
But when, brother, and in what times?

287
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,221
Immediately after the Lord's passion?

288
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:19,825
After the reign of Decius, nearly 300 years after the Lord's passion.

289
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:20,347
What then?

290
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:26,249
Did he follow prophets like the Cataphrygians, or someone like Apelles; or did he receive such authority himself?

291
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,503
Did he speak in tongues?

292
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:28,339
Did he prophesy?

293
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,592
Could he raise the dead?

294
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:34,032
He ought to have possessed some of these things to introduce a new law of the gospel.

295
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:43,382
And if the Apostle cries out against it: Even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse (Galatians 1:8).

296
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:46,777
Novatian understood it this way, you say: but Christ taught this.

297
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:49,911
So from Christ up to the reign of Decius, no one understood?

298
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:58,320
After Decius, every bishop was impatient; all others were lax, preferring to associate with the lost and to perish with the wretched, wounded by another's wound?

299
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,387
With Novatian as avenger, justice is liberated; under his authority, whatever erred is corrected.

300
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:06,834
Come, you say, let us contend with examples and fight with reason.

301
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:14,544
Until now, I have been at ease, content with the peace of the Church's tradition and the congregation's ancient practices.

302
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:18,195
I have neither learned to engage in discord nor sought out arguments.

303
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:27,032
After you separated yourself from the rest of the body and divided from the mother, you began to delve into books, constantly searching and probing every hidden thing.

304
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,779
You disturb whatever is peaceful.

305
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,330
Our ancestors did not voluntarily engage in disputes; our security is straightforward.

306
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,293
What fortified argument have you brought from your side?

307
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:42,432
I do not know what Novatian did, what Novatus committed, what Evaristus exaggerated, or what Nicostratus proclaimed.

308
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:47,512
While I disregard your weapons, I am unaware of them; see if you can contend with unarmed truth.

309
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:51,428
Nevertheless, let us wait to see what you object to and what you will say.

310
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:54,021
Could pure truth or innocent simplicity stand up?

311
00:29:54,021 --> 00:30:17,569
You propose, and rightly so, that the Church is a people renewed by water and the Holy Spirit, without denying the name of Christ, the temple and house of God, the pillar and foundation of truth, as mentioned in First Timothy 3:15, a holy virgin with the most chaste thoughts, the bride of Christ from His bones and flesh, as stated in Ephesians 5:30, having no spot or wrinkle, from Ephesians 5:27, upholding the complete rights of the Gospels.

312
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:18,892
Who among us denies this?

313
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:48,738
Indeed, we even add that the Church is a queen in a gold-embroidered and colorful robe, as described in Psalm 45:10, a fruitful vine on the sides of the Lord's house, as mentioned in Psalm 128:3, the mother of countless young maidens, as in Song of Solomon 6:7, a unique, beautiful dove, perfect and the mother of her children, as stated in Song of Solomon 6:8, the mother of all, built on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone, as mentioned in Ephesians 2:20, a great house enriched with a diversity of vessels.

314
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:52,072
But these are our matters for later; for now, let us see yours.

315
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:55,194
The Church is a people reborn of water and the Holy Spirit.

316
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:55,671
Go ahead.

317
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:57,523
Who has closed the fountain of God?

318
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,110
Who has taken away the Spirit?

319
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,132
Indeed, with us, the water is living, the very one that springs from Christ.

320
00:31:03,132 --> 00:31:07,101
You, separated from the everlasting fountain, from where are you generated?

321
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:11,493
The Holy Spirit has not departed from the principal mother; how has it reached you?

322
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:20,482
Unless he perhaps followed a discordant path, abandoning many priests and content with an unconsecrated seat, he loved the worn-out pool of a fake spring.

323
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:24,705
Where does your congregation receive the Spirit if it is not anointed by a priest?

324
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:28,155
Where does the water come from if it has separated from the source?

325
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:31,863
Where is the renewal if it has lost the foundation of peaceful marriage?

326
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:34,850
The Church is a people who do not deny the name of Christ.

327
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,506
Do we not have among us confessors proven by chains, fires, and swords?

328
00:31:38,506 --> 00:32:17,128
You might say, "There were, but they perished by accepting the deniers."
Should I remain silent that Novatian, while he was still in the Church, wrote, advised, and read a letter about accepting deniers or the lapsed?
Meanwhile, who can you persuade that the whole Church collapsed because the lapsed were accepted?
That by admitting the repentant, the admitting congregation became deniers?
And if some congregation was more lenient, did the others who did not approve of this act but followed custom and peace, lose the Christian name?
Hear the voice of Jeremiah:
"In those days, they shall no longer say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,' but everyone shall die for their own sin" (Jeremiah 31:29-30).

329
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:25,007
Nor is the Lord silent in Ezekiel:
"As the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. Everyone shall die for their own sin" (Ezekiel 18:4).

330
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:34,843
And further down:
"The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him" (Ezekiel 18:20).

331
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:44,164
You yourself provide that example:
"Even if these three men, Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in it, they would not deliver sons or daughters; they alone would be saved" (Ezekiel 14:16).

332
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:48,541
Behold, those who are in the midst of sinners are saved, but they cannot save others.

333
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:54,618
You bind the entire world with the chains of a few; you condemn the whole Church with the weakness of a small portion.

334
00:32:54,618 --> 00:33:00,798
What about all the saints with you, whom Novatus educated, Evaristus chose, Nicostratus taught, and Novatian instructed?

335
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:10,060
You have rejected thorns and thistles; you don't have weeds among your crops; your grains are already cleaned: the cleaner will come to you without a winnowing fan.

336
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,432
Are you the only one who will not have chaff?

337
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:15,384
Come on, say the rest: The Church is the body of Christ.

338
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:23,343
Certainly a body, not just a limb: a body gathered from many parts and members into one, as the Apostle says: For the body is not one member, but many.

339
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:28,140
Therefore, the Church is a complete body, both solid and spread throughout the whole world.

340
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:35,256
Like a city, whose parts are united; not like you Novatians, a certain isolated fragment and lump, separated from the rest of the body.

341
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:47,432
The Church is the temple of God: certainly a large temple, a great house, indeed having golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and clay ones, some for honor, many indeed magnificent for various uses of different works destined.

342
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:51,280
The Church is a holy virgin, with the purest senses, the bride of Christ.

343
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,389
A virgin; it is true: but also a mother.

344
00:33:53,389 --> 00:34:00,083
A bride; it is evident: but also a wife and spouse taken from her husband: therefore bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh.

345
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:07,463
For David said of her: Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the sides of your house: your children like olive shoots around your table.

346
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:14,104
Therefore, this virgin has many offspring and countless progeny, filling the whole world, always buzzing with populous swarms.

347
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:26,702
This mother's care and tender affection for her children is great: the good are honored, the proud are chastised, the sick are cared for: no one perishes, no one is despised: the secure offspring are retained under the mother's indulgence.

348
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:33,344
The Church is without spot or wrinkle: that is, it does not have heresies, not Valentinians, not Cataphrygians, not Novatians.

349
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,457
For in these are certain stained and wrinkled folds, envying the adornments of precious garments.

350
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:46,153
Moreover, the sinner and penitent is not a blemish of the Church; because as long as he sins and does not repent, he is placed outside the Church.

351
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:49,494
When one stops sinning, they are already healed.

352
00:34:49,494 --> 00:34:55,709
But a heretic tears apart the garment of the Lord, the Church of Christ, by disrupting, corrupting, and wrinkling it.

353
00:34:55,709 --> 00:35:02,084
For when, he says, there are divisions and arguments among you, are you not worldly and walking according to human ways?

354
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,253
First Corinthians 3:3.

355
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:05,006
Their talk spreads like gangrene.

356
00:35:05,006 --> 00:35:06,069
Second Timothy 2:17.

357
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,619
This is the stain on unity, this is the wrinkle.

358
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:13,825
Finally, when the Apostle speaks about these things, he proposes the love of Christ and affection.

359
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:17,544
Just as Christ, he says, loved the Church and gave himself up for her.

360
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:18,340
Ephesians 5:25.

361
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,219
So that he might exclude heretics, because they did not know how to love.

362
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,875
But why is this important to a miserable penitent?

363
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,425
Because he desires both to love and to be loved.

364
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,772
The Church is the guardian of the complete laws of the Gospels.

365
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:33,269
Complete, indeed, because it is whole and full.

366
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:48,675
Where rewards are given to the faithful, where tears are not denied to the miserable, where the sick are healed, where arrogant health and proud justice claim nothing for themselves, where diligent charity endures in everything, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things.

367
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:49,897
First Corinthians 13:7.

368
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,031
Hence the Apostle’s saying: Who is weak, and I am not weak?

369
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:56,006
Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with indignation?

370
00:35:56,006 --> 00:35:57,334
Second Corinthians 11:29.

371
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:01,956
Where the whole brotherhood bears its burdens together, suffering in mutual compassion.

372
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:08,012
All bearing with one another in love, striving earnestly to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

373
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:08,756
Ephesians 4:3.

374
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:15,131
This will be the Church, brother Sympronian; this will be the people reborn in Christ through water and the Holy Spirit.

375
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:24,003
You say, I do not know whether a sin can be forgiven by bishops, since the Lord said: Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.

376
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:24,747
Matthew 10:33.

377
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:34,681
Why then did your Novatian, who was not even falsely a priest with episcopal authority, long before Cornelius became bishop of Rome, before he envied Cornelius’s priesthood, suggest this?

378
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:38,453
You have the testimony of Cyprian; Cyprian whom you could never defame.

379
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:48,072
In one place, he wrote to Antonianus like this:
It was also mentioned that Novatian was writing at the time, and he recited what he had written with his own voice.

380
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:56,207
Moses, who was then a confessor and now already a martyr, was signing so that peace might be given to those who had fallen, were weak, and in their final moments.

381
00:36:56,207 --> 00:37:01,228
These letters were sent throughout the whole world and brought to the attention of all the churches.

382
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:03,036
What do you say, brother Sympronian?

383
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:07,756
Novatian wrote this, and to add to the service of pure will, he also recited what was written.

384
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:12,928
His right hand is a witness, the hand that wrote it is a witness: the tongue that read it is a witness.

385
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:16,443
Cornelius, for whose sake all this envy erupted, was not yet a bishop.

386
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:26,184
Much later, with many fellow bishops, with many confessors, and immediately with martyrs, as Cyprian himself writes, he agreed to the counsel of the elders that it was permissible to give peace.

387
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:31,105
If the way to repentance is to be denied, Novatian is at fault, who wrote, advised, and read this.

388
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,863
Where then was the impatient rigor?

389
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,419
Where was that fierce judgment?

390
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:38,587
If no one had preferred Cornelius to you, the authority of the writer would remain.

391
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:46,019
Now the whole opinion is displeasing, now weapons are being thrown at us, supplied by those whose authority strengthened the cause of those weapons.

392
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,228
When did this very heresy of Novatian begin?

393
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:51,090
Listen, please, and notice the whole order of your error.

394
00:37:51,090 --> 00:38:01,535
Cornelius, already made a bishop in Rome by sixteen bishops, had taken the place of the vacant chair, and with the chastity he possessed in his virginity, he endured frequent persecutions from an angry ruler.

395
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:17,502
Then, by chance, a certain presbyter Novatus from Africa, after defrauding widows in the Carthaginian church, robbing orphans, denying church money, casting his father out of the house and leaving him to die of hunger without burial, striking his pregnant wife's womb with a kick causing her to miscarry, came to Rome.

396
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:23,026
And while in Carthage, with the brothers in the church pressing, and the day of his trial approaching, he hid.

397
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:32,462
Not long after, Novatian, anxious about the bishopric of Cornelius (since he had hoped for it himself), gathered some supporters, as often happens in these situations.

398
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:36,059
He encouraged the doubtful and urged them to hope for something great.

399
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,246
Among them were some who had escaped the storm of persecution.

400
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:42,946
Cornelius, however, incited envy over the issue of receiving the lapsed.

401
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:53,790
Novatian sent their letters to him, and from the authority of these letters, while the bishop was already seated in Rome, he assumed the title of another bishop, violating the unique authority of the priesthood.

402
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,107
He accused Cornelius of communing with the lapsed and claimed innocence for himself.

403
00:38:58,107 --> 00:39:03,554
Against him, I must defend myself; against him, I must assert my honor; against him, I must clear my name.

404
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,586
But you might say, “Why do you bishops approve such things?

405
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:08,385
” Let someone else defend Novatian.

406
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:12,137
This cause may seem inexcusable to others, but it may be pleasing to you.

407
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:14,244
To you, anyone who is guilty is innocent.

408
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:17,481
Do not accuse another of a crime for which you cannot be freed.

409
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:24,522
Come, we bishops must owe our entire honor because we have received the name of the apostles and are marked by the designation of Christ.

410
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:29,096
You say, “The Lord denies the denier,” yet you do not want to acknowledge him who denies.

411
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:30,535
Who acknowledges the denier?

412
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:38,758
The one who drives to repentance, rebukes, shows the crime, opens the wounds, reminds them of eternal punishments, and corrects by the destruction of the flesh.

413
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:40,813
This is to chastise, not to acknowledge.

414
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:44,308
The Lord says to us, “You are the salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13).

415
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:48,728
Therefore, by saying this, we rightly season, and whoever hears will not be worthless.

416
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:52,325
You see that we do not trample on the Lord’s judgment, but approve it.

417
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,689
We do not reject severity but reveal His will.

418
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:59,880
But you say, “You forgive sins to the penitent, whereas you are only allowed to remit sin in baptism.

419
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,944
” Not to me indeed, but to God alone, who grants forgiveness in baptism and does not reject the tears of the penitent.

420
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:13,704
Moreover, what I do, I do not by my own right, but by the Lord’s: “We are God's co-workers,” he says, “you are God’s building” (First Corinthians 3:9).

421
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:18,028
And again: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.

422
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:23,178
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.

423
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:24,414
First Corinthians 3:6-7.

424
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:31,161
Therefore, whether we baptize, urge repentance, or grant forgiveness to those who repent, we do all this with Christ as the author.

425
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:34,921
You need to see whether Christ can do this, whether Christ has done this.

426
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:40,019
If forgiveness of sins could be given to those who repent, you say, then baptism was not necessary.

427
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:41,358
What a foolish comparison!

428
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:47,539
Baptism is the sacrament of the Lord's passion; the forgiveness for the repentant is the merit of the one who confesses.

429
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:52,174
Anyone can obtain the former, because it is the gift of God’s grace; that is, a free gift.

430
00:40:52,174 --> 00:41:01,341
However, the latter is the work of the few who rise after a fall, who recover after wounds, who are helped by tearful prayers, who come back to life after the death of the flesh.

431
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:07,315
You wrongly claim that I have misused the example that God said: I prefer the repentance of a sinner to their death.

432
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:08,036
Ezekiel 33:11.

433
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:14,577
What if I had added the words of Isaiah: When you turn and groan, then you will be saved and you will know where you have been?

434
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:16,740
Isaiah 30:15, according to the Septuagint.

435
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:23,178
What if I had added this from Revelation: Remember where you have fallen from, and repent, and do the works you did at first?

436
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:23,950
Revelation 2:5.

437
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,092
You will say these were spoken to the nations before baptism.

438
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:32,242
Listen to the Apostle: We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law.

439
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:32,860
Romans 3:19.

440
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,444
Therefore, the condition of repentance will not apply to those who lived without the law.

441
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:42,388
Even if they repented, they did so freely by faith, not bound by the law’s obligation to repent.

442
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:47,075
So you will say that even the Jews who repented before baptism cannot repent after baptism.

443
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:49,238
Who taught you this, brother Sympronianus?

444
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:53,512
Who persuaded you that someone who has repented before should not repent afterward?

445
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,212
But we will look into this later.

446
00:41:55,212 --> 00:42:05,976
In the meantime, if repentance is closed off to the Jews after baptism because they fulfilled it before, at least concede that the nations who did not know the law of repentance before should repent afterward.

447
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,220
But even concerning the Jews, I do not want you to be mistaken.

448
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,417
They repented earlier because they had corrupted the old baptism and, after betraying their faith, they repented.

449
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:36,635
Listen to the Apostle:
"I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ"
(First Corinthians 10:1-4).

450
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:39,745
Therefore, they had violated this baptism and thus repented.

451
00:42:39,745 --> 00:43:32,206
Let us see then what you say:
"If God often commands a person to repent, you say, He often allows a person to sin."
What are you saying? Does the one who often shows the remedy for a crime reveal the crime? Just as a doctor who heals frequently teaches to be wounded? God does not want a person to sin even once, and yet He frees them from sin.
And surely, when He frees, He does not teach sin; just as the one who rescues from a fire does not show the fire; nor does the one who saves a shipwrecked person from rocks drive them onto the rocks. It is one thing to be freed from danger, another to be driven to danger.
And perhaps I would allow this to be believed if repentance were considered a delight, which imposes such labor, demands the destruction of the flesh, constant tears, and eternal groans. Would the healed person want to cut themselves again, to be burned again? Would they want to sin again and repent again, when it is written:
"Do not add sin, lest something worse happens to you"
(John 5:14)?

452
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:36,664
And furthermore:
"I will not have mercy on the one who sins constantly"
(Sirach 12:3).

453
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:49,935
But if, as you say, one is driven to sin by the medicine of repentance shown; what then will the one do to whom repentance itself is closed off; to whom, with the remedy in despair, the whole wound is covered; to whom, entirely, the path of life is denied?

454
00:43:49,935 --> 00:44:06,524
In baptism, you say, we die once, as the Apostle says:
"Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too may walk in newness of life"
(Romans 6:3-4).

455
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:07,509
What is surprising?

456
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:14,292
The Apostle taught that we should strive to be new, so that no one would sin; but if someone did sin, they should repent.

457
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:22,410
The one who was whole should live, and the one who was healed should also live: the innocent would receive a crown, and the penitent would obtain pardon.

458
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,382
One would get a reward, the other would receive healing.

459
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:35,623
Finally, the same Apostle says: "For if while we were still sinners, Christ died for us; much more, now that we are justified by his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath" (Romans 5:9-10).

460
00:44:35,623 --> 00:44:38,170
From the wrath, indeed, that was due to sinners.

461
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,741
If he did not let the Gentile people perish, much more will he not allow the redeemed to be extinguished.

462
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:50,002
He will not cast away those whom he has redeemed at a great price; for the loss of his servants is not trivial to him.

463
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:53,823
Indeed, he who rises will not die again, as it is written (Romans 14:4).

464
00:44:53,823 --> 00:45:02,313
But he himself is an advocate with the Father; he himself intercedes for our sins, a not insignificant patron of the wretched, a more than adequate intercessor.

465
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:07,141
Answer, brother, can the devil oppress the servants of God, or can Christ not absolve them?

466
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:10,431
You say Peter's repentance happened before the Lord's passion?

467
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:11,917
No one proposed this to you.

468
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:19,186
And yet Peter had already been baptized: for the Lord had said to him: "He who has bathed once does not need to wash again" (John 13:10).

469
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:26,031
However, he later received Christ's remedy, but he repented beforehand; and he was considered holy before he received the remedy.

470
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:30,382
And his repentance would not have been written down if it had not been beneficial.

471
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:32,717
It says, "He wept bitterly" (Matthew 26:75).

472
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:34,680
Do you not want to do what Peter did?

473
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,386
Do you not want what benefited Peter to benefit us?

474
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:41,472
Come, did not my Thomas doubt the resurrection after the Lord's resurrection?

475
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:52,933
Was he not accused of disbelief by the Lord when the marks of the nails, the pierced hands, and the wound in the side were shown to him, when the Lord said to him: "Do not be unbelieving, but believing" (John 20:27)?

476
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:53,464
What then?

477
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:54,684
Did he blush to repent?

478
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:56,064
Did he not humble himself?

479
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,611
Did he not immediately confess his God and Lord?

480
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,574
Does not this confession commend him?

481
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:08,884
You've cleverly addressed the argument I presented about the power given to bishops: that whatever they bound on earth would be bound in heaven.

482
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:16,361
You claim this applies not to the faithful but to the catechumens, suggesting it was permissible to release or bind the sins of those yet to be baptized.

483
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:19,733
You combine chapters from two Evangelists to make them seem like one.

484
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:47,490
You add that John completed what Matthew had less fully pursued because the Lord said in Matthew:
"Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19);
He fulfilled it in John by saying:
"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:23);
So this forgiving or binding seemed to pertain to the nations to be baptized, because the first Evangelist spoke of the nations, and the latter completed it concerning binding and loosing.

485
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,272
What do you say?

486
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,497
Did the two Evangelists report half-thoughts and incomplete ideas?

487
00:46:51,497 --> 00:47:00,049
Were they lacking in words or reasoning with each other, or did the Holy Spirit not fully complete everything, carrying out the proposed senses and defining the sayings fully?

488
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:04,838
No one overrides a confirmed testament of a man: will a different tablet change the tablet of God?

489
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,281
Why this desire to win, that you dare such things?

490
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:17,250
What about the fact that the Lord said before His passion in Matthew itself:
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19)?

491
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,964
The Lord predicted this in Matthew and made no mention of the nations there.

492
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:26,877
Why then do you add the chapter of John to where He placed His own, and in such a way that separates it from the nations?

493
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:31,324
If He had wanted it to pertain to the nations, He could have joined what He Himself placed.

494
00:47:31,324 --> 00:47:33,816
Therefore, you have everything you seek in Matthew.

495
00:47:33,816 --> 00:47:36,602
Why didn't you read everything, you who teach the bishop?

496
00:47:36,602 --> 00:47:38,458
Repeat the first part of this command.

497
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:47,375
According to Matthew, a little earlier, the Lord spoke to Peter individually to establish unity from one person, and soon after, He gave the same command to all.

498
00:47:47,375 --> 00:49:25,173
However, He begins with Peter:
"And I say to you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven"
Matthew 18:19.
Tell me, brother; did He say this only about the gentiles: "On this rock I will build my Church"? Does He call unbaptized people the Church? Is a man not yet reborn the body of Christ? What do I loose for the gentiles, which is not bound? For if it is not considered, it is not bound. What do I bind, which I have no right to constrain? A gentile man is free from the Law.
Now see the opposite, whether both apply to the baptized. Forgiveness is granted because he was held by sin; he is bound by anathema because he was freed by faith and released by grace. But if I concede that this power of loosing or binding applies to the gentiles, I will much more prove it pertains to the baptized. For if one who had no bond could be loosed or bound, how much more one who is held by the laws of faith?
You say Matthew wrote: "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone"
Matthew 18:15; and immediately adds the Lord’s words: "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven," so it seems to pertain to a brother's offense.
Come on, don't you see what He says above: "If your brother sins against you"; but here He adds: "Amen I say to you, whatever you bind on earth, etc." This command was given to one, but this was released to many: the former he looses to whom it is admitted; the latter, the Church: the former, without a priest, without brothers; the latter is obtained by all. "Whatever you bind," He says; absolutely nothing is excluded. "Whatever," He says: whether great or small.

499
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:33,688
Please pay attention to what Peter is told below:
That sins against a man must be forgiven seventy-seven times, to show that other sins can be forgiven even once.

500
00:49:33,688 --> 00:49:42,048
However, he who sins against Peter offends the Lord, as it is shown to Samuel: "It is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me" (First Samuel 8:7).

501
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:47,639
Therefore, it is allowed for the Church to forgive at least once, which is commanded to us many times over.

502
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:51,663
Now, let's return to the wandering sheep, the lost coin, and the younger son.

503
00:49:51,663 --> 00:50:07,495
When I briefly mentioned these examples in my previous writing, you repeated them in full, teaching and showing that the lost coin, the sheep, and the younger son refer to tax collectors and sinners; that is, to humble people, not to the image of the Christian community nor to the form of the faithful.

504
00:50:07,495 --> 00:50:11,936
I am glad to be taught; however, I am distressed that the understanding is not there.

505
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:13,243
For what should I assert?

506
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,482
Whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law.

507
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:45,116
(Romans 3:19)
Certainly, I agree that this was primarily said to the former people, but in the form of the faithful, but in the image of the future, as the Apostle says:
"These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come."
(First Corinthians 10:11)
And again: "The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming."
(Hebrews 10:1)
Surely you agree that these teachings were for tax collectors and sinners, that is, humble people, and therefore, the younger ones.

508
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:47,781
So tell me, is the Christian people itself younger?

509
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,766
Has it not been grafted into the root?

510
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:52,013
Has it not been joined together as members?

511
00:50:52,013 --> 00:50:58,492
Built, as it is written, on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.

512
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:00,844
(Ephesians 2:20)
Is God the God of Jews only?

513
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:02,620
Is he not the God of Gentiles too?

514
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,717
Yes, of Gentiles too.

515
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:07,688
Since there is one God who justifies the ungodly by faith and through faith.

516
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:19,079
(Romans 3:29-30)
Surely that humble people, whom God compared to the lost coin, the younger son, and the little sheep, was the Church: from which came the whole crowd of believers, from which came the Christian people.

517
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:32,297
Our bodies are also connected to this body, along with all the parts of the believers, so that we may come together into the good olive tree from the wild olive tree of the Gentiles, as the Apostle says:
"Partakers of its richness" (Romans 11:17).

518
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:36,440
And so we all may be one in Christ, Jew and Greek, slave and free (Galatians 3:28).

519
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:46,722
If, therefore, we are one body with those humble ones, what was said to the humble of old was said to us as well:
and thus it was announced to the whole body, whatever was preached about a part of the body.

520
00:51:46,722 --> 00:51:53,960
Let me make it clearer: those later people, that poor and ordinary group, were the image of the Church—a humble and modest soul, freed by Christ.

521
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:01,897
The Lord came to save this, did not leave it in hell:
this is the sheep that is carried back on the shoulders:
that is, by the effort and strength of patience.

522
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:06,040
This is the coin that is sought: and, having been found, is shown to the neighbors.

523
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,985
Do you see how its form fits the likeness of the repentant?

524
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:11,131
Do you see mercy extending up to this time?

525
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:15,873
Do you see that whatever was said to the nascent Church pertains to the fullness of the Church?

526
00:52:15,873 --> 00:52:24,359
Therefore, the Lord added:
"There will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need repentance" (Luke 15:7).

527
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:31,297
For if all those things were written to remind us;
to whom then will that humble sinful people be compared, if not to the repentant people?

528
00:52:31,297 --> 00:52:44,375
And if the figures recur in order, the ninety-nine healthy ones are the whole Church;
the one that strays is the portion of the delinquents:
and the coin that was lost is that poor sinner:
the son returning after his wrongs is considered similar to the redeemed.

529
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:54,008
Now you see rightly placed by me, when I was dealing with the care of the repentant, that the Lord said:
"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" (Matthew 9:12).

530
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:58,351
Rightly also:
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" (Matthew 5:4).

531
00:52:58,351 --> 00:53:03,143
Whatever was said about publicans and sinners will pertain to all the sick and all the wretched.

532
00:53:03,143 --> 00:53:06,787
You say it is written only of the martyrs:
"Blessed are those who mourn."

533
00:53:07,536 --> 00:53:09,739
Does no one besides them mourn their sins?

534
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:13,306
Doesn't David cry out, "I will wash my bed every night" (Psalm 6:7)?

535
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:18,132
And again, "For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears" (Psalm 102:10).

536
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:21,910
Doesn't Jacob say, "The years of my life have been hard" (Genesis 47:9)?

537
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:27,260
Doesn't the Apostle say to Timothy, "Longing to see you, remembering your tears" (Second Timothy 1:4)?

538
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,254
Yet he wasn't speaking about a martyr.

539
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:29,726
What now?

540
00:53:29,726 --> 00:53:31,667
Do miserable penitents have dry eyes?

541
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:35,182
And do those who are sorrowful for their sins not know how to weep?

542
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:37,857
Do we, who partake and are faithful, have no tears?

543
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:41,372
Does anyone among us delight in rejoicing while the world rejoices?

544
00:53:41,372 --> 00:53:47,248
You Novatians, are you already satisfied, made rich, and have begun to reign without us (First Corinthians 4:8)?

545
00:53:47,248 --> 00:53:50,028
So, isn't everyone who is wretched deserving of pity?

546
00:53:50,028 --> 00:54:02,671
After this, you propose and say it is written by the Lord: "Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come" (Matthew 12:31-32).

547
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:05,609
Either I am mistaken, or this example works against you.

548
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:10,802
For if every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, you see that repentance is not denied forgiveness.

549
00:54:10,802 --> 00:54:13,006
Therefore, every sin, including blasphemy.

550
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:19,773
You have an addition according to Luke: "And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him" (Luke 12:10).

551
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:23,812
What more is there to say about God's mercy and the leniency of His judgment?

552
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:28,114
Is your eye envious because the head of the household is generous (Matthew 20:15)?

553
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:30,107
Is he not allowed to do what he wants?

554
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:32,573
Indeed, who are you to judge another's servant?

555
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:34,567
To his own master, he stands or falls.

556
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:37,085
And God is able to make him stand (Romans 14:4).

557
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:41,963
But you say, whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven (Matthew 12:32).

558
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:48,416
You are accustomed to reading all the scriptures thoroughly: why did you not read here what it means to be "in the Spirit"?

559
00:54:49,728 --> 00:56:43,704
You mentioned earlier that when the Lord cast out demons with a word and performed many miracles with special power, the Pharisees said:
"He does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
Matthew 12:24.
This means they sinned against the Holy Spirit by blaspheming the works done through the Holy Spirit.
In other sins, we either err out of ignorance, are broken by fear, or are overcome by the weakness of the flesh.
This blindness is not seeing what you see and attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, calling the glory of the Lord, by which the devil himself is overcome, the power of the devil.
This is what will not be forgiven: the rest, for those who truly repent, Brother Symproniane, are forgiven.
After this, you discuss the branches and the vine as follows:
The Lord says in John:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes."
John 15:1-2.
You see, therefore, that fruit is required in the branches, that is, good works of repentance, as John says:
"Produce fruit in keeping with repentance."
Matthew 3:8.
You see the branches being pruned, which are the losses of the flesh, the losses of joy, the losses of wealth, and the labors of life; these are the proper actions of those who repent. You also see the Lord's gardening, who does not lose even the branches but prunes and gathers them, some clearly for the fire, others for planting and nurturing new vineyards.
The priest Eli, you say, speaks and says:
"If a man sins against another man, they can intercede for him; but if a man sins against God, who will intercede for him?"
First Samuel 2:25.
John likewise says:
"If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying that he should pray about that."
First John 5:16.
You see this all pertains to ongoing sins, not to those who have sinned at some point and have begun to repent before anyone prays for them.
It is lengthy to replicate examples. Consider all the sins the Lord threatens: you will see they are present.

560
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:53,249
If past righteousness does not benefit the righteous person during their time of iniquity, then past iniquity will not harm the wicked person during their time of righteousness.

561
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:54,813
Ezekiel chapter 18, verse 24.

562
00:56:54,813 --> 00:58:10,041
For it is written:
"Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to God, and they will receive mercy."
Isaiah chapter 55, verse 7.
And if God has punished past sins and established a penalty and punishment for things done and omitted, does He not have the power to change His decision?
Did He not save Rahab, King Nebuchadnezzar, the Gibeonites, the Ninevites, and Zoar from the foretold destruction?
Did not Joel the prophet say,
"Return to the Lord your God with fasting, weeping, and mourning; for He is merciful, patient, and long-suffering, full of compassion, and willing to relent from sending calamity.
And who knows if He will turn and relent and leave behind a blessing?"
Joel chapter 2, verses 12 to 14.
Therefore, whenever you find a penalty established for sinners, you will understand it either as established for those persisting in sin or as leaving God the freedom to change His decision if you repent and turn to better ways.
You still say that it is written:
"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you."
Matthew chapter 5, verse 29.
Moses explained what this means in Deuteronomy:
"If your brother (for these are our eyes and hands), or your daughter, or the wife who is in your embrace, or your closest friend entices you, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods' whom you have not known.

563
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:48,060
"
Deuteronomy chapter 13, verse 6.
He then added below:
"You shall kill him; your hand should be the first against him to put him to death."
Deuteronomy chapter 13, verse 9.
You see, therefore, it is not said about those who repent, but about those who not only persist in wickedness themselves but also do not cease to scandalize us.
These people, no matter how dear they are, must be abandoned; no matter how useful, they must be deserted.
You further propose that the apostle Paul said:
"Remove the evil person from among yourselves."
First Corinthians chapter 5, verse 13.
Certainly, it is persistent evil, but repentance is not evil, as David says:
"It is good to confess to God."
Psalm 111, verse 2.

564
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:52,905
However, he who repents is not with me, nor among the saints, nor is he united in peace.

565
00:58:52,905 --> 00:59:04,050
But the Apostle says:
If anyone who is called a brother is a fornicator, an idolater, a greedy person, an abusive person, a drunkard, or a swindler, do not even eat with such a person
First Corinthians 5:11.

566
00:59:04,050 --> 01:00:50,220
You see, it is not without reason that it is said, "and is," referring to someone who has not yet repented, who has not yet ceased to be wicked.
And it is certainly said together about the greedy, the drunkards, and the abusive.
Answer, brother, is there no such person among you, in your peace?
Therefore, it is from there, and what God cries through Isaiah:
The unjust and sinners will perish together
Isaiah 1:28;
those who do not repent, who do not seek mercy, to whom God says again through the same Isaiah:
Even if your sins are like scarlet, I will make them white as snow; if they are red as crimson, I will make them like wool
Isaiah 1:18.
However, as you say, the Apostle condemned the wrongdoer.
For in the first letter to the Corinthians, he says:
Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit and have already judged him who has committed this act.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are assembled, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord
First Corinthians 5:3-5.
Note, brother, first, that he does not condemn those with whom this man associates: only he who has committed such an act is handed over to Satan, only he is excluded, while the peace of the saints is preserved.
Do you condemn all churches for one sinner?
Then you see, this same incestuous sinner is not handed over to death but to Satan, for correction, for discipline, for repentance.
Finally, he says, for the destruction of the flesh, but not the soul, not even the spirit: only for the destruction of the flesh, that is, the trials, the distresses of the flesh, the loss of limbs, as he says elsewhere about the undisciplined:
Such people will experience tribulation in the flesh
First Corinthians 7:28.
Do you want to know this?
In the second letter to the Corinthians, Paul himself absolves this same impious person.

567
01:00:50,327 --> 01:01:05,658
Because he himself says: "For such a one, the punishment by the majority is sufficient; so that, on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps he be swallowed up with too much sorrow. Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him" (Second Corinthians 2:6-8).

568
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:18,144
Further on: "If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven, if there was anything to forgive, I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us" (Second Corinthians 2:10).

569
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:21,938
Do you see the Apostle's forgiveness, even moderating his own judgments?

570
01:01:21,938 --> 01:01:25,678
Do you see the gentle kindness that is far removed from your arrogance?

571
01:01:25,678 --> 01:01:31,263
It is far different from the stance of Novatian, who truly considers the common life and salvation of all.

572
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,266
But even against us, you have turned into a harsh critic.

573
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:55,971
You say, according to the heavenly law, that it is not permitted to break one of the commandments and not to mix lambs with wolves, and that any agreement in a crime is wrong; and therefore, whoever touches pitch will be defiled (Ecclesiasticus 13:1); and there should be no fellowship between light and darkness, or between the temple of God and idols, or between Christ and Belial (Second Corinthians 6:14-15).

574
01:01:55,971 --> 01:02:02,820
Therefore David says: "When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and with adulterers, you have been a partaker" (Psalm 50:18).

575
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,665
You finally say that we break the Lord's commandments.

576
01:02:05,665 --> 01:02:22,471
Do we bend a single jot of the Law; or rather Novatian, who has violated all the laws of the Church and all the bonds of unity, who, after so many years of peace and so many covenants of sanctity, has brought forth new laws, new institutions, new rites, pretending to have the secret of justice with an unyielding face?

577
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:31,690
Have we welcomed wolves into the Church, who avoid the faces of heretics; or rather Novatian, who, being ravenous wolves themselves, fear slightly more miserable little sheep?

578
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:44,756
Do we consent to evil, do we touch pitch, do we cling to darkness, do we join with idols and Belial; or rather those who received Evaristus, who received Nicostratus, and the others who departed from the Church, tainted in speech, hand, and morals?

579
01:02:45,335 --> 01:02:58,798
We encounter adulterers and thieves; or those who valued Novatus over their own life and well-being; after intercepting the money of orphans and widows; the wretched parent and the murderer of his wife's offspring, not only not repenting but even boasting?

580
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,426
But Paul the Apostle said: Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands.

581
01:03:02,426 --> 01:03:03,425
First Timothy 5:21.

582
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:07,107
He also teaches; either slowly, or after repentance, not to be denied.

583
01:03:07,107 --> 01:03:12,260
After the destruction of Jericho, Achan son of Carmi was killed because of the theft of a garment.

584
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,992
Come on; all of you, kill the thieves of our money and books entirely; and rage against the bones of Novatus.

585
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:21,936
Take up again that yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear.

586
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:22,515
Acts 15:10.

587
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:26,616
Why do you delay, Novatians, demanding an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

588
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:27,563
Deuteronomy 19:21.

589
01:03:27,563 --> 01:03:31,297
Seeking a soul, restoring the practice of Circumcision and the Sabbath?

590
01:03:31,297 --> 01:03:33,242
Kill the thieves, stone the insolent.

591
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:37,554
Do you not read in the Gospel that the Lord even spared the confessing adulteress.

592
01:03:37,554 --> 01:03:38,080
John 8:11.

593
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:57,906
Whom no one condemned: that He absolved the sinner who washed His feet with her tears: that He liberated Rahab in the city of Jericho among the Phoenicians: that He absolved Tamar from the judgment of the patriarch: that, even with Sodom perishing, He did not destroy the daughters of Lot; and would have saved the sons-in-law if they had believed in the impending destruction.

594
01:03:57,906 --> 01:04:03,270
Come on; do you not hold to saying with David to the Lord: With those who hated peace, I was peaceful.

595
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,901
Psalm 119:7.

596
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:08,581
And not to be silent about Solomon's saying: A brother helping a brother will be exalted.

597
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:09,317
Proverbs 18:9.

598
01:04:09,317 --> 01:04:10,527
What about the Apostle?

599
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:19,466
Brothers, even if a man is caught in any wrongdoing; you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourselves lest you also be tempted.

600
01:04:19,466 --> 01:04:23,148
Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.

601
01:04:23,148 --> 01:04:24,041
Galatians 6:1, 2.

602
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:32,876
And that which I already mentioned: For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.

603
01:04:32,876 --> 01:04:33,455
Romans 9:3.

604
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:38,030
And again: I have become all things to all people, that I might by all means save some.

605
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,976
First Corinthians.

606
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:49,083
Chapter 9, Verse 22:
This means sharing the groans with the wounded, the labor with the sick, the death with the dying, and connecting your own state with the fall of brothers.

607
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:53,602
It involves giving up some of your own health to provide medicine to those who are failing.

608
01:04:53,602 --> 01:05:01,995
Chapter 21:
What good does it do to harden your faces with pride and harshness, to rule with arrogance, to turn away from the miserable, and to close your ears and eyes?

609
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:03,087
Have you never fallen?

610
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:04,726
Is there no blemish in your mind?

611
01:05:04,726 --> 01:05:06,265
Is there no speck in your eyes?

612
01:05:06,265 --> 01:05:09,294
Who can boast of having a pure heart or being free from sins?

613
01:05:09,294 --> 01:05:11,380
Proverbs 20:9 according to the Septuagint.

614
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:18,034
I believe you are just, kind, and temperate, with all your limbs healthy and your whole body untouched, needing no doctor or medicine.

615
01:05:18,034 --> 01:05:22,305
Enter now into heaven; pass through the gates of paradise, with the sword withdrawing.

616
01:05:22,305 --> 01:05:25,235
Close off your gifts from the many who confess the one God.

617
01:05:25,235 --> 01:05:32,584
If things are far different from the unrelenting harshness of reality and your cruelty lies, you now understand, Novatians, that God can have mercy.

618
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:37,798
You now understand that medicine, even if late, can be available to brothers who confess their past sins.

619
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:42,565
You now understand that the one neglected by the Levite and priest can be healed through Christ.

620
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:46,786
You now understand that the prayers of the Church should not be denied to the humble.

621
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:51,007
You now understand that the hands of priests should be extended to pitiable brothers.

622
01:05:51,007 --> 01:05:59,350
But we understand, as you reproach, that the Church of God, the dove, is not bitter with bile, not violent with the tearing of claws, even with small and weak feathers.

623
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:09,778
We also know that the well of living water and the sealed fountain are not tainted by the stain of a heretic's pool, and that the enclosed garden is full of both large and small herbs, both common and precious.

624
01:06:09,778 --> 01:06:16,581
Even the eight souls from the ark, among whom was Ham, and the thousands of birds and beasts in pairs and sevens, both clean and unclean.

625
01:06:16,581 --> 01:06:22,888
We consider the dry fountains and clouds stirred by whirlwinds to be the barrenness of heretics and the force of insane voices.

626
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:27,430
We do not promise freedom, as we ourselves are slaves to punishment.

627
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:39,917
But having confessed our own crimes, we also encourage others to confess and believe in Him who justifies the ungodly by faith (Romans 3:26),
who reverses the judgment imposed against wickedness (Joel 2:13, according to the Septuagint).

628
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:44,944
We also take heed of false prophets and ravenous wolves as we guard against you (Matthew 7:15).

629
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:49,600
Indeed, we think that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses just as you oppose the Catholics.

630
01:06:49,600 --> 01:07:03,940
Thus, the Apostle says:
"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth: men of corrupt minds and disapproved by God; but they will not progress further, for their folly will be plain to all, as it was with those two" (Second Timothy 3:8-9).

631
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:09,231
It is clear that this was said about you, who could neither progress further nor conceal your folly.

632
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:20,925
He who is baptized by the dead gains nothing (Ecclesiasticus 34:30);
indeed, he who is washed by a heretical source, and likewise he who is anointed with the oil of a sinner, that is, who is filled with an unclean spirit.

633
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:22,883
Therefore, you will be sons of blood.

634
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:26,322
For you do not desire the peace of the brethren, but their blood.

635
01:07:26,322 --> 01:07:27,751
Your belief is false faith.

636
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:37,222
The adulterous woman is the heretical congregation: for the Catholic Church, from the beginning, has not left her husband's bed and chamber, nor desired foreign or strange lovers.

637
01:07:37,222 --> 01:07:49,446
You have painted an exiled form with a new color; you have separated your bed from the ancient marriage;
you have departed from the body of the one-bedded mother, adorned with new ways of pleasing and new enticements of corruption.

638
01:07:49,446 --> 01:08:09,182
For when you propose blessed Cyprian as a contrary witness to me, because in the Epistle concerning the Lapsed, he says that Moses and Daniel and Job prayed for sinners and did not obtain, as the Lord says:
"Even if these three men, Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in their midst, they would not save sons or daughters, but only they themselves would be saved" (Ezekiel 14:20).

639
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:15,056
If only, if only you would rely on Cyprian as a witness, if only you would agree with such wholesome sentences.

640
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:27,154
For when he urged those who had fallen to repentance, who did not want to repent, saying they had received peace from confessors or martyrs, he taught and showed that not even those patriarchs could obtain it for the unrepentant.

641
01:08:27,154 --> 01:08:29,097
Indeed, who can free someone unwilling?

642
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:31,090
Who can humble themselves for the proud?

643
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:32,983
Who can intercede for the unrepentant?

644
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:36,122
When he said this, he urged them to the remedies of repentance.

645
01:08:36,122 --> 01:08:44,294
The man of such gravity and merit did not speak against himself, but he taught that prayers should be poured out by sinners and that confession should be cherished.

646
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:51,519
Yet the examples of Cyprian move you, as he recalls that even Moses and the other saints did not obtain what they asked for on behalf of sinners.

647
01:08:51,519 --> 01:08:51,768
What?

648
01:08:51,768 --> 01:08:54,907
Don't you see that Moses couldn't obtain it for certain people?

649
01:08:54,907 --> 01:08:57,946
When he returned to the people, what did he hear in the camp?

650
01:08:57,946 --> 01:09:00,936
The voices of drunkards and the singing of idolaters echoed.

651
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:06,616
The people were still persisting in wickedness, still remaining in the very crime, and did not know how to repent.

652
01:09:06,616 --> 01:09:09,356
But who among us told you that Moses did not obtain it?

653
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:15,585
For God had indeed said to him, "He has sinned against me, I will blot him out of my book" (Exodus thirty-two, thirty-three).

654
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:23,956
However, he said this with the authority of a judge and the power of the Lord; but see how quickly he reversed the sentence that was passed against the people's malice.

655
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:24,304
Listen.

656
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:33,074
The prophet immediately says: "And Moses prayed before the Lord his God, 'Why, Lord, do you let your anger burn against your people?' and the rest" (Exodus thirty-two, eleven).

657
01:09:33,074 --> 01:09:39,800
And further down: "And the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened" (Exodus thirty-two, fourteen).

658
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,843
Do you see that God's anger was appeased?

659
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:43,886
Do you see that the offense was placated?

660
01:09:43,886 --> 01:09:47,623
And he did not pray for the people, nor did he repent for what he had done.

661
01:09:47,623 --> 01:09:51,559
But Noah, you say, and Daniel, and Job could not save their sons and daughters.

662
01:09:51,559 --> 01:10:00,279
This is because they would ask for those who do not pray; if they intercede for those persisting in crime; if they do not defend individuals, if not a few, but many thousands.

663
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:09,845
However, Noah saved his household from the public ruin; and Job received back all that he had lost; and Daniel, by his prayer, repelled the sword that was imminent for the wise men of Babylon.

664
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:16,015
Certainly, for the safety of the town, Lot prays, and Paul prays for the passengers of the ship.

665
01:10:16,015 --> 01:10:19,050
Thus, those who know how to repent are freed from justice.

666
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:22,974
Finally, I see what is written: "They alone will be saved" (Ezekiel 14:20).

667
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:23,654
Who are they?

668
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:28,154
They are those who intercede for sinners and plead for such people without punishment.

669
01:10:28,154 --> 01:10:29,933
And why do you condemn the Church?

670
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:36,578
Why do you forbid interceding for those who repent, if it is also permitted to pray for those who are not allowed to obtain it?

671
01:10:36,578 --> 01:10:40,921
Therefore, read my Cyprian more diligently: read the whole letter about the Lapsed.

672
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:45,212
Read another which he gave to Antonianus, where Novatian is urged by all examples.

673
01:10:45,212 --> 01:10:48,822
Then you will know what he pronounces about the care of the penitent.

674
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:52,747
I speak of Cyprian, who opposes your views and upholds the Catholic rights.

675
01:10:52,747 --> 01:11:02,845
Tertullian, after his heresy for you have taken much from it you will hear in his own letter, and in that very one which he published as a Catholic, confessing that the Church can forgive sins.

676
01:11:02,845 --> 01:11:11,479
Therefore, you see that the Church is a queen in a golden and variegated garment (Psalm 45:10) composed undoubtedly of many bodies and many peoples of various kinds.

677
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:15,769
This picture is not of one color, nor does such diversity shine in one appearance.

678
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:18,333
One part of the garment covers, another arranges.

679
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:23,357
Some adhere to the chest, some are drawn to the hem, and among the very edges, it becomes dirty.

680
01:11:23,357 --> 01:11:27,124
Some are compared to the purple of martyrs; others to the virginal silk.

681
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:30,839
Some are sewn in with a folding hem, or repaired by inserting a needle.

682
01:11:30,839 --> 01:11:36,333
For one is like this, another is like that (First Corinthians 7:7); and yet one queen is composed in all.

683
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:41,566
Therefore, the same fruitful and wealthy vine, having many branches, is extended with many clusters.

684
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:44,129
Did none of these suffer from the cold of winter?

685
01:11:44,129 --> 01:11:45,647
Did it not endure harsh hail?

686
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:47,688
Did it not withstand scorching summers?

687
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:51,507
This gem is harsher on the branches, that one is stronger, another purer.

688
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:55,118
This one spreads itself in fruits, this one overflows only in leaves.

689
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:57,054
Yet everywhere the vine is beautiful.

690
01:11:57,054 --> 01:12:01,711
This is the mother of young women, whose number is beyond counting (Song of Solomon 6:7).

691
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:06,891
Finally, if you can count the Catholic flocks, and reckon the swarms of our people on your fingers.

692
01:12:08,303 --> 01:12:16,532
Not only the things that are spread all over the world, filling every region, but also those things, Brother Sympronian, that are near you in the neighboring city.

693
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:21,479
Think about how many of our people you see alone, how many of my people you encounter by yourself.

694
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:24,255
Aren’t you like tiny drops compared to great fountains?

695
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:26,880
Aren’t you like a drop in the ocean, being absorbed?

696
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,020
Tell me, are these young women from your people, or do you alone bring them forth?

697
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,250
This queen, chosen and perfected for her mother, is ours, I say.

698
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:40,106
Nothing is chosen unless it is better and greater than something else; nothing can be perfect unless it is complete.

699
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:48,082
Now consider this: is this particularly built upon the foundation of the prophets and apostles, with Jesus Christ himself as the cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20)?

700
01:12:48,082 --> 01:13:11,050
If it started before you, if it believed before you, if it did not leave the original foundations, if it did not move away, if it did not separate from the rest of the body, establishing its own teachers and unique instruments, if it argued anything unusual, if it discovered any new law, if it declared a rejection of peace to its own body—then it clearly seems to have departed from Christ, then it would have stood apart from the prophets and apostles.

701
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:22,661
Therefore, this will be a great house, rich with the diversity of all kinds of vessels, where pure gold shines, and malleable silver gleams; indeed, it also honors wooden and earthen vessels as it is written (Second Timothy 2:20).

702
01:13:22,661 --> 01:13:25,790
A great house serves many purposes, requiring different works.

703
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:29,576
It does not only seek silver, nor does it only delight in golden adornment.

704
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:35,230
Often, a great house is more fitting with simplicity; among noble pursuits, small things can also be delightful.

705
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:39,067
No craftsman despises his works or thinks that what he created is worthless.

706
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:44,771
And why do you think Christ suffered for sinners, except that he did not want to lose anything he himself formed?

707
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:57,946
Why do you think he still intercedes for the wretched today, except that he does not reject the humble and despised; he will not lose any of those he has received; even if they are compared to wood and clay, he arranges all the vessels in his house accordingly?

708
01:13:58,703 --> 01:14:01,973
Finally, brother Symproniane, don't hesitate to join the many.

709
01:14:01,973 --> 01:14:05,664
Be willing to disregard the remnants of the Novatians and your doubts.

710
01:14:05,664 --> 01:14:09,988
Consider the Catholic congregations and the people of the Church spread so widely.

711
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:14,997
Where there is one, you will say, there I am too; and where there are two, there is the Church.

712
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:19,321
Where there is one, let there be harmony; where there are two, let there be peace.

713
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:23,487
Where there is one, there is the Church; how much more so where there are many?

714
01:14:23,487 --> 01:14:28,707
He says, "Two are better than one: and a threefold cord is not quickly broken" (Ecclesiastes 4:12).

715
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:32,820
Listen to David: "I will praise your name in a great assembly" (Psalms 35:18).

716
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,248
And again: "I will praise you in a mighty throng" (Psalms 35:18).

717
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:43,050
And: "The Mighty One, God, the Lord, has spoken, and summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting" (Psalms 50:1).

718
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:48,534
What about the seed of Abraham, compared to the stars and the grains of sand, content with your poverty?

719
01:14:48,534 --> 01:14:52,225
"All the nations of the earth will be blessed in you" (Genesis 22:18).

720
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:54,176
Tell me; does Novatian fulfill these?

721
01:14:54,176 --> 01:14:58,131
God did not redeem so little with His own blood, and Christ is not so poor.

722
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:04,406
Recognize now, brother, the Church of God expanding its tents and fastening its tent pegs to the right and to the left.

723
01:15:04,406 --> 01:15:10,312
Understand that from the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised (Psalms 113:3).

724
01:15:10,312 --> 01:15:16,112
See, see, I beg you, while the Novatians struggle with words, the Catholic riches are spread across the world.

725
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:19,698
Concerning everything you consulted me about, I have instructed you.

726
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:22,914
I have omitted nothing from the proposed topics or sentences.

727
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:25,340
I have responded to the very points and words.

728
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:32,037
If you sought with a consulting spirit, it has been shown lovingly: if with a challenging spirit, it has been debated promptly.

729
01:15:32,037 --> 01:15:37,257
I will append another letter when there is time, in which I will not refute yours but present ours.

730
01:15:37,257 --> 01:15:40,685
If you read kindly and without disdain, perhaps it will not harm.

731
01:15:40,685 --> 01:15:44,007
Meanwhile, in this, I ask that you review each thing carefully.

732
01:15:44,007 --> 01:15:46,485
Everything quickly read is quickly passed over.

733
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:51,811
If you desire better gifts and bear a soul of good learning, you will not easily disdain such truths.

734
01:15:51,811 --> 01:15:57,400
May the Lord deign to keep and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian in spiritual harmony.

735
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:57,664
Amen.
