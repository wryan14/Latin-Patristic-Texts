However long a person's mind, fearing God, has been attentive to the divine laws, the more they will learn to choose what is true, so that by learning they become wise, because the guide of the eyes of the heart for them is in the law: the Power of God the Father and wisdom is Christ.

(First Corinthians 1:24)

And as if the doors of heaven were opened, they hear with their own mouth of God, they rejoice, learning something truly wise in the law: from which the wisdom of God does not allow a person to remain silent; they are compelled by the truth itself to speak, to make others wise.

And whoever is joined to wisdom cannot envy.

Therefore, a wise person wants, through the wisdom of God by which they have been made wise, to abandon envy through which death dominates and reigns.

(Wisdom 2:24)

For all people in the world to become wise.

For they know it is foretold in the law that a multitude of wise people is the health of the world.

(Wisdom 6:26)

Therefore, when in accordance with the law, in the presence of brothers, guided by wisdom, a treatise was discussed and opposed by them, that the beginning and end of the world cannot be fully known by us; some affirming that the world is already more than 20,000 years old; others not wanting to give a beginning or an end to it; others, granting a beginning, wanted it to be eternal.

To this I say: To assert this through art, the philosophy of the world, and empty deception; they loved the pomp of words and opinion more than the truth and are lovers of them.

For if we listen to the command of God, which is faithful; we must accept whatever the divine law has faithfully narrated to us: which, with the Lord's consent, if you permit, will be simply narrated to you.

For there are those who think that the years in the law were written in vain or unnecessarily, as if they were not necessary: not knowing that those who believe that what the law of God suggests is not true have little faith.

But they say: Is there great power in bringing something from the law and committing it to writing?

Truly, I say: for as you yourselves know, long ago, at your urging, I made writings on the calculation of the Passover and the number of the years of the world; but I remained silent for some time so that our works themselves would not be irrationally established with the spices of foreign wisdom.

Hence, with things better digested, we have already sent ahead a booklet on the most sacred day of Passover: in which we have legally demonstrated which is the first month: thereafter also calculating the course of the years from the creation of the world, in this booklet, in its own order, we note.

In these promises, the brothers, greatly rejoicing, do what we have more diligently decreed.

For indeed, on this matter, many have written not equally, but variously; so that the reader's mind, remaining in doubt, cannot know what is truer.

I will do as you wish, as I also promised, with the Lord God Christ showing the way.

Therefore, I will diligently and skillfully follow all parts and rules of the years; so that the explanation itself may seem to those reading, as to those walking, a delightful, even, and smooth path.

After the various compositions of the previously described, especially those who are already held in prejudiced opinion, to say anything is not permissible or arrogant; but I will speak; for it is necessary by compelling reason, although I believe it is not arrogant if at a later time, something better is brought forth by anyone from the law.

This the holy apostle Paul, advising peace, testifies and says: If anything better is revealed to another sitting by, let the first one be silent.

(First Corinthians 14:30)

And indeed, the apostle said this about any dispute of the law: About which matter, whoever has thought in any way, as they have thought well, may better be accepted.

Now the matter revolves around the complete number of years; where no one can place an imperfect number for a perfect number, or go beyond that perfect number; and whatever is less, and more than the perfect number, to assert as true.

Therefore, let us now come to the cause, and narrate everything in its order, and let it be understood in what place those willing to attain this reasoning, or I may say fully.

Therefore, when this world was established by the Creator God and He saw that all things appeared from nothing by His command, He quickly created the heavens with their ornaments, that is the sun, and the moon.

And the stars, for the changes and signs of the seasons, shining with light; the earth, full of the greenness of all seeds, having flowers in various colors as if painted by divine art; the seas enclosed by the boundaries of shores and mountains, so they do not overflow as if besieged by a certain rampart, and there also having the first movement within them and all living souls.

After this perfection of the world, it pleased the Almighty God to create man, whom above all other animals God willed to be something special: for He created those by His command and word; this one He formed with His sacred hands (
Genesis
 1:27), whom He appointed as free and master over all His creation: those, to be governed by this one; this one, to govern himself in the world as a wise, rational, and clever animal.

From this time and the generations of all subsequent ones, we have shown up to our time; how many years have passed since this world, in which we live, was made; but which, according to the gospel voice, is now established at the end: holding from the eighth day before the Kalends of April the beginning of this world, in which it was initiated and made, in the Paschal book; explaining the course of events, we have already shown, and narrated that the world existed for five days without man, and on the sixth day was formed and brought to life by the breath of God.

From the birth of the first man, Adam, to the flood under Noah, there are 2257 years, which are faithfully verified by each generation. Adam begot Seth in the year 230. Seth begot Enos in the year 205. Enos begot Cainam in the year 170. Cainam begot Mahalalel in the year 170. Mahalalel begot Jared in the year 165. Jared begot Enoch in the year 162. Enoch begot Methuselah in the year 165. Methuselah begot Lamech in the year 182.

Here, the first years of Methuselah, which an error of the writers caused, no one saw, no one inspected, no one corrected with diligent inquiry: he lived 167 years and begot Lamech; and lived 811 years afterward, which cannot be true, because it is shown to be 14 years more than 811 up to the time after the flood. For no one escaped the flood, no one passed beyond it by living except in the ark. Therefore, Methuselah lived 182 years and then begot Lamech: and after that, he lived 787 years, as the true faith of the divine Scripture shows, which narrated that Methuselah lived and died before the flood.

Lamech begot Noah in the year 188; for in the 600th year of Noah, the flood occurred and was completed. From the time of the flood to the 60th year of Abraham, when he went forth from his land to wander, there are 1012 years. Thus, in order, the second generations from Shem, the son of Noah, are shown.

But since the years of Shem were 78 at the completion of the flood, 2 years, that is, are necessary for the total we have designated after the flood: for Shem was 100 years old two years after the flood, and thus begot Arphaxad; those 2 years the writers of this account did not include in the number of years, as they did not foresee them in the least. Therefore, after the flood, Shem lived 2 years and begot Arphaxad. Arphaxad begot Salah in the year 135. Salah begot Eber in the year 130. Eber begot Peleg in the year 134. Peleg begot Reu in the year 130. Reu begot Serug in the year 132. Serug begot Nahor in the year 130. Nahor begot Terah in the year 79. Terah begot Abram in the year 70.

Abram went forth from his land in the year 70 (as we said) to Haran. From the wandering of Abraham to the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt to the wilderness, there are 430 years. Thus afterward, it is more accurately declared by us. Abraham wandered for 30 years and received the son of promise, Isaac: who, when he desired to hear the word of the Lord, when his seed might inherit the land of Canaan; having prepared a sacrifice in the evening, the Lord spoke to him, concluding and designating that his seed would still wander in the land of Canaan and in the servitude of the Egyptians for 400 years, as the divine Scripture attests to Abraham in the book of Genesis: Know for certain that your seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and oppressed for 400 years. But the nation they serve, I will judge (
Genesis
 15:13-14).

And therefore, the wisest legislator Moses, with God as his guide, tells us.

Thus, having followed this, he said: 

The dwelling of the children of Israel, in which they lived in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, they and their fathers, was for 430 years.

Exodus
 12:40.

This is something that the disputers of the years did not fully understand; they mistakenly said that the children of Israel were in Egypt for only 350 years and not the full 430 years.

To clarify, it is better to understand that the 430 years were completed through the seed of Abraham, from the birth of Isaac until they left Egypt, not only in Egypt but also in the land of Canaan.

We show this by going through their generations.

Isaac, at the age of 60, fathered Jacob.

When Jacob was 130 years old, he entered Egypt with his sons, grandsons, and all his descendants, among whom was Kohath, the son of Levi, who is the grandfather of Moses.

Therefore, Amram was born in Egypt.

Amram fathered Moses; at the age of 80, Moses left Egypt with the children of Israel.

Thus, from the birth of Isaac until Jacob's entry into Egypt, they lived in the land of Canaan for 140 years, and in Egypt for 210 years.

This is sufficient to explain the years about which many have been uncertain.

Therefore, from the creation of the world until the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt, there were 3,646 years.

They were in the desert for 40 years; then, after the death of Moses, Joshua, the son of Nun, led the people across the dry bed of the Jordan River into the Promised Land.

With divine favor, he defeated the hostile nations and judged justly.

During the time of the Judges, there were periods of captivity from Joshua son of Nun to Samuel the prophet, who anointed Saul as king, lasting 561 years.

To ensure our summary is complete and to show that the apostle Paul was correct in the Acts of the Apostles, it is known to readers that from Joshua son of Nun, the Lord God gave judges to our fathers for 450 years until Samuel the prophet.

The apostle Paul, addressing this in the Acts of the Apostles, mentioned only the periods in which they had judges and ruled, not the times of captivity: “And he gave them Judges,” he said (Acts 13:20).

During their captivity for their sins, they did not have their own judges but were oppressed by foreigners.

The apostle Paul could not contradict the faith of the Scripture of the Book of Judges if he wanted to cover the full span of time.

He named the judges given by God to the people, wanting to convey the faith of the Lord Christ; for up to David, he spoke to the people to narrate that Christ came from his seed: those who believed, if they wished, were to have the forgiveness of sins.

Thus, these times of the judges are shown as follows:

Joshua son of Nun judged with the elders for 30 years.

After this, they sinned and were handed over to Chushan-Rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, for 8 years.

The Lord raised up Othniel to help them, and he judged Israel for 50 years after killing Chushan-Rishathaim.

After him, they sinned and served Eglon, king of Moab, for 18 years.

Ehud killed Eglon and judged for 80 years.

After his death, the people sinned and served Jabin, king of the Canaanites, for 20 years.

The Lord raised up Deborah against Jabin, and after his death, she judged for 40 years.

Again they sinned and were handed over to the Midianites for 7 years.

Gideon rose up against them and judged the people for 40 years.

After him, his son judged for 3 years.

After him, Tola judged for 22 years.

After Tola’s death, the people chose Jair, and he judged for 22 years.

After his death, the people sinned and were handed over to the Ammonites for 18 years.

Crying out to the Lord, He raised up Jephthah, who judged for 6 years.

After him, Ibzan judged for 7 years.

The people sinned again and were handed over to the Philistines for 40 years.

Once more, turning back to the Lord, He raised up Samson, who defeated the Philistines and judged for 20 years.

After his death, Shamgar judged for 1 year.

After him, the people lived in peace without a ruler; everyone did what seemed right to them, and they were their own judges for 30 years.

After these years, Eli the priest judged for 20 years.

He was succeeded by Samuel, also a priest of God, who judged for 40 years until...

With which he anointed Saul as king. So, all the years, as we said, total 561. For those who think the Apostle narrated differently about these years, they should carefully notice that those who described the history of the years did not consider the years of captivity separately (as the Apostle did), because, excluding only the times of the Judges, the years without captivity are 111. Therefore, all the years from the creation of the world to Samuel, who anointed Saul as king, are 4300.

Then followed the times of the Kings. The Kings ruled for 514 years from Saul to Zedekiah, whose eyes Nebuchadnezzar took out and killed him in a mill. Thus, the years of the Kings are confirmed. Saul reigned for 40 years, David reigned for 40 years and 3 months, Solomon for 40 years, Rehoboam for 17 years, Abijah for 3 years, Asa for 41 years, Jehoshaphat for 25 years, Joram for 8 years, Ahaziah for 1 year, Athaliah for 6 years, Joash for 40 years, Amaziah for 29 years, Uzziah for 52 years, Jotham for 17 years, Ahaz for 15 years, Hezekiah for 29 years, Manasseh for 55 years, Amon for 2 years, Josiah for 31 years, Jehoahaz for 3 months, Jehoiakim for 11 years, Jehoiachin for 3 months and 10 days, Zedekiah for 11 years. Therefore, as we said, the years of the Kings are 514.

From the creation of the world to Zedekiah, when Jerusalem was destroyed and the people were taken into Babylonian exile, there are 4814 years. After the eleventh year of Zedekiah, when Jerusalem was destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar, the Jewish people were taken to Babylonian captivity. This captivity lasted for 70 years. How these years were completed is shown as clear as day when we come to the weeks of Daniel; so that these weeks are confirmed very carefully, both from when and where they were completed.

For in his tenth vision, Daniel, being wholly intent on prayer to God with a mind attentively hanging in anxiety, wanting to know if the state of Jerusalem and its people, after the Babylonian captivity, would suffer any more harm from enemies; an angel of God appeared to him saying: 
Daniel
, I have now come out to show you understanding; for the command of the Lord has gone out, and I have come to show you: For you are a man of desires. Therefore, understand the command, and understand the vision. Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and the holy city of Jerusalem (Daniel 9:22-24). Therefore, the angel designates to Daniel, and sums up the seventy weeks, and again divides them in their order, when and how they are to be completed. And the same angel proceeds saying: To put an end to transgression, and to seal up sins, and to atone for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy (Daniel 9:24).

And you, rest and understand concerning the outcome of the holy ones, or the command to be responded to and the building of the city of Jerusalem, until the anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks (Daniel 9:25): which weeks are 49 years: which years pertain to the body of the 70 years of the captivity of Jerusalem. For in the first year of King Darius, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans, who also killed King Belshazzar, Daniel saw a vision: and it was the 21st year of the captivity of Jerusalem; for Nebuchadnezzar lived for 18 years after he had plundered Zedekiah and Jerusalem; and his son Belshazzar reigned for 3 years, in the third year of which he was killed, and Darius took the kingdom. In his first year, the angel told Daniel about the seventy weeks: when he divided them, the seven weeks were first named by the same angel: which, as said, are 49 years, which are added to the 21 of captivity, when Daniel saw the vision; and they make up the 70 years, which were completed in Babylon, to fulfill the vision and prophecy of Jeremiah.

After these years, Cyrus, king of the Persians, ordered the people to go to Jerusalem in the first year of his reign; so that Jerusalem could be rebuilt, and the most holy place in the Temple of God could be anointed. Therefore, the people returned from Babylon, having with them the leader Zerubbabel, of whom mention was made by the angel to Daniel; until the anointed prince, seven weeks. For every king of the people of God, in divine law, was called an anointed one.

The prophet 
Zechariah
 speaks to the people about the future king, saying:

The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it, and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.

For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice and see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.

Zechariah 4:9-10.

This is similar to how emperors today seem to carry the people in their right hand.

The angel repeats and says to Daniel that 62 weeks of years are for the Lord, which means that during these weeks, with the temple and city of Jerusalem restored, they served the Lord with their offerings.

These 62 weeks are 434 years, which were completed during the times of the Maccabees in the 141st year of the Greek kingdom.

During this time, Antiochus ruled the Greeks with a proud mind.

Even though this order of years from divine law, from the foundation of the world, is self-sufficient, to satisfy the reader's mind, we also show through the kings of Persia, from public historical records, that 62 weeks were completed by the time of the Maccabees.

Cyrus ruled the Persians for 30 years, Artaxerxes for 9 years, Argus for 9 months, Darius for 36 years, Artaxerxes the Second for 19 years and 2 months, Socidanus for 7 months, Xerxes the elder son for 20 years, Artaxerxes for 72 years, Artabus for 7 months, Darius Nothus for 29 years, Olus for 22 years, Arser for 17 years, and Darius for 6 years.

Alexander the Great of Macedonia killed him; from his time, the history of the Maccabees and the years of the Greeks are covered by divine narration.

Therefore, the total number of years for the kings of Persia is 263, and from Alexander of Macedonia to the time of Antiochus, that is, up to the 141st year of the Greek kingdom, 62 weeks, which is 434 years, were completed as we said.

After 62 weeks, says the angel, the anointing and the Holy One will be destroyed.

Therefore, after 7 and 62 weeks, one week remains, which makes 7 years, to complete the total of 70 weeks.

In this week, the wickedness of the nations increased, as the angel had already said; so that even in the middle of the week, from King Antiochus of the Greeks, the sacrifice is taken away from the holy place: and the Holy Place itself is defiled with feminine contempt, and the Abomination of Desolation is set up on the altar, and the statue of Jupiter, whom they call Olympian, is placed there.

This same Antiochus, carrying the image of the Antichrist with a perverse mind, tried to make one people and one sacrilegious nation under his rule.

For he even allowed apostate men to build a gymnasium, that is, a school, in Jerusalem; and where God Almighty had commanded a temple to be placed only for praying to him and offering holy sacrifices, he desired to defile it with idol spectacles.

When the 7 and 62 weeks were completed, in this first week (as mentioned above), he commanded the books of the law to be burned, sacrifices to be made to idols, and unclean foods to be eaten by the Jewish people; and it lasted until the 25th day of the 9th month in the 148th year of the Greek kingdom.

In which year, all 70 weeks designated by the angel to Daniel, concerning the trouble of the city of Jerusalem and the destruction of the people, were completed; about which Daniel himself, desiring, asked the Lord.

From here up to the 174th year of the Greek kingdom; at which time Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was a Roman consul, sent letters about an alliance and friendship to Simon, the brother of Judas Maccabeus; the years are 26.

From this consulship, counting the annual consuls, we find that from the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, up to the 16th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, there are 179 years completed: and therefore from the creation of the world up to the passion of Christ our Savior, there are 5530 years.

Thus, to complete six thousand years, there remain 470 years. For it is necessary that just as the children of Israel received the promised land 470 years after the promise made by the Lord God to Abraham, we Christians will also have the first resurrection after the same number of years.

For the Jewish people, in all things, bear our figure:

In whom the ends of the ages have met (First Corinthians 10:15).

Therefore, from the passion of the Lord Christ (from which time He promised resurrection to those who believed in Him, the Son of God), 470 years must be completed, so that the total of six thousand years is concluded.

When the seventh and thousandth year begins, those who truly believe will be freed from the world; for then will be the first resurrection of all the Saints.

Seventeen. Of the 470 years from the passion of the Lord, in the consulship of Caesarius and Atticus; on the ninth day before the Kalends of April, 369 years have passed.

Therefore, 101 years remain for the 6000 years to be completed, which will not be completed until, near the end, ten kings arise in the world; and they will remove the daughter of Babylon who now holds sway, from the middle of the world.

To them will suddenly come one who is powerful over them, who is called the Dragon in the Apocalypse, and he will dominate the ten kings; and from them, he will destroy some, others will remain under his rule:

Then that wicked one will be revealed, the son of perdition, who is exalted against everything that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he sits in the temple of God showing himself as if he were God (Second Thessalonians 2:8, 4).

This will be the true Antichrist.

To this one, the most powerful Dragon to whom ten kings gave in, will hand over his power and authority, and all mortals will be amazed. And there will be the times of Antichrist (which times, necessarily, must be mortal) like when Antiochus under his reign tried to make one people apostate; to whom (because the time was not right) did not happen such things as Antichrist will attempt to accomplish.

When he comes, he will come to the destruction of the unbelievers: whose time will be grievous and nefarious; whom only the Lord Christ will kill with the spirit of His mouth, and will nullify with the presence of His coming (Second Thessalonians 2:8, 4).

Eighteen. Therefore, with Antichrist defeated and killed, the total of six thousand years will be completed, and the resurrection of all the saints will take place while the world still exists; and also a thousand years will pass, during which that ancient dragon (Revelation 20:3), the devil and Satan, will be bound in the abyss, to prevent him from deceiving anyone, until three years are completed.

These three years will be counted among those who remain under the sign of Antichrist, and all these will marry and be given in marriage, and will die: upon them, those plagues described in the Apocalypse will come, and this world will be continually struck.

For the Saints of God, in the resurrection, there will be one day; and this day of the Saints will be extended into light as much as a thousand years will be counted for the impious living in the world with punishment. This is the seventh day, and the eternal and true Sabbath, whose image and figure is held by this temporal Sabbath written in the law of Moses.

For as it was said to the Jewish people: Work the works of the world for six days; but on the seventh day, which is called the Sabbath, rest from your works (Exodus 23:12): so for all the saints who are from the beginning of the world, and now believe in Christ with true faith; with the six days (that is six thousand years) in which they labored and suffered passed; the seventh day and the true Sabbath will come.

Nineteen. Therefore, the Lord Christ warned every soul in the Gospel to believe in Him before running away at that time when both eternal punishment for the wicked and good reward for the saints must be given according to the merits of each:

Pray, He said, that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath (Matthew 24:20).

After the seventh and thousandth year, Satan will be released from his prison, and will go out to deceive the nations of Gog and Magog; and gathering them to the camp of the Saints as if to fight: and fire will come down from heaven, and all men will be consumed:

and then will be the second resurrection of all flesh; and all will be judged by the just judgment of God for not believing, but delighting in injustices.

And after this, this heaven and this earth will be removed; and that city described in the Apocalypse, prepared from heaven, will descend with the riches of God, in which the just will dwell: and there will be a new heaven and a new earth, and both will remain forever: the impious in eternal burning; the just will live in the glory of God.

In eternal life with God. Amen.
