00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,887
Saint Pacian's Three Letters to Sympronian the Novatian.

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:07,008
Letter One On the Catholic Name

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,310
Pacianus to his brother Sympronian, greetings.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:19,823
If it is not a carnal intention but, as I believe, a spiritual calling that prompts you to examine the faith of Catholic truth from us, then you should have indicated which different beliefs you were following.

5
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:25,981
You seem to have started far from the source and origin of the principal Church, not holding to its fountain and beginning.

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,487
You should have revealed what specifically caused you to break from the unity of our body.

7
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:33,290
For those parts that require healing need to be exposed.

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,195
Now, with the matter hidden, we do not see which parts of us most need curing.

9
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:41,951
So many heresies have arisen from the Christian head that the volume of their names is immense.

10
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:55,568
For instance, to omit the heretics among the Jews, like Dositheus the Samaritan, the Sadducees, and the Pharisees: it would be too long to count how many emerged during the times of the apostles: Simon Magus, Menander, Nicolaus, and others whom obscure fame has concealed.

11
00:00:55,568 --> 00:01:04,229
What about later times with Ebion, Apelles, Marcion, Valentinus, and Cerdon: and not long after them, the Cataphrygians and Novatians, not to mention the more recent swarms?

12
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,231
So who should I first refute in writing?

13
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:09,485
The paper will not hold all their names if you wish to list them.

14
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:15,243
Except that in your writings, which condemn repentance everywhere, you declare yourself aligned with the Phrygians.

15
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:25,055
But even among these, their error is so manifold and diverse that it is not just one thing in them that opposes repentance, but rather, like the many-headed Hydra, several aspects must be cut off.

16
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:36,409
If your intention is not carnal but a spiritual calling, Lord, and you seek to examine our faith in the Catholic truth, you should have clearly indicated which teachings you intend to follow and how they differ.

17
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:44,105
You, who began far from the source and did not adhere to the origins of the main Church, should have revealed the primary cause that divided our unity.

18
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,653
For those parts that need healing must be exposed.

19
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:51,597
Now, with the letters, so to speak, closed, we do not see which parts need our special attention.

20
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:56,439
So many heresies have emerged from the Christian faith that the list of their names is immense.

21
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,382
To set aside the heretics of the Jews: Dositheus the Samaritan, the Sadducees, and the Pharisees.

22
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:08,772
It would take too long to count how many arose during the apostles' times: Simon Magus, Menander, Nicolaus, and others whom history has obscured.

23
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:12,646
What about later times with Ebion, Apelles, Marcion, Valentinus, and Cerdon?

24
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:16,825
And soon after them, the Cataphrygians and Novatians, not to mention newer groups?

25
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,914
Who then should I refute first by letter?

26
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,972
The names of all would not fit on a single page if you wish.

27
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:27,324
Except that in your writings, condemning repentance everywhere, you declare agreement with the Phrygians.

28
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:36,803
But in those very writings, dear Lord, the error is so varied and diverse that it is not just one thing against repentance, but many issues like the Hydra's heads that must be addressed.

29
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,485
First, they rely on many authors.

30
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:44,040
For I think even the Greek Blastus is among them: Theodotus and Praxeas also taught your people at some time.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,850
Those notable Phrygians, who falsely claim to be inspired by Leucius, boast that they were instructed by Proculus.

32
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:57,495
Following Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla, they stirred up many controversies about the Paschal day, the Paraclete, the apostles, and the prophets.

33
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:02,133
And many other issues, like this about the Catholic name and the forgiveness of repentance.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,015
Therefore, if we want to discuss all these matters, we need your full attention.

35
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:12,838
Even if I can't fully instruct you on these topics, we must still serve those seeking knowledge in any way possible.

36
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:17,909
To inform you, we will briefly talk about the subjects you've deemed important enough to write about.

37
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,728
If you want to understand our beliefs more fully, you need to speak more plainly about your own.

38
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:27,798
This way, by asking clearly, you won't leave us wondering whether you're questioning or provoking us.

39
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:31,964
As for the current matters, first of all, I ask you not to give authority to error.

40
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:36,783
You mentioned that no one in the entire world could refute or persuade you against your beliefs.

41
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,795
Even if we are unskilled, the Spirit of God is most skilled.

42
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:43,410
And even if we are unfaithful, God is faithful, who cannot deny Himself.

43
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,217
Second Timothy, Chapter 2, Verse 13.

44
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:49,383
Moreover, for a long time, it was not permitted to contend with the priests of God.

45
00:03:49,383 --> 00:04:44,903
The Apostle says, "We have no such custom, nor does the Church of God." First Corinthians, Chapter 11, Verse 16.
After a single admonition, as you know, a contentious person should be avoided. Titus, Chapter 3, Verse 10.
But who can persuade someone against their will? Therefore, brother, it is your fault, not theirs, if no one has persuaded you of what is best. Even today, you have the power to disregard our writings if you prefer to reject them rather than accept them.
Furthermore, many resisted the Lord Himself and His apostles. The truth cannot persuade anyone unless they agree with it through their own faith. So, my lord, we did not write with the confidence that we could persuade a resistant person, but with the faith that we would not deny the path to good peace to one who is willing.
If this is in your mind and heart, there is no struggle with the name Catholic. If our people attain this through God, there is no need to question, with divine authority preceding. If through man, when usurped, it must be exposed. If the name is good, it does not receive hatred. If bad, it lacks envy.

46
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:52,434
First, they rely on many authors:
I believe that even the Greek Blastus is among them; Theodotus and Praxeas also once taught your people.

47
00:04:52,434 --> 00:05:04,570
Notable Phrygians, who claim to be inspired by Leucius and instructed by Proculus,:
Following Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla, they have stirred up many controversies about the Passover day, the Paraclete, the apostles, and the prophets.

48
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,615
And many other issues, like the Catholic name and the forgiveness of repentance.

49
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:22,117
Therefore, if we want to examine all these things, a teachable presence is needed:
If I didn't sufficiently instruct you on these matters you wrote about, I will briefly address them for your sake because it is necessary to serve those who wonder in any way possible.

50
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:31,270
If you wish to know more fully about our side, you must openly confess your own; so that by consulting unclearly, you do not make us unsure whether you are questioning or provoking.

51
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:41,939
Regarding the present matters, first of all, I ask you not to lend authority to error for the reason you mentioned, that throughout the whole world there is no one who could refute you or persuade you otherwise.

52
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:49,676
For even if we are unskilled, the Spirit of God is most skilled; and if we are unfaithful, God is faithful, who cannot deny himself Second Timothy, 2:13.

53
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:53,418
Furthermore, it is not allowed to contend long against the priests of God.

54
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:58,475
The Apostle says, we do not have such a custom, nor does the Church of God First Corinthians, 11:16.

55
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,571
After one correction Titus, 3:10, as you know, the contentious person is avoided.

56
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,897
But who can persuade someone who is unwilling?

57
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:09,499
Therefore, brother, it is your fault, not theirs, if no one persuaded you of what was best.

58
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:15,364
Even today, it is within your power to disregard our writings if you prefer to defeat them rather than approve them.

59
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:22,646
However, many resisted the Lord himself and his apostles; and the truth could not persuade anyone unless they agreed with it by their own faith.

60
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:27,703
Therefore, Lord, we haven't written with the confidence to persuade someone who resists.

61
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:32,053
Instead, we've written with faith that we shouldn't deny access to those seeking peace.

62
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:36,553
If this aligns with your mind and heart, there will be no struggle over the Catholic name.

63
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:41,353
For if our people achieve this through God, there's no need to question, given divine authority.

64
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:44,353
If through man, whenever it’s usurped, it should be exposed.

65
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,753
If the name is good, it won’t receive hatred; if bad, it lacks envy.

66
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:50,852
I hear that the Novatians are named after Novatus or Novatian.

67
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,552
However, I don’t accuse the name, but the sect itself.

68
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:57,152
Similarly, no one has accused Montanus or the Phrygians over their name.

69
00:06:57,152 --> 00:07:00,252
You might say, under the apostles, no one was called Catholic.

70
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,752
So be it, let that be allowed.

71
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:16,502
When heresies arose after the apostles, trying to tear and divide God's dove and queen into parts with various names, didn’t the apostolic people demand a name to distinguish the unity of the uncorrupted people so that the pure virgin of God wouldn’t be torn apart by the errors of some members?

72
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,651
Wasn't it fitting to mark the principal head with its own name?

73
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:27,051
Suppose I entered a populous city today and found Marcionites, Apollinarians, Cataphrygians, Novatians, and others who called themselves Christians.

74
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,151
How would I recognize the congregation of my people if it weren’t called Catholic?

75
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,001
Come on, who has granted such names to the other peoples?

76
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,101
Why do so many cities and nations have their own descriptions?

77
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:43,601
The very one who questions the Catholic name wouldn’t know the reason for his own name if I asked where it was handed down to him.

78
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:47,600
Certainly, it wasn’t borrowed from man, as it has endured for so many centuries.

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,100
This Catholic name doesn’t sound like Marcion, Apelles, or Montanus, nor does it take heretics as its authors.

80
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:03,100
The Holy Spirit, whom God sent from heaven as a teacher and comforter to the apostles, has taught many of us; reason, as Paul says, and honesty, and, as he says, nature itself have taught many things.

81
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,350
What?

82
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:10,300
Do we have little authority from the apostolic men, little from the first priests, little from the most blessed martyr and teacher Cyprian?

83
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,994
Do we want to teach the teacher?

84
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:22,659
Are we wiser than him, and are we driven by the spirit of the flesh against him, whom the noble blood and the crown of the most illustrious passion of the eternal God have produced as a witness?

85
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:28,687
What about all those priests from different regions, whom the same peace united with Cyprian throughout the entire world?

86
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:32,424
What about all those aged bishops, all those martyrs, all those confessors?

87
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:32,822
Come on.

88
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:37,356
If they were not suitable authors by claiming this name, will we be suitable by denying it?

89
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:42,637
Will our authority be followed by the fathers, and will the antiquity of the saints yield to be corrected?

90
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:46,673
Will the times, now decaying with vices, erase the canons of apostolic antiquity?

91
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:55,092
I hear Novatians being called after Novatus or Novatian:
however, I do not accuse the sect by their name;
nor did anyone object to the name of Montanus or the Phrygians.

92
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:58,331
But you will say, under the apostles, no one was called Catholic.

93
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,576
Let it be so, allow that.

94
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:15,668
When heresies arose after the apostles and tried to tear and divide the dove of God and the queen into parts under different names:
didn't the apostolic flock ask for its own name to distinguish the unity of the uncorrupted people, so that the virgin of God would not be torn apart by the error of some through the members?

95
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:19,256
Wasn't it fitting for the principal head to be marked with its own name?

96
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:31,960
Suppose I entered a populous city today and found Marcionites, Apollinarians, Cataphrygians, Novatians, and others of that kind, who called themselves Christians:
by what name would I recognize the congregation of my people if it were not called Catholic?

97
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,451
Come on, who gave such names to the other peoples?

98
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:37,291
Why does each city, each nation have its own description?

99
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:43,767
The one who questions the Catholic name would not know the reason for his own name if I asked from where it was handed down to me.

100
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:48,251
Certainly, it was not borrowed from a man, that which has not fallen through so many ages.

101
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:53,682
The name Catholic does not sound like Marcion, nor Apelles, nor Montanus, nor does it take heretical authors.

102
00:09:53,682 --> 00:10:02,849
The Holy Spirit has taught us many things, whom God sent from heaven to the apostles as a comforter and teacher;
much reason, as Paul says, and honesty, and, as he says, nature itself.

103
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:03,347
What then?

104
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:10,330
Do we give little authority to the apostolic men, the first priests, or the blessed martyr and teacher Cyprian?

105
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,056
Do we want to teach the teacher?

106
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:13,351
Are we wiser than he is?

107
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:20,632
Are we driven by worldly desires against him, whom noble blood and the crown of a great passion have made a witness of the eternal God?

108
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:26,133
What about all the priests across different places, united in peace with Cyprian throughout the world?

109
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:29,369
What about the elderly bishops, the martyrs, the confessors?

110
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:29,800
Come on.

111
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,924
If they were not suitable authorities by claiming this name, will we be suitable by denying it?

112
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,459
Will our authority surpass that of the fathers?

113
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,886
Will we correct the traditions of the saints?

114
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:43,985
Will our current, vice-ridden times erase the canons of apostolic antiquity?

115
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:48,192
But do not be troubled, brother: Christian is my name, Catholic is my surname.

116
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:50,511
The former calls me; the latter defines me.

117
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,154
By this, I am approved; by that, I am identified.

118
00:10:53,154 --> 00:11:03,779
If the meaning of the word Catholic must finally be given and explained from Greek to Roman: Catholic means one, or as the more learned believe, obedience to all, namely to the commandments of God.

119
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,986
Hence the Apostle: If you are obedient in all things (Second Corinthians 2:9).

120
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:15,483
And again: For as by the disobedience of one many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one, many will be made righteous (Romans 5:19).

121
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:18,935
Therefore, he who is Catholic is also obedient to the righteous.

122
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:22,818
He who is obedient is also a Christian: thus, a Catholic is a Christian.

123
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:26,647
Therefore, our people are separated from heretics by the name Catholic.

124
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:37,110
Additionally, if Catholic means one everywhere, as the superior ones think, David indicates the same saying: The queen stood in a golden vestment and adorned (Psalms 45:10), that is, one in all.

125
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:46,441
And in the Song of Songs, the Groom says: My dove is one, my perfect one, she is the only one of her mother, she is the chosen one of her who bore her (Song of Solomon 6:8).

126
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:50,324
And again: Virgins will be brought to the king after her (Psalms 45:15).

127
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:53,668
And still: Young maidens without number (Song of Solomon 6:7).

128
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:56,257
Therefore, in all things one, and one above all.

129
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:01,511
But don't worry, brother: Christian is my name, and Catholic is my surname.

130
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,098
The first identifies me; the second describes me.

131
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,002
This is how I am known, and that is how I am signified.

132
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:17,087
If we need to explain the meaning of the word Catholic and translate it from Greek into Latin: Catholic means 'universal', or, as the more educated think, 'obedient to all God's commandments.

133
00:12:17,087 --> 00:13:38,817
' Hence the Apostle says, "If you are obedient in everything" Second Corinthians 2:9. And again: "For just as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous" Romans 5:19.
Therefore, a Catholic is also obedient to righteousness. Whoever is obedient is also a Christian: thus, a Catholic is a Christian. This is why our people are distinguished from heretics by this name, Catholic: and if Catholic means 'one everywhere,' as the elders think, David also indicates this when he says, "The queen stood in gold from Ophir" Psalm 45:9, that is, one in all things.
In the Song of Songs, the Bridegroom says: "My dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, chosen by the one who bore her" Song of Solomon 6:9. And again: "They will be led to the king, the virgins, her companions who follow her" Psalm 45:14.
And also: "The maidens, without number" Song of Solomon 6:8. Therefore, she is one in all things and one above all. If you seek the reason for the name, it is clear.
As for repentance, may God grant that it is never necessary for the faithful; may no one fall into the pit of death after the help of the holy font: nor should priests be forced to offer late consolations or teach them, lest they open the way to sin while comforting the sinner with remedies. But we reveal this indulgence of our God to the wretched, not to the blessed, not before sin, but after sins are revealed: and we announce healing not to the healthy, but to the sick.

134
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:49,641
If spiritual evils have no power over the baptized, then neither does the deceit of that serpent which first led humanity astray and imposed so many titles of damnation on its descendants.

135
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:58,661
If it has retreated from the world, if we have already begun to reign, if no sin sneaks into our eyes, hands, or minds, then let this gift of God be discarded.

136
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:04,221
Let help be rejected, let no confession, no groans be heard; let proud justice scorn every remedy.

137
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:13,241
But if the Lord has provided this for His people, if He has granted rewards to those who stand and remedies to those who fall, then stop accusing divine mercy.

138
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:20,843
Stop erasing so many titles of heavenly clemency with rigorous objections, or denying the Lord’s free gifts with unyielding harshness.

139
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:23,793
We do not grant these things from our own resources.

140
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:28,729
Turn to me, says the Lord, along with fasting, weeping, and mourning; tear your hearts.

141
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,296
Joel 2:12.

142
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:37,466
And again: Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him.

143
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,146
Isaiah 55:7.

144
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:45,578
Likewise, the Prophet cries out in this way: Because God is gracious, and merciful, patient, and who relents from sending calamity.

145
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:46,145
Joel 2:13.

146
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:50,457
Does the serpent have such lasting venom, and Christ does not have a remedy?

147
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,747
The devil kills in the world, and Christ cannot help here?

148
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:57,889
Certainly, let it be painful to sin, but let it not be painful to repent.

149
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,803
Let it be shameful to be in danger, but not shameful to be delivered.

150
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:06,228
Who would take away a plank from a shipwrecked person to prevent their escape?

151
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,554
Who would begrudge the healing of wounds?

152
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:13,830
Does not David say: I drench my bed with my tears every night; I flood my couch with weeping.

153
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,398
Psalm 6:6.

154
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:18,028
And again: I acknowledge my sin; I did not cover up my iniquity.

155
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:18,653
Psalm 32:5.

156
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:38,111
And further: I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord," and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
Did not the prophet respond to David after his guilt of murder and adultery, for Bathsheba’s repentance: The Lord has taken away your sin.
Second Samuel 12:13.
Did not confession free the Babylonian king after so many crimes of idolatry?

157
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,257
And what does the Lord say: "Does not one who falls get up, and the one who turns away come back?" (Jeremiah 8:4).

158
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:48,516
What do those many examples of the Lord's arguments respond to?

159
00:15:48,516 --> 00:16:02,793
The woman who finds the lost coin and rejoices; the shepherd who brings back the wandering sheep; the father who warmly welcomes his returning son, after he squandered all his wealth and lived with prostitutes and sinners, and who scolds the jealous brother by showing reason?

160
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:08,018
Saying, "This son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found" (Luke 15:32).

161
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:12,002
What about the man injured on the road, ignored by the Levite and the priest?

162
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,140
Doesn’t he get healed?

163
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:30,625
Consider what the Spirit says to the churches (Revelation 2):
He accuses the Ephesians of abandoned love; charges the Thyatirans with adultery; criticizes the Sardians for halting their work, and the Pergamenes for teaching different doctrines; rebukes the Laodiceans for their wealth; and yet invites all to repentance with satisfaction.

164
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:43,299
What does the Apostle say to the Corinthians: "Lest, when I come, I should mourn over many of those who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced" (Second Corinthians 12:21).

165
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:54,783
And again to the Galatians: "If anyone is caught in any transgression" (Galatians 6:1); that is, in any, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, watching yourself lest you too be tempted.

166
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,025
Does the head of the household in a large house keep only silver and gold vessels?

167
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:03,422
Does he not also honor clay and wooden ones, and some that are repaired and restored?

168
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:08,802
Now I rejoice, says the Apostle, because you were made sorrowful to repentance (Second Corinthians 7:9).

169
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:14,906
And again: "For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted" (Second Corinthians 7:10).

170
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:17,596
If you seek the reason for the name, it is apparent.

171
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:33,115
As for repentance, may God grant that it is not necessary for any of the faithful; may no one after the help of the sacred font fall into the pit of death; nor should priests be forced to offer late consolations or teach them, lest they open the way to sin while they soothe the sinner with remedies.

172
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,165
We reveal God's mercy not to the blessed, but to the wretched, not before sin, but to expose sins.

173
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,752
We announce medicine not to the healthy, but to those who are ill.

174
00:17:42,752 --> 00:18:04,599
If spiritual wickedness has no power over the baptized, if the serpent's deceit—which first overthrew man and marked his descendants with so many titles of damnation—can do nothing, if it has retreated from the world, if we have already begun to reign, if no crime enters our eyes, hands, or minds, then let this gift of God be rejected, let the help be repelled, let no confession, no groans be heard.

175
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,718
Let proud justice despise every remedy.

176
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:23,185
But if the Lord has provided these things for His own; if He has given rewards to those who stand and remedies to those who fall, stop accusing divine mercy or erasing the many titles of heavenly clemency by the objection of severity, or prohibiting the free gifts of the Lord with unyielding harshness.

177
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,141
We do not bestow these from our own.

178
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:30,739
"Turn to me," says the Lord, "with fasting and weeping and mourning, and rend your hearts" (Joel 2:12).

179
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:39,217
And again: "Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts, and let them turn to the Lord, and they will receive mercy" (Isaiah 45:7).

180
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:48,075
Similarly, the Prophet cries out: "For God is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from sending calamity" (Joel 2:13).

181
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:51,988
Does the serpent have such enduring venom, and Christ not have medicine?

182
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:55,357
Does the devil kill in the world, and Christ cannot help here?

183
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,781
Certainly, let it be painful to sin, but not painful to repent.

184
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:02,313
Let it be shameful to be in danger, but not shameful to be saved.

185
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:06,715
Who would snatch a plank from a shipwreck survivor to prevent them from escaping?

186
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:08,563
Who would begrudge healing wounds?

187
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:14,215
Does not David say, "Every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with weeping" (Psalm 6:6)?

188
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:18,943
And again, "I acknowledge my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity" (Psalm 32:5).

189
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:25,356
And still, "I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,' and you forgave the guilt of my sin" (Psalm 32:5).

190
00:19:26,279 --> 00:21:18,240
Didn't the prophet respond after David was guilty of murder and adultery, and repented for Bathsheba: "The Lord has taken away your sin" 2 Samuel 12:13?
Didn't repentance free the Babylonian king after so many acts of idolatry condemned him? And what does the Lord mean when He says: "Doesn't the one who falls rise again, and the one who turns away return" Jeremiah 8:4?
What do all those parables of the Lord mean? That the woman finds the lost coin and rejoices; that the shepherd brings back the wandering sheep; that the father lovingly meets the returning son after he squandered all his wealth with prostitutes and sinners, and reproves the envious brother? The father says, "This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found" Luke 15:32.
What about the man who was wounded on the road, and passed by the Levite and the priest? Isn't he healed?
Consider what the Spirit says to the churches: He accuses the Ephesians of abandoned love; charges the Thyatirans with adultery; rebukes the Sardians for their incomplete works, the Pergamenes for teaching false doctrines; scorches the Laodiceans for their wealth; yet invites all to repentance through atonement.
What does the Apostle say to the Corinthians? "I fear that when I come, I may grieve over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery they have committed" 2 Corinthians 12:21.
And again to the Galatians? "If someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently, but watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted" Galatians 6:1.
Does the master of a great house keep only silver and gold vessels? Doesn't he also keep vessels of clay and wood, some for special purposes and some for common use?
Now I rejoice, says the Apostle, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance 2 Corinthians 7:9. And again: "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret" 2 Corinthians 7:10.
But one could not repent. No one commands labor without reward: "The worker is worthy of his wages" Matthew 10:10; Luke 10:7.

191
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,349
God would never threaten someone who repents unless He intended to forgive them.

192
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:37,349
You might say, "Only God can do this." That's true: but what He does through His priests is still His power. What did He mean when He told the Apostles:
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19; John 20:23)?

193
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,099
Why would He say this if it weren't allowed for people to bind and loose?

194
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,205
Is this permission only for the Apostles?

195
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:51,270
If only they can baptize, give the Holy Spirit, and cleanse the sins of the nations, because all this was commanded only to the Apostles, then what about us?

196
00:21:51,270 --> 00:22:02,571
If in one place the power to release bonds and perform the sacraments is given, either everything has been passed down to us through the example and power of the Apostles, or none of it has been relaxed from the decrees.

197
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,246
"I laid the foundation," he says, "and someone else builds on it" (First Corinthians 3:10).

198
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:10,637
So, we build on what the doctrine of the Apostles has established.

199
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:17,777
Finally, bishops are also called Apostles, as Paul explains about Epaphroditus:
"My brother and coworker; your apostle" (Philippians 2:25).

200
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:25,585
Therefore, if the power of baptism and chrism, and the greater and long-standing gifts come down to bishops, they also have the right to bind and loose.

201
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:32,725
Even if we claim this right recklessly because of our sins, God will not deny it to those who hold the seat of the Apostles and the saints.

202
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,448
He has even granted bishops the name of His Only Son.

203
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:37,143
But it was not allowed to repent.

204
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:42,126
No one orders labor without a reward: "The worker deserves his wages" (Matthew 10:10; Luke 10:7).

205
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:46,236
God would never threaten someone who repents unless He intended to forgive them.

206
00:22:46,236 --> 00:23:01,236
You might say, "Only God can do this." That's true: but what He does through His priests is still His power. What did He mean when He told the Apostles:
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19; John 20:23)?

207
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,986
Why would He say this if it weren't allowed for people to bind and loose?

208
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,707
Is this only allowed for the Apostles?

209
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:13,106
Then is it also only allowed for them to baptize, give the Holy Spirit, and cleanse the sins of the nations?

210
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:16,406
Because all of this was commanded to no one else but the Apostles.

211
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:26,854
But if in one place, both the loosening of bonds and the power of the sacrament are given; either all of it is derived to us from the form and power of the Apostles, or none of it is released from the decrees.

212
00:23:26,854 --> 00:24:55,240
"I, Paul, laid the foundation, and another builds on it,"
First Corinthians 3:10.
Therefore, we build on what the Apostles' teaching has founded. Moreover, bishops are also called Apostles, as Paul explains about Epaphroditus:
"My brother and fellow worker, but your apostle"
Philippians 2:25.
If the authority of baptism and chrism, and even greater gifts, have descended to the bishops; then the right to bind and to loose has also been given. Even if we claim it rashly because of our sins, God will still not deny it to those who hold the seat of the Apostles and saints; He even granted them the name of His Only Son.
I would write more, brother, if I were not pressed by the urgency of the returning messenger, and if I did not wish to save more detailed writings either for you in person or to confess the whole purpose. No one should despise a bishop because of human considerations. Let us remember that the Apostle Peter called our Lord a bishop:
"But now you have returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls"
First Peter 2:25.
What will be denied to a bishop, in whom the name of God works? He will indeed give an account if he has done anything wrong, or judged corruptly and impiously. Nor is God prejudiced against rescinding the works of a wicked builder: meanwhile, if the administration is pious, it continues as an aid to God's works. Behold, the Apostle writes to the laypeople:
"If you forgive anyone, I do too. And what I have forgiven, if there was anything to forgive, I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, so that Satan might not outwit us; for we are not unaware of his schemes"
Second Corinthians 2:10-11.
If the Apostle says he has forgiven what the laypeople have forgiven, how will what a bishop has done be rejected?

213
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,844
So, neither baptism, forgiveness of sins, nor the renewal of the body has been granted to his holy authority because nothing has been commanded by his own usurpation.

214
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,173
All of it has flowed from apostolic authority.

215
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:15,540
I know, brother, that this very pardon for repentance is not given to everyone everywhere, nor is it relaxed before either an interpretation of divine will or a visitation has occurred.

216
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:25,261
With great weight and balance, after many groans, shedding of tears, and the prayers of the whole church, true repentance is not denied pardon, so that no one prejudges Christ, who will judge.

217
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:29,565
If you write more clearly what you think, brother, you will be more fully instructed.

218
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:39,336
I would write more, brother, if I were not pressed by the speed of the boy returning, and I would save more abundant things for you, either in your presence or for confessing the whole purpose.

219
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,526
No one should despise a bishop because of human considerations.

220
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:50,171
Let us remember that the Apostle Peter called our Lord a Bishop:
But now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls First Peter 2:25.

221
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:53,513
What will be denied to a bishop, in whom the name of God operates?

222
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:58,323
He will indeed give an account if he has done anything wrong or judged corruptly and impiously.

223
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:02,323
Nor is God prejudiced, so that he might not undo the works of a wicked builder.

224
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:06,728
Meanwhile, if that administration is pious, it continues to assist in the works of God.

225
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:10,829
See, the Apostle writes to the laity: If you forgive anyone, I also forgive them.

226
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:21,866
And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us; for we are not unaware of his schemes Second Corinthians 2:10-11.

227
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:27,182
So if what the laity forgives, the Apostle says he has forgiven; how will what a bishop does be rejected?

228
00:26:27,182 --> 00:26:35,587
So, neither baptism, forgiveness of sins, nor the renewal of the body has been granted to his holy authority because nothing has been commanded by his own usurpation.

229
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:37,916
All of it has flowed from apostolic authority.

230
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:47,283
I know, brother, that this very pardon for repentance is not given to everyone everywhere, nor is it relaxed before either an interpretation of divine will or a visitation has occurred.

231
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:54,792
With deep reflection and heavy hearts, after many sighs and tears, and the prayers of the entire church, true repentance cannot be denied.

232
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,960
No one should judge before Christ's judgment.

233
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,151
If you express your thoughts more clearly, brother, you will gain better understanding.

234
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,895
Letter TwoAbout Sympronian's letters.

235
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:08,100
Pacianus the bishop sends greetings to his brother Sympronian. I.

236
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,009
In this lengthy discussion, I will be as brief as possible.

237
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:15,890
I won't repay you, brother, with malice for your hidden verbal attacks disguised as good questions.

238
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:27,327
We are commanded to pray for those who persecute us and to bless those who curse us (Matthew 5:44)
Deceit is like a fox, while force is like a lion: both are very uncharacteristic of a person; but deceit is more deserving of hatred.

239
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:34,427
When you think you can cause more harm, you ask questions as if you are ignorant; when you believe you are teaching, you pretend to be learning.

240
00:27:34,427 --> 00:27:51,041
The old Pharisees called the Lord "Rabbi" when they posed riddles from the law; they called Him "Master" when they claimed all authority for themselves. Whatever you do, brother, you will learn everything from me plainly. I prefer to be understood as unskilled rather than malicious; I prefer to be judged as foolish rather than cunning.

241
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:58,567
So, before I explain the reasoning behind our faith—which is what you're asking about—let me address a few points from your letter that you prioritized.

242
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:04,075
You mentioned that my previous letters have restored you, yet you immediately add that I responded with bitterness.

243
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:10,924
If bitter things restore, I wonder what sweet things would do; perhaps, like in medicinal drinks, the bitter tends to heal more than the sweet.

244
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:15,761
But I ask you to reread my letters to see if they contained any bitterness, pride, or unpleasantness.

245
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,539
You say I mentioned many heresies that no one asked about.

246
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,365
Well, what does it matter to you if you were not a heretic?

247
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:30,895
Since you questioned our faith and said you wanted to be taught, I noted that ignorance has many causes and asked you to clarify which one applies to you, so I wouldn't have to cover too many points.

248
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:35,972
I responded calmly about the Catholic name, explaining that it doesn't matter what someone else is called.

249
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:45,982
And if you seek the significance of the name—whether it is something marvelous, unique, or above all—or, as I haven't said before, related to the Christian people, know that it wasn't given to us to fade away.

250
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:50,292
Indeed, I am glad that although you prefer others, you still agree with us about the name.

251
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:52,352
If you denied it, nature would proclaim it.

252
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,746
And if you still have doubts, let's remain silent.

253
00:28:54,746 --> 00:28:58,386
Whatever we are called, we will be, as shown by the name's enduring history.

254
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:05,139
But if you persistently demand to know, be cautious of the virtuous man's response: "Why do you ask my name? It is wonderful" (Judges 13:18).

255
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:15,245
You added that it shouldn't matter where the Catholic name comes from, just as the Valentinians are not blamed for being named after Valentinus, nor the Phrygians after Phrygia, nor the Novatians after Novatian.

256
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:20,752
You mentioned that my previous letters have restored you, yet you immediately add that I responded with bitterness.

257
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:27,601
If bitter things restore, I wonder what sweet things would do; perhaps, like in medicinal drinks, the bitter tends to heal more than the sweet.

258
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:33,769
But please, review my letters to see if they contain any bitterness or if I responded with pride or harshness.

259
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:37,207
You say that I mentioned several heresies that no one had asked about.

260
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:40,349
Well then, what does it matter to you if you were not a heretic?

261
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:52,036
When you raised questions about our faith and said you wanted to be taught, I explained that ignorance has many causes, and I asked you to reveal which one affected you the most, so I wouldn't be overwhelmed by addressing too many issues.

262
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,148
I responded calmly about the Catholic name.

263
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:57,242
I said that it doesn’t matter to others what someone is called.

264
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:07,750
And if you demanded the meaning of the name, whatever it is—whether it’s something wonderful, or one among all, or one above all, or what I hadn’t mentioned before—the son of the king, meaning the Christian people.

265
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,942
Surely, it wasn’t given to us for it to fade over many centuries.

266
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:16,049
And indeed, I am glad that even though you have preferred others, you also agree with us about the name.

267
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,326
What if you had denied it?

268
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:18,701
Nature would have cried out.

269
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:20,960
Or if you still have doubts, let’s keep quiet.

270
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,036
Both of us will be whatever we are called, with the age of the name as our witness.

271
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:30,535
However, if you persist obstinately, be careful lest that virtuous man cries out to you: Why do you ask my name?

272
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:31,321
It is wonderful.

273
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:31,959
Judges 13:18.

274
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:43,499
Then you added that the origin of the name Catholic shouldn’t be considered; because neither should the Valentinians be judged if they are named after Valentinus, nor the Phrygians if after Phrygia, nor the Novatians if after Novatian.

275
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:47,379
Here, you become seriously agitated, and as if pricked by a thorn, you rise up.

276
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:53,517
In your anger, you shout: Does it harm the holy man Cyprian that his people are called apostates, or Capitoline, or Syndrean?

277
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,334
You insult, and behold, I am unmoved.

278
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:57,249
Were we ever called any of these names?

279
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:05,450
Ask the world, brother, and all the years in their order; whether this name has stuck to us, or whether Cyprian’s people have been called anything other than Catholic.

280
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,316
I have never heard any of these names.

281
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:11,244
Now see, if someone could be called by a name they don’t know was given to them.

282
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:11,637
So what?

283
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:15,614
These are curses, not names; and curses from the angry, curses from the insolent.

284
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:19,003
I can call you by as many names as I want, if anger were permissible.

285
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,173
You call Cyprian holy, but his people apostates? How so?

286
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:29,167
If the beginning is holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches Romans 11:16.

287
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:31,027
Am I the apostate, or is it Novatus?

288
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:35,677
Novatus, who betrayed his father, abandoned the Church, and forsook his wife's childbirth?

289
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:43,996
Am I the apostate, or is it Novatian, who was made a bishop in absentia by a letter, and whose consecration was without ceremony, taking his seat on linen cloth?

290
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:48,026
But let these things be discussed later: for now, tell me what you are called.

291
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,713
Do you deny that Novatians are named after Novatian?

292
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:53,451
Whatever name you choose, that one will always stick.

293
00:31:53,451 --> 00:33:13,074
Search through all the annals if you wish, and trust the centuries: you will answer "Christian."
When I inquire about the sect, you will not deny Novatian.
Yet I do not condemn the name of your Novatian, which you so often avoid with circumlocutions and hidden meanings.
Admit it simply: there is no crime in the name.
Why do you hide when asked so often? Why are you ashamed of the name?
When you first wrote, I thought you were a Cataphrygian.
Do you now confess in your second letter? Do you envy my name and avoid your own?
See who is ashamed of what he is called.
Here you are greatly agitated, as if pricked by a thorn; thus, in anger, you exclaim: Does it harm holy Cyprian that his people bear the name apostate, or Capitoline, or Syndrean?
You revile me, but I am not moved.
Have we been called any of these names? Ask the world, brother, and all the years in order; did this name stick to us, or was Cyprian's people ever called anything but Catholic?
I have never heard any of these names.
Now see if anyone could be called by a name they did not know was given to them. So what then? These are insults, not names; and insults from the angry, insults from the petulant.
I too can call you many names if I am allowed to be angry.
You call Cyprian holy, but his people apostates? How so?
If the beginning is holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if the root is holy, so are the branches Romans 11:16.
Am I the apostate, or is it Novatus? Novatus, who betrayed his father, abandoned the Church, and forsook his wife's childbirth?

294
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:20,083
Am I a renegade or a Novatian, who, though absent, was made a bishop by letter and received the bishop's seat without any consecration?

295
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,598
But let’s leave that for later.

296
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:23,601
For now, you tell me what you are called.

297
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,044
Do you deny being called Novatians after Novatian?

298
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:28,340
Whatever name you choose, it will always stick.

299
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,640
Look through all the annals, if you will, and trust history: you will answer 'Christian.

300
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,718
' When I inquire about the sect, you won’t deny being Novatian.

301
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:41,581
Yet I don’t criticize the name of your Novatian, which you obscure with circumlocution and conceal in some hidden place.

302
00:33:41,581 --> 00:33:43,829
Admit it simply: there’s no crime in the name.

303
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:45,587
Why do you hide when asked so often?

304
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:47,151
Why are you ashamed of the name?

305
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,887
When you first wrote, I thought you were a Cataphrygian.

306
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:51,744
Do you admit it in your second letter?

307
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,356
You envy my name and avoid yours?

308
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:55,945
See what shame causes, as it shuns what it is called.

309
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:57,558
What do you criticize and pursue?

310
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,639
Are we here for rhetoric, or is there some craft to be handled, or should I expound on verses of Virgil?

311
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,352
When I named numerous heretics, I added: 'And those whom obscure fame hides.

312
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:10,750
' And how do you think this comes from a verse of Virgil if you didn’t know Virgil at all?

313
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,899
But I deny that I quoted the verse in order.

314
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:18,323
For I said: 'Those whom obscure fame hides;' as is customary in human speech, to say something previously said.

315
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,303
But you repeated the verse in its proper order and structure.

316
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:25,065
Did you love Virgil so much that you thought it wrong if you broke his verse?

317
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,873
And yet, I learned it from childhood.

318
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:29,218
Is it surprising if I stumbled upon what I knew?

319
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:33,957
In you, brother, there’s such effort that you now read what you once blushed to read from others?

320
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:41,970
Should you accuse a Latin speaker for speaking Latin, as much as a Greek for speaking Greek, a Parthian for speaking Parthian, a Phoenician for speaking Phoenician?

321
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:48,419
The Medes, Egyptians, and Hebrews have their own language according to the abundance of the Lord, who modulated it into 120 tongues.

322
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,934
A bishop quoted a poetic verse.

323
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:51,302
What about the Apostle Paul?

324
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:54,575
Does he blush when he both quotes and approves that Athenian verse?

325
00:34:55,943 --> 00:35:01,453
In the Acts of the Apostles, it says:
Some of your own poets have said:
For we are also his offspring.

326
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:03,992
Since we are God's offspring
(Acts 17:28, 29)
.

327
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:11,825
And again, he said to Titus:
One of them, a prophet of their own, said,
'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons'
(Titus 1:12, 13)
.

328
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,770
And he adds:
This testimony is true.

329
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,550
We sin by example:
We are not rhetoricians, but we believe in any voice that comes as the abundance of God.

330
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,790
Rome, Egypt, Athens, Thrace, Arabs, Spain confess God; the Holy Spirit understands all languages.

331
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:52,394
Why do you say,
"I will polish your writings with lively cedar against the decayed enemies of the Muses"?
Which Muses, I pray, are you talking about?
Are they the ones who invented letters and wrote pages that moths will pursue?
Tell me, brother, did the Muses discover letters?
Is not everything through the Lord, and everything from God?
Besides those 120 languages, was there another of the Muses?
Hesiod lied about that on Helicon, but the Athenians, as the Apostle said, did nothing but talk
(Acts 17:21)
.

332
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:59,470
We, as the Apostle testifies
(First Corinthians 14:10, 18)
,
retain all kinds of voices and all kinds of languages inspired by God.

333
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:09,896
However, I forgive you, brother, if you presume something from your author and combine the philosophy of Novatian, through which he suffered shipwreck in religion, with the authority of Hesiod.

334
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:17,783
Nevertheless, you should have remembered the Apostle who said:
Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit
(Colossians 2:8)
.

335
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:19,673
What are you criticizing and doing?

336
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:25,021
Are we coming to a rhetorician, or is it an art to be handled, or am I explaining verses of Virgil?

337
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:29,235
When I mentioned several heretics, I added:
And those whom obscure fame hides.

338
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:34,259
And how do you think this was taken from a verse of Virgil if you did not know Virgil at all?

339
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,960
But I deny it; I did not place the verse in order.

340
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:45,224
For I said:
Those whom obscure fame hides;
as it is customary for speakers to say something from the abundance of human speech that has been said before.

341
00:36:45,224 --> 00:36:48,141
But you repeated the verse in its order and structure.

342
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:52,841
You loved Virgil so much that you thought it would not be right if you broke his verse?

343
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,800
I learned this from a young age. Is it any wonder I fell into what I knew?

344
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,987
Brother, you put in so much effort, only to now read what you once blushed to read from others?

345
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:12,269
If you were educated in Latin and speak Latin, should you not criticize just as you would a Greek speaking Greek, a Parthian speaking Parthian, or a Punic speaking Punic?

346
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:20,296
Medes, Egyptians, Hebrews all have their own languages, according to the abundance of the Lord, who expressed it in one hundred and twenty tongues.

347
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,098
The bishop quoted a poetic verse.

348
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:23,627
What about the Apostle Paul?

349
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:27,012
Did he blush when he recited and approved that Athenian verse?

350
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:35,803
For in the Acts of the Apostles, it is written: "Some of your own poets have said, 'For we are indeed his offspring.'" So being God's offspring (Acts 17:28, 29).

351
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:44,048
And he also said to Titus: "One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.'" (Titus 1:12, 13).

352
00:37:44,048 --> 00:38:27,565
And he adds: "This testimony is true."
So we sin by example: we are not rhetoricians, but we believe in whatever voice, the abundance of God.
Latium, Egypt, Athens, Thrace, Arabs, Spaniards all confess God; the Holy Spirit understands all languages.
Why do you say, "I will preserve your letters with durable cedar against the decayed enemies of the Muses?"
Which Muses, I ask?
Are they the ones who discovered letters and wrote papers that moths will pursue?
Tell me, brother, did the Muses discover letters?
Is not everything through the Lord, and everything from God?
Besides those one hundred and twenty languages, was there another of the Muses?
Hesiod lied about this on Helicon, with the enthusiasm of the Athenians, who, as the Apostle said, had no interest except in talking (Acts 17:21).

353
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:34,882
We, with the Apostle as our witness (First Corinthians 14:10, 18), retain all modes of speech, all kinds of languages inspired by God.

354
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:45,311
I forgive you, brother, if you presume anything from your author, and if you combine Novatian's philosophy, through which he fell into the shipwreck of religion, with the authority of Hesiod.

355
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:53,992
Nevertheless, you should have remembered the Apostle, who said: "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit" (Colossians 2:8).

356
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,660
Now, what do you think of this accusation against Catholics?

357
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:05,996
If kings or empires have ever persecuted you,
by the same logic, should it not be held against you whenever Catholics have endured persecution from kings and empires?

358
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:08,155
Our people were persecuted by pagan rulers.

359
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:10,164
Did you endure the hatred of Christians?

360
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,720
But our people complained more.

361
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,194
Let the one who did this see with what intention and spirit it was done;
whether it was for peace or discord.

362
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:22,617
Even if some of them did wrong, as it is written,
Does their unfaithfulness nullify the faithfulness of God?

363
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:23,270
(Romans 3:3).

364
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,383
However, do not think that our people were merely complaining.

365
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:34,116
When Christian rulers began to emerge through our faith,
those rulers, favoring the Catholic side, that is, their own side, were moved by their own grief.

366
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:49,682
Unless perhaps it will be held against Daniel that he was vindicated by Darius,
or against the most holy woman Esther, when the king's leader was killed for her sake,
or against the three youths, because the Babylonian king threatened the profane and unbelieving because of them after the trials of the flames.

367
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:52,494
Did not Peter confound Simon, with the judge's approval?

368
00:39:52,494 --> 00:39:55,005
Did not Paul blind Elymas, with Sergius's support?

369
00:39:55,005 --> 00:39:59,123
And he would have been vindicated in Jerusalem, if he had any faith to hold on to.

370
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:04,245
Do you not know that the authorities serve the innocent and minister for the good of the holy fathers?

371
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:07,860
As the Apostle says: Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil.

372
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,069
Do you want to be unafraid of the authority?

373
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:15,744
Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same; for he is God's servant to you for good
(Romans 13:3-4).

374
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:19,459
And yet I have complained about no one, nor have I been avenged by anyone.

375
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:25,435
I do not think the Novatians are a hindrance to me, whose small number and weakness I could boast about if I wanted to.

376
00:40:25,435 --> 00:40:29,101
Behold, no one accuses your people before the Emperor, and you are alone.

377
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:33,620
We all must stand before the judgment seat of God
(Romans 14:10; Second Corinthians 5:19).

378
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,039
One thing I know, the Novatians would complain if their cause was favored by any rulers.

379
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:42,755
You endured the hatred of Christians? But our people complained more.

380
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:47,781
Let the one who did this see with what intention and spirit; whether he sought peace or discord.

381
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:53,016
But even if some of them sinned, he says, does their unfaithfulness nullify the faithfulness of God?

382
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:56,785
(Romans 3:3)
Yet, you should not think that our people were complaining.

383
00:40:56,785 --> 00:41:04,951
When Christian leaders began to emerge from our faith, those very leaders, favoring the Catholic Church—that is, their own side—were moved by personal pain.

384
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:19,347
Unless perhaps Daniel is to be blamed for being avenged by Darius, or Esther, the most holy woman, when the leader of the king was killed for her; or the three boys, because for them, after the ordeal of the flames, the Babylonian king threatened the impious and unbelieving.

385
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:22,173
Did not Peter confound Simon, with the judge agreeing?

386
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,791
Did not Paul blind Elymas, with Sergius approving?

387
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:28,612
He would also have been avenged in Jerusalem if he had any binding faith.

388
00:41:28,612 --> 00:41:33,480
Do you not know that powers serve the innocent and minister for the good of the holy fathers?

389
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,354
As the Apostle says: Leaders are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.

390
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,500
Do you wish to have no fear of authority?

391
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:45,311
Do what is good, and you will receive approval from it through the Lord: For he is God's servant for your good.

392
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:49,761
(Romans 13:3-4)
And yet I did not complain about anyone, nor was I avenged by anyone.

393
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:55,623
Nor do I think that the Novatians hinder me, whose insignificance and shortcomings I could boast of if I wished.

394
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:59,235
Behold, no one accuses your people to the emperor, and you are alone.

395
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:01,853
We all must stand before the judgment seat of God.

396
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:08,972
(Romans 14:10; Second Corinthians 5:19) This one thing I know, the Novatians would complain if their cause were pleasing to any princes.

397
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,485
You say it is more useful to win than to please.

398
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:15,306
But those who are driven by the desire to win advance through contention.

399
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:21,274
The Apostle, however, says: If anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.

400
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:30,958
(First Corinthians 9:16) On the contrary, regarding the desire to please: I try to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.

401
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:39,648
(First Corinthians 10:33) But you, while thinking of your own interests and not those of your brothers, prefer to crush by winning rather than to restore by pleasing.

402
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:47,327
To overcome evil with good is rational; however, in any situation, wanting to be victorious is a sign of irrational arrogance.

403
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:55,253
This perspective is not from Apostolic law but from Greek tradition, where it is believed that the entire Spartan custom was driven by the desire to win.

404
00:42:55,253 --> 00:43:00,019
The muddy pig and the insane tiger, what else do they want but to win rather than to please?

405
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:03,904
You write that you have free time, and thus contentious things delight you.

406
00:43:03,904 --> 00:43:10,794
As for me, occupied with Catholic affairs, your letters were delivered to me after almost 30 days and repeated after another 40 days.

407
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:13,695
It would be more useful, you say, to win than to please.

408
00:43:13,695 --> 00:43:17,736
But those who are driven by the fervor of winning progress through contention.

409
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:25,196
However, the Apostle says: "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor does the Church of God" (First Corinthians 9:16).

410
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:34,676
On the contrary, regarding the effort to please: "I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved" (First Corinthians 10:33).

411
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:41,825
But you, considering your own advantages rather than those of your brothers, prefer to crush by winning rather than to revive by pleasing.

412
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:48,352
To overcome evil with good is rational; however, in any situation, wanting to be victorious is a sign of irrational arrogance.

413
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:56,278
This perspective is not from Apostolic law but from Greek tradition, where it is believed that the entire Spartan custom was driven by the desire to win.

414
00:43:56,278 --> 00:44:01,044
The muddy pig and the insane tiger, what else do they want but to win rather than to please?

415
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:04,930
You write that you have free time, and thus contentious things delight you.

416
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,820
As for me, occupied with Catholic affairs, your letters were delivered to me after almost 30 days and repeated after another 40 days.

417
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,736
You say that I am angry; far from it.

418
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:17,414
I am stirred, like a bee that sometimes defends its honey with a sting.

419
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:22,232
But consider both of our letters; you will see whether we arm our page with barbs or flowers.

420
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:26,066
As for those like you, the Apostle says they must be stopped (Titus 1:11).

421
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:26,998
But pay attention.

422
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,314
We contend with you like doves, more with words than with teeth.

423
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:32,956
Would that it were true that you wish to be taught!

424
00:44:32,956 --> 00:44:36,945
I would already be offering you the holy oil of the Spirit with my own hands.

425
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:37,722
Do you love me?

426
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:39,172
I have not hurt you, I know.

427
00:44:40,415 --> 00:44:45,918
Only then can you truly love, if you approach my work with kindness and without holding differing opinions.

428
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:48,746
You're curious why I appreciate the letters of Cyprian?

429
00:44:48,746 --> 00:44:52,089
Why not, given that he is a blessed martyr and a Catholic priest?

430
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,477
You mention Novatian to me?

431
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:58,774
I know he was a worldly philosopher, and it's no surprise he strayed from the Church of the living God.

432
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:03,608
He abandoned the ancient law and the heritage of the old people out of envy towards Cornelius.

433
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:08,133
He supported the madness of Novatus and became a bishop without legitimate consecration.

434
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:14,818
Thus, he was never truly made one, even with a letter from those pretending to be Confessors, who sought to divide the one mother.

435
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:19,189
I'll prove these points to you, brother, through the writings of your own Confessors.

436
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:25,411
Your philosopher, trying to establish his own wisdom, as the Apostle says in Romans 10:3, is not subject to God's wisdom.

437
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:28,342
The world did not recognize God's wisdom through its own.

438
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:31,788
You think Novatian suffered, and you add that Cyprian mentioned it.

439
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:34,462
My adversary preceded me; see how clearly I respond.

440
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:40,324
Novatian never endured martyrdom, nor has this ever been heard or read from the words of the most blessed Cyprian.

441
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:45,158
Cyprian's letters report Cornelius, the bishop of the city, whom Novatian envied at that time.

442
00:45:45,158 --> 00:45:49,220
Cornelius resisted enemy leaders, often confessed, and was frequently harassed.

443
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:56,574
He was made a leader by many Confessors and Martyrs and was crowned most gloriously with many others while Novatian was still alive and secure.

444
00:45:56,574 --> 00:46:00,534
Indeed, Novatian left the church of Christ to avoid the burden of confession.

445
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:03,413
Driven by envy, he couldn't bear Cornelius's episcopate.

446
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:06,499
Ridiculed by a few letters, he committed himself to Novatus.

447
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:09,841
Cyprian's letters will teach you all these things about Novatian.

448
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,572
Even if Novatian did suffer, he wasn't killed; and even if he was killed, he wasn't crowned.

449
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:14,984
Why not?

450
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:20,434
Because outside the peace of the Church, outside concord, outside the mother, one cannot be a true martyr.

451
00:46:20,434 --> 00:46:26,245
Listen to the Apostle: And if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains; but do not have charity, I am nothing.

452
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:34,536
And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.

453
00:46:34,536 --> 00:46:35,787
First Corinthians 13:2-3.

454
00:46:35,787 --> 00:46:43,343
As for Cyprian, he suffered in harmony with everyone, in common peace, among the group of Confessors, and often confessed during repeated persecutions.

455
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:47,447
He was tormented with many lacerations and was finally offered the saving chalice.

456
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:48,898
This was his crowning moment.

457
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:55,904
Therefore, let Novatian keep his letters to himself; let him keep his arrogance and pride, which, while lifting him up, caused his downfall.

458
00:46:55,904 --> 00:46:57,856
While sparing no one, he was scattered.

459
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:02,510
Behold the one who blocks the path of salvation for his brothers with unyielding religiosity!

460
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:07,614
Behold the one who confidently claims to bear himself openly and to purify the Lord’s threshing floor!

461
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:09,216
You say I am angry; far from it.

462
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:12,719
I am stirred like a bee, which sometimes defends honey with its sting.

463
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,374
But consider the letters from both sides; you will soon see whether we are arming the page with barbs or flowers.

464
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:21,626
The Apostle indeed speaks of similar people who must be silenced.

465
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:22,177
Titus 1:11.

466
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:23,078
But pay attention.

467
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:26,631
We fight with you like doves, more with our mouths than with our teeth.

468
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:29,033
If only it were true that you want to be taught!

469
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:33,187
I would already be offering you the holy anointing of the Spirit with my own hands.

470
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:33,937
Do you love me?

471
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,438
I have not harmed you, I know.

472
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:39,992
But you would truly love me if you did not think differently and approached my work kindly.

473
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:42,395
Are you surprised that I like Cyprian's letters?

474
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:46,098
Why wouldn’t I like the letters of a blessed martyr and a Catholic priest?

475
00:47:46,098 --> 00:47:47,449
You mention Novatian to me?

476
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:53,004
I hear he was a philosopher of the world; nor am I surprised that he strayed from the Church of the living God.

477
00:47:53,004 --> 00:48:09,018
I know he abandoned the root of the ancient law, the source of the old people, envying Cornelius, accommodating Novatus’s madness, and became a bishop without legitimate consecration, and therefore was not made one through the letter of those who pretended to be Confessors, who would tear apart the limbs of one mother.

478
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:13,822
These things, brother, I will prove to you with the confession of your own people, with letters.

479
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:23,030
Thus, your philosopher, seeking to establish his own wisdom, as the Apostle says, is not subject to the wisdom of God; for in his wisdom, the world did not recognize the wisdom of God.

480
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,630
Romans 10:3.

481
00:48:25,031 --> 00:49:36,741
Because you think Novatian suffered before Cyprian, and you add that Cyprian said, "My adversary preceded me," see how clearly I respond. Novatian never suffered martyrdom, nor was this ever heard or read from the words of the most blessed Cyprian.
You have his letters in which he speaks of Cornelius, the bishop of Rome, whom Novatian envied at the time. Cornelius resisted hostile leaders, often confessed, was often tormented; he led many Confessors and Martyrs, and was crowned most gloriously with many while Novatian was still alive and even unconcerned. Novatian had left the church of Christ to avoid the burden of confession. Initially provoked by envy, he could not endure the episcopate of Cornelius; then he committed himself to Novatus, mocked by the letters of a few. All these things about Novatian, Cyprian's letters will teach you thoroughly.
Furthermore, even if Novatian did suffer something, he was not killed; even if he was killed, he was not crowned. Why? Because he was outside the peace of the Church, outside harmony, outside the mother of whom a martyr should be a part. Listen to the Apostle: "And if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give away all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing" (First Corinthians 13:2-3).

482
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:41,762
However, Cyprian suffered in the harmony of all, in common peace, among the group of Confessors.

483
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:48,195
He often confessed under repeated persecutions, was tormented with much laceration, and finally was offered the saving cup.

484
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:49,398
This was to be crowned.

485
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:57,296
Therefore, let Novatian keep his letters; his arrogance and pride, which, while lifting him high, cast him down; while he spares no one, he is spilled.

486
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:00,748
Behold, he who inexorably closes the way of salvation to brothers!

487
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:05,822
Behold, he who confidently claims to carry himself openly and cleanse the Lord's threshing floor!

488
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:16,073
Have mercy on yourself, brother Sympronian, and do not let Novatian deceive you under this facade; and let him not be considered more righteous because he despises others by comparison to himself.

489
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:22,639
Often, boldness pretends to be confidence; and to those desperate sinners, a false image of a good conscience flatters them.

490
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:29,989
On the other hand, all humility is innocence, even that which owes a debt, even that which sins, even that which flatters its soul with the sinner.

491
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:35,888
Moses said, Erase me from the book you have written, so that sinners might not perish (Exodus thirty-two, thirty-two).

492
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:43,438
The Apostle said, I wished that I myself were accursed in Christ for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh (Romans nine, three).

493
00:50:43,438 --> 00:50:48,788
Certainly, both are praying on behalf of sinners; and because of this, neither Moses nor Paul offended God.

494
00:50:48,788 --> 00:50:50,238
Is Novatian better than them?

495
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:51,588
A reformer of the Prophets?

496
00:50:51,588 --> 00:50:52,888
A teacher of the Apostles?

497
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:55,187
Does he now seem to be with Christ like Moses?

498
00:50:55,187 --> 00:50:57,637
Does he now ascend to the third heaven like Paul?

499
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,887
Is he now heard alone, neglecting all others?

500
00:50:59,887 --> 00:51:02,137
This should be enough to answer your letters.

501
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:14,386
But because you argued more extensively about not doing penance, or doing it before baptism; and filled the page of the treatise with many chapters of examples, I will respond to each abundantly: I will not be silent about what true faith holds.

502
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:18,486
You, as you generously commanded our hearing, offer a kind return to the treatise.

503
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:24,936
Perhaps the Lord will provide that we who have patiently presented ourselves to you, may also reap some fruit from your patience.

504
00:51:24,936 --> 00:51:31,236
May the Lord deign to guard and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian and Catholic, and be in harmony with us.

505
00:51:31,236 --> 00:51:31,486
Amen.

506
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:41,335
Have mercy on yourself, brother Sympronian, and do not let Novatian deceive you under this pretense; and therefore be considered more righteous, because he despised others in comparison to himself.

507
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:47,535
Often, boldness pretends to be confidence; and to those desperate sinners, a false image of a good conscience flatters them.

508
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:54,884
On the other hand, all humility is innocence, even that which owes a debt, even that which sins, even that which flatters its soul with the sinner.

509
00:51:54,884 --> 00:52:00,784
Moses said, Erase me from the book you have written, so that sinners might not perish (Exodus thirty-two, thirty-two).

510
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:08,334
The Apostle said, I wished that I myself were accursed in Christ for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh (Romans nine, three).

511
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:14,058
Of course, both pray for sinners; and because of this, neither Moses nor Paul offended God.

512
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:17,038
Is Novatian better than them? A corrector of the Prophets?

513
00:52:17,038 --> 00:52:18,373
A teacher of the Apostles?

514
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:20,839
Has he already been seen with Christ like Moses?

515
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:23,870
Has he already been elevated to the third heaven like Paul?

516
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,438
Has he been heard alone, neglecting everyone else?

517
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,904
This should suffice in response to your letters.

518
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:41,284
But because you broadly debated about not doing penance, or doing it before baptism, and you filled the page of the treatise with many chapters of examples, I will respond to each abundantly: I will not be silent about what true faith holds.

519
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:46,369
You, as you graciously commanded our hearing, kindly offer your graciousness again to the treatise.

520
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:52,534
Perhaps the Lord will grant that we, who have patiently submitted to you, may also gain some benefit from your patience.

521
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:59,058
May the Lord deign to keep and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian and Catholic, and be in agreement with us.

522
00:52:59,058 --> 00:52:59,314
Amen.

523
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:04,031
Letter Three Against the Treatises of the Novatians.

524
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:07,115
Pacianus, bishop, sends greetings to his brother Sympronian.

525
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:21,403
The entire treatise of the Novatians, which you have sent to me from all sides with propositions, my brother Sympronian, contains this: that it is not permitted to repent after baptism; that the Church cannot forgive mortal sin, and indeed that it perishes by accepting sinners.

526
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:29,575
A remarkable honor, unique authority, and great constancy; to reject the guilty, to avoid the touch of sinners, and to mistakenly trust in one's own innocence.

527
00:53:29,575 --> 00:53:31,014
Who advocates this, brother?

528
00:53:31,014 --> 00:53:32,196
Moses, Paul, or Christ?

529
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:43,914
Moses wished to be erased from the book for the sake of blasphemers Exodus thirty-two verse thirty-two,
Paul desired to be cursed for his brothers Romans nine verse three,
and the Lord Himself preferred to suffer for the unjust.

530
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:45,097
None of these, you say.

531
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:45,559
Who then?

532
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,998
Novatian has commanded this.

533
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:57,894
Someone pure and spotless, who has never heard of Novatus, who has never deserted the Church, who became a bishop by bishops, who was consecrated by the usual order, who succeeded to a vacant chair in the Church?

534
00:53:57,894 --> 00:53:59,282
What does it matter to you?

535
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:00,824
you say; Novatian taught this.

536
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,725
But when, brother, and in what times?

537
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:04,627
Immediately after the Lord's passion?

538
00:54:04,627 --> 00:54:09,150
After the reign of Decius, that is, nearly three hundred years after the Lord's passion.

539
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,664
What then?

540
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:15,728
Did he follow prophets like the Cataphrygians, or some Philomena like Apelles; or did he alone receive such authority?

541
00:54:15,728 --> 00:54:16,962
Did he speak in tongues?

542
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,784
Did he prophesy?

543
00:54:17,784 --> 00:54:19,018
Could he raise the dead?

544
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:23,181
For he should have had some of these things to introduce a new law of the gospel.

545
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:49,752
And even if the Apostle cries out against this, "Even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed" Galatians one verse eight.
Novatian understood it this way, you say: but Christ taught this.
So from Christ to the reign of Decius, no one understood?
After Decius, finally, every bishop was impatient; all others were dissolute who preferred to mix with the lost, who preferred to perish with the wretched, who preferred to be wounded by another's wound?

546
00:54:50,831 --> 00:55:02,822
The entire treatise of the Novatians that you, my brother Sympronian, have sent to me contains this: that repentance is not allowed after baptism, that the Church cannot forgive mortal sin, and that it perishes by accepting sinners.

547
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:11,504
What an extraordinary honor, unique authority, and great steadfastness—to reject the guilty, to avoid the touch of sinners, and to wrongly trust in one's own innocence.

548
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:14,088
Who supports this, brother—Moses, Paul, or Christ?

549
00:55:14,088 --> 00:55:22,771
But Moses wishes to be erased from the book for the blasphemers; and Paul wishes to be anathema for his brothers; and the Lord Himself prefers to suffer for the unjust.

550
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:23,959
None of these, you say.

551
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:24,424
Who then?

552
00:55:24,424 --> 00:55:25,665
Novatian commanded this.

553
00:55:25,665 --> 00:55:36,208
Someone immaculate and pure, who has not heard of Novatus, who has never deserted the Church, who became a bishop by bishops, who was consecrated by regular law, who obtained a vacant chair in the Church?

554
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,086
What's it to you?

555
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:38,637
you ask; Novatian taught this.

556
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:40,549
But when, brother, and in what times?

557
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:42,151
Right after the Lord's passion?

558
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:45,924
No, after the reign of Decius, almost 300 years after the Lord's passion.

559
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:46,441
What then?

560
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:52,798
Did he follow prophets like the Cataphrygians, or some Philomena like Apelles; or did he himself receive so much authority?

561
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:54,038
Did he speak in tongues?

562
00:55:54,038 --> 00:55:54,865
Did he prophesy?

563
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:56,105
Could he raise the dead?

564
00:55:56,105 --> 00:56:00,550
For he ought to have had some of these abilities to introduce the gospel of a new law.

565
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:35,642
And if the Apostle cries out against it: "Even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you other than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed." Novatian understood this, you say; but Christ taught this. Therefore, from Christ until the reign of Decius, no one understood? After Decius, finally, every bishop was impatient; all others were dissolute who preferred to mix with the lost, who preferred to perish with the wretched, who preferred to be wounded by another's wound? Under Novatian's rule, justice is liberated; under his leadership, everything that has gone astray is corrected.
Come on, you say, let us compete with examples and fight with reason.

566
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:42,712
But I have been at peace up to this point, content with the tranquility of the ancient congregation of the Church.

567
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:46,930
I have not engaged in studies of discord nor sought out arguments for disputes.

568
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:59,320
After you were separated from the rest of the body and divided from the mother, to justify your actions, you began to diligently search through every corner of books, probing into hidden things, and disturbing whatever was at peace.

569
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,272
Our ancestors did not engage in disputes; our security lies in simplicity.

570
00:57:03,272 --> 00:57:06,316
What fortified arguments have you brought from your side?

571
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:12,457
I do not know what Novatian did, what Novatus admitted, what Evaristus boasted about, or what Nicostratus declared.

572
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:17,691
Since I ignore your weapons, I am not familiar with them; see if you can clash with unarmed truth.

573
00:57:17,691 --> 00:57:21,322
Nonetheless, let’s wait to hear what you object to and what you say.

574
00:57:21,322 --> 00:57:24,153
Could bare truth or innocent ignorance even stand up?

575
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:34,460
You propose, and rightly so, that the Church is a people renewed by water and the Holy Spirit, without denying the name of Christ, a temple and house of God, the pillar and foundation of truth.

576
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,275
First Timothy chapter 3, verse 15.

577
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:40,815
A holy virgin with the purest thoughts, the bride of Christ from His bones and flesh.

578
00:57:40,815 --> 00:57:42,417
Ephesians chapter 5, verse 30.

579
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,698
Without spot or wrinkle.

580
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,301
Ephesians chapter 5, verse 27.

581
00:57:45,301 --> 00:57:47,597
Adhering to the full rights of the Gospels.

582
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,932
Who among us denies this?

583
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:52,777
Moreover, we add that the Church is a queen in golden and varied attire.

584
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:53,792
Psalm 45, verse 10.

585
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:56,408
A fruitful vine on the sides of the Lord's house.

586
00:57:56,408 --> 00:57:57,423
Psalm 128, verse 3.

587
00:57:57,423 --> 00:57:59,346
The Mother of countless young women.

588
00:57:59,346 --> 00:58:01,215
Song of Solomon chapter 6, verse 7.

589
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:03,885
The one beautiful dove of her mother, and perfect.

590
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:05,754
Song of Solomon chapter 6, verse 9.

591
00:58:05,754 --> 00:58:12,483
She is the mother of all, built on the foundations of the Prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone.

592
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:14,085
Ephesians chapter 2, verse 20.

593
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:16,702
A great house enriched with a variety of vessels.

594
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,226
Come, you say, let us contend with examples and fight with reason.

595
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:26,315
But I have been at peace up to this point: content with the tranquility of the ancient congregation of the Church.

596
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:30,533
I have not engaged in studies of discord nor sought out arguments for disputes.

597
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:40,736
After you were separated from the rest of the body and divided from the mother, you diligently search through all the recesses of books to explain your actions.

598
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:44,392
You seek out hidden things and disturb whatever is otherwise secure.

599
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:47,241
Our ancestors did not engage in unnecessary disputes.

600
00:58:47,241 --> 00:58:48,961
Our security is straightforward.

601
00:58:48,961 --> 00:58:51,219
What fortified arguments have you brought?

602
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:57,186
I do not know what Novatian did, what Novatus committed, what Evaristus inflated, or what Nicostratus reported.

603
00:58:57,186 --> 00:58:59,766
While I disregard your arms, I do not know them.

604
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:01,809
See if you contend with unarmed truth.

605
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,980
Let us wait, however, for what you object to, what you say.

606
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,044
Could naked truth or innocent ignorance stand on its own?

607
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:19,226
You propose, and rightly so, that the Church is a people renewed by water and the Holy Spirit, without denying the name of Christ, a temple and house of God, the pillar and foundation of truth 1 Timothy 3:15.

608
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:29,278
A holy virgin with the purest thoughts, the bride of Christ from His bones and flesh Ephesians 5:30, without spot or wrinkle Ephesians 5:27, faithfully preserving the laws of the Gospels.

609
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:30,622
Who among us denies this?

610
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:45,835
We even add that the Church is a queen in a golden and multicolored robe Psalm 45:10, a fruitful vine on the sides of the Lord's house Psalm 128:3, the mother of young maidens beyond number Song of Solomon 6:7, a unique, beautiful dove of her mother, and perfect Song of Solomon 6:8.

611
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:53,307
The very mother of all, built on the foundations of the Prophets and Apostles, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone Ephesians 2:20.

612
00:59:53,307 --> 00:59:55,941
A great house enriched with all kinds of vessels.

613
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:57,769
But these are our arguments later.

614
00:59:57,769 --> 00:59:59,166
For now, let us see yours.

615
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:02,446
The Church is a people reborn from water and the Holy Spirit.

616
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:02,714
Fine.

617
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,112
Who closed God's fountain?

618
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:05,456
Who took away the Spirit?

619
01:00:05,456 --> 01:00:09,488
Indeed, with us, there is living water, the very one springing from Christ.

620
01:00:09,488 --> 01:00:13,035
You, separated from the eternal fountain, from where are you born?

621
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:15,723
The Holy Spirit has not left the principal mother.

622
01:00:15,723 --> 01:00:16,852
How did He reach you?

623
01:00:16,852 --> 01:00:25,722
Unless perhaps He followed you in discord, content with an unconsecrated seat, having abandoned so many priests, and loved a worn-out pond of a counterfeit fountain.

624
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,241
Your people, where do they receive the Spirit that is not anointed by a priest?

625
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:34,475
Where do they get the water that has departed from the source?

626
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:38,023
Where is the renewal that has lost the cradle of the bride of peace?

627
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:41,048
The Church is a people who do not deny the name of Christ.

628
01:00:41,048 --> 01:00:45,222
Do we not have among us confessors who were tested by chains, fires, and swords?

629
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:48,665
You might say, they were, but by accepting deniers, they perished.

630
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:57,794
I won't remain silent about the fact that even Novatian, when he was still in the Church, wrote, advised, and read the document about accepting back the deniers or the fallen.

631
01:00:57,794 --> 01:01:02,437
Meanwhile, whom can you convince that the whole Church collapsed by accepting the fallen?

632
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:05,985
That by admitting penitents, those who admitted them became deniers?

633
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:13,549
And if some people were more lenient, did the others who did not approve their actions but followed the custom and peace lose the Christian name?

634
01:01:13,549 --> 01:02:19,542
Hear the voice of Jeremiah: "In those days, they will not say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,' but everyone will die for their own sin."
Jeremiah 31:29-30.
Nor is the Lord silent in Ezekiel: "As the father’s soul, so also the son’s soul is mine. Everyone will die for their own sin."
Ezekiel 18:4.
And further down: "The son will not bear the iniquity of the father, nor will the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous will be upon them."
Ezekiel 18:20.
You yourself cite this example: "And if these three men were in its midst, Noah, Job, and Daniel, they would not save sons or daughters; they alone would be saved."
Ezekiel 14:16.
Behold, they are saved who are placed among sinners, who cannot save others. You bind the whole world with the chains of a few; you condemn the whole Church with the weakness of a small portion.
What of all the saints with you, whom Novatus trained, whom Evaristus chose, whom Nicostratus taught, whom Novatian instructed? You reject thorns and thistles. You do not have weeds in your crop. For you, the grains are already purified. The one who purifies will come to you without a winnowing fan.
Matthew 3:12.
Will you alone among all not have chaff?

635
01:02:20,063 --> 01:02:23,620
But let’s leave our things for later; for now, let’s focus on yours.

636
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,072
The Church is the community reborn from water and the Holy Spirit.

637
01:02:27,072 --> 01:02:28,902
So, who has blocked God’s fountain?

638
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:30,471
Who has taken the Spirit away?

639
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:35,178
On the contrary, among us, there is living water, the very water that springs from Christ.

640
01:02:35,178 --> 01:02:38,891
You, separated from the eternal source, where are you regenerated from?

641
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:42,657
The Holy Spirit has not left the original mother: how does He reach you?

642
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:50,554
Unless perhaps He followed someone discordant, content with a seat not consecrated by so many priests, and loved the worn-out pool of a false fountain.

643
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:55,627
Where does your community get the Spirit; the people whom an anointed priest does not consecrate?

644
01:02:55,627 --> 01:02:58,974
Where do they get the water, which has departed from the mother?

645
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:02,897
Where do they get renewal, which has lost the cradle of the peaceful bride?

646
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:09,852
The Church is a community without denying the name of Christ: are there not confessors among us, proven by chains, fires, and swords?

647
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,879
You will say, they existed, but by accepting those who denied, they perished.

648
01:03:13,879 --> 01:03:23,503
I won’t even mention that, indeed, Novatianus of your group, when he was still in the Church, both wrote and advised and read a document about accepting those who had denied or lapsed.

649
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,889
Meanwhile, how can you persuade anyone that the entire Church has fallen by accepting those who lapsed?

650
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,707
That by admitting the penitent, the admitting people have become deniers?

651
01:03:32,707 --> 01:03:40,500
And if some people have been more lenient, have the rest who did not approve of their actions but followed custom and peace, lost the Christian name?

652
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:50,855
Hear the voice of Jeremiah: "In those days, they will not say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,' but each will die for his own sin" (Jeremiah 31:29-30).

653
01:03:50,855 --> 01:03:59,014
Nor is the Lord silent through Ezekiel: "Just as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. Each will die for his own sin" (Ezekiel 18:4).

654
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:08,637
Further down: "The son will not bear the iniquity of the father, nor will the father bear the iniquity of the son: The righteousness of the righteous will be upon him" (Ezekiel 18:20).

655
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:17,842
You even cite this example: "Even if these three men were in it, Noah, Job, and Daniel, they would not save their sons or daughters; they alone would be saved" (Ezekiel 14:16).

656
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:23,394
Here are the ones who are saved, who are in the midst of sinners and cannot save others.

657
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:29,385
You bind the whole world with the chains of a few; you condemn the whole Church with the weakness of a small portion.

658
01:04:29,385 --> 01:04:36,451
What about all the saints with you, those whom Novatus taught, whom Evaristus chose, whom Nicostratus instructed, whom Novatianus trained?

659
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:42,442
You have avoided thorns and thistles; you don't have weeds among your crops; for you, the grains are already cleaned.

660
01:04:42,442 --> 01:04:47,256
The purifier will come to you without a winnowing fan; will you be the only one without chaff?

661
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:50,123
Come on, say the rest: the Church is the body of Christ.

662
01:04:50,123 --> 01:04:57,497
Indeed, a body, not a part; a body gathered from many parts and members into one, as the Apostle says: For the body is not one member, but many.

663
01:04:57,497 --> 01:05:03,078
Therefore, the Church is a full body, both a body and a solid one, already spread throughout the whole world.

664
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:10,759
Like a city, I say, whose parts are united; not like you Novatians, an insolent little part and lump gathered and separated from the rest of the body.

665
01:05:10,759 --> 01:05:23,151
The Church is the temple of God; certainly a spacious temple, a great house, having indeed vessels of gold and silver, but also wooden and earthenware ones, some for honor, but many magnificent ones destined for various uses of various works.

666
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:27,248
The Church is a holy virgin, with the most chaste feelings, the bride of Christ.

667
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:29,296
A virgin; it is true: but also a mother.

668
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:35,748
A bride; it is clear: but also a wife and partner taken from her husband; therefore bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh.

669
01:05:35,748 --> 01:05:43,019
For David said about her: Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.

670
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:50,188
Therefore, this virgin has many offspring and countless children, with which the whole world is filled, always buzzing with populous swarms.

671
01:05:50,188 --> 01:06:01,914
This mother has great care for her children and a tender affection; the good are honored, the proud are punished, the sick are cared for; no one is lost, no one is despised; children are safely kept under the mother's indulgence.

672
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:03,860
The Church is without spot or wrinkle.

673
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:09,656
This means avoiding heresies, such as the Valentinians, the Cataphrygians, and the Novatians.

674
01:06:09,656 --> 01:06:14,847
Among these are some blemished and wrinkled folds, envious of the ornaments of precious garments.

675
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:22,767
However, the sinner and the penitent are not a stain on the Church; because as long as he sins and does not repent, he is placed outside the Church.

676
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:25,122
When he stops sinning, he is already healed.

677
01:06:25,122 --> 01:06:30,580
But the heretic tears, disrupts, corrupts, and wrinkles the garment of the Lord, the Church of Christ.

678
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:36,146
For when there are divisions and contentions among you, are you not carnal and walking according to man?

679
01:06:36,146 --> 01:06:37,323
First Corinthians 3:3.

680
01:06:37,323 --> 01:06:39,196
And their word spreads like cancer.

681
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,267
Second Timothy 2:17.

682
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:42,621
This is a stain on unity, this is a wrinkle.

683
01:06:42,621 --> 01:06:47,919
Finally, where the Apostle speaks about these things, he proposes the love of Christ and affection.

684
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:51,665
Just as Christ, he says, loved the Church and gave himself up for her.

685
01:06:51,665 --> 01:06:52,468
Ephesians 5:25.

686
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:55,786
To remove the heretics, because they did not know how to love.

687
01:06:55,786 --> 01:06:58,087
But why is this for the miserable penitent?

688
01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:00,388
Because he desires to love and to be loved.

689
01:07:00,388 --> 01:07:03,224
Come, say the rest:
The Church is the body of Christ.

690
01:07:03,224 --> 01:07:11,465
Certainly a body, not just a member: a body collected into one with many parts and members, as the Apostle says:
For the body is not one member, but many.

691
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,750
First Corinthians 12:14.

692
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:18,743
Therefore, the Church is a complete body, both unified and solid, and already spread throughout the whole world.

693
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:26,610
Like a city, I say, whose parts are united; not like you Novatians, a certain insolent fragment and outgrowth, separated from the rest of the body.

694
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:39,025
The Church is the temple of God: certainly a spacious temple, a great house, having indeed golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, some for honor, many indeed magnificent, destined for various uses in multiple works.

695
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:40,095
Second Timothy 2:20.

696
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:44,270
The Church is a holy virgin, with the most chaste senses, the bride of Christ.

697
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,303
Virgin; it is true: but also a mother.

698
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,992
Bride; it is evident: but also a wife and spouse taken from her husband: therefore bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh.

699
01:07:52,992 --> 01:07:53,688
Genesis 2:23.

700
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:03,986
For David spoke about this: "Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like young olive trees around your table." (Psalm 127:3).

701
01:08:03,986 --> 01:08:11,498
Thus, this virgin has many children and countless offspring, filling the whole world, always buzzing like a beehive with a large population.

702
01:08:11,498 --> 01:08:23,624
This mother has great care and tender affection for her children: the good are honored, the proud are punished, the sick are treated; no one is lost, no one is despised; secure offspring are kept under the mother’s indulgence.

703
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:25,717
The Church is without stain or wrinkle.

704
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:26,629
(Ephesians 5:27).

705
01:08:26,629 --> 01:08:30,761
That is, it has no heresies, no Valentinians, no Cataphrygians, no Novatians.

706
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:36,019
For among them are certain stained and wrinkled parts, envying the ornaments of precious garments.

707
01:08:36,019 --> 01:08:43,370
However, a sinner and a penitent are not a stain on the Church; because as long as he sins and does not repent, he is outside the Church.

708
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,731
When he stops sinning, he is already healed.

709
01:08:45,731 --> 01:08:51,204
But the heretic tears, intercepts, spoils, and wrinkles the garment of the Lord, the Church of Christ.

710
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:56,730
For when there are divisions and disputes among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans?

711
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,018
(First Corinthians 3:3).

712
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:00,003
And their talk spreads like gangrene.

713
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,184
(Second Timothy 2:17).

714
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:03,759
This is the stain of unity, this is the wrinkle.

715
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:09,071
Finally, when the Apostle speaks about these things, he speaks of the love of Christ and affection.

716
01:09:09,071 --> 01:09:12,290
Just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her.

717
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,203
(Ephesians 5:25).

718
01:09:13,203 --> 01:09:16,529
To remove the heretics, because they did not know how to love.

719
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:19,480
But why mention these things to the miserable penitent?

720
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,841
Because he also wishes to love and be loved.

721
01:09:21,841 --> 01:09:24,739
The Church is whole, guarding the laws of the Gospels.

722
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:27,851
Whole indeed because it is entire, because it is complete.

723
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:43,518
Where rewards are given to the faithful, where tears are not denied to the miserable, where the sick are treated, where insolent health and proud justice claim nothing for themselves, where caring charity perseveres in all things, believing everything, hoping everything, enduring everything.

724
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:44,860
(First Corinthians 13:7).

725
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:52,586
Hence that saying of the Apostle: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?" (Second Corinthians 11:29).

726
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:59,176
Where the entire brotherhood bears its burdens together, grieving together, secure in mutual devotion.

727
01:09:59,176 --> 01:10:05,248
All supporting one another in love, making every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

728
01:10:05,248 --> 01:10:12,400
(Ephesians 4:3)
This will be the Church, my brother Sympronian; this will be the people reborn in Christ through water and the Holy Spirit.

729
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:31,181
You say, "I do not know if a sin can be forgiven by bishops," since the Lord said, "Whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven." (Matthew 10:33)
Why then did your Novatian, not even a legitimate bishop at that time, long before Cornelius became bishop of Rome, long before he envied Cornelius' priesthood, propose these things?

730
01:10:31,181 --> 01:10:34,834
You have the testimony of Cyprian; Cyprian whom you could never defame.

731
01:10:34,834 --> 01:11:48,414
For in one place, he wrote to Antonianus in this manner:
"It was also added while Novatian was writing then; and what he wrote, he read aloud with his own voice; and Moses, who was then a confessor and now already a martyr, signed it; that peace should be given to those who had lapsed, who were weak and at the point of death: these letters were sent throughout the whole world and brought to the attention of all churches."
What do you say, my brother Sympronian? Novatian wrote these things, and to add the service of pure will, he also read them aloud. His right hand is a witness, the hand that wrote, is a witness: the tongue that read is a witness. Cornelius, for whom all this envy of yours erupted, was not yet a bishop. Much later, with many fellow bishops, with many confessors, and immediately with martyrs, as the same Cyprian writes, he agreed with the advice of the elders that it was permissible to grant peace.
If the door to repentance is to be closed, Novatian is guilty, who wrote, proposed, and read these things. Where then was the impatient rigor? Where was that fierce judgment? If no one had preferred Cornelius to you, the authority of the writer would remain. Now the whole opinion is displeasing, now weapons are thrown at us, supplied by the very authority by which the cause of the weapons prevailed.
The Church is, keeping the full rights of the Gospels. Whole indeed because complete, because full.

732
01:11:48,671 --> 01:12:04,031
Where the reward is given to the faithful, where tears are not denied to the miserable, where the sick are healed, where insolent health and proud justice claim nothing for themselves, where caring love perseveres in all things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things.

733
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,249
First Corinthians 13:7.

734
01:12:05,249 --> 01:12:08,532
Hence the Apostle's statement: Who is weak, and I am not weak?

735
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,386
Who is offended, and I do not burn?

736
01:12:10,386 --> 01:12:11,710
Second Corinthians 11:29.

737
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:15,894
Where the whole brotherhood bears its burdens together, sharing in mutual care.

738
01:12:15,894 --> 01:12:21,243
All supporting each other in love, striving to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

739
01:12:21,243 --> 01:12:21,985
Ephesians 4:3.

740
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:28,340
This will be the Church, brother Sympronian; this will be the people reborn in Christ through water and the Holy Spirit.

741
01:12:28,340 --> 01:13:43,971
You say, "I don't know if a sin can be forgiven by bishops," since the Lord said: Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. Matthew 10:33.
Why then, did your Novatian, who was not even falsely a priest at that time, long before Cornelius became bishop of Rome, before he envied his priesthood, suggest these things? You have the testimony of Cyprian; Cyprian, whom you have never been able to defame. For in one place, he wrote to Antonianus in this way: It was also added by Novatian, who was writing at that time; and what he wrote, he recited with his own voice; and with Moses, then a confessor and now a martyr, subscribing; that peace should be given to the fallen and those on the verge of death.
These letters were sent throughout the whole world and made known to all the churches. What do you say, brother Sympronian? Novatian wrote these things, and to add the duty of pure will, he also recited the writings. His right hand is a witness, the hand that wrote is a witness: the tongue that read is a witness. Cornelius, for whom all this envy of yours erupted, was not yet a bishop. Much later, with many fellow bishops, with many confessors, and immediately martyrs, as Cyprian himself writes, he agreed with the council of elders that it was permissible to grant peace. If entry to repentance is to be denied, Novatian is at fault, who wrote, suggested, and read these things.

742
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,844
Where then is the impatient severity? Where is that fierce judgment?

743
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:52,339
If no one had preferred Cornelius to you, the authority of the writer would have remained.

744
01:13:52,339 --> 01:13:59,181
Now the entire opinion is displeasing, and weapons are being hurled at us by the very people whose authority once strengthened our cause.

745
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:01,129
But when did the Novatian heresy begin?

746
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:04,376
Listen, please, and understand the entire sequence of your error.

747
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:09,320
Cornelius, already made bishop of Rome by sixteen bishops, had taken the place of the vacant chair.

748
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:14,864
In that same virginal purity with which he was endowed, he endured frequent persecutions from an angry emperor.

749
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:30,897
Then, by chance, a certain priest named Novatus from Africa, who had defrauded widows in the Carthaginian church, robbed orphans, withheld church money, thrown his father out of the house, causing him to die of hunger without burial, and struck his pregnant wife's womb with a kick, causing her to miscarry, came to Rome.

750
01:14:30,897 --> 01:14:34,942
While in Carthage, as the day of his trial in the church was approaching, he hid.

751
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:49,027
Not long after, he influenced this Novatian, who was anxious about Cornelius's bishopric (for he had hoped for it himself), and with some supporters on his side, as usually happens in such matters, he encouraged him, fueled his hesitation, and urged him to hope for something great.

752
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:57,018
He found some of those who had escaped the storm of that persecution, among whom he could stir up jealousy against Cornelius for accepting those who had lapsed.

753
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:58,716
He sent their letters to Novatian.

754
01:14:58,716 --> 01:15:12,052
Based on the authority of these letters, even though there was already a bishop in Rome, he assumed the title of another bishop for himself, against the singular priesthood’s rules: he accused Cornelius of communing with the lapsed and claimed himself to be innocent.

755
01:15:12,052 --> 01:15:15,748
Against him, I must give an account, defend my modesty, and clear my life.

756
01:15:15,748 --> 01:15:17,695
But when did the Novatian heresy begin?

757
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:20,942
Listen, please, and understand the entire sequence of your error.

758
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:25,886
Cornelius, already made bishop of Rome by sixteen bishops, had taken the place of the vacant chair.

759
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:31,430
In that same virginal purity with which he was endowed, he endured frequent persecutions from an angry emperor.

760
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:49,090
Then, by chance, a certain priest named Novatus from Africa, who had defrauded widows in the church of Carthage, robbed orphans, denied the church's money, thrown his father out of the house, and caused his father to die of hunger without burial, and who had kicked his pregnant wife in the womb causing a miscarriage, came to Rome.

761
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:54,760
And when in Carthage, as the brothers in the church pressed on him, the day of his trial approached, and he hid.

762
01:15:54,760 --> 01:16:08,786
Not long after, he incited Novatian, who was anxious about the bishopric of Cornelius (for he hoped for it himself) and, as often happens in such matters, he swayed some followers to his side, encouraging and supporting the doubtful one; urging him to hope for something great.

763
01:16:08,786 --> 01:16:17,140
He found some among those who had escaped the storm of that persecution; through whom he could stir up envy against Cornelius regarding the acceptance of the lapsed.

764
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,862
He sent their letters to Novatian.

765
01:16:18,862 --> 01:16:31,823
Using the authority of these letters, while the bishop was already sitting in Rome, Novatian assumed the title of another bishop, which was contrary to the singular priesthood, accusing Cornelius of communing with the lapsed and claiming his own innocence.

766
01:16:31,823 --> 01:16:38,051
Against this man, I must give an account, against this man, I must assert my honor, against this man, I must clear my life.

767
01:16:38,051 --> 01:17:31,013
But you may say, "You bishops, why do you approve such things?" Let someone else say this: you defend Novatian. This cause may seem inexcusable to others, though it may be pleasing to you. Anyone who is innocent for you is guilty for another. Do not accuse someone else of a crime from which you cannot be freed. Come on, as bishops, we must owe all modesty, for we have received the name of the apostles, for we are marked by the title of Christ.
The Lord denies the denier, you say; you should not acknowledge the denier. Who acknowledges the denier? The one who drives him to repentance, rebukes, shows the crime, opens the wounds, reminds him of eternal punishments, corrects him by the destruction of the flesh? This is chastising, not acknowledging.
The Lord says to us, "You are the salt of the earth" Therefore, by rightly speaking these things, we do not become worthless, and anyone who hears will not be worthless. You see, we do not trample on the Lord's judgment, but we approve it; we do not reject severity, but we reveal His will.

768
01:17:31,367 --> 01:17:37,704
But to the penitent,
you will say, you forgive sins; when it is only in baptism that you are allowed to forgive sin.

769
01:17:37,704 --> 01:17:44,149
Not by me, clearly, but by God alone, who both grants pardon in baptism and does not reject the tears of the penitent.

770
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:51,086
Moreover, what I do, I do not by my own authority, but by the Lord's:
We are God’s co-workers, He says, you are God’s building.

771
01:17:51,086 --> 01:18:01,246
First Corinthians 3:9
And again: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth:
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.

772
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:08,346
First Corinthians 3:6-7
So whether we baptize, urge repentance, or grant pardon to the penitent;
we do this by Christ's authority.

773
01:18:08,346 --> 01:18:12,443
You must consider whether Christ can do this, whether Christ has done this.

774
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:15,666
But you will say, bishops, why do you approve such actions?

775
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:18,233
Let someone else say this: you defend Novatian.

776
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:22,384
This cause may seem inexcusable to others, though it may be pleasing to you.

777
01:18:22,384 --> 01:18:25,935
Let anyone be innocent for you, whoever is guilty on your behalf.

778
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:29,431
Do not accuse another of a crime from which you cannot be freed.

779
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:36,804
Come, let us bishops show all our modesty, because we have received the title of apostles, because we are marked by the name of Christ.

780
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:40,901
You say the Lord denies the denier: you, I do not want to admit the denier.

781
01:18:40,901 --> 01:18:42,267
Who confesses the denier?

782
01:18:42,267 --> 01:18:50,842
The one who urges repentance, reproaches, shows the crime, reveals the wounds, reminds of eternal punishments, corrects through the destruction of the flesh?

783
01:18:50,842 --> 01:18:52,699
This is to chastise, not to admit.

784
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:55,485
The Lord says to us: You are the salt of the earth.

785
01:18:55,485 --> 01:19:01,657
Matthew 5:13
Therefore, we rightly preserve by saying these things, and anyone who listens will not be worthless.

786
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:07,884
You see, we do not trample on the Lord's judgment, but approve it; we do not reject severity, but reveal His will.

787
01:19:07,884 --> 01:19:14,220
But to the penitent,
you will say, you forgive sins; when it is only in baptism that you are allowed to forgive sin.

788
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:20,666
Not by me, clearly, but by God alone, who both grants pardon in baptism and does not reject the tears of the penitent.

789
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:27,603
Moreover, what I do, I do not by my own authority, but by the Lord's:
We are God's co-workers, He says, you are God’s building.

790
01:19:27,603 --> 01:19:28,750
First Corinthians 3:9

791
01:19:29,951 --> 01:19:33,250
And again: I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.

792
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:38,487
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.

793
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:39,534
1 Corinthians 3:6-7.

794
01:19:39,534 --> 01:19:45,974
Therefore, whether we baptize, compel to repentance, or grant forgiveness to the repentant, we do it by Christ's authority.

795
01:19:45,974 --> 01:19:50,059
You must consider whether Christ can do this and whether Christ has done this.

796
01:19:50,059 --> 01:19:55,086
If forgiveness of sins could be given to the repentant, you say, then baptism was not necessary.

797
01:19:55,086 --> 01:19:56,866
This is a very foolish comparison!

798
01:19:56,866 --> 01:20:03,202
For baptism is the sacrament of the Lord’s passion; the forgiveness for the repentant is the merit of the one confessing.

799
01:20:03,202 --> 01:20:07,862
Everyone can obtain the former because it is a gift of God’s grace; that is, a free gift.

800
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:16,397
But this labor is for the few who rise again after a fall, who recover after wounds, who are aided by tearful cries, who revive after the destruction of the flesh.

801
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:22,262
You claim that I have wrongly cited the example where God says: I prefer a sinner's repentance over their death.

802
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:22,995
Ezekiel 33:11.

803
01:20:22,995 --> 01:20:29,854
What if I had added the passage from Isaiah: When you turn and groan, then you will be saved and you will know where you have been?

804
01:20:29,854 --> 01:20:32,054
Isaiah 30:15, according to the Septuagint.

805
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:38,389
What if I had quoted from Revelation: Remember where you have fallen from, and repent, and do the works you did at first?

806
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:39,175
Revelation 2:5.

807
01:20:39,175 --> 01:20:42,474
You might say these were spoken to the Gentiles before baptism.

808
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:47,710
Listen to the Apostle: We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law.

809
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:48,338
Romans 3:19.

810
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:52,946
Therefore, those who lived without the law are not bound by the condition of repentance.

811
01:20:52,946 --> 01:20:58,444
Even if they had repented, they did so freely by faith, not by the bond of repentance imposed by the law.

812
01:20:58,444 --> 01:21:02,895
So then, you might say, Jews who repented before baptism cannot repent after baptism.

813
01:21:02,895 --> 01:21:04,990
Who taught you this, brother Sympronian?

814
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:08,917
Who suggested that one who has repented before should not repent afterward?

815
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:10,540
But we will discuss this later.

816
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:20,856
Meanwhile, if repentance was denied to Jews after baptism because they fulfilled it before, at least grant that the Gentiles, who did not know the law of repentance before, should repent afterward.

817
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:24,102
But even regarding the Jews, I do not want you to be mistaken.

818
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:32,310
They repented earlier because they had corrupted the old baptism and were repenting as if they had betrayed their faith after believing.

819
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:52,145
Listen to the Apostle: "For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ" (First Corinthians 10:1-4).

820
01:21:52,145 --> 01:21:55,165
They had violated this baptism, and therefore they repented.

821
01:21:55,165 --> 01:21:59,998
If the remission of sins could be given to those who repent, you say, baptism was not necessary.

822
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,307
What a foolish comparison!

823
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:06,895
Baptism is the sacrament of the Lord's passion; the pardon of the repentant is the merit of the one confessing.

824
01:22:06,895 --> 01:22:11,426
Everyone can achieve the former because it is a gift of God's grace; that is, a free gift.

825
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:20,034
But the latter is the labor of a few who rise after a fall, who recover after wounds, who are aided by tearful prayers, who come back to life after the death of the flesh.

826
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:26,377
You falsely claim that I used that example of what God said: "I prefer the repentance of the sinner to death" (Ezekiel 33:11).

827
01:22:26,377 --> 01:22:34,935
What if I had added that from Isaiah: "When you turn and groan, then you will be saved and you will know where you have been" (Isaiah 30:15, according to the Septuagint)?

828
01:22:34,935 --> 01:22:42,185
What if I had added that from Revelation: "Remember from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the works you did at first" (Revelation 2:5)?

829
01:22:42,185 --> 01:22:45,658
You might say these things were spoken to the nations before baptism.

830
01:22:45,658 --> 01:22:51,498
Listen to the Apostle: "We know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law" (Romans 3:19).

831
01:22:51,498 --> 01:22:55,978
Therefore, the condition of repentance will not hold for those who lived without the law.

832
01:22:55,978 --> 01:23:01,113
Even if they had repented, they did so freely, not under the compulsion of a law requiring repentance.

833
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:05,090
So, you say, even Jews who repented before baptism cannot repent after baptism.

834
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:07,154
Who taught you this, brother Symproniane?

835
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:10,930
Who persuaded you that one who repented before should not repent afterward?

836
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,893
But we will consider this matter later.

837
01:23:13,799 --> 01:23:24,534
Meanwhile, if repentance is denied to the Jews after baptism because they have already made up their minds, then at least allow the Gentiles, who were unaware of the law of repentance before, to repent afterward.

838
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,622
But even regarding the Jews, I don't want you to be mistaken.

839
01:23:27,622 --> 01:23:33,800
They repented earlier because they had corrupted the old baptism, as though they were repenting after betraying the faith.

840
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:53,547
Listen to the Apostle: "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ" (First Corinthians 10:1-4).

841
01:23:53,547 --> 01:23:56,281
They had violated this baptism and therefore repented.

842
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:01,800
Let's then see what you say: If God often commands a person to repent, you say, He often permits them to sin.

843
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,813
What are you saying?

844
01:24:02,813 --> 01:24:06,408
Does the one who frequently shows the remedy for sin also show the sin?

845
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:10,053
Does the doctor, when he continuously treats, teach to wound repeatedly?

846
01:24:10,053 --> 01:24:13,901
God does not want a person to sin even once, and yet He frees them from sin.

847
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:24,028
And certainly, when He frees, He does not teach sin; just as the one who frees from fire does not show the fire, nor does the one who rescues a shipwrecked person from rocks drive them onto the rocks.

848
01:24:24,028 --> 01:24:27,724
It's one thing to be freed from danger, another to be driven into danger.

849
01:24:27,724 --> 01:24:38,408
And perhaps I would allow this to be believed if repentance were considered a luxury; because such great labor is imposed, with the destruction of the flesh commanded, with constant tears, with eternal groaning.

850
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:42,054
Will the healed person then want to cut themselves again, to burn again?

851
01:24:42,054 --> 01:24:48,737
Will they want to sin again and repent again, when it is written: "Do not add sin, lest something worse happens to you" (John 5:14)?

852
01:24:48,737 --> 01:24:52,585
And again: "I do not pity those who continuously sin" (Ecclesiasticus 12:3).

853
01:24:52,585 --> 01:25:06,965
But if, as you say, they are driven to sin, to whom the medicine of repentance is shown; what then will the person do to whom repentance itself is denied; to whom, with the remedy despaired of, the whole wound is covered; to whom, completely and altogether, the way of life is denied?

854
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:16,375
In baptism, you might say, we die once, as the Apostle says:
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

855
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:24,709
Therefore, we were buried with him by baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too might walk in newness of life
Romans
6:3-4.

856
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:25,930
Why is this surprising?

857
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,487
The Apostle taught that we should be new, so that no one would sin.

858
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:32,035
However, if someone did sin, they should repent.

859
01:25:32,035 --> 01:25:38,458
The whole person would live, the cured would live: the innocent would receive a crown, the penitent would receive pardon.

860
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:41,855
The former would get a reward, the latter would receive healing.

861
01:25:41,855 --> 01:25:52,047
Finally, the same Apostle says:
For if while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, much more now that we are justified by his blood, shall we be saved by him from the wrath
Romans
5:9-10.

862
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:54,755
From the wrath, of course, that was due to sinners.

863
01:25:54,755 --> 01:25:59,957
If he did not allow the Gentile people to die, much more will he not allow the redeemed to perish.

864
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:02,770
Nor will he reject those he redeemed at a great cost.

865
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:05,849
For the loss of his servants is not a light matter to him.

866
01:26:05,849 --> 01:26:09,140
He who rises will no longer die, as it is written
Romans
14:4.

867
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:17,156
But he is the advocate with the Father; he intercedes for our sins, a not insignificant advocate for the miserable, not a poorly qualified intercessor.

868
01:26:17,156 --> 01:26:22,623
Let us then see what you say:
If God often commands man to repent, you say, he often allows him to sin.

869
01:26:22,623 --> 01:26:23,526
What do you mean?

870
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:27,560
Therefore, does the one who often shows the remedy for crime show the crime?

871
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:31,117
And does the doctor, when he constantly heals, teach to be wounded?

872
01:26:31,117 --> 01:26:34,833
God does not want man to sin even once, and yet he frees him from sin.

873
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:45,237
And of course, when he frees, he does not teach sin; just as one who frees from a fire does not show the fire; nor does one who rescues a shipwrecked person on the rocks drive them onto the rocks.

874
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:49,165
It is one thing to be freed from danger, another to be driven into danger.

875
01:26:49,165 --> 01:26:59,835
And perhaps I would allow this to be believed if penance were thought to be a delight; whose labor is so great, whose destruction of the flesh is commanded, whose continual tears, whose eternal groans.

876
01:26:59,835 --> 01:27:03,392
So will the healed person want to be cut again, to be burned again?

877
01:27:04,559 --> 01:28:58,535
Will he choose to sin again and repent again, when it is written:
"Do not add sin, lest something worse happens to you"
John 5:14
?
And also:
"I do not pity the one who sins constantly"
Ecclesiasticus 12:3
.
But if, as you say, he is compelled to sin, to whom is the medicine of repentance shown?
What then will he do, who is denied repentance itself;
to whom the remedy is desperate, the whole wound is covered;
to whom, entirely and completely, the way of life is denied?
You will say, in baptism, we die once, as the Apostle says:
"Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead,
we too might walk in newness of life"
Romans 6:3-4
.
Why is this surprising?
The Apostle taught that we should be new, so that no one would sin:
but it followed that whoever had sinned, should repent.
Here the whole one, there the healed one would live:
the innocent would receive the crown,
the penitent would receive forgiveness:
the former would receive a reward, the latter a remedy.
Finally, the same Apostle says:
"For if while we were still sinners, Christ died for us;
much more now, being justified by his blood, will we be saved by him from wrath"
Romans 5:9-10
.
From the wrath, of course, that was owed to sinners.
But if he did not allow the Gentile people to die, much more will he not allow the redeemed to perish.
Nor will he reject those he redeemed at great cost;
for the loss of his servants is not small to him.
Indeed, he who rises will no longer die, as it is written
Romans 14:4.
But he is the advocate with the Father; he intercedes for our sins,
a patron not to be scorned of the wretched, a very capable intercessor.
Answer, brother, can the devil oppress the servants of God,
or can Christ not absolve them?
You say Peter’s repentance was before the Lord's passion?
No one proposed this to you.
And yet Peter had already been baptized:
for the Lord had said to him:
"He who is washed once, does not need to be washed again"
John 13:10
.

878
01:28:58,535 --> 01:29:05,594
However, he later received the remedy of Christ, but he repented beforehand; and he was considered holy before he received the remedy.

879
01:29:05,594 --> 01:29:10,440
His repentance would not have been recorded if it hadn't benefited the penitent in some way.

880
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,125
He wept, it says, very bitterly.

881
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:15,286
Matthew 26:75
Don't you want to be as faithful as Peter was?

882
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:17,920
Don't you want what benefited Peter to benefit us?

883
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,134
Come now, didn't my Thomas doubt the resurrection after the Lord's resurrection?

884
01:29:22,134 --> 01:29:31,720
Didn't the Lord accuse him of faithlessness when he showed him the marks of the nails, the pierced hands, the wound in the side, and said to him: Don't be unbelieving, but believing?

885
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,984
John 20:27
So what then?

886
01:29:32,984 --> 01:29:34,301
Was he ashamed to repent?

887
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:35,249
Wasn't he humbled?

888
01:29:35,249 --> 01:29:37,725
Didn't he immediately confess his God and Lord?

889
01:29:37,725 --> 01:29:39,621
Doesn't this confession commend him?

890
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:44,151
Answer, brother, can the devil oppress God's servants, or can Christ not absolve them?

891
01:29:44,151 --> 01:29:47,154
You say Peter's repentance was before the Lord's passion?

892
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:48,629
No one proposed this to you.

893
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:55,055
And yet Peter had already been baptized: for the Lord had said to him: He who has bathed once does not need to wash again.

894
01:29:55,055 --> 01:30:02,693
John 13:10
However, he later received the remedy of Christ, but he repented beforehand; and he was considered holy before he received the remedy.

895
01:30:02,693 --> 01:30:07,539
His repentance would not have been recorded if it hadn't benefited the penitent in some way.

896
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:09,224
He wept, it says, very bitterly.

897
01:30:09,224 --> 01:30:12,385
Matthew 26:75
Don't you want to be as faithful as Peter was?

898
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:15,019
Don't you want what benefited Peter to benefit us?

899
01:30:15,019 --> 01:30:19,232
Come now, didn't my Thomas doubt the resurrection after the Lord's resurrection?

900
01:30:19,232 --> 01:30:28,819
Didn't the Lord accuse him of faithlessness when he showed him the marks of the nails, the pierced hands, the wound in the side, and said to him: Don't be unbelieving, but believing?

901
01:30:28,819 --> 01:30:30,083
John 20:27
So what then?

902
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,400
Was he ashamed to repent?

903
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,348
Wasn't he humbled?

904
01:30:32,348 --> 01:30:34,824
Didn't he immediately confess his God and Lord?

905
01:30:34,824 --> 01:30:36,720
Doesn't this confession commend him?

906
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:43,621
Now, how cleverly you absolve that point I made; the power given to bishops, that what they bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.

907
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:52,609
You say this does not pertain to the faithful, but to the catechumens; so that sins could be forgiven or retained for those who are still to be baptized.

908
01:30:52,609 --> 01:30:59,534
You combine the chapters of two Evangelists, making them seem as one; and you add that what Matthew recorded less completely, John fulfilled.

909
01:30:59,534 --> 01:31:15,200
The Lord said in Matthew:
"Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"
(Matthew 28:19) ;
and in John, he fulfilled it by saying:
"If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
(John 20:23) .

910
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:26,200
So, this forgiving or retaining seems to pertain to the nations that were to be baptized, because the first Evangelist spoke about the nations beforehand, and the latter fulfilled it by talking about forgiving and retaining.

911
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,182
What are you saying?

912
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:31,258
Did the two Evangelists report incomplete and half-finished meanings to each other?

913
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:38,969
Were they lacking words or reasoning; or did the Holy Spirit not fully complete everything, carrying the intended meanings and defining the words completely?

914
01:31:38,969 --> 01:31:43,536
No one overrides a confirmed testament of a man; will a different tablet change God's tablet?

915
01:31:43,536 --> 01:31:46,531
What is this desire to win in you that you dare such a thing?

916
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:56,304
What about the fact that the Lord said in Matthew before his passion:
"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
(Matthew 16:19) .

917
01:31:56,304 --> 01:31:59,889
The Lord predicted this in Matthew and did not mention any nations there.

918
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:04,456
Why then do you join John's chapter where he placed his own and separate it from the nations?

919
01:32:04,456 --> 01:32:09,564
Because if he had wanted it to pertain to the nations, he could have joined what he himself was placing.

920
01:32:09,564 --> 01:32:12,068
Therefore, you have everything you seek in Matthew.

921
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,917
Why did you not read everything, you who teach the bishop?

922
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:16,783
Repeat the first part of this command.

923
01:32:17,519 --> 01:32:22,167
According to Matthew, just before this, the Lord spoke to Peter to establish unity from one.

924
01:32:22,167 --> 01:34:00,479
Immediately after, He gave the same command to all, beginning with Peter:
"And I say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Matthew eighteen nineteen.
Tell me, brother, did He say this only to the Gentiles: "On this rock, I will build my Church"? Does He call the Church unbaptized nations? Is a man not yet reborn the body of Christ? What do I loose for the Gentiles if it is not bound? For if it is not accounted, it is not bound. What do I bind that I do not constrain by any law? A Gentile man is free from the Law.
See now, on the contrary, whether both apply to the baptized. Forgiveness is granted because he was held by sin; he is bound by anathema because he was released by faith and freed by grace. Even if I concede that this power to bind and loose was given to the Gentiles, I will prove much more that it pertains to the baptized. For if he who had no bond could be loosed or bound, how much more he who was held by the laws of faith?
Now, how cleverly you resolve that point which I raised about the power given to bishops, that what they bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. You say this pertains not to the faithful, but to catechumens, so that the sins of those about to be baptized might be loosed or held. You even combine the chapters of two Evangelists to make them appear as one, and you add that what Matthew less fully pursued, John completed:
for where Matthew wrote, "Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,"
Matthew twenty-eight nineteen; John fulfilled it by saying: "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."
John twenty twenty-three.

925
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:10,783
So, this binding or loosing seems to pertain to the nations that were to be baptized, because the first Evangelist spoke about the nations beforehand, while the latter fulfilled it regarding loosing and binding.

926
01:34:10,783 --> 01:34:11,661
What do you think?

927
01:34:11,661 --> 01:34:15,470
Did the two Evangelists present incomplete or half-formed ideas to each other?

928
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:17,423
Were they lacking in words or reasoning?

929
01:34:17,423 --> 01:34:23,283
Or was the Holy Spirit not fully present in all things, carrying out the proposed meanings and fully defining the words?

930
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:27,873
No one overrides a confirmed human testament; so, will a different tablet change God's tablet?

931
01:34:27,873 --> 01:34:31,242
Why do you have this desire to win, that you dare to say such things?

932
01:34:31,242 --> 01:34:40,617
Consider that the Lord said to Matthew himself before His passion: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (Matthew 16:19).

933
01:34:40,617 --> 01:34:48,528
The Lord predicted this to Matthew without mentioning the nations: so why do you attach John's chapter to where He placed His own, separating it from the nations?

934
01:34:48,528 --> 01:34:52,923
If He wanted it to pertain to the nations, He could have connected what He placed Himself.

935
01:34:52,923 --> 01:34:55,413
Therefore, you have everything you need in Matthew.

936
01:34:55,413 --> 01:34:58,196
Why didn't you read everything, you who teach the bishop?

937
01:34:58,196 --> 01:35:00,247
Repeat the first part of this commandment.

938
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:15,042
As Matthew himself reports, the Lord spoke to Peter a little earlier; to one, to establish unity from one; soon after, giving the same command in common, but starting with Peter: And I say to you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.

939
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:24,173
And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven: and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven (Matthew 18:18-19).

940
01:35:24,173 --> 01:35:29,252
Tell me, brother; did He speak only about the nations when He said: On this rock I will build my Church?

941
01:35:29,252 --> 01:35:31,547
Does He call the Church the unbaptized nations?

942
01:35:31,547 --> 01:35:33,646
Is a man not yet reborn the body of Christ?

943
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:36,088
What do I loose for the nations that is not bound?

944
01:35:36,088 --> 01:35:38,432
If it is not considered, it is not bound either.

945
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,783
Why should I bind what I have no right to bind?

946
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:44,001
A Gentile, a non-Jew, is free from the Law.

947
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:47,456
Now consider the opposite case: does it apply to a baptized person?

948
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:54,109
Forgiveness is granted because he was bound by sin; he is bound by anathema because he was freed by faith and liberated by grace.

949
01:35:54,109 --> 01:35:59,988
If I admit that the power to release or bind applies to Gentiles, then it is even more applicable to the baptized.

950
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:05,506
For if someone without a bond could be released or bound, how much more for one bound by the laws of faith?

951
01:36:05,506 --> 01:37:04,295
You say that Matthew wrote: Matthew wrote: "If your brother sins against you, go and correct him privately" (Matthew 18:15); and immediately added the Lord's words: "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven." So, it seems to pertain to the offense of a brother. But don't you see what he says above: "If your brother sins against you"; and here he adds: "Amen, I say to you. Whatever you bind on earth, etc." He commanded this to one person but gave permission to many: the former is released by the one against whom the offense is committed; the latter, by the Church: the former, without a priest or brothers; the latter, obtained by all. "Whatever you bind," he says; absolutely nothing is excluded. "Whatever," he says: whether great or small. Pay attention to what he says to Peter below: that what is sinned against a man should be forgiven seventy-seven times; to show that other offenses can be forgiven even once. However, whoever sins against Peter offends the Lord: as He himself indicated to Samuel: "They have not rejected you, but me" (First Samuel 8:7).

952
01:37:04,295 --> 01:37:08,679
Therefore, it is granted to the Church even once, what is commanded of us many times.

953
01:37:08,679 --> 01:37:32,659
You say that Matthew wrote: "If your brother sins against you, go and correct him privately" (Matthew 18:15); and immediately added the Lord's words: "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven." So, it seems to pertain to the offense of a brother. But don't you see what he says above: "If your brother sins against you"; and here he adds: "Amen, I say to you. Whatever you bind on earth, etc."

954
01:37:33,071 --> 01:37:45,967
He commanded one thing to a single person but permitted this to many: the former He Himself forgives for the one who sins against Him; but this, the Church does: the former, without a priest and without brothers; the latter is obtained by all.

955
01:37:45,967 --> 01:39:33,906
"Whatever you forgive," He says; He makes no exception at all. "Whatever," He says: whether big or small. Observe what He says to Peter below, that what is sinned against a man must be forgiven seventy times seven; to show that otherwise, it could perhaps be forgiven even once. However, whoever sins against Peter offends the Lord, as He Himself makes clear to Samuel: "They have not rejected you, but me" First Samuel 8:7. Therefore, it is granted to the Church even once, what is commanded to us so many times.
Now let's return to the wandering sheep, the lost coin, and the younger son, which I briefly mentioned in my previous writing, and you have repeated in full, teaching and showing that the coin, the sheep, and the younger son relate to tax collectors and sinners; that is, to the humble people, not to the image of the Christian congregation, nor to the form of the faithful. I am glad to be taught, but I regret that it is not understood. For what should I assert? Whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law Romans 3:19; indeed, I agree that this was also said primarily to the former, but in the form of the faithful, but in the image of the future, as the Apostle says: "These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come" First Corinthians 10:11. And again: "These were a shadow of the good things to come" Hebrews 10:1. Certainly, you agree, to tax collectors and sinners, that is, to the humble people, and therefore younger, those were dictated. So tell me: is the Christian people themselves younger? Have they adhered to the root? Have they joined those members? Built, as it is written, on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone Ephesians 2:20. Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Indeed, He is also the God of the Gentiles. Since there is one God, who justifies the ungodly by faith and through faith Romans 3:29, 30.

956
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:40,261
Certainly, the humble people, whom God compared to a coin, the younger son, and the little sheep, represent the Church.

957
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:43,755
From this Church came all believers, forming the Christian people.

958
01:39:43,755 --> 01:39:52,916
We are also members of this body, grafted into the good olive tree from the wild olive tree of the Gentiles, as the Apostle says: "Partakers of its richness" (Romans 11:17).

959
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:57,258
Thus, we all become one in Christ, Jew and Greek, slave and free (Galatians 3:28).

960
01:39:57,258 --> 01:40:02,606
So, if we are one body with the humble, the words spoken to the humble of old were also spoken to us.

961
01:40:02,606 --> 01:40:07,212
Therefore, whatever was preached to a part of the body was announced to the whole body.

962
01:40:07,212 --> 01:40:20,397
Now let's return to the wandering sheep, the coin, and the younger son: examples I briefly touched upon earlier, and you elaborated on, teaching that the coin, sheep, and younger son pertain to tax collectors and sinners; that is, the humble people.

963
01:40:20,397 --> 01:40:24,474
Not to the image of the Christian community, nor to the form of the faithful.

964
01:40:24,474 --> 01:40:28,181
I am glad to be taught; but I am displeased that it is not understood.

965
01:40:28,181 --> 01:40:29,240
What shall I assert?

966
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,946
Whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law (Romans 3:19).

967
01:40:32,946 --> 01:40:49,361
Certainly, I agree this is primarily addressed to the former ones, but in the form of the faithful, and in the image of the future, as the Apostle says: "These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come" (First Corinthians 10:11).

968
01:40:49,361 --> 01:40:53,279
And again: "These are a shadow of the good things to come" (Hebrews 10:1).

969
01:40:53,279 --> 01:41:00,639
Certainly, you agree that these things were said to tax collectors and sinners, that is, the humble people, and therefore the younger ones.

970
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:03,763
So tell me: is the Christian people itself the younger one?

971
01:41:03,763 --> 01:41:05,722
Have they been grafted into the root?

972
01:41:05,722 --> 01:41:07,364
Have they joined those members?

973
01:41:07,364 --> 01:41:14,512
Built, as it is written, on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20).

974
01:41:14,512 --> 01:41:16,153
Is He the God of the Jews only?

975
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:18,218
Is He not also the God of the Gentiles?

976
01:41:18,218 --> 01:41:19,595
Yes, also of the Gentiles.

977
01:41:19,595 --> 01:41:24,520
Since there is one God who justifies the ungodly by faith and through faith (Romans 3:29-30).

978
01:41:25,631 --> 01:41:30,967
Surely that humble people, whom God compared to a coin, the younger son, and a little sheep, was the Church.

979
01:41:30,967 --> 01:41:35,166
From this came the whole crowd of believers, from which the Christian people emerged.

980
01:41:35,166 --> 01:43:19,005
Our members are also joined to this body, all portions of believers, so that they might be grafted into the good olive tree from the wild olive tree of the nations, as the Apostle says: "Partakers of its richness" in the book of Romans chapter eleven, verse seventeen. And so, we all might be one in Christ, Jew and Greek, slave and free, as stated in Galatians chapter three, verse twenty-eight. Therefore, if we are one body with those humble ones, the words spoken to the humble of old are also spoken to us. Thus, whatever was preached about a part of the body was announced to the whole body.
Let me be clearer. That later people, that poor, that average, was an image of the Church, a humble and modest soul, a soul freed by Christ. The Lord came to save this, did not leave it in hell: this is the sheep carried back on the shoulders, that is, by the effort and strength of patience. This is the coin that is sought and shown to the neighbors when found. Do you see how its form matches the likeness of the repentant? Do you see mercy extending to this time? Do you see that whatever was said to the nascent Church pertains to the fullness of the Church? Hence, the Lord added there: "There will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need repentance" as found in Luke chapter fifteen, verse seven. For if all those things were written to remind us, to whom then will that humble sinner people be compared, if not to the repentant people? And if the figures recur in order, the ninety-nine healthy represent the whole Church. The one wandering is the portion of the delinquent, and the lost coin is that miserable sinner. Returning after his wrongs, he is considered similar to the redeemed one. Now you see rightly placed by me, when I was dealing with the cure of the repentant, that the Lord said: "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick" in Matthew chapter nine, verse twelve. Rightly also: "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" as stated in Matthew chapter five, verse five.

981
01:43:19,103 --> 01:43:24,401
Whatever has been said about tax collectors and sinners will apply to all the sick and all the wretched.

982
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:31,888
Let me speak more clearly: that latter group of people, the poor, the average, represents the Church, a humble and modest soul liberated by Christ.

983
01:43:31,888 --> 01:43:40,395
The Lord came to save this soul and did not leave it in hell: this is the sheep that is brought back on the shoulders, that is, by the effort and strength of patience.

984
01:43:40,395 --> 01:43:44,215
This is the coin that is sought and, once found, is shown to the neighbors.

985
01:43:44,215 --> 01:43:47,016
Do you see how its form matches the image of penitents?

986
01:43:47,016 --> 01:43:49,308
Do you see how mercy extends up to this time?

987
01:43:49,308 --> 01:43:54,096
Do you see that whatever was said to the nascent Church applies to the fullness of the Church?

988
01:43:54,096 --> 01:44:02,602
Hence, the Lord added: So there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need repentance (Luke 15:7).

989
01:44:02,602 --> 01:44:09,173
If all those things were written to remind us, to whom will that humble sinful people be compared, if not to the penitent people?

990
01:44:09,173 --> 01:44:22,977
And if in recurring figures, the ninety-nine healthy ones represent the whole Church; the one wandering represents the portion of the delinquent; and the lost coin is the miserable sinner: the returning son after his wrongdoings is considered similar to the redeemed one.

991
01:44:22,977 --> 01:44:31,585
Now you see correctly, as I laid it out, when dealing with the healing of penitents, the Lord said: It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick (Matthew 9:12).

992
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:35,965
And rightly so: Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted (Matthew 5:5).

993
01:44:35,965 --> 01:44:41,263
Whatever has been said about tax collectors and sinners will apply to all the sick and all the wretched.

994
01:44:41,263 --> 01:44:45,032
You say it is written only about the martyrs: Blessed are those who mourn.

995
01:44:45,032 --> 01:44:47,630
So, does no one else besides them mourn their sins?

996
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:51,348
Doesn't David cry out: Every night I flood my bed with tears (Psalm 6:7)?

997
01:44:51,348 --> 01:44:55,626
And again: For I eat ashes like bread and mingle my drink with tears (Psalm 102:10).

998
01:44:55,626 --> 01:44:59,599
Doesn't Jacob say: The years of my life have been few and hard (Genesis 47:9)?

999
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:04,693
Doesn't the Apostle say to Timothy: Longing to see you, remembering your tears (Second Timothy 1:4)?

1000
01:45:04,693 --> 01:45:06,730
And yet he was not speaking of a martyr.

1001
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:07,189
What now?

1002
01:45:08,207 --> 01:45:10,833
Are miserable penitents supposed to have dry eyes?

1003
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:13,720
And do those who regret their sins not know how to cry?

1004
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:17,238
We who partake in communion and are faithful, do we not have tears?

1005
01:45:17,238 --> 01:45:20,440
Does it please any of us to rejoice while the world rejoices?

1006
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:25,375
You Novatians are already satisfied, you have become rich, you have begun to reign without us.

1007
01:45:25,375 --> 01:45:27,318
First Corinthians chapter 4, verse 8.

1008
01:45:27,318 --> 01:45:30,363
Thus, not everyone who is miserable begins to be pitiable.

1009
01:45:30,363 --> 01:47:14,104
After this, you propose and say it is written by the Lord: "Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people; but whoever sins against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the future."
Matthew chapter 12, verses 31 to 32.
Either I am mistaken, or this example works against you. For if every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, you see that forgiveness is not denied to the penitent. Therefore every sin, therefore even blasphemy itself.
You have what is added according to Luke: "And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven."
Luke chapter 12, verse 10.
What more can be said about the mercy of God, about the clemency of the judge? Is your eye envious because the head of the household is good?
Matthew chapter 20, verse 15.
Is it not lawful for him to do what he wants? Indeed, who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master, he stands or falls; and he will stand, for God is able to make him stand.
Romans chapter 14, verse 4.
But you say, whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Matthew chapter 12, verse 32.
You are accustomed to reading the whole passages; why did you not read here what it means, "In the Spirit"? You have it written above, when the Lord was casting out demons by His word, and performing many miracles with special power, the Pharisees said: "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons."
Matthew chapter 12, verse 24.
This means sinning against the Holy Spirit, blaspheming what was done through the Holy Spirit. In other sins, we either stumble out of error, break from fear, or are overcome by the weakness of the flesh. This blindness is not seeing what you see, and attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, and calling the glory of the Lord by which the devil himself is overcome, the power of the devil.
This, therefore, is what will not be forgiven: the rest are forgiven to good penitents, brother Symproniane.

1010
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:25,399
About the sun, you say it is written about the martyrs:
"Blessed are those who mourn."
Does that mean no one else laments their sins? Doesn't David cry out:
"I drench my bed every night" (Psalm 6:7)?

1011
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:30,341
And again:
"I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with tears" (Psalm 102:10)?

1012
01:47:30,341 --> 01:47:34,295
Doesn't Jacob say:
"The years of my life have been hard" (Genesis 47:9)?

1013
01:47:34,295 --> 01:47:39,896
Doesn't the Apostle say to Timothy:
"Longing to see you, remembering your tears" (Second Timothy 1:4)?

1014
01:47:39,896 --> 01:47:42,202
And yet, he wasn't talking about a martyr.

1015
01:47:42,202 --> 01:47:42,861
So what now?

1016
01:47:42,861 --> 01:47:44,893
Do miserable penitents have dry eyes?

1017
01:47:44,893 --> 01:47:47,968
And do those who regret their sins not know how to weep?

1018
01:47:47,968 --> 01:47:51,702
Don't we, who share in this, who are faithful, have tears ourselves?

1019
01:47:51,702 --> 01:47:55,051
Does it please any of us to rejoice while the world rejoices?

1020
01:47:55,051 --> 01:48:01,202
You Novatians, are you already satisfied, made rich, and have begun to reign without us (First Corinthians 4:8)?

1021
01:48:01,202 --> 01:48:04,441
Therefore, isn't anyone who is miserable deserving of pity?

1022
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:17,016
You then propose and say it is written by the Lord:
"Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come" (Matthew 12:31-32).

1023
01:48:17,016 --> 01:48:20,091
Either I am mistaken, or this example works against you.

1024
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:25,637
For if every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, you see that forgiveness is not denied to penitents.

1025
01:48:25,637 --> 01:48:27,944
Therefore, every sin, yes, even blasphemy.

1026
01:48:27,944 --> 01:48:34,149
According to Luke, it is added:
"And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven" (Luke 12:10).

1027
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:38,157
What more can be said about God’s mercy, about the clemency of the judge?

1028
01:48:38,157 --> 01:48:42,550
Is your eye envious because the father of the household is good (Matthew 20:15)?

1029
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:45,021
Is it not lawful for Him to do what He wants?

1030
01:48:45,021 --> 01:48:47,602
Indeed, who are you to judge another's servant?

1031
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:52,380
To his own master, he stands or falls: And God is able to make him stand (Romans 14:4).

1032
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:57,596
But you say,
"Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven" (Matthew 12:32).

1033
01:48:57,596 --> 01:49:03,033
You often go through entire readings: why didn't you read here what it means to be "in the Spirit"?

1034
01:49:04,295 --> 01:50:59,543
You mentioned earlier that when the Lord cast out demons with a word and performed many miracles with special power, the Pharisees said:
"This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the prince of demons"
Matthew 12:24.
This means they had sinned against the Holy Spirit by blaspheming the works done through the Holy Spirit.
With other sins, we either fall through error, break under fear, or are overcome by the weakness of the flesh.
This blindness is failing to see what is evident and attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, calling the glory of the Lord, by which the devil is overcome, the power of the devil.
This is what will not be forgiven; other sins are forgiven to those who truly repent, brother Symproniane.
After this, you refer to the branches and the vine.
The Lord says in John: "I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He will take away; and every branch that bears fruit, He will prune"
John 15:1-2.
Therefore, you see that fruit is required in the branches, meaning good works of repentance, as John says: "Produce fruit worthy of repentance"
Matthew 3:8.
You see that the branches are pruned, which symbolizes the losses of the flesh, the losses of joy, the losses of possessions, and the labors of life; these are the actions typical of those who repent.
You also see the farming of the Lord, who does not lose even those branches but prunes and gathers them, some clearly for the fire, others for planting and tending vineyards.
Eli the priest, you say, speaks and says: "If a man sins against another man, they will pray for him; but if a man sins against God, who will pray for him?"
First Samuel 2:25.
John likewise says: "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make a request for this"
First John 5:16.
You see, this all pertains to ongoing sins, not to those who have sinned at some time and have begun to repent before anyone prays for them.
It would take too long to repeat all the examples.
Consider all the sins for which the Lord threatens; you will see they are present sins.

1035
01:50:59,543 --> 01:51:08,670
If past righteousness doesn't benefit the righteous person at the time of their iniquity, then past iniquity won't harm the wicked person at the time of their righteousness.

1036
01:51:08,670 --> 01:51:16,109
As it is written: Let the wicked abandon their ways, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to God, and they will receive mercy.

1037
01:51:16,109 --> 01:51:23,178
(Isaiah 55:7)
If God punished past sins and established retribution for past actions, then surely He has the power to change His mind?

1038
01:51:23,178 --> 01:51:29,034
Did He not save Rahab, King Nebuchadnezzar, the Gibeonites, the Ninevites, and Zoar from predicted destruction?

1039
01:51:29,034 --> 01:51:39,004
Through the prophet Joel, He said: Return to the Lord your God with fasting, weeping, and mourning; for He is merciful, patient, and long-suffering, full of compassion, and repents of evil.

1040
01:51:39,004 --> 01:51:42,697
And who knows if He will turn and relent, and leave behind a blessing?

1041
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:54,567
(Joel 2:12-14)
Therefore, whenever you see punishment established for sinners, understand it either as punishment for those who persist in sin, or as God’s freedom to change His decision if you repent and turn to better ways.

1042
01:51:54,567 --> 01:52:02,481
After this, you propose the analogy of the branches and the vine as follows: The Lord says in John: I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.

1043
01:52:02,481 --> 01:52:08,231
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes.

1044
01:52:08,231 --> 01:52:16,408
(John 15:1)
So, you see that fruit is required from the branches, meaning good works of repentance, as John says: Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

1045
01:52:16,408 --> 01:52:27,434
(Matthew 3:8) You see that the branches are pruned, which signifies the losses of the flesh, the losses of joy, the losses of inheritance, and the labors of life; these are the proper acts of those who repent.

1046
01:52:27,434 --> 01:52:36,666
You also see the Lord’s gardening, who does not lose the branches but prunes and gathers them, some clearly for the fire, and some for replanting and tending to the vineyards.

1047
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:45,423
You say that Eli the priest speaks and says: If a person sins against another person, they will pray for him; but if a person sins against God, who will pray for him?

1048
01:52:45,423 --> 01:52:46,426
(First Samuel 2:25)

1049
01:52:47,111 --> 01:52:54,620
John also says: If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray for him, and God will grant him life.

1050
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:59,040
There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying that he should pray about that.

1051
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,892
First John 5:16.

1052
01:52:59,892 --> 01:53:07,187
You see, this pertains to ongoing sins, not to those who have sinned at some point and then begun to repent before anyone prays for them.

1053
01:53:07,187 --> 01:53:09,477
It would take too long to recount examples.

1054
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:13,950
Consider all the sins that the Lord warns about; you will see that they are present.

1055
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:22,736
If past righteousness does not benefit the righteous person in his time of iniquity, then past iniquity will not harm the wicked person in his time of righteousness.

1056
01:53:22,736 --> 01:53:23,482
Ezekiel 18:24.

1057
01:53:23,482 --> 01:53:30,990
As it is written: Let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to God, and He will have mercy on him.

1058
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:31,629
Isaiah 55:7.

1059
01:53:31,629 --> 01:53:39,084
If God even punished past sins and established penalties for past and overlooked actions, does He not have the power to change His decision?

1060
01:53:39,084 --> 01:53:45,154
Did He not save Rahab, King Nebuchadnezzar, the Gibeonites, the Ninevites, and Zoar from the foretold destruction?

1061
01:53:45,154 --> 01:53:56,124
Did not the prophet Joel convey this: Return to the Lord your God with fasting, weeping, and mourning; for He is gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in love, and relents from sending calamity.

1062
01:53:56,124 --> 01:53:59,426
Who knows, He may turn and relent and leave behind a blessing.

1063
01:53:59,426 --> 01:54:00,118
Joel 2:12-14.

1064
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:13,324
Therefore, wherever you find a punishment established for sinners, you will understand that it is either established for those who persist in sin or that it leaves God the freedom to change His decision if you repent and turn towards better things.

1065
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:18,862
You still say, it is written: If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.

1066
01:54:18,862 --> 01:54:19,554
Matthew 5:29.

1067
01:54:19,554 --> 01:54:33,985
Moses already explained what this means, as testified in Deuteronomy: If your brother, the child of your own mother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods." Deuteronomy 13:6.

1068
01:54:34,943 --> 01:54:59,846
Then he added below: "You will bring him, and your hand will be upon him to kill him."
You see, therefore, it is not said about those who repent, but about those who persist in their crime and continue to scandalize us. These people, no matter how dear they are, must be left behind; no matter how useful, they must be abandoned.
You still propose that the Apostle Paul said: "Remove the evil from among yourselves" (First Corinthians 5:13): certainly, persistent evil.

1069
01:54:59,846 --> 01:55:04,891
Otherwise, repentance is not evil, as David says: "It is good to confess to God" (Psalm 111:2).

1070
01:55:04,891 --> 01:55:09,510
Nevertheless, he who repents is not with me, nor is he united with the saints or peace.

1071
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:20,236
But the Apostle says: "If someone is called a brother and is either a fornicator, an idolater, greedy, a slanderer, a drunkard, or a robber, do not even eat with such a person" (First Corinthians 5:11).

1072
01:55:20,236 --> 01:55:55,493
You see it is not without reason that it is said, "and is," that is, someone who has not yet repented, who has not yet ceased to be wicked. And certainly, it is said equally about the greedy, drunkards, and slanderers. Answer, brother, is there no one of this kind held in your peace?
Therefore, it is from there that God cries out through Isaiah: "The wicked and the sinners shall perish together" (Isaiah 1:28); not those who repent, not those who seek works of mercy, to whom God again says through the same Isaiah: "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool" (Isaiah 1:18).

1073
01:55:55,493 --> 01:56:02,608
You still say, it is written: "If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you" (Matthew 5:29).

1074
01:56:02,608 --> 01:56:17,687
What this means, Moses foretold in Deuteronomy: "If your brother (for these are our eyes and hands), or your daughter, or the wife in your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you, saying: 'Let us go and serve other gods whom you have not known'" (Deuteronomy 13:6).

1075
01:56:17,687 --> 01:56:29,316
Then he added below: "You will bring him, and your hand will be upon him to kill him."
You see, therefore, it is not said about those who repent, but about those who persist in their crime and continue to scandalize us.

1076
01:56:29,687 --> 01:56:35,338
No matter how dear they are, they must be left behind; no matter how useful they are, they must be abandoned.

1077
01:56:35,338 --> 01:56:42,854
You still propose that the Apostle Paul said: Remove the wicked person from among you (First Corinthians 5:13), certainly the wicked who persist.

1078
01:56:42,854 --> 01:56:47,831
However, repentance is not evil, as David says: It is good to confess to the Lord (Psalm 111:2).

1079
01:56:47,831 --> 01:56:52,289
Yet, the one who repents is not with me, nor is he united with the saints or in peace.

1080
01:56:52,289 --> 01:57:03,226
But the Apostle says: If anyone who is called a brother is sexually immoral or worships idols, or is greedy, or abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler, do not even eat with such a person (First Corinthians 5:11).

1081
01:57:03,226 --> 01:57:09,032
It is not without reason that it is said, and is, who has not yet repented, who has not yet ceased to be wicked.

1082
01:57:09,032 --> 01:57:13,179
And certainly, it is also said about the greedy, the drunkards, and the abusive.

1083
01:57:13,179 --> 01:57:15,926
Answer, brother, is there no one like this among you?

1084
01:57:15,926 --> 01:57:35,210
Therefore, it is because of this that God cries out through Isaiah: The rebels and sinners will perish together (Isaiah 1:28); not those who repent, not those who perform works of mercy, to whom God again says through the same Isaiah: Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool (Isaiah 1:18).

1085
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:38,165
However, as you say, the Apostle condemned the wrongdoer.

1086
01:57:38,165 --> 01:57:43,193
For he says to the Corinthians: Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit.

1087
01:57:43,193 --> 01:57:47,651
And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.

1088
01:57:47,651 --> 01:58:01,595
When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord (First Corinthians 5:3-5).

1089
01:58:01,595 --> 01:58:12,014
Note, brother, first, that he does not condemn those with whom this man communicates; only he who committed such a deed is handed over to Satan, only he is excluded, preserving the peace of the saints.

1090
01:58:12,014 --> 01:58:14,243
Do you condemn all churches for one sinner?

1091
01:58:14,243 --> 01:58:21,086
Then you see, this very incestuous sinner is not handed over to death, but to Satan, for correction, for discipline, for repentance.

1092
01:58:21,863 --> 01:58:38,880
Finally, he says, "To the destruction of the flesh, but not of the soul, not even of the spirit: but to the destruction of the flesh alone, namely the temptations, the sufferings of the flesh, the loss of members, just as he says elsewhere about the undisciplined: 'They will suffer tribulation of the flesh' (First Corinthians 7:28).

1093
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:57,579
"
Do you want to know this? In the second letter to the Corinthians, the same Paul absolves this same wicked person. About him, he says: "For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough; so instead you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest he be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. So I urge you to reaffirm your love for him" (Second Corinthians 2:6-8).

1094
01:58:57,579 --> 01:59:09,501
Further down: "If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the presence of Christ for your sake, so that Satan might not outwit us" (Second Corinthians 2:10).

1095
01:59:09,501 --> 01:59:13,016
Do you see the Apostle's leniency, even moderating his own decisions?

1096
01:59:13,016 --> 01:59:16,175
Do you see the gentleness, so far removed from your arrogance?

1097
01:59:16,175 --> 01:59:20,913
So different from the severity of Novatian, considering the common life and salvation of all?

1098
01:59:20,913 --> 01:59:24,072
Nevertheless, as you say, the Apostle condemned the wrongdoer.

1099
01:59:24,072 --> 01:59:48,374
For in the first letter to the Corinthians, he says: "Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present. When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord" (First Corinthians 5:3-5).

1100
01:59:48,374 --> 01:59:58,666
Note, brother, first, that he does not condemn those with whom this man associates: he alone who committed this sin is handed over to Satan, he alone is excluded, with the peace of the saints preserved.

1101
01:59:58,666 --> 02:00:00,857
Do you condemn all churches for one sinner?

1102
02:00:00,857 --> 02:00:08,194
Furthermore, you see that this same incestuous sinner is not handed over to death, but to Satan, for correction, for punishment, for repentance.

1103
02:00:08,194 --> 02:00:25,210
Finally, he says, "To the destruction of the flesh, but not of the soul, not even of the spirit: but to the destruction of the flesh alone, namely the temptations, the sufferings of the flesh, the loss of members, just as he says elsewhere about the undisciplined: 'They will suffer tribulation of the flesh' (First Corinthians 7:28).

1104
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:26,484
Do you want to know this?

1105
02:00:26,484 --> 02:00:26,535
"

1106
02:00:27,095 --> 02:00:31,732
In the second letter to the Corinthians, Paul himself forgives this same impious person.

1107
02:00:31,732 --> 02:02:20,687
He says: "For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough; so you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest he be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him" Second Corinthians 2:6-8. And later: "If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, in order that Satan might not outwit us" Second Corinthians 2:10.
Do you see the Apostle's leniency, even moderating his own judgments? Do you see the gentle mildness, far removed from your arrogance? It's far different from the sternness of Novatian, but rather concerned with the common life and the salvation of all.
Yet you also criticize us severely. You say that it is not permissible to break even one of the heavenly commandments, nor to associate sheep with wolves, and that every agreement in crime is wrong; and therefore, those who touch pitch will be defiled Sirach 13:1; nor is there any fellowship between light and darkness, or between the temple of God and idols, or any agreement between Christ and Belial Second Corinthians 6:14-15. Therefore, David says: "When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and you have been a partaker with adulterers" Psalm 50:18.
You finally say that we nullify the Lord's commandments. Do we bend even one iota of the Law; or rather, do the Novatians, who have violated all the laws of the Church and harmony, who after so many years of peace and so many holy covenants, have created new laws, new institutions, and new rites for themselves, feigning the mystery of justice with an unyielding demeanor? Did we receive wolves into the Church, while avoiding the mouths of heretics; or rather the Novatians, who, being ravenous wolves themselves, fear the slightly more pitiful little sheep? Do we consent to evil, touch the pitch, cling to darkness, join with idols and Belial; or rather those who received Evaristus, Nicostratus, and others who withdrew from the Church, defiled in speech, actions, and morals?

1108
02:02:20,687 --> 02:02:28,835
We encounter adulterers and thieves, or those who preferred Novatus over their own lives and well-being, after embezzling the money of orphans and widows.

1109
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:33,861
The wretched parent and the wife’s childbirth murderer, not only unrepentant but even boasting?

1110
02:02:33,861 --> 02:04:21,206
But the Apostle Paul said in 1 Timothy chapter 5, verse 21, "Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands."
He teaches the same; whether late or after repentance, they should not be denied.
Moreover, you will be a severe critic against us.
You say, according to the heavenly law, it is not allowed to break one of the commandments, nor to join lambs with wolves, and that every agreement in crime is forbidden.
Therefore, he who touches pitch will be defiled, as it is written in Sirach chapter 13, verse 1.
Nor should there be any fellowship of light with darkness, or the temple of God with idols, or the union of Christ with Belial, as stated in 2 Corinthians chapter 6, verses 14 and 15.
Therefore, David says in Psalm chapter 49, verse 18, "You saw a thief and ran with him, and you shared your portion with adulterers."
You finally say that we nullify the Lord’s commandments.
We bend one jot of the Law; or rather the Novatians, who violated all the rights of the Church, all the laws of harmony, who after so many years of peace, so many covenants of sanctity, created new laws, new institutions, new rites for themselves, pretending an uncompromising front of justice?
We received wolves into the Church, who avoid the mouths of heretics; or rather the Novatians, who, being ravenous wolves themselves, fear the slightly more miserable little sheep?
We agree with the evildoers, we touch pitch, we cling to darkness, we join with idols and Belial; or those who received Evaristus, who received Nicostratus, and others who departed from the Church, defiled in speech, hand, and manners?
We encounter adulterers and thieves, or those who preferred Novatus over their own lives and well-being, after embezzling the money of orphans and widows.
The wretched parent and the wife’s childbirth murderer, not only unrepentant but even boasting?
But the Apostle Paul said in 1 Timothy chapter 5, verse 21, "Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands."
He teaches the same; whether late or after repentance, they should not be denied.

1111
02:04:21,311 --> 02:04:26,383
But when Jericho was lost, Achan, the son of Carmi, was killed because of the theft of a garment.

1112
02:04:26,383 --> 02:04:31,455
Come on, you, kill all the thieves of our money and books; and rage against the bones of Novatus.

1113
02:04:31,455 --> 02:04:35,116
Take up again that yoke which neither we nor our ancestors could bear.

1114
02:04:35,116 --> 02:04:36,475
Acts chapter 15, verse 10.

1115
02:04:36,475 --> 02:04:40,554
Why do you delay, Novatians, to demand an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?

1116
02:04:40,554 --> 02:04:42,279
Deuteronomy chapter 19, verse 21.

1117
02:04:42,279 --> 02:04:46,201
To ask for a life, to restore the practice of Circumcision and the Sabbath?

1118
02:04:46,201 --> 02:04:48,397
Kill the thieves, stone the insolent ones.

1119
02:04:48,397 --> 02:04:52,841
Do you not read in the Gospel that the Lord spared even the adulteress who confessed?

1120
02:04:52,841 --> 02:04:54,149
John chapter 8, verse 11.

1121
02:04:54,149 --> 02:05:14,175
Whom no one condemned: that he forgave the sinful woman who washed his feet with her tears; that he saved Rahab in the very city of Jericho of the Phoenicians; that he absolved Tamar from the judgment of the patriarch; that, even when Sodom was perishing, he did not destroy the daughters of Lot; he would have also saved their sons-in-law if they had believed in the impending doom.

1122
02:05:14,175 --> 02:06:21,888
Come on, do you not recall saying to the Lord with David: "With those who hate peace, I was peaceful." Psalm chapter 120, verse 7.
Do not ignore the saying of Solomon either: "A brother helping a brother will be exalted." Proverbs chapter 18, verse 9.
What about the Apostle? "Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore that person gently, considering yourselves lest you also be tempted. Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ." Galatians chapter 6, verses 1 and 2.
And what I already mentioned before: "For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race." Romans chapter 9, verse 3.
And again: "I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some." First Corinthians chapter 9, verse 22.
That is, to share the groans with the wounded, the toil with the sick; to share death with the dying, to mix the fall of brothers with their state, to give up something of one's own health, and to provide medicine to the failing ones.
But when Jericho was lost, Achan, the son of Carmi, was killed because of the theft of a garment. Come on; you, kill all the thieves of our money and books; and rage against the bones of Novatus.

1123
02:06:22,463 --> 02:06:26,874
Take up that yoke again, which neither we nor our ancestors were able to bear.

1124
02:06:26,874 --> 02:06:32,190
(Acts 15:10)
Why do you hesitate, Novatians, to demand an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?

1125
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:37,506
(Deuteronomy 19:21)
To demand a life, to restore the practice of circumcision and the Sabbath?

1126
02:06:37,506 --> 02:06:39,372
Kill thieves, stone the insolent.

1127
02:06:39,372 --> 02:06:45,253
Don’t you read in the Gospel that the Lord spared even the confessing adulteress, whom no one condemned?

1128
02:06:45,253 --> 02:06:48,759
That He forgave the sinner who washed His feet with her tears?

1129
02:06:48,759 --> 02:06:52,265
That He saved Rahab in the city of Jericho of the Phoenicians?

1130
02:06:52,265 --> 02:06:55,545
That He absolved Tamar from the judgment of the patriarch?

1131
02:06:55,545 --> 02:06:59,447
That, even when Sodom was destroyed, He did not kill Lot’s daughters?

1132
02:06:59,447 --> 02:07:04,536
He would have saved their sons-in-law too, if they had believed in the coming destruction.

1133
02:07:04,536 --> 02:07:10,983
(John 8:11)
Come on; don’t you remember to say to the Lord with David: With those who hated peace, I was peaceful?

1134
02:07:10,983 --> 02:07:16,298
(Psalm 119:7)
And not to ignore Solomon’s saying: A brother helping a brother will be exalted.

1135
02:07:16,298 --> 02:07:18,673
(Proverbs 18:9)
What does the Apostle say?

1136
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:27,099
Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore that person gently, watching yourselves so you also may not be tempted.

1137
02:07:27,099 --> 02:07:31,567
Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.

1138
02:07:31,567 --> 02:07:40,784
(Galatians 6:1, 2)
And what I mentioned before: For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race.

1139
02:07:40,784 --> 02:07:47,061
(Romans 9:3)
And again: I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.

1140
02:07:47,061 --> 02:08:00,407
That is, to share cries with the wounded; to share labor with the sick; to share death with the dying; to mix the fall of brothers with one’s own state, to give up something of one’s own health, and to provide medicine to those failing.

1141
02:08:00,407 --> 02:08:11,151
(1 Corinthians 9:22)
What good does it do you to harden your face with pride and harshness, to govern with lofty necks, to turn your face away from the miserable, to shut your ears and eyes?

1142
02:08:11,151 --> 02:08:12,847
Have you never, I ask, fallen?

1143
02:08:12,847 --> 02:08:14,657
Is there no stain in your minds?

1144
02:08:14,657 --> 02:08:16,806
Is there no speck in your eyes, I ask?

1145
02:08:16,806 --> 02:08:20,595
Who will boast of having a pure heart, or of being clean from sins?

1146
02:08:20,595 --> 02:08:23,083
(Proverbs 20:9, according to the Septuagint)

1147
02:08:24,383 --> 02:08:34,399
I believe you, the just, the kind, the temperate, who have all your limbs healthy, whose entire body is intact, who do not need a doctor or medicine for ailments, can enter heaven now.

1148
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:38,046
The gates of paradise are open; with the sword yielding, penetrate.

1149
02:08:38,046 --> 02:08:41,965
With so many of our people confessing the one God, close off your gifts.

1150
02:08:41,965 --> 02:08:48,552
But if circumstances are far different and your cruelty prevails, now you understand, Novatians, that God can have mercy.

1151
02:08:48,552 --> 02:08:53,940
Now, let the medicine, though late, be available to our unfortunate brothers confessing their past.

1152
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:58,785
Now, the one wounded and neglected by the Levite and priest can be healed through Christ.

1153
02:08:58,785 --> 02:09:02,269
Now, the prayers of the Church must not be denied to the humble.

1154
02:09:02,269 --> 02:09:06,351
Now, the hands of the priests must be extended to these miserable brothers.

1155
02:09:06,351 --> 02:09:14,516
We understand your reproach, but the Church of God is a dove, not bitter with gall, not violent with tearing claws, even with small and tiny feathers.

1156
02:09:14,516 --> 02:09:25,185
We also know the well of living water and the sealed fountain, untainted by the filth of a heretic's whirlpool, and the enclosed garden full of great and small vegetables, both cheap and precious.

1157
02:09:25,185 --> 02:09:33,023
Consider the eight souls from the ark, among them Ham, and those thousands of birds and beasts, clean and unclean alike, by pairs and by sevens.

1158
02:09:33,023 --> 02:09:39,936
We think of the dry fountains and the clouds stirred by whirlwinds as the sterility of heretics and the force of insane voices.

1159
02:09:39,936 --> 02:09:54,687
We do not promise freedom while we ourselves are slaves to punishment; but having confessed our crimes, we urge others to confess as well and to believe in Him who justifies the ungodly by faith Romans 3:26, who reverses the judgment imposed against wickedness Joel 2:13.

1160
02:09:54,687 --> 02:09:59,586
We also heed the false prophets and ravenous wolves, as we guard against you Matthew 7:15.

1161
02:09:59,586 --> 02:10:04,104
We remember Jannes and Jambres who opposed Moses, just as you oppose the Catholics.

1162
02:10:04,104 --> 02:10:09,547
Thus the Apostle says: Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth.

1163
02:10:09,547 --> 02:10:18,257
They are men of corrupt minds, disapproved by God; but they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men 2 Timothy.

1164
02:10:19,127 --> 02:10:24,599
It is clear that you have been criticized for your inability to improve and for displaying your foolishness.

1165
02:10:24,599 --> 02:10:32,706
What good does it do to maintain a proud and harsh demeanor, to carry yourself with arrogance, to turn away from those in need, and to close your ears and eyes?

1166
02:10:32,706 --> 02:10:34,175
Have you never made mistakes?

1167
02:10:34,175 --> 02:10:35,898
Is there no flaw in your thinking?

1168
02:10:35,898 --> 02:10:37,469
No imperfection in your vision?

1169
02:10:37,469 --> 02:10:40,610
Who can truly claim to have a pure heart or be free from sins?

1170
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,738
Proverbs 20:9 according to the Septuagint.

1171
02:10:42,738 --> 02:10:50,287
I believe you are just, benevolent, temperate, with all your limbs healthy and your whole body intact, not needing a doctor or medicine for ailments.

1172
02:10:50,287 --> 02:10:56,874
Enter heaven now; pass through the gates of paradise with confidence; and keep your gifts from those who confess the one true God.

1173
02:10:56,874 --> 02:11:02,802
If reality is far harsher and your unforgiving cruelty persists, then understand, Novatians, that God can show mercy.

1174
02:11:02,802 --> 02:11:07,109
For the brothers who confess their past sins, even late, let the remedy be available.

1175
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:11,517
Now, the one wounded and ignored by the Levite and priest can be healed through Christ.

1176
02:11:11,517 --> 02:11:18,610
Now, the prayers of the Church should not be denied to the humble, and the hands of the priests should be extended to the pitiable brothers.

1177
02:11:18,610 --> 02:11:25,298
We, however, understand, as you criticize, that the Church of God is like a dove, not bitter or violent, even if small and delicate.

1178
02:11:25,298 --> 02:11:34,266
We also know the well of living water and the sealed fountain, untainted by the heretic's stain, and the enclosed garden full of various plants, both insignificant and valuable.

1179
02:11:34,266 --> 02:11:40,194
Eight souls were saved in the ark, including Ham, along with thousands of birds and animals, clean and unclean alike.

1180
02:11:40,194 --> 02:11:46,173
But we see the dry springs and stormy clouds as symbols of the sterility of heretics and the rage of senseless voices.

1181
02:11:46,173 --> 02:11:49,567
We do not promise freedom, as we ourselves are bound by punishment.

1182
02:11:49,567 --> 02:11:55,445
But having confessed our sins, we encourage others to confess and believe in Him who justifies the ungodly by faith.

1183
02:11:55,445 --> 02:11:55,749
Romans

1184
02:11:56,711 --> 02:12:01,588
Who reverses a decision against the malice inflicted (Joel 2:13, according to the Septuagint).

1185
02:12:01,588 --> 02:12:06,204
We guard against false prophets and ravenous wolves when we beware of you (Matthew 7:15).

1186
02:12:06,204 --> 02:12:10,769
Indeed, we believe that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, just as you resist Catholics.

1187
02:12:10,769 --> 02:12:17,928
The Apostle states: Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these resist the truth—people with corrupt minds and rejected by God.

1188
02:12:17,928 --> 02:12:24,983
But they will not get very far, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just as that of those men was (Second Timothy 3:8-9).

1189
02:12:24,983 --> 02:12:29,444
This clearly applies to you, who cannot advance any further nor hide your foolishness.

1190
02:12:29,444 --> 02:12:33,231
He who is baptized by a dead person gains nothing (Ecclesiasticus 34:30).

1191
02:12:33,231 --> 02:12:39,196
Similarly, he who is washed in a heretical font, or anointed with a sinner's oil, is filled with an unclean spirit.

1192
02:12:39,196 --> 02:12:41,375
Therefore, you will also be sons of blood.

1193
02:12:41,375 --> 02:12:44,280
For you desire not the peace of the brothers, but blood.

1194
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,784
Your belief is a false faith.

1195
02:12:45,784 --> 02:12:55,173
An adulterous woman is like a heretical congregation:
For the Catholic Church, from the beginning, has not left her husband's bed and chamber, nor desired other lovers or strangers.

1196
02:12:55,173 --> 02:13:07,727
You have painted an exiled image with a new color;
you have separated your bed from the ancient union;
you have distanced yourself from the body of the one-bedded mother, adorned with new methods of pleasing and new enticements of corruption.

1197
02:13:07,727 --> 02:13:27,543
When you propose the most blessed Cyprian as a witness against me, because in the Epistle concerning the Lapsed, he says that Moses, Daniel, and Job prayed for sinners and did not obtain what they asked for, with the Lord saying:
And if three men were in the midst of them, Noah, Job, and Daniel, they would not save sons or daughters, but they alone would be saved (Ezekiel 14:20).

1198
02:13:27,543 --> 02:13:32,886
If only you would rely on Cyprian as a witness, if only you would agree with such healthful sentiments.

1199
02:13:32,886 --> 02:13:45,231
For he, when he urged the lapsed to repentance who did not want to repent, saying that they had received peace from confessors or martyrs, taught and showed that even those patriarchs would not obtain anything for those who do not repent.

1200
02:13:45,231 --> 02:13:47,358
Indeed, who can free an unwilling person?

1201
02:13:47,358 --> 02:13:49,278
Who can humble himself for the proud?

1202
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:52,428
Who can intercede for those who do not repent?

1203
02:13:52,428 --> 02:13:56,029
When he said this, he was urging them towards the remedies of repentance.

1204
02:13:56,029 --> 02:14:03,229
A man of such seriousness and merit did not speak against himself but taught that sinners should offer prayers and practice confession diligently.

1205
02:14:03,229 --> 02:14:09,197
Cyprian’s own examples illustrate this, recalling that neither Moses nor other saints were able to intercede for sinners.

1206
02:14:09,197 --> 02:14:11,565
Those who are baptized by the dead gain nothing.

1207
02:14:11,565 --> 02:14:22,316
As it is written in Ecclesiasticus thirty-four, verse thirty: “Indeed, those who are washed in the font of heretics are like those anointed with the oil of sinners, that is, those who are filled with an unclean spirit.

1208
02:14:22,316 --> 02:14:24,634
” Therefore, you will be children of bloodshed.

1209
02:14:24,634 --> 02:14:27,544
For you do not desire the peace of the brothers, but blood.

1210
02:14:27,544 --> 02:14:29,813
Your faith is false, your belief is deceitful.

1211
02:14:29,813 --> 02:14:39,480
The heretical congregation is like an adulterous woman: for the Catholic Church has never left the bed and chamber of her husband from the beginning, nor has she desired other lovers or strangers.

1212
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:50,873
You have painted an exiled form with a new color; you have separated your bed from the ancient marriage; you have departed from the body of the one true mother, adorned with a new kind of pleasing and new enticements of corruption.

1213
02:14:50,873 --> 02:15:08,973
You present the most blessed Cyprian to me as a witness against me because in the letter concerning the Lapsed, he says that Moses, Daniel, and Job prayed for sinners but did not succeed, as the Lord says: “Even if Noah, Job, and Daniel were in their midst, they would not save their sons or daughters, but they alone would be saved” (Ezekiel fourteen, verse twenty).

1214
02:15:08,973 --> 02:15:13,018
If only you would rely on Cyprian as a witness and agree with such sound opinions.

1215
02:15:13,018 --> 02:15:23,178
When urging the lapsed to repentance, who did not want to repent and claimed they had received peace from confessors or martyrs, he taught that even those patriarchs could not intercede for the unrepentant.

1216
02:15:23,178 --> 02:15:25,446
Indeed, who can free someone who is unwilling?

1217
02:15:25,446 --> 02:15:27,419
Who can humble themselves for the proud?

1218
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:29,688
Who can intercede for those who do not repent?

1219
02:15:29,688 --> 02:15:33,288
When he said this, he was urging them towards the remedies of repentance.

1220
02:15:33,288 --> 02:15:40,489
A man of such seriousness and merit did not speak against himself but taught that sinners should offer prayers and practice confession diligently.

1221
02:15:41,327 --> 02:15:48,848
However, consider Cyprian's examples, where he notes that even Moses and other saints didn't always succeed in their petitions for sinners.

1222
02:15:48,848 --> 02:15:49,227
Really?

1223
02:15:49,227 --> 02:15:51,608
Don't you see for whom Moses didn't succeed?

1224
02:15:51,608 --> 02:15:54,908
When he returned to the people, what did he hear in the camp?

1225
02:15:54,908 --> 02:15:58,371
The voices of drunkards and the songs of idol worship resounded.

1226
02:15:58,371 --> 02:16:04,269
The people still persisted in wickedness, still remained in their very crimes, and didn't know how to repent.

1227
02:16:04,269 --> 02:16:07,136
Yet, who among us told you that Moses didn't succeed?

1228
02:16:07,136 --> 02:16:12,601
God had indeed said to him: "He has sinned before me, I will erase him from the book" (Exodus 32:33).

1229
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:20,825
However, God spoke with the authority of a judge and the power of the Lord; but see how quickly he changed his sentence against the people's wickedness.

1230
02:16:20,825 --> 02:16:21,204
Listen.

1231
02:16:21,204 --> 02:16:29,266
The prophet immediately said: "And Moses prayed before the Lord, his God; Why, Lord, are you so angry with your people?" and the rest (Exodus 32:21).

1232
02:16:29,266 --> 02:16:35,271
Further down: "And the Lord was appeased from the harm which he said he would do to his people" (Exodus 32:14).

1233
02:16:35,271 --> 02:16:37,490
Do you see that God's anger was softened?

1234
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:39,708
Do you see that the offense was placated?

1235
02:16:39,708 --> 02:16:43,874
And Moses didn't pray for the people, nor did he repent for what he had done.

1236
02:16:43,874 --> 02:16:44,253
Really?

1237
02:16:44,253 --> 02:16:46,634
Don't you see for whom Moses didn't succeed?

1238
02:16:46,634 --> 02:16:49,934
When he returned to the people, what did he hear in the camp?

1239
02:16:49,934 --> 02:16:53,397
The voices of drunkards and the songs of idol worship resounded.

1240
02:16:53,397 --> 02:16:59,295
The people still persisted in wickedness, still remained in their very crimes, and didn't know how to repent.

1241
02:16:59,295 --> 02:17:02,162
Yet, who among us told you that Moses didn't succeed?

1242
02:17:02,162 --> 02:17:07,627
God had indeed said to him: "He has sinned before me, I will erase him from the book" (Exodus 32:33).

1243
02:17:07,627 --> 02:17:15,851
However, God spoke with the authority of a judge and the power of the Lord; but see how quickly he changed his sentence against the people's wickedness.

1244
02:17:15,851 --> 02:17:16,230
Listen.

1245
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:24,292
The prophet immediately said: "And Moses prayed before the Lord, his God; Why, Lord, are you so angry with your people?" and the rest (Exodus 32:21).

1246
02:17:24,292 --> 02:17:30,298
Further down: "And the Lord was appeased from the harm which he said he would do to his people" (Exodus 32:14).

1247
02:17:30,298 --> 02:17:32,516
Do you see that God's anger was softened?

1248
02:17:32,516 --> 02:17:34,734
Do you see that the offense was placated?

1249
02:17:34,734 --> 02:17:38,901
And Moses didn't pray for the people, nor did he repent for what he had done.

1250
02:17:40,415 --> 02:17:44,425
But Noah, you say, and Daniel, and Job could not save their sons and daughters.

1251
02:17:44,425 --> 02:17:53,257
And this is the reason: if they ask for those who do not ask; if they intercede for those who persist in crime; if they defend not individuals, not a few, but many thousands.

1252
02:17:53,257 --> 02:18:02,292
However, Noah saved his own household from public ruin; and Job recovered everything he lost; and Daniel diverted that impending sword from the wise men of Babylon by his prayer.

1253
02:18:02,292 --> 02:18:07,164
Lot certainly prayed for the safety of the town, and Paul prayed for the passengers on the ship.

1254
02:18:07,164 --> 02:18:10,210
Thus, those who know how to repent are absolved by the just.

1255
02:18:10,210 --> 02:18:55,840
Finally, I observe what is written: Ezekiel 14:20: "They alone will be saved."
Who are they? Certainly, those who intercede for sinners. They will be able to ask for such things without punishment. And why do you condemn the Church? Why do you forbid praying for the repentant; if it is allowed to ask even for those for whom it is not allowed to obtain?
Therefore, read my Cyprian more diligently: read the entire letter on the Lapsed: read another which he gave to Antonianus; where Novatian is urged with all examples: you will already know what he pronounces about the treatment of the penitent.
I speak of Cyprian, who opposes your views and retains the rights of the Catholic Church. After his heresy (for you have taken many things from him) you will hear Tertullian himself confessing in his letter, and the very one he published as a Catholic, that the Church has the power to forgive sins.

1256
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,849
But Noah, you say, and Daniel, and Job could not save their sons and daughters.

1257
02:18:59,849 --> 02:19:08,681
And this is the reason: if they ask for those who do not ask; if they intercede for those who persist in crime; if they defend not individuals, not a few, but many thousands.

1258
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:17,716
However, Noah saved his own household from public ruin; and Job recovered everything he lost; and Daniel diverted that impending sword from the wise men of Babylon by his prayer.

1259
02:19:17,716 --> 02:19:22,588
Lot certainly prayed for the safety of the town, and Paul prayed for the passengers on the ship.

1260
02:19:22,588 --> 02:19:25,634
Thus, those who know how to repent are absolved by the just.

1261
02:19:25,634 --> 02:19:37,409
Finally, I observe what is written: Ezekiel 14:20: "They alone will be saved."
Who are they? Certainly, those who intercede for sinners. They will be able to ask for such things without punishment. And why do you condemn the Church?

1262
02:19:37,967 --> 02:19:40,416
Why do you prevent prayers for those who repent?

1263
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:45,212
If it's acceptable to pray even for these people, for whom is it not acceptable to seek mercy?

1264
02:19:45,212 --> 02:19:57,558
Therefore, read my Cyprian more diligently:
read the entire letter about the Lapsed:
read another letter he gave to Antonianus, where Novatian is confronted with all examples:
you will then know what he pronounces about the care of penitents.

1265
02:19:57,558 --> 02:20:00,874
I speak about Cyprian, who opposes you and upholds Catholic laws.

1266
02:20:00,874 --> 02:20:10,822
After the heresy (for you have taken much from there), you will hear Tertullian himself confessing in his letter, and even in the one he published as a Catholic, that the Church can forgive sins.

1267
02:20:10,822 --> 02:20:18,372
Therefore, you see that the Church is a queen in a garment of gold and varied colors (Psalm 45:9); clearly composed of many bodies and many peoples.

1268
02:20:18,372 --> 02:20:22,913
This painting is not of one color, nor does such diversity shine forth in one appearance.

1269
02:20:22,913 --> 02:20:25,719
One part of the garment covers, another part shapes it.

1270
02:20:25,719 --> 02:20:30,361
Some adhere to the chest, some are dragged at the hem, and some even get dirty at the feet.

1271
02:20:30,361 --> 02:20:37,402
Some are compared to the purple of martyrs; some to virginal silk; some are sewn with a folding hem, or repaired with an inserting needle.

1272
02:20:37,402 --> 02:20:43,064
For one person is this way, another is that way (First Corinthians 7:7); and yet, one queen is composed of all.

1273
02:20:43,064 --> 02:20:50,054
The same fruitful and rich vine, having many branches, is adorned with many clusters; has none of these suffered from the cold of winter?

1274
02:20:50,054 --> 02:20:51,533
Has it endured no harsh hail?

1275
02:20:51,533 --> 02:20:53,319
Has it not faced scorching summers?

1276
02:20:53,319 --> 02:21:00,563
This gem is tougher for the clusters, that one stronger, another purer; this one spreads itself in fruits, this one only overflows in foliage.

1277
02:21:00,563 --> 02:21:02,451
Yet the vine is beautiful everywhere.

1278
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:06,481
This mother of young women, whose number is beyond count (Song of Solomon 6:7).

1279
02:21:06,481 --> 02:21:10,766
Finally, if you can count the Catholic flocks, and number the throngs of our people.

1280
02:21:10,766 --> 02:21:19,643
Not only those spread throughout the whole world, filling all regions; but also, brother Sympronian, those that dwell with you in the neighboring territories and nearby city.

1281
02:21:19,643 --> 02:21:23,928
Observe, how many of ours do you see alone, how many of my people do you meet alone.

1282
02:21:23,928 --> 02:21:26,377
Are you not like drops from the great fountains?

1283
02:21:26,377 --> 02:21:29,336
Are you not swallowed up like a small drop from the ocean?

1284
02:21:30,407 --> 02:21:35,023
Tell me, are these young women born from your people, or do you alone give birth to them?

1285
02:21:35,023 --> 02:21:39,327
That queen, I said, is chosen and perfect for her mother Song of Solomon chapter 8.

1286
02:21:39,327 --> 02:21:45,550
For nothing is chosen unless it is better and greater than something else; nothing can be perfect unless it is complete.

1287
02:21:45,550 --> 02:21:50,683
You see then that the Church is a queen in a golden and variegated robe Psalm chapter 45, verse 10.

1288
02:21:50,683 --> 02:21:54,832
Certainly composed of many bodies and many peoples with diverse characteristics.

1289
02:21:54,832 --> 02:21:59,084
This picture is not of one color, nor does such great diversity shine in one form.

1290
02:21:59,084 --> 02:22:01,781
One part of the garment covers, another part adorns.

1291
02:22:01,781 --> 02:22:07,018
Some cling to the chest, some are dragged to the lowest fold, and get dirty among the very footsteps.

1292
02:22:07,018 --> 02:22:14,486
Some are likened to the purple of martyrs; some, to the silk of virgins; some are sewn with a folding hem, or repaired with an inserting needle.

1293
02:22:14,486 --> 02:22:18,893
For one person is this way, another is that way First Corinthians chapter 7, verse 7.

1294
02:22:18,893 --> 02:22:20,708
Yet, in all, one queen is composed.

1295
02:22:20,708 --> 02:22:28,124
Therefore, the same fruitful and wealthy vine, having many branches, is extended with many shoots; did none of these suffer from winter's cold?

1296
02:22:28,124 --> 02:22:29,835
Did none endure harsh hailstorms?

1297
02:22:29,835 --> 02:22:31,858
Did none complain of scorching summers?

1298
02:22:31,858 --> 02:22:38,754
This gem is harsher for the shoots, that one stronger, another purer; this one spreads itself into fruits, this one into mere leaves.

1299
02:22:38,754 --> 02:22:40,673
Yet the vine is beautiful everywhere.

1300
02:22:40,673 --> 02:22:45,444
This is the mother of the young women, who are countless Song of Solomon chapter 6, verse 7.

1301
02:22:45,444 --> 02:22:49,748
Finally, if you can count the Catholic flocks, and tally the numbers of our people.

1302
02:22:49,748 --> 02:22:58,304
Not only those spread throughout the whole world, filling all regions; but these, brother Symproniane, which are with you in the nearby borders and neighboring city.

1303
02:22:58,304 --> 02:23:02,608
Consider how many of ours you alone see, how many of my people you alone encounter.

1304
02:23:02,608 --> 02:23:05,668
Are you not swallowed up like raindrops by great fountains?

1305
02:23:05,668 --> 02:23:08,261
Are you not, like a drop from the ocean, absorbed?

1306
02:23:08,261 --> 02:23:12,876
Tell me, are these young women born from your people, or do you alone give birth to them?

1307
02:23:12,876 --> 02:23:17,180
That queen, I said, is chosen and perfect for her mother Song of Solomon chapter 8.

1308
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:23,403
For nothing is chosen unless it is better and greater than something else; nothing can be perfect unless it is complete.

1309
02:23:24,647 --> 02:23:31,946
Now, also consider this: whether it is mainly built on the foundation of the prophets and apostles, with Jesus Christ himself as the cornerstone.

1310
02:23:31,946 --> 02:23:55,401
If it started before you, if it believed before you, if it did not depart from the earlier foundations, if it did not move away, if it did not separate itself from the rest of the body to establish its own teachers and its own instruments, if it argued something unusual, if it discovered some new law, if it declared a rejection of peace to its own body: it must clearly seem to have departed from Christ, to have been established outside the prophets and apostles.

1311
02:23:55,401 --> 02:24:01,894
This, then, will be the great house, rich with all sorts of vessels, in which pure gold shines, in which malleable silver gleams.

1312
02:24:01,894 --> 02:24:06,928
But, as it is written in Second Timothy chapter 2, verse 20, it also honors wooden and clay vessels.

1313
02:24:06,928 --> 02:24:09,998
For a great house serves many uses and demands various works.

1314
02:24:09,998 --> 02:24:13,924
It does not only seek silver, nor is it solely delighted by golden decoration.

1315
02:24:13,924 --> 02:24:19,562
Often, a great house is more fitting with simplicity; and among noble ambitions, even small things are pleasing.

1316
02:24:19,562 --> 02:24:23,840
No artist despises his own works, nor considers anything he has made to be worthless.

1317
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:29,729
And why do you think Christ suffered for sinners, if not because he did not want to lose anything he himself created?

1318
02:24:29,729 --> 02:24:38,839
Why do you think he still intercedes for the miserable today, if not because he does not reject even the smallest and most despised, intending to lose none of those he has accepted?

1319
02:24:38,839 --> 02:24:44,376
Even if they are compared to wooden and clay vessels, he still arranges all the vessels in his house this way.

1320
02:24:44,879 --> 02:24:51,673
Here, then, will be a grand house, rich with diverse kinds of vessels, where pure gold shines brightly and ductile silver gleams.

1321
02:24:51,673 --> 02:24:56,150
As it is written in Second Timothy 2:20, it also includes wooden and earthen vessels.

1322
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:59,626
For a great house serves many purposes and requires various works.

1323
02:24:59,626 --> 02:25:03,681
It does not seek only silver, nor does it delight solely in golden ornaments.

1324
02:25:03,681 --> 02:25:09,106
Often, what suits the great more is humility; and among noble affairs, even small things are enjoyable.

1325
02:25:09,106 --> 02:25:13,583
No artist despises his own works, nor does he think the things he made are worthless.

1326
02:25:13,583 --> 02:25:19,323
And why do you think Christ suffered for sinners, if not because He did not want to lose anything He created?

1327
02:25:19,323 --> 02:25:25,907
Why do you think He still intercedes for the wretched, if not because He does not reject even the smallest and most despised?

1328
02:25:25,907 --> 02:25:30,594
He will not lose anyone He has accepted, whether they are like wooden or earthen vessels.

1329
02:25:30,594 --> 02:25:33,175
And so, He arranges all the vessels in His house.

1330
02:25:33,175 --> 02:25:40,706
Finally, brother Sympronianus, do not hesitate to be with the many; be willing to leave behind the remnants of the Novatians and your own sect.

1331
02:25:40,706 --> 02:25:44,709
Look upon the Catholic flocks and the people of the Church spread so widely.

1332
02:25:44,709 --> 02:26:41,799
You say, "Where there is one, there I am also; and where there are two, there is the Church." Where there is one who is in harmony; where there are two, they are peaceful.
Where there is one, there is the Church; how much more so where there are many? "Two are better than one," he says, "and a threefold cord is not quickly broken" Ecclesiastes 4:12.
Hear David: "I will praise your name in the great assembly" Psalm 35:18. And again: "I will praise you among a mighty throng."
And: "The God of gods has spoken, and summoned the earth from sunrise to sunset" Psalm 50:1. Why is the seed of Abraham, as numerous as the stars and grains of sand, content with your poverty?
"In you," he says, "all the tribes of the earth will be blessed" Genesis 22:18. Tell me, does Novatian fulfill this? God did not redeem such a small number with His blood, nor is Christ so poor.
Recognize now, brother, the Church of God expanding its tents and fixing the tent pegs to the right and left. Understand, "From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised" Psalm 113:3.

1333
02:26:42,431 --> 02:26:48,994
Look, I beg you, while the Novatians argue over words, the wealth of the Catholic Church is spreading throughout the whole world.

1334
02:26:48,994 --> 02:26:51,639
I have instructed you on everything you asked about.

1335
02:26:51,639 --> 02:26:54,488
I didn't skip any of the topics or questions you raised.

1336
02:26:54,488 --> 02:26:56,573
I answered down to the details and words.

1337
02:26:56,573 --> 02:27:02,271
If you asked with a curious mind, it was shown with love; if with a challenging mind, it was debated with vigor.

1338
02:27:02,271 --> 02:27:11,224
I will add another letter when I have time, in which I will not refute your points, but present ours: if you read it kindly and without disdain, perhaps it will not offend you.

1339
02:27:11,224 --> 02:27:14,836
Meanwhile, I ask that you carefully consider each point in this letter.

1340
02:27:14,836 --> 02:27:22,314
Things read quickly are easily forgotten: if you desire better gifts and have a soul seeking good education, you will not easily despise the truth.

1341
02:27:22,314 --> 02:27:27,961
May the Lord be pleased to guard and protect you forever and make you live as a Christian in spiritual harmony.

1342
02:27:27,961 --> 02:27:28,215
Amen.

1343
02:27:28,215 --> 02:27:38,745
Finally, brother Sympronian, do not be ashamed to be with the many; be willing to scorn the remnants and fragments of the Novatians; look at the Catholic flocks and the people of the Church spread so widely.

1344
02:27:38,745 --> 02:27:45,816
Where there is one, you say, there I am too; and where there are two, there is the Church: where one is in harmony; where two are peaceful.

1345
02:27:45,816 --> 02:27:49,682
Where there is one, there is the Church; how much more where there are many?

1346
02:27:49,682 --> 02:27:53,396
Two are better than one, he says, and a triple cord is not easily broken.

1347
02:27:53,396 --> 02:27:54,311
Ecclesiastes 4:12.

1348
02:27:54,311 --> 02:27:57,923
Listen to David: I will sing praise to your name in the great assembly.

1349
02:27:57,923 --> 02:27:58,534
Psalm 35:18.

1350
02:27:58,534 --> 02:28:00,925
And again: I will praise you among many people.

1351
02:28:00,925 --> 02:28:01,535
Psalm 35:18.

1352
02:28:01,535 --> 02:28:06,368
And: The God of gods has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.

1353
02:28:06,368 --> 02:28:06,927
Psalm 49:1.

1354
02:28:06,927 --> 02:28:12,320
How does the seed of Abraham, according to the stars and the sands of the seashore, fit with your poverty?

1355
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,914
In you all the tribes of the earth will be blessed.

1356
02:28:14,914 --> 02:28:15,626
Genesis 22:18.

1357
02:28:15,626 --> 02:28:17,407
Tell me; can Novatian fulfill this?

1358
02:28:17,407 --> 02:28:21,120
God redeemed us with His blood, not for so little, nor is Christ so poor.

1359
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:31,650
Recognize now, brother, the Church of God expanding its tents, and setting up its stakes to the right and to the left: understand, from the rising of the sun to its setting, the Lord’s name is to be praised.

1360
02:28:31,650 --> 02:28:32,261
Psalm 113:3.

1361
02:28:32,261 --> 02:28:38,823
Look, I beg you, while the Novatians argue over words, the wealth of the Catholic Church is spreading throughout the whole world.

1362
02:28:40,247 --> 02:28:43,377
For everything you asked me about, I have provided instructions.

1363
02:28:43,377 --> 02:28:46,360
I didn't leave out any topic or sentence from your questions.

1364
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:48,169
I responded to every detail and word.

1365
02:28:48,169 --> 02:28:50,907
If you asked with a seeking heart, I answered with love.

1366
02:28:50,907 --> 02:28:54,281
If you asked with a challenging spirit, I debated without hesitation.

1367
02:28:54,281 --> 02:28:59,318
I will add another letter when I have time, in which I will not refute your points, but present my own.

1368
02:28:59,318 --> 02:29:02,594
If you read it kindly and without disdain, it might not offend you.

1369
02:29:02,594 --> 02:29:05,968
Meanwhile, in this one, I ask that you consider each point carefully.

1370
02:29:05,968 --> 02:29:08,413
Things that are read quickly are easily forgotten.

1371
02:29:08,413 --> 02:29:13,449
If you desire better understanding and have a passion for learning, you won't easily dismiss the truth.

1372
02:29:13,449 --> 02:29:18,681
May the Lord choose to keep and protect you forever, and make you live as a Christian in spiritual harmony.

1373
02:29:18,681 --> 02:29:18,926
Amen.
