    <p>To holy ears, a new guest of charity would not approach differently, nor would the modesty of the first impulse be provoked or driven, nor would an unknown person begin a conversation, unless a reward was expected. Therefore, dearest brother, an apostolic man begins the fullness of this present letter, so that you may easily understand the praises of the martyrs that follow. Jacob, a faithful man of heavenly desires, intending to bestow dignity among Christ's companions, requested the relics of the recent saints, still steaming with their holy fervor. I said, "intending," because the dignity accumulated before the Lord cannot be taken away.</p>
    
    <p>Though I was quite fearful and not a little prudent about the matter, struggling within myself, I almost denied it out of fear, knowing it was always necessary to give what had been entrusted to me. I confess, I greatly feared the private loss of many things due to private fear, unless I considered Jacob, who would deliver them to Saint John with certain reverent offerings, so that the delegated love through the sacred names of the martyrs would be carried and again united by blood, not as strangers but as kin. Happily accepting this opinion of faith among others, which, even in my grief, made me smile, I delayed but did not refuse. I delayed so that my slowness might openly be revealed, for I had not deserved to follow my companions. I confess, I hoped, but the crown of justice is not in desire alone.</p>
    
    <p>Now, if a proper order will not be burdensome to eager ears, I will begin with the location and journey; I will follow the main traces of events without boredom, so that the flood of merits may more easily flow if you reach the source with capacious love.</p>
    
    <p>The place known as Anagnia, separated by 25 stadia from the city, is enclosed by narrow passages both due to treachery and nature, almost accessible by a single route (you might call it the path of the three martyrs), lying with a soft back, surrounded on all sides by valleys, with castles placed in a crown all around, and neighboring treachery conspiring among themselves, presenting a spectacle of nature. The place lacked a cause, but Christ was a sufficient cause to turn the devil's show into a martyrdom's parade.</p>
    
    <p>The relation of the places may not be unpleasant to the listener's ears. It was always a bad companion for itself, a concave place among the mountains: when Christ's militia first ascended there, the often-stirred, brutal pagans, inflamed by jealous fury and the sounds of war, were stirred. But the one kind of battle for the saints was perfected: to endure all, to yield when attacked, to bear patiently, to temper public fury with private gentleness, to conquer by declining. But the predestined glory urged on the titles of a mature exit, which the due order had produced. For, avoiding digressions and cutting off long windings (I will not be silent) where the virtue of the martyrs was nourished, I will take away the loss of praise with a summary.</p>
    
    <p>When the name of the Lord was still a stranger in the aforementioned region, and there was no sign which would show the seal of faith, these were then in number, now in merit, unique visitors, both in religion and in race, from whom it was not undeserved that God, once unknown, should be preached, composed by the quiet conversation of long time, while no utility of faith was exciting them. But now, if the cause of the rising hatred against the Lord is sought, the title of violated peace was the reason; because one of them, named Sisinnius, the oldest among them, in whom even old age was venerable, elevated a church with his own expenses. Richer in faith than in wealth, wealthy in spirit, poor in census, he handed over the fold to the shepherd. He became the guardian of what he had founded, but the fold was contrary to wolves. The ruin of the devil envied the elevated summit. This was the first fate of martyrdom, that the sheep, while pursuing the lamb, would kill. Added as a sacrifice, it was a juster cause to God.</p>

        Here is the translation of the provided Latin text into modern, easy-to-understand English:

    <p>
        Because when they wanted to lead the evil ritual around the boundaries of the fields, trampling and defiling the growing crops, they also intended to trample on the seedlings of Christ, crowned with mournful decorations, singing the devil's howling song, and with the processions of different livestock bearing flags raised to the temple of the Lord. Recently, they forced someone who had converted from their own people to sacrifice victims to the works of darkness. When the Lord's ministers saw this happening without their consent, they barely managed to avoid being associated with the confused actions as they seemed to be participating. That day, the bodies of the saints were pledged to a deadly massacre, though the palm of victory was yet to be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, brother, I want to briefly discuss with you the titles of things, so that no one may think that martyrdom was taken up humbly:
        because every present good is considered worthless; while something new and wonderful, raised without the envy of time and thus completed, is seen as unique, without precedence or follow-up, but stands alone as the only thing concluded by its completion.
        I believe that the one who guards the sheep from the thief is not a hired hand, but is shown to be a disciple of Christ; and the one who flees is a hired hand; the one who does not abandon them is a shepherd.
        The one who lays down his life lives; the one who seeks to save it loses it.
        For what else did the Master and Lord do except not abandon the deserters; or the Lamb, except defend the lamb, so that a holy victim could be completed for the sheep?
        But about to enter the gate of sufferings, after presenting various reasons, I will not claim or steal foreign praise: for wanting what belongs to others is not a martyr's trait; nor is deceit a priest's.
        I confess myself unable to relate these things by pursuing them, and in this, I will speak of lesser matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the banner of the devil's rites, which, as we mentioned, was an indication of the glory soon to come, one night passed before he ascended to the crown.
        For at dawn, when the shadow of the sky suddenly receded, an unexpected but conspired hand was gathered, armed with pre-burnt stakes and axes, and what the devil's anger had made as a weapon; and there, some deacons found in the church, singing the morning hymn, suffered a vast devastation, a savage plundering: everything sacred and divine mysteries were profaned; ultimately, religion became a spoil.
        Let no one think this was a common struggle, as either insensible idols were torn down by sensible people, or masses of stones were moved with their millers; so you would be uncertain about the worshipper and the object of worship, whom you would judge harsher.
        Christ, the rock, was harassed in all these things, the cornerstone was rejected by the nations, to be approved again; he would build with his blood a rising ruin.
        In these events, faith had its spectacle.
        The body of deacon Sisinnius was held on a bed, pierced and wounded by previous injuries, when he was either ordered to recall a sheep for sacrifice or to become a victim himself unless he consented to the deadly sacrifices; struck by the trumpet that sounded the devil's song, not without reason as he had first introduced the sound of faith: he was cut down by axes, defending the axe from the barren tree of paganism.
        And not to prolong this further, confirmed; he was found in the quiet of the bed as we said, confessing, I believe, so that by private mystery he might reach the cross sooner, freeing the paralyzed people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through wood, the lector Martyrius was also bound with ropes: the confessor similarly and the asserter of his name; who first sang a new song, and now alone in a foreign land; among the loud and horrid pastoral shouts, already then giving praises to God with sweet eloquence, as I mentioned earlier; and he had provided healing or remedies to deacon Sisinnius, to heal pains, even though he was to receive wounds; recalling the fleeing soul with excellent drafts, not to the body, but to suffering.
        But the saint, now destined for the journey of martyrdom to Christ, refused water to drink, because the wine of suffering had come, which he had mixed with the cup of true life flowing.
        In this care, he was found, always concerned for the sanctity of souls, not born for himself alone, nor certainly to live for himself alone, he withdrew to the secret place of the garden which was contiguous, that is, he did not leave the church.

  Just as you know well, the church garden, planted with the hedges of commandments of the living. He did not bring in a body that he was unwilling to deny, nor did he take up the boldness of recklessness, but the confidence of piety. As is said in African regions, those who arm themselves for a voluntary funeral, which they do without fear, surround themselves with pride. The future martyr stood, captured, free; fearless, confessed; giving thanks, wounded; injured in body, secure in mind, with his head cut off, deprived of baptism, washed in blood. No one deserved to follow him who was thought to flee, where religion is vain and similar to fear to have withdrawn, but the captured righteous confession showed that he stood only to conquer; he withdrew so that even the persecutor would perish in his glory. From the garden where he had fled, Martyrius is brought. This kind of withdrawal is a mystery, so that the purple flower would be dyed in deserving places, preceding a new martyr; or among the whitening lilies through the baptism of all the drenched locks planted with a recurring death, the silent will of life would be dictated. Pierced even by spears, he was led to the idol: but he deserved to be a victim before he reached the altar of the devil.

  The third crown, to honor Alexander, of the Lord is also completed. He found a familiar way, who was watching at the doors of Christ; with him as the keeper, the veil of the temple tore open the hidden hearts of the Gentiles. Sought diligently by the multitude, because he was well known for his zeal of faith, captured, but not made captive; fear, he did not fear. The disciple of Christ was often mocked, and in this, the greater labor in the martyrial torments made the punishment more lively: and thus to compensate for dignity with the excess of passion, he deserved by lot that nothing in the three was inferior. For in the others, fury did not delay the torments; a slow punishment preserved him in the Lord: he felt that he knew what he endured, as a spectator of his own body: and although the inflicted wounds delayed the aforementioned deacon from becoming a martyr, the torments exhibited him as a keeper. Bound and tied bodies, and dragged through the public like dogs, but not to return to vomit, Alexander was led alive among them with bound feet, to leave part of his trembling limbs on the rocks, until he was led to the end of life, I say. After this, they went to the religious heights, that is, the high temples of God; after the bodies, laid on the ground, the peaks, made into pyres with sacred beams, in the presence of Saturn, an ancient idol with a long history. With the twin brothers' bodies sent into the fire first, wounded Alexander stood, to confess again; to whom the reward of life was proposed, that he would lack life; if he wants to escape the present flame, he should say he agreed with their darkness. But for him, looking askance and rejecting the gifts of the impious, light was before his eyes against the light; fear of punishment prevented the punishment: the heat of faith repelled the flame: the order of reverence also held the steps of the passion. He is received last: but he is not crowned as the least among the brothers. It has been fulfilled, brothers, in the three ministers, now truly in the feast of heavenly joy, the mystery of the Trinity; when others could also suffer as a living sacrifice, with a similar lot, unless all were considered perfected by the number three. For we were not a small part among these: and we are blamed by the nations because of them; nor did we abandon the companions: but the rank has a choice.

  Many things moreover, in the days approaching the passion, were not so much shown as depicted in truth, which we leave out for brevity; so that through these few events that happened, we may more fully teach the mysteries. If, however, you kindly read over what has been said with patience, from the very cradle of the region indeed, Sisinnius was a Cappadocian by race or a Greek, once among you of the first blood; swift in faith, magnanimous in spirit, prodigal of labor, persevering in all things, not late in concluding his race with a palm, coming in the seventh lot of promise, always joined by the bond of charity, agreeing in peace, holding the reins of divine discipline, the tamer of such a great people, a witness of Christ; finally of the future flock or of the same blood (as is customary...

        The day also revealed the horror of the passion, not just dim, but deprived. For the light of Friday had come forth, always friendly to martyrs after God: reverently holding a part of the Lord's body, through the holy students, it served the servants of God, although envy competing with the fate of religion was to come.

        Thus, the Lord asserts Himself in His works; thus, He presents Himself as a companion in everything, so that He is joined in equality and time. I confess, I was a witness among these mysteries, and a guard at the ashes of the saints. Although I was not worthy to be a participant, I felt what I could not reach. I saw, and even today I can barely believe myself: the deeds surpass the reverence related by words. Hence, it will be God's task, brother, to assert what He has chosen, and to give testimony to the witness.
