To the holy and venerable Father, above all good things, Simplicianus, Vigilius, bishop of the Church of Trent, sends greetings.

The mention of the Martyrs should commend not the words, but their merits. It would be better to pass over their steadfastness in silence, as their virtue has been proven. Nevertheless, piety compels me to recount the causes, places, and battles of their martyrdom. With trembling sorrow, I couldn't remain silent, for the lamp cannot be hidden under a bushel, nor the voice of holy blood be silenced.

After many trials of patience and diligent battles, a recent act of treachery was added. The ministers in the newly founded churches were harassed and attained the titles of martyrdom. Ready for anything, they endured everything willingly, giving no one an occasion. Through their devotion, they deserved glory.

To summarize their lives, they were diligent in their care and singular in their purpose. Free from the bond of marriage, they presented their pure souls to God as holy sacrifices.

In short, Sisinnius brought the new peace of the Christian name to a barbarian nation, maintaining it for many years. He avoided polluted hospitality, like Lot in Sodom, preserving his religion with great fear. Although among wolves, he sought the fold he first founded in that region, generously with the vows of little faith. If you recall, he deserved to be an elder by age and merit.

Martyrius, a reader, supported Sisinnius and was commended by his name. After his military service, he became a catechumen and then a reader. He cast aside his military belt, rejected his carnal family, and understood he had received the grace of true light from God. As a reader, he brought divine praise to a region deaf to it. Always attentive to spiritual works and weary with continuous fasts, he was a teacher anxious to win souls. He spent a short time but earned a great reward, believed to be rightly given as a crown.

Why should I recount the souls he liberated, bringing them to the bosom of Abraham, from the cruel death condemned by superstitious days? He, withdrawn from maternal care, sought fitting affection for his mother, intending to declare the resurrection.

Alexander, the brother of Martyrius by blood, completed the sacrifice of the trinity as the third, opening the gate of confession. For the sake of God, he left his homeland and parents. He was a faithful companion in trials, magnanimous in faith, and inclined to compassion. They were not to be preferred to each other, except perhaps as was appropriate.

The disdain is alleviated if you willingly admit this to your ears. The smoky gentility, against the heat of faith, inflamed with the zeal of the devil's fury. The slow kindling serpent, devoted to the poverty of faith, set up the tabernacle of the church.

It was just that he forbade offerings to the devil from a Christian home and prohibited the banner of deadly sacrifice to be carried before the banner of the Passion. A band, invited under one reward, flocked to blood. In the morning hours, finding him exhausted from the previous day's wounds, they buried him in deserved rest.

The reader, never idle, served in the pre-dawn ministry, and the deacon assisted in the sacrifice. Martyrdom wounds were remembered. The work they were caught doing, they completed.

The reader withdrew to the garden, was captured, and planted the tree of his life from the root. The doorkeeper was also involved in the suffering, caught in a lodging. Although he did not offer his soul, he did not deny it either.

All of them, gathered together, were dragged for a while and breathed their last for God. Two bodies were carried away lifeless; the third, whose life was more tenacious, felt a harsher punishment, seeing his own funeral while still alive.

A pyre was prepared from the sacred beams of the church, and this flame covered the martyrs. With respectful devotion, we think a basilica should be built at the place where they earned their glorious testimony of faith.

Now, comfort me, undeserving as I am, with fatherly love, and approach the saints with the same prayer, so that on that day I may touch the hem of either the priests or the martyrs, setting aside all my sins.

We greet your holiness with special service. Please, deign to commend my sorrow to the Lord.

Written by another hand, I could not deny what was in us. It might be made more glorious by the merit of the recipient, not by the grace of the giver.

The day of the saints' suffering was on the twenty-ninth of May, on a Friday, at dawn.
