1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,664
Two Privileges of Pope Anastasius the Third

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:07,896
Privilege for the Church of Vercelli. (Year 912.)

3
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:16,346
ANASTASIUS, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the most reverent and holy RAGEMBERTO, bishop of the holy Church of Vercelli, for the days of his life only.

4
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:24,797
Just as shepherds of sheep brave the cold and heat to protect their flock day and night, ensuring none are lost or taken by wild beasts, they remain ever watchful.

5
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:32,782
How much more effort and care should we, as shepherds of souls, dedicate to being vigilant and attentive, fulfilling our duty to protect the Lord's flock?

6
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:42,114
So that on the day of divine judgment, we are not punished for negligence before the supreme Shepherd due to our carelessness, which now brings us honor and elevation among others!

7
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:49,943
We grant your holiness the pallium to celebrate the solemnities of the masses, which we bestow upon you without altering the privileges of your Church.

8
00:00:49,943 --> 00:01:10,215
Use it only on the day of the holy venerable Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, on the birthdays of the holy apostles, on Saint John, on the Assumption of the blessed mother of God Mary, on the day of the birth of our Lord, on the solemnity of your Church, and on the anniversary of your ordination, as was done by our predecessor, Lord Gregory, the presiding bishop of this blessed see.

9
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:16,021
In the private chamber, your brotherhood should put on the pallium, then proceed to the solemnity of the masses.

10
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:25,768
Do not arrogate anything more to yourself with reckless presumption, for if something is improperly assumed in appearance, even those things that could have been done properly may be lost.

11
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:36,449
As the honor of this garment is to be preserved through modest actions, we encourage you to ensure that all ornaments are fitting, so that, with God as your guide, you may rightly and everywhere be notable.

12
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,222
Let your life be a guide for your children.

13
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:47,396
If they find any strength within themselves, let them channel it by watching and imitating you, always striving to improve by following your example.

14
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:50,633
After God, let your goodness be reflected in how they live.

15
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:55,516
Don't let temporary prosperity lift your heart too high, nor let adversity bring it down.

16
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,478
Whatever happens, face it with the virtue of patience.

17
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,508
Avoid hatred or indiscriminate favor.

18
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:06,542
Let the guilty recognize your strictness, and don't let false suggestions make you see the innocent as guilty.

19
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:12,028
Don't let grace excuse the guilty; avoid showing leniency to wrongdoers, so nothing goes unpunished.

20
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:16,143
Embody the sweetness of the good shepherd and the firmness of a true judge.

21
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:19,983
Support those who live innocently, and correct those who are restless.

22
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:25,414
Sometimes, the zeal of those in charge can turn correction into cruelty in an attempt to be strict.

23
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:32,162
Manage your anger with judgment, and use discipline to address faults without withdrawing your love from those you correct.

24
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:38,745
Show mercy to the poor as much as you can, defend the oppressed, and stand firm against those with different intentions.

25
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:42,914
Do not favor anyone over justice, and do not dismiss those seeking fairness.

26
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:50,265
Strive to uphold fairness, so the wealthy don't sway us from the right path, nor should the humility of the poor lead them to despair.

27
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:57,068
With God's mercy, aim to be the person sacred scripture instructs, saying: "A bishop must be blameless" (First Timothy 3:2).

28
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:02,992
You can use all these principles beneficially if love is your guide, ensuring you never stray from the path.

29
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:07,107
Behold, dearest, among many other things, these are the duties of a priest.

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,554
If you carefully maintain your cloaks and show that you've received them externally, you'll keep them internally as well.

31
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:24,137
May the Holy Trinity envelop you with its protective grace and guide you along the path of reverence, so that after the hardships of this life, we can together reach eternal joy.

32
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:29,790
This was written by John, secretary of the Holy Roman Church, in February during the fifteenth indiction.

33
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,274
Farewell.

34
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:45,456
Issued on February tenth by Theophylact, treasurer of the Holy Apostolic See, in the year of the pontificate of Lord Anastasius, the supreme pontiff, with God's favor, and of Scili Junior, Pope, from the most sacred seat of the blessed Peter the apostle, in the fifteenth indiction.

35
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:50,904
Privilege for the Church of Hamburg. (Year 912.)

36
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:59,060
Anastasius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the beloved brother Hoger, the venerable archbishop of the Church of Hamburg, eternal greetings.

37
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:07,649
It is fitting for the apostolic authority to assist those who excel in pious devotion with benevolent compassion and to eagerly support those who ask for help.

38
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:15,427
For from this, we undoubtedly earn the greatest reward from God when places of reverence, properly managed, are brought by us to a better state.

39
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:34,332
Therefore, because you asked us to confirm the entire archbishopric of Hamburg for you and your successors, as it was decreed by our predecessors Gregory and Nicholas of this apostolic see, we, moved by your prayers, grant and confirm by apostolic authority, with all things generally and specifically pertaining to that same mentioned archbishopric.

40
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:44,866
Namely, all things that your predecessors acquired through their efforts, or even those granted there by faithful Christians for the love of the eternal homeland, or that are still being granted.

41
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:58,154
Also, with those who at this time have been converted to the faith of Christ, encouraged and protected by the grace of God, namely bishops among all the peoples of the Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, Icelanders, Greenlanders, and all northern nations.

42
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:08,741
As well as in those parts of the Slavs, which are from the river Peene to the river Eider, so that they remain under the authority of you and your successors, archbishops of the Church of Hamburg.

43
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:16,897
Or whatever can be acquired by you, with the favor of divine grace, from the error of unbelief, whether of people or places, to the Christian religion.

44
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:23,325
We also send you the pallium, and we decree that its use be held perpetually and inviolably by you and your successors.

45
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:30,833
Furthermore, we have decreed that no archbishop, whether of Cologne or any other, should claim any authority in your diocese, and so forth.

46
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,696
We also allow your head to be adorned with a miter, a symbol of the Romans.

47
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:41,531
If anyone tries to oppose or violate this privilege of our authority in any way, let them be cursed.

48
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:46,665
But whoever observes it faithfully will receive grace and blessings from our Lord Jesus.

49
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:53,200
Issued by the hand of Adrian, secretary of the holy Roman Church, in the month of January, in the 8th indiction.
