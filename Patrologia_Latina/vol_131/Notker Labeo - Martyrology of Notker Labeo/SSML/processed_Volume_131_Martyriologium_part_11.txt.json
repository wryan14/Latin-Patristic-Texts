Finally, when Blessed Mary had completed her earthly life and was called from this world, all the apostles gathered from different regions at her home. Upon learning that she was to be taken from the world, they kept vigil with her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        And behold, the Lord Jesus came with His angels, took her soul, entrusted it to the archangel Michael, and departed. At dawn, the apostles lifted her body, placed it in a tomb, and watched over it, awaiting the arrival of the Lord. And behold, the Lord stood by them again, and He ordered the holy body, taken up in a cloud, to be carried to paradise. There, reunited with her soul, she rejoices with His chosen ones, enjoying eternal good without end.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Up to this point, Gregory. If anyone wonders how Gregory, situated in the West, learned of events that occurred in the East, they should recognize from his other writings that people from all over the world would gather at Saint Martin‚Äôs, much like they would with philosophers, and that holy places in Judea were often visited by those from the western parts of the world. This continued to be customary up until the times of the Norsemen.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        But lest the same Catholic and venerable Father seem to have thought against the Apostle, where he says: Christ has risen from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
