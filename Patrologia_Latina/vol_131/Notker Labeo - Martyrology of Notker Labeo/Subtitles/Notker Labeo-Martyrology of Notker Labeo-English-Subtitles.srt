1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,544
In the name of the Lord,
begins the martyrology for the year by our holy father Notker, known as the Stammerer, a monk of Saint Gall.

2
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:16,704
January. The month of January has 31 days, while the lunar cycle is 29 days.

3
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:30,199
January 1st marks the eighth day of the birth of the Lord, the day on which He was circumcised according to the law of Moses and received the name Jesus, as foretold by the angel before His conception, as mentioned in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2.

4
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:37,599
In Rome, it is the feast day of Saint Almachius, a martyr who was killed by gladiators on the order of Alipius, the prefect of the city.

5
00:00:37,599 --> 00:01:55,523
He declared, "Today is the eighth day of the Lord's birth, cease from idolatrous superstitions and polluted sacrifices."
Also in Rome, we remember Saint Martina, a virgin and martyr who suffered various tortures for her faith in Christ under Emperor Alexander, ultimately being struck down with a sword.
Through the Holy Spirit within her, she tamed a lion, destroyed idols through prayer, and converted many to the Christian faith.
In revenge for her, the emperor met his own end by harming himself.
On the same day, in the city of Spoleto in Tuscany, we commemorate the martyrdom of Saint Concordius, a Roman priest from the title of Pastor, who, during the reign of Emperor Antoninus, was sentenced to death by Count Torquatus for refusing to sacrifice to idols.
Also in Rome, on the Appian Way, we remember the martyrdom of Corona and thirty soldiers who were deemed worthy of martyrdom under Emperor Diocletian for confessing the Christian faith.
In the metropolis of Caesarea in Cappadocia, we honor the death of Saint Basil, a bishop known for writing the Rule for brothers and many other significant works.
Among his many miracles, he retrieved a contract a man had made with the devil, delayed his death for the conversion of Joseph the Hebrew, and even after his death, abolished the record of a certain heinous crime.
In Africa, we celebrate the feast day of Saint Fulgentius, bishop of the Church of Ruspe and confessor.

6
00:01:55,632 --> 00:02:02,894
During the Vandal persecution, he faced great hardship from the Arians because of his Catholic faith and remarkable teachings.

7
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:08,370
He was exiled to Sardinia for a long period but was eventually allowed to return to his church.

8
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:17,592
Distinguished by his life and words, he passed away peacefully in a holy manner, having served as a bishop for twenty-five years and lived for sixty-five years.

9
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:24,740
In Alexandria, Saint Euphrosyne, a virgin, was born to her once-barren mother through the prayers of her father, Paphnutius.

10
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,331
At a young age, she secretly cut her hair and chose a monastic life, adopting the name Smaragdus.

11
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:39,323
She lived in holiness for twenty-eight years, and sensing her death was near, she revealed herself to her father, who had been searching for her with tears.

12
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:43,761
Her name and life are celebrated among the Romans as a symbol of pure virtue.

13
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,239
January second—The Octave of Saint Stephen.

14
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,003
In Rome, Pope Telesphorus established that fasting should be observed for seven weeks before Easter.

15
00:02:52,003 --> 00:03:52,929
He decreed that Mass should be celebrated on the night of the Nativity of the Lord, and the angelic hymn, "Glory to God in the highest," should be sung. At all other times, no one should presume to celebrate Mass before the third hour, the time when the Lord was crucified. He was also crowned with martyrdom and buried next to the body of Saint Peter in the Vatican.
In Antioch, the abbot Macarius.
In Tomis, a city in Pontus, the three brothers Argeus, Narcissus, and Marcellinus, children. Also in Tomis, Bishop Philip, who, when captured under Caesar Licinius among the recruits, refused to serve as a soldier, was beaten to death, imprisoned for a long time, placed in a stock, and then drowned in the sea, thus achieving martyrdom. His body was washed ashore and laid to rest by religious men, shining with great virtues.
In Vienna, the passing of Blessed Florentius, bishop.
In the territory of Lyon, at the monastery of the Jura, Saint Eugendus, abbot, whose life was full of virtues and miracles.

16
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:59,473
In Rome, Pope Antherus, a martyr and the twentieth successor of Saint Peter, led the Church for 12 years.

17
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,629
He was dedicated to collecting the acts of the martyrs.

18
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:08,080
He suffered under Maximian and was laid to rest in the cemetery of Callistus on the Appian Way.

19
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:19,097
In Paris, Saint Genevieve, a virgin consecrated to Christ by Saint Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, became renowned for her exceptional virtues and miracles, dedicating 80 years to serving Christ.

20
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:21,277
January 2nd - Octave of the Innocents.

21
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:25,638
In Crete, we celebrate the birth of Saint Titus, a disciple of the apostles.

22
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:33,041
In Africa, we honor Saints Aquilinus, Geminus, Eugentius, Martian, Quintus, Theodotus, and Tryphon, the most illustrious martyrs.

23
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:43,828
On the same day in Rome, the holy martyrs Priest Priscus, Cleric Priscillian, and the devout woman Benedicta suffered martyrdom by the sword during the reign of the impious Emperor Julian.

24
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:54,100
Also in Rome, blessed Daphrosa, the wife of the martyr Fabian, was first exiled after her husband's condemnation and then ordered by the wicked Julian to be executed by beheading.

25
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,699
On the same day, the martyr Theogenes was martyred under the rule of Licinius Caesar through the tribune Licentius.

26
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:07,527
In Hellespont, he was first stretched between four columns and beaten with clubs, then sent to prison to die of hunger.

27
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:14,585
However, through the Lord's mercy, he was nourished with invisible food for 40 days and remained in constant praise of God.

28
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:17,569
Ultimately, he was thrown into the sea and martyred.

29
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:24,397
Eutychus, Eustochius, and Zoticus retrieved his body from the seashore and buried him in the marketplace of Hellespont.

30
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:37,710
On the same day, we remember the martyrdom of Peter, known as Balsamus, who was suspended and torn with claws under Emperor Maximian and the governor Severus, and finally struck down by the sword, being buried in the city of Aulona.

31
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,964
On the same day, we commemorate Lucian, a priest and martyr sent from Rome to preach the word of God in Gaul.

32
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:48,956
After converting many to Christ in those regions, he was beheaded under Emperor Julian.

33
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:51,538
Many miracles and healings occur at his tomb.

34
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:53,375
January 5th - Vigil of Epiphany.

35
00:05:54,408 --> 00:06:05,667
In Jerusalem, we commemorate the burial of Saint Simeon the prophet, who, through the revelation of the Holy Spirit, recognized the Lord Jesus Christ and took Him into his arms from His parents.

36
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:10,426
He prophesied not only about Him but also about His mother with a mystical speech.

37
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,297
Luke Chapter 2.

38
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:16,346
In Antioch, we remember the burial of Saint Simeon the monk, a man of admirable virtue.

39
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:21,454
At the age of thirteen, he renounced the world and sought the solitude of the monastery.

40
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:28,766
There, with remarkable abstinence, he allowed himself food only on the seventh day and learned the Psalms in just four months.

41
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:35,847
Then, with great focus on subduing his body, he tied a rope of palm fiber around his waist, causing himself severe wounds.

42
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:41,999
After that, he confined himself in a well, but was forcibly brought back to the monastery by his brothers.

43
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:46,178
Secretly fleeing, he sought the desert, where he stayed for a long time.

44
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:53,549
There, atop a high column, he fervently devoted himself to holiness, refusing to be seen by any woman, not even his own mother.

45
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:56,799
Even today, no woman enters the basilica of that column.

46
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:03,822
A certain woman, dressed in men's clothing, tried to enter, but as soon as she touched the threshold, she fell back dead.

47
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:10,728
In Africa, we commemorate Felix, Secundus, Honorius, Lucian, Candidus, Januarius, Telesphorus, Jocundus, and Anastasia.

48
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:15,546
On January sixth, we celebrate the Epiphany of the Lord, which means manifestation.

49
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:23,033
Among the Romans, this same feast is called Theophany, signifying the appearance of God, as shown by the composition of the name.

50
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:38,645
On this day, the magi, according to the prophecy of Balaam, whose successors they were, said: A star shall rise out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall strike the chiefs of Moab and destroy all the sons of Seth, and Edom shall be his possession.

51
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,748
Numbers Chapter 24.

52
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:44,565
And again: One from Jacob shall have dominion and destroy the remnants of the city.

53
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:51,374
When a previously unknown star appeared at the time of the Lord's birth, the wise men saw it in the East.

54
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:57,307
Upon reaching Jerusalem, they were guided by the prophecy of Micah to learn the location of Christ's birth.

55
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:04,017
Following the star to Bethlehem, they found the child Jesus with Mary, his mother, and worshiped him with mystical gifts.

56
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:12,446
It's believed that this was divinely inspired so that nearby nations could begin to understand the teachings of the Lord's birth and prophetic doctrine.

57
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:17,437
However, there is also a historical context and a temporary arrangement concerning Christ.

58
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:26,420
This was so the leaders of Moab could gain favor with the parents of the newly suspected king by offering gifts, which in turn assisted in their journey to Egypt.

59
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:34,460
The magi were not Chaldeans, Indians, or Persians, as some suggest, nor did they come to worship him in the second or third year after his birth.

60
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,063
Rather, they were Moabites, Ammonites, or Midianites, as confirmed by Saint Jerome.

61
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:50,209
On the thirteenth day after his birth, they found him not exalted in Jerusalem as they expected, but humble in Bethlehem, and they were deemed worthy to receive spiritual reward through their devotion.

62
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,148
On the same day, Saint Macra, a virgin, was martyred.

63
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:58,638
When Governor Ricovarus ordered her to be tortured and thrown into the fire, she remained unharmed.

64
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:04,904
Despite having her breasts cut off and being tormented in prison, she was rolled over sharp shards and hot coals.

65
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:07,177
She prayed and then departed to the Lord.

66
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:11,780
In Africa, Florus, Jocundus, Peter, Marcus, Acutius, and Januaria are commemorated.

67
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,998
In Syria, Saint Anastasia is remembered.

68
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:20,153
The birth and ordination as bishop of Medonis and the passing of Saint Melani, bishop and confessor, are noted.

69
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:24,201
His body was found unharmed, with a cloth placed over it amid the flames.

70
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,473
January 7th marks the return of the child Jesus from Egypt.

71
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:33,017
Today, we remember Saint Lucian, a priest and martyr from the Church of Antioch.

72
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:39,748
Known for his wisdom and eloquence, he was martyred in Nicomedia for his faith in Christ, being cut into four pieces.

73
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:42,854
Each piece was tied to stones and thrown into the sea.

74
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:50,850
Miraculously, the next day, his entire body, along with the stones, was found at Helenopolis in Bithynia and was given an honorable burial.

75
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,041
The city, originally called Drepana, was later rebuilt by Emperor Constantine and renamed Helenopolis in honor of his mother.

76
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:04,829
In Antioch, we also honor the blessed martyr Clerus, a deacon who endured torture seven times for his faith in Christ.

77
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,683
After suffering long in prison, he achieved martyrdom by beheading.

78
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:13,803
We also remember the martyrdom of Saint Fausta, a virgin during Emperor Maximian's reign.

79
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:20,821
Her patience and faith converted her torturer, Evilasius, a palace officer, as well as the prefect ordered to torture her.

80
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:26,228
She was first suspended and torn with tools, then thrown to beasts, but they did not harm her.

81
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:28,069
Nails were driven into her head.

82
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,866
Then, she was thrown into a boiling tar pan but remained unharmed.

83
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:36,295
Ultimately, along with Evilasius and the prefect, she surrendered her spirit.

84
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:40,609
Hearing of this, the Christian community buried the bodies of these saints.

85
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:44,348
On January 8th, we commemorate Poliectes and Palladius in Greece.

86
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:53,380
In Naples, Campania, we celebrate the birth of Saint Severinus, a bishop and confessor, and the brother of the blessed Victorinus, renowned for his miracles.

87
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,982
After living a life full of holiness and performing many virtues, he found rest.

88
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:02,469
He was buried where he had led a very abstinent life before becoming a bishop.

89
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,920
In Greece, we also remember Rusticus, Timothy, and Jocundus.

90
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,177
We honor the memory of Saint Lucian, a companion of the blessed Dionysius.

91
00:11:10,177 --> 00:11:11,730
We also remember Messianus.

92
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,261
In Metz, we commemorate Patient, the bishop.

93
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:21,222
On January 9th, in Mauretania, in the city of Caesarea, we remember the martyrdom of Saint Martiana, a virgin and martyr.

94
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:27,880
In Antioch, the feast of Saint Julian the martyr and Basilissa the virgin is celebrated on this day.

95
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:35,267
They were cherished by their wealthy parents and, being their only children, were reluctantly joined in marriage, but only in appearance.

96
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:39,365
They upheld a holy vow and remained together in virginity for several years.

97
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:49,178
With their wealth, they established numerous monasteries in the districts of Antioch, with Julian becoming the father of ten thousand monks, and Basilissa the mother of many virgins.

98
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:53,330
Basilissa sent them ahead to the kingdom of heaven and then followed herself.

99
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,972
Later, Julian was sought by the governor Martian.

100
00:11:55,972 --> 00:12:07,673
During this time, under Diocletian and Maximian, the persecution of the saints intensified, forcing many priests and ministers of the Church of Christ to seek refuge with Julian due to the severity of the persecution.

101
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:17,217
Captured with this vast multitude, Julian awaited the governor's hearing, while the other servants of God were consumed by fire on the spot, by the order of the ruthless leader.

102
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:22,933
In their honor, choirs singing to God were reportedly heard at the third, sixth, ninth, and evening hours.

103
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:25,575
Blessed Julian was first beaten with harsh clubs.

104
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:32,315
During the beating, an official necessary to the governor lost an eye, which he regained immediately through Julian's prayer.

105
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:36,089
Believing in Christ, he was promptly beheaded by the irrational judge.

106
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:42,182
Blessed Julian was then taken to the temple of demons, where about five hundred statues were shattered into dust.

107
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:46,765
For this, he was locked in a deep, dark prison with young Celsus, the governor's son.

108
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,486
However, they were granted a pleasant fragrance and miraculous light.

109
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:57,873
Seven brothers and twenty soldiers who visited them were first thrown into the fire, and then the soldiers were slaughtered by the sword.

110
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:07,633
Moreover, Julian, along with the boy Celsus, the priest Anthony, and Anastasius, suffered various torments, and they, along with the matron Marcionilla, were killed by the soldiers.

111
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:08,962
January.

112
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:16,952
This marks the birth of Blessed Nicanor, one of the first seven deacons, who was gloriously crowned in Cyprus and honorably buried there.

113
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:20,277
In the Thebaid, we remember Saint Paul, the first hermit.

114
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:25,234
He lived in solitude in the desert from the age of sixteen until he was ninety-three.

115
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:31,242
Anthony witnessed his soul being carried to heaven by angels among the choirs of apostles and prophets.

116
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:36,724
In Rome, Bishop Melchiades decreed that the faithful should not fast on Sundays in the Church.

117
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:40,865
Pope Hyginus organized the clergy and distributed ecclesiastical ranks.

118
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:41,856
January eleventh.

119
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:50,488
This day marks the departure of the Lord from Egypt, celebrated by some on January ninth and by others on January fifth, due to the lengthy journey.

120
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:54,746
In Alexandria, we honor the holy confessors, Peter, Severus, and Leucius.

121
00:13:54,746 --> 00:14:01,861
In Africa, we commemorate Saint Salvius the martyr, on whose feast day Saint Augustine preached to the people of Carthage.

122
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,794
January twelfth.

123
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,661
In Achaia, we remember Cyriacus.

124
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,527
In Egypt, Philoromus is honored.

125
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:18,308
In Arabia, Saturus, who, upon passing by a temple of an idol, blew upon it and made the sign of the cross on himself, causing it to fall immediately; for this reason, he was beheaded by the local judge.

126
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:24,549
On this same day, we celebrate the birth of Saint Arcadius the martyr, famous for his lineage and miracles.

127
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,657
January thirteenth.

128
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,232
The octave of the Epiphany.

129
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:33,239
In Rome, on the Lavican Way, we remember Secundina, Corona, and forty soldiers under Emperor Gallienus.

130
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:43,971
In Poitiers, we commemorate the burial of Saint Hilary, bishop and confessor, who, under the heretical Emperor Constantius, was exiled for four years in Phrygia for the Catholic faith.

131
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:48,345
Among his other virtues, it is said that he raised the dead through prayer.

132
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,453
January fourteenth.

133
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:56,510
In Antioch, we remember Glycerius the deacon, one of the ancients, who suffered many torments and was drowned in the sea.

134
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,009
In Campania, in the city of Nola, we honor Felix the priest.

135
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:09,808
During persecution, his bishop, Maximus, fled to the desert in fear, and blessed Felix was captured, bound in chains, brought before the governor, and beaten with rods.

136
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:22,410
Then, tortured on the rack, chained in prison, and placed on screws and shards: at night, an angel of the Lord broke the chains and split the beam that held his feet, instructing him to seek out his priest.

137
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:31,927
When he finally found him, the priest was burdened with age, weakened by hunger, stiff from the cold, with closed eyes and clenched teeth, barely alive and scarcely breathing.

138
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:37,256
He had nothing to offer the old man, but suddenly, he marveled at a grape hanging from the bushes.

139
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:46,120
He squeezed it into the mouth of the confessor, reviving him, and carried him on his shoulders to the city, where he secretly fed him under the shelter of a widow.

140
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,960
Then, captured and sent into exile, he converted many there through the display of signs.

141
00:15:50,960 --> 00:16:01,945
Returning later, when sought again for torture, he was hidden by divine providence and stood out gloriously in Nola for his many virtues, so much so that all the people asked for him to be their bishop.

142
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:12,223
He did not consent, but with another appointed in his place, he nonetheless continued in the service of God for 12 years and, having completed the mysteries on a Sunday, departed to Christ.

143
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:16,029
He was buried not far from the city of Nola, in a place called Pincis.

144
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:23,207
In the city of Spoleto, the birth of Pontianus the martyr, who suffered during the time of Emperor Antoninus under the judge Fabian.

145
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:28,102
When he refused to sacrifice to idols, he was ordered to be beaten very cruelly with rods.

146
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:33,159
Then he was made to walk barefoot over burning coals, and later, two lions were set upon him.

147
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:39,902
When they did not harm him, he was poured over with molten lead; and when he was not harmed by this either, he was beheaded.

148
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:52,301
On the 15th of January in Palestine, the burial of the prophet Habakkuk, whose remains, along with the bones of the prophet Micah, were found through the Lord's revelation during the reign of Arcadius and Honorius, the emperors.

149
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:56,380
Also, the commemoration of Macarius the abbot, a disciple of Saint Anthony.

150
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,458
Also, the blessed Isidore, renowned for his holy life, faith, and miracles.

151
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:06,984
On the 16th of January in Rome, on the Via Salaria, in the cemetery of Priscilla, the birth of Saint Marcellus the Pope.

152
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:17,932
He established cemeteries along the Salaria Road and set up twenty-five locations in Rome for baptism and repentance, aimed at those converting from paganism, and for the burial of martyrs.

153
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:24,419
By order of Emperor Maximian, he was first beaten with clubs and expelled from the emperor's presence after rebuking him.

154
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:40,019
When Maximian learned that the house of Saint Lucina, which he had confiscated because she had given her property to Christians, was being used to create a church and hold Masses, he ordered boards to be laid in the middle of the city, in the same church, for animals from the public stable.

155
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,396
He assigned the bishop to serve the animals under public watch.

156
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:51,974
After many years of serving there, dressed in rough garments, he died and was buried with spices by Priest John and Blessed Lucina in the cemetery of Priscilla.

157
00:17:51,974 --> 00:18:02,213
In Arles, there is Saint Honoratus, a bishop and confessor who, among other miracles, is said to have driven a dragon from the island of Hilarina through prayer and founded a monastery there.

158
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:06,770
In the region of Mandensis, at the Perona monastery, we have Saint Fursey of Ireland.

159
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:15,669
Taken from this world, he witnessed many wonders and, upon returning, shared these amazing experiences with others before ultimately passing away in severe austerity.

160
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,494
On January 17th, in Egypt, at Thebaid, we remember the burial of Blessed Anthony the monk.

161
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:28,053
Though he had no formal education, he is said to have memorized the divine Scriptures by listening and understood them through wise thinking.

162
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:36,953
His life was unparalleled, marked by miracles from childhood to old age, and he left behind many disciples of his holiness, celebrated throughout the Christian world.

163
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:44,565
He died peacefully under Emperor Constantine at the age of 105 and was buried in the desert by his disciples, as he had instructed, in secret.

164
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:52,660
His body was later found by divine revelation under Emperor Justinian and taken to Alexandria to be interred in the church of Blessed John the Baptist.

165
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:58,441
The birth of the holy twins Speusippus, Elasippus, and Melasippus took place in Lingonis.

166
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:06,639
At the age of twenty-five, they, along with their grandmother Leonilla, Jonilla, and Neon, were martyred during the reign of Emperor Aurelian.

167
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:15,298
The twins were hung on a single tree, their hands tied upwards and their feet downwards, stretched so much that it seemed their joints might separate.

168
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,339
They were then thrown into a fire but remained unharmed by the flames.

169
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:22,514
In prayer, they peacefully passed together to the Lord.

170
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:26,150
Jonilla, witnessing these events, declared her Christian faith.

171
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,134
She was seized by the crowd, hung by her hair, and tortured severely.

172
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:34,232
Refusing to renounce Christ, she and Leonilla were killed by the sword.

173
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:39,197
Neon, who documented these events, also confessed the name of Christ and was martyred.

174
00:19:39,197 --> 00:19:47,509
The priest Benignus, sent from the East by Blessed Polycarp, Bishop of Myra and a disciple of the Apostle John, taught and baptized these twins.

175
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:51,435
He traveled to Gaul with fellow priest Andochius and deacon Thyrsus.

176
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:54,783
The twins were buried two miles from the city of Lingonis.

177
00:19:54,783 --> 00:20:00,844
Turbon, who also chronicled the victories of those confessing the Lord, suffered martyrdom shortly after.

178
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:06,675
On January 18th, we remember the Chair of Saint Peter the Apostle, marking when he first sat in Rome.

179
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:13,140
Peter, the chief of the apostles, initially preached the Gospel in Jerusalem, Caesarea, and other Jewish cities.

180
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:20,299
Later, he was sent to preach to the Gentiles, arriving in Antioch where he established and led the Church for several years.

181
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:29,477
He then traveled to Rome in the second year of Claudius Caesar's reign, fervently preaching the Gospel and serving as bishop of the city for twenty-five years.

182
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:33,634
In Rome, we also honor the birth of Saint Prisca, the virgin and martyr.

183
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:41,715
In Pontus, we remember the holy martyrs Moses and Ammonius, who, as soldiers, were first sent to the mines and ultimately condemned to fire.

184
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:47,430
On January 19th, in Jerusalem, we commemorate the holy sisters Martha and Mary, sisters of Lazarus.

185
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,337
In Smyrna, we honor the holy martyr Germanicus, who was condemned to face the beasts.

186
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:56,147
In Africa, we remember the martyrs Paul, Quintus, and many others.

187
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,319
In Carthage, for Picaria, Pia, and thirty-eight others, on January 20th.

188
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:09,402
In Rome, Pope Fabian, who led the Church for twenty-five years, was martyred during Emperor Decius's reign and buried in the cemetery of Callixtus.

189
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:18,310
He organized the Church by dividing regions among deacons and appointed seven deacons to oversee notaries, ensuring the deeds of martyrs were properly documented.

190
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,279
He also commissioned many buildings in the cemeteries.

191
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:26,283
During his election, it's said that the Holy Spirit appeared to many in the form of a dove.

192
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:35,796
Also in Rome, on the same day, the birth of Saint Sebastian the martyr, who was so valued by Emperors Diocletian and Maximian that they gave him command of the first cohort.

193
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:44,099
When Diocletian discovered Sebastian was a Christian and couldn't sway him from his faith, he ordered him to be tied in a field as a target for arrows.

194
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,718
Shot by soldiers, Sebastian was left for dead, standing like a hedgehog with arrows.

195
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:53,392
However, at night, a woman named Irene came to retrieve his body and found him alive.

196
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:58,341
She took him home, cared for him, and once he recovered, he fortified many in their faith.

197
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:01,310
Sebastian then confronted the emperors, rebuking them.

198
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,534
Diocletian ordered him to be taken to the palace hippodrome and beaten with rods until he died.

199
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:43,596
His body was discarded in the main sewer, but he appeared in a dream to Saint Lucina, a noblewoman, telling her, "Near the circus, you'll find my body hanging on a hook. When you retrieve it, take me to the Catacombs and bury me in a crypt near the apostles' footsteps." That same night, she followed his instructions with her servants.
On the same day in Rome, the holy martyrs Marinus and Martha, along with their sons Audifax and Ambacuc, nobles from Persia, came to Rome to pray during Emperor Claudius's reign. After suffering beatings with clubs, the rack, fire, and having their hands cut off, Martha was drowned in a pool, and the others were beheaded.
January 21st.

200
00:22:44,256 --> 00:22:50,478
In Athens, Bishop Publius, who, after being shipwrecked with the Apostle Paul on an island, showed great kindness.

201
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:55,990
After healing his father of fever and dysentery, he was converted to Christ through Paul's preaching.

202
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:03,741
He grew so much in God's grace that he was ordained as a bishop for the Athenians by the Apostle himself and was later crowned with martyrdom.

203
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:11,328
In Rome, Saint Agnes, under the prefect of the city, Symphronius, refused to marry his son out of love for Christ and her vow of virginity.

204
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:18,641
She was taken to a brothel for humiliation and stripped, but her own hair covered her, and then she was clothed in a heavenly garment.

205
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:25,300
She revived the prefect's son, who had pursued her indecently and was strangled by the devil, through the power of prayer.

206
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,741
After this, she was cast into flames, which were extinguished due to her holiness, and then she was struck by a sword.

207
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:41,620
Later, she appeared to her parents among a multitude of virgins dressed in garments woven with gold, openly proclaiming the glory of God, which she enjoyed in the heavens, on earth.

208
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,060
In Spain, in the city of Tarragona, the birth of Saints Fructuosus, the bishop, and the deacons Augurius and Eulogius.

209
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:55,156
During the time of Emperor Gallienus, under the governor Aemilianus, they were first thrown into prison and then cast into flames.

210
00:23:55,156 --> 00:24:02,251
Their bonds were consumed, and with their hands spread in the form of a cross, they prayed to be burned, and they accomplished it.

211
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:09,292
Soon, some of the brothers and the governor's daughter, who was present, saw the souls of the saints ascending to heaven crowned.

212
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,131
At Troyes, the suffering of Saint Patroclus, martyr.

213
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:22,228
In Spain, the birth of Saint Vincent, deacon and martyr, who, with his bishop Saint Valerius, was taken in heavy chains from the city of Caesarea Augusta to Valencia by order of Dacian.

214
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:34,072
There he was long tormented by hunger and the filth of the prison, tortured with the rack and the horrendous tearing of claws, and burned for a long time on an iron bed, sprinkled with drops of fat and crackling salt.

215
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:41,277
After this, he was thrust into a most foul prison, with his legs stretched in a shackle, and thrown onto sharp fragments of pottery.

216
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:46,168
A great light appeared at night, and by God's power, the martyr was freed.

217
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:51,781
Among the angels, who visited him, he sang a hymn, leading even the prison guard to believe in Christ.

218
00:24:51,781 --> 00:25:01,302
When morning came, Datianus called for him and ordered that he be laid on a very soft bed so that, after a slight refreshment, he could be tortured more severely once again.

219
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,613
He returned his tireless spirit to Christ.

220
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:09,006
Then Datianus ordered his body to be thrown into the field to be exposed to wild beasts and birds.

221
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:16,050
However, a divinely sent raven was sent to guard him, keeping away other birds and driving off a fierce wolf from the holy body.

222
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,709
When Datianus heard of this, he ordered the body to be sewn into a sack and drowned in the sea with a heavy stone weight.

223
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:30,469
Yet, by God's power, he first floated on the waves, was carried to the shore, and was buried in the sands before the rowers reached the port.

224
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:39,109
Later, when the holy martyr revealed himself to a faithful old woman and the persecution subsided, Christians reverently took him and buried him in a church.

225
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:55,508
The birth of Saint Anastasius, a monk and martyr from Persia:
He endured many torments of prison, beatings, and chains in Caesarea of Palestine by the Persians and was ultimately afflicted with numerous punishments in Persia, finally being beheaded by their king Chosroes along with seventy others.

226
00:25:55,508 --> 00:26:41,185
His relics were first brought to a monastery in Jerusalem, then transferred to Rome, where they are venerated in the monastery of the blessed apostle Paul called "ad Aquas Salvias."
On the same day in Gaul, in the city of Ebredunum, the holy martyrs Vincent, Orontius, and Victor.

In February, we remember the birth of Saint Timothy, a disciple of Saint Paul the Apostle.

228
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,486
He was ordained as a bishop in Ephesus by the blessed Apostle and, after many struggles for Christ, passed away peacefully.

229
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:59,774
In the twentieth year, his body was moved to Constantinople, along with the relics of the blessed Andrew and Luke.

230
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:09,097
In Antioch, we honor Saint Babylas the bishop and three children, who glorified the Lord through his sufferings and tortures, bravely ending his glorious life in chains.

231
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:14,724
He was buried not far from the Castalian spring, silencing Apollo in the place famous for his oracles.

232
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:24,268
In Neocaesarea, we remember the holy martyrs Mardonius, Musonius, Eugene, and Marcellus, who were all given over to the fire, with their remains scattered in the Axum River.

233
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:30,832
On January twenty-fifth, in Rome, we commemorate the transfer of Saint Paul the Apostle and his conversion at Damascus.

234
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:34,639
Here, we also remember the birth of Saint Ananias, who baptized Paul.

235
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,231
Elsewhere, we honor Saint Proiectus the martyr.

236

238

On January twenty-sixth, we celebrate the birth of Saint Polycarp, a disciple of the blessed Apostle John.

239
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:55,491
He was ordained by John as bishop of Smyrna and became a leader of all Asia.

240
00:27:55,491 --> 00:28:04,372
During the reign of Marcus Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus, in the fourth persecution after Nero, he was brought to the flames by the proconsul in Smyrna.

241
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:11,765
The fire, however, curved like a vaulted ceiling, appearing like the sail of a wind-filled ship, standing over the body of the martyr.

242
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:16,840
The body did not appear as burning flesh but as if gold or silver were glowing in a furnace.

243
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,860
Those standing by perceived a fragrance like incense or the most precious burning ointment.

244
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:29,693
Finally, seeing that the fire could not consume the body, the executioners were ordered to pierce it with a dagger, which the fire had spared.

245
00:28:29,693 --> 00:28:33,831
When this was done, so much blood poured out that it extinguished the pyre.

246
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:40,020
Alongside twelve others from Philadelphia, they were martyred in the aforementioned city.

247
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:49,128
During this time, the remarkable athlete of Christ, Germanicus, willingly faced the beasts and embraced his fate, swiftly earning the crown of eternal life.

248
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:53,740
On the same day, the holy martyrs Theogenes and thirty-six others were honored.

249
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,703

251
00:29:04,366 --> 00:30:39,476
This day also marks the birth of Saint John, bishop of Constantinople, renowned for his exceptional teaching, earning him the name Chrysostom, meaning "golden mouth" in Latin.
Through his many struggles, he achieved eternal life.
We also honor Marius, abbot of the monastery of Badocensis, celebrated for his virtuous life.
In Bethlehem of Judah, we remember the passing of Paula, mother of Eustochium, a virgin dedicated to Christ.
Coming from a noble Roman senatorial family, she renounced worldly wealth, gave to the poor, and embraced the poverty of Christ, becoming the mother of a virginal monastery in that town, glorified on the Lord's nativity.
Saint Jerome, writing about her life, attests that she was crowned far beyond with martyrdom.
In response to her requests, he composed many works.
January 28th—The octave of Saint Agnes, or as some believe, her true birth.
In the city of Apollonia, we remember the martyrs Leucius, Thyrsus, and Gallinicus.

However, she successfully brought them back to Christ.

320

00:45:33,877 --> 00:45:36,715
After Blessed Timothy, he also served as bishop.

379
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:44,461
He was taken to Rome, where he was stoned for his faith in Christ and became the first martyr for Christ, later being buried there.

380
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:49,605
His body was eventually brought back to the place where he had been ordained as bishop.

381
00:45:49,605 --> 00:45:53,330
In Cumae, we commemorate the birth of Saint Juliana the virgin.

382
00:45:53,330 --> 00:46:02,140
During the time of Emperor Maximian, she was severely tortured by her father, Africanus, and then by the prefect Eleusius, to whom she was betrothed.

383
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:13,019
She endured being stripped, beaten with rods, hung by her hair, and having molten lead poured on her head, before being thrown back into prison, where she openly fought with the devil.

384
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:20,528
When summoned again, she overcame tortures involving wheels, fire, and a boiling pot, and completed her martyrdom by beheading.

385
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:26,263
She suffered in Nicomedia but was transferred to Campania shortly after, according to God's plan.

In the presence of Emperor Decius, he was struck with stones in his face, his hands outstretched, and his eyes raised to heaven, and he gave up his spirit, as written in the passion of Saint Lawrence.

398
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:36,270
Though of very noble birth, they were baptized by Blessed Gaius, the Roman pontiff, under the guidance of their brother Gabinius, a priest.

399
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:42,697
And afterward, they were arrested by the order of Diocletian, under the judge Julius.

400
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:51,237
Claudius, along with his wife and children, was sent into exile; then they were burned, offering to God the fragrant sacrifice of martyrdom.

401
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:53,921
Later, they were cast into the sea at Ostia.

402
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:58,557
Their remains were diligently sought by Christians and buried near the city.

In Tyre, a large and renowned city of Phoenicia, the blessed martyrs, whose number only God knows, suffered.

411
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:56,752
Ordered by Diocletian, Veturius, the military commander, killed them through various tortures.

412
00:48:56,752 --> 00:49:07,244
First, the martyrs of God were scourged all over their bodies; after this, they were handed over to beasts: lions, bears, leopards, and wild animals, even horses and bulls.

413
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,599
Their ferocity was further provoked with iron and fire.

414
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:14,991
But when none of the wild beasts harmed them, the fury turned to humans.

415
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:20,786
When they couldn't kill them with beasts, they even threw the bodies of the slain into the sea.

416
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:33,413
The leaders among them were Tyrannio and Sylvanus, bishops, who shortly afterward completed their martyrdom by the teeth of beasts; and Peleus and Linus, bishops, who were consumed by fire with many clerics.

417
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:36,341

418
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:40,977
On February 21st, in Sicily, seventy-four martyrs suffered under Diocletian.

In Nicomedia, we recall the birth of Saint Thecla, a virgin and disciple of Saint Paul the Apostle.

427
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:36,248
Under Emperor Nero, she was subjected to fire for the name of Christ but remained unharmed.

428
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:39,625
Later, she faced wild beasts and snakes without injury.

429
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:45,150
Ultimately, in Seleucia, she passed away peacefully, preserving her virginity and virtues.

430
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:53,315
In Rome, on the Tiburtine Way near Saint Lawrence, we remember Saint Concordia, who was martyred during the persecution under Decius.

433
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,540

In Palestine, we celebrate the birth of Saint Matthias the Apostle, chosen to replace Judas the traitor among the seventy disciples.

439
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:41,262
He preached the Gospel in Judea.

440
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:50,348
Additionally, we recognize the discovery of the head of the Lord’s forerunner during Prince Marcian's time, revealed by the forerunner to two monks.

441
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:56,395
It's known that he was beheaded as the Easter festival approached, as the Gospel indicates.

442
00:51:56,395 --> 00:52:01,638
The following year, when Easter came around again, the mystery of the Lord's Passion was fulfilled.

443
00:52:01,638 --> 00:52:06,881
In the Book of Sacraments, his birth is recorded as the fourth day before the Kalends of September.

444
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:18,215
In the Martyrology, marked with the names of Eusebius and Jerome, it states that on August 29, in the city of Emessa in the province of Phoenicia, Saint John the Baptist's birth is noted on the day he was beheaded.

445
00:52:18,215 --> 00:52:24,888
However, this refers not to the day of his beheading, but to the day his head was found in that city and placed in the church.

446
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:28,807
Two Eastern monks traveled to Jerusalem to worship and see the holy sites.

447
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:36,646
Through a revelation, the Lord's forerunner instructed them to go to the former dwelling of King Herod, find his head there, and bury it with honor.

448
00:52:36,646 --> 00:52:43,054
Malicious women had kept it in their room, separated from the body, so it couldn't accuse them of their wickedness again.

449
00:52:43,054 --> 00:52:47,079
The head was found and taken by the mentioned brothers through divine grace.

450
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:54,070
However, it was taken by their companions and passed from place to place, and from person to person, until it was brought to Emessa.

451
00:52:54,070 --> 00:53:03,603
It was ignobly stored in a cave in an urn under the ground for some time until it revealed itself again to a religious priest named Marcellus, while he was living in the same cave.

452
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:10,594
From that time, the beheading of the blessed Forerunner began to be celebrated in that city on the day his head was found or raised.

453
00:53:10,594 --> 00:53:18,220
Elsewhere, the finding of his head is celebrated on September 24, the day he is said to have been conceived, but some celebrate it on August 29.

454
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:26,959
He was beheaded in a castle in Arabia called Machaerus, and his body was buried in the city of Samaria, now known as Sebaste, while the head was buried in Jerusalem.

455
00:53:27,648 --> 00:53:31,647
Over time, his bones were moved to Jerusalem and then to Alexandria.

456
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:35,234
They are now housed there in a church dedicated to his honor.

457
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:43,939
Additionally, his head was taken from Edessa to Constantinople by Emperor Theodosius and is now visited in a richly adorned church outside the city.

458
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:53,407
It's believed this was done by divine providence so that by distributing the relics of the blessed martyr to various places, many signs of virtue would manifest.

459
00:53:53,407 --> 00:54:03,288
Many people would be drawn to the faith and love he preached through the memory of his teachings and life, leading to conversions to the faith that justifies and saves.

460
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:04,640
Also, in Rome, Absalon.

461
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,640

463
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,992
In Nicomedia, the priest Lucian.

464
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:23,872
On February 25th, in Egypt, the saints Victor, Victorinus, Nichophorus, Claudian, Dioscorus, Serapion, and Papias were martyred during the reign of Emperor Numerian, under Duke Sabinus.

465
00:54:23,872 --> 00:54:29,694
Victor was placed in a hollow wooden ball with holes and pierced through each hole for a long time.

466
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:33,929
When too much blood flowed out, he was taken from the ball and beheaded.

467
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:41,751
Victorinus had his hands and feet cut off, was put into the same ball, endured the same torture, and was finally killed with a sword.

468
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:49,867
Nichophorus, who willingly entered the ball, was ordered by the judge, in anger, to be taken out and roasted on a gridiron with hot coals.

469
00:54:49,867 --> 00:54:56,101
When he persisted in his confession, he was taken from there and cut to pieces with a sword, passing away.

470
00:54:56,101 --> 00:55:03,276
Of the remaining four, Claudian and Dioscorus were burned with flames, while Serapion and Papias were killed with a sword.

471
00:55:03,276 --> 00:55:07,334

473
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:09,981
February 26th.

474
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,916
In the city of Perge in Pamphylia, the blessed Bishop Nestor was born.

475
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:23,832
During the persecution of Decius, while praying day and night for the protection of Christ's flock, he was captured by Irenarchus, the chief of the city council.

476
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:27,043
He was brought before Governor Pollio like a spotless ram.

477
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:37,344
When he boldly and eagerly confessed the name of Christ and declared the gods of the nations to be evil demons, the governor ordered him to be suspended on the rack and tortured cruelly.

478
00:55:37,344 --> 00:56:57,474
Joyfully, he sang, "I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth" from Psalm Thirty-Four.
Amazed by his endurance and trying to persuade him gently to abandon his faith, the governor asked, "Do you want to be with us, or with your Christ?"
Saint Nestor joyfully replied, "With my Christ, I was, I am, and I will be."
Angered, the governor sentenced him, declaring that anyone who confessed Jesus, crucified under Pontius Pilate, should suffer the same fate and be nailed to a cross.
Nestor encouraged the Christians present to remain steadfast in their faith and love for Christ and to suffer willingly so they might be glorified together.
He then asked the entire crowd of faithful to kneel and pray with him.
After finishing the prayer, and as everyone said, "Amen," he gave up his spirit.
He completed his martyrdom on the fifth day of the week, at the third hour.
On the same day, in Alexandria, the blessed Bishop Alexander, a venerable old man, removed Arius, his priest, corrupted by heretical impiety, from the Church. Later, Arius was condemned among three hundred and eight Fathers at the Council of Nicaea.
Also in Alexandria, Felix and his companions.
February Twenty-Seventh---In Seville, Spain, Saint Leander, a bishop, was born. The blessed Gregory wrote the books of Moralia for him.
Through his preaching and diligence, the entire Gothic nation was converted from Arian impiety by King Reccared.

479
00:56:57,695 --> 00:57:08,655
He also converted his brother, King Erminigild, from the Arian heresy to the Catholic faith while their heretic father was still alive, and through his encouragement, led him to glorious martyrdom.

480
00:57:08,655 --> 00:57:13,328
On the same day in Alexandria, the birth of Saint Julian the martyr is commemorated.

481
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:21,228
Despite being so constrained by gout that he could neither walk nor stand, he was brought on a small chair by those carrying him to the judge.

482
00:57:21,228 --> 00:57:28,738
One of them immediately renounced the faith, but another, named Eum, remained steadfast with the old man Julian in confessing the Lord.

483
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:37,640
They were ordered to be placed on camels and paraded around the city while being whipped, with the crowd surrounding them, until they succumbed to the beatings.

484
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,092
In Lyon, Saint Baldemer, a man of God, whose tomb is graced with frequent miracles, is remembered.

485
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:50,157
On the day before the Kalends of March—in Alexandria, the holy martyrs Celeris, Pupillus, Gaius, and Serapion are commemorated.

486
00:57:50,157 --> 00:58:01,506
In the verdant places of the territory of Lyon, the blessed Romanus, an abbot who was the first to lead a hermit life there and was renowned for many miracles and virtues, became the Father of many monks.

487
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,817
March has 31 days, including 30 lunar days.

488
00:58:05,817 --> 00:58:10,559
This month marks the first fast for the Ember Days.

489
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:18,588
On March 1st in Rome, 260 holy martyrs were condemned during the time of Claudius for bearing the name of Christ while working on the Via Salaria.

490
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:23,647
Claudius ordered them to be sent to a brick kiln outside the city walls at the Salaria Gate.

491
00:58:23,647 --> 00:58:27,717
Enclosed in the city's amphitheater, they were killed by soldiers' arrows.

492
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:37,945
In the same place, Pope Simplicius, who led the church in Rome for 15 years, condemned Acacius, the bishop of Constantinople, and Peter, the bishop of Alexandria, for following Eutyches.

493
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:40,475
Also, at Angers, Bishop Albinus is remembered.

494
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:47,514
On March 2nd in Rome, along the Via Latina, the martyrs Jovinus and Basileus suffered under the emperors Gallienus and Valerian.

495
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:54,003
On the same day, numerous martyrs suffered under Emperor Alexander, who, after long tortures, sentenced them to death.

496
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:59,722
March 3rd in Spain, in the city of Calahorra, marks the birth of the holy martyrs Emeterius and Celedon.

497
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:06,981
As soldiers in the city of León in Galicia, during a period of persecution, they endured many torments for confessing Christ's name.

498
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:10,775
They were brought to Calahorra, achieved martyrdom, and were crowned.

499
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:15,669
When their heads were severed by the executioner, a great miracle appeared to the people.

500
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:20,894
The ring of one and the scarf of the other were lifted by a cloud and carried into the heavens.

501
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:26,558
All present witnessed this, following the brightness of the gold and the whiteness of the linen in awe.

502
00:59:26,558 --> 00:59:29,527
Aureolus writes about this in the book of the crowned.

503
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:36,621
At Caesarea in Palestine, the holy martyrs Marinus the soldier, and Asterius the senator, suffered during Valerian's persecution.

504
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:46,575
Marinus was accused by fellow soldiers of being a Christian and, when asked by the judge, declared in a clear voice that he was a Christian, and was given three hours to deliberate.

505
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:54,222
After leaving the courts, he found great strength in his faith from the blessed Theotecnus, the bishop of the city.

506
00:59:54,222 --> 01:00:02,587
Returning to the judge's court, he boldly declared, "We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29) and was immediately martyred by beheading.

507
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:10,418
Asterius, mentioned earlier, honored the martyr by catching his headless body on his shoulders and spreading his garment beneath it.

508
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:12,850

His victory over the ancient serpent is still celebrated.

519
01:01:03,574 --> 01:01:11,999
When someone is bitten by a snake in that area, they touch the door of his basilica in faith, and the venom's power is nullified, saving them.

520
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:16,686

531

During the time of Emperor Licinius, Governor Agricolaus, and Duke Lysias, they were crowned with martyrdom for the name of Christ.

550
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:12,332
When Governor Agricolaus couldn't persuade them to worship idols, he ordered them to be buried with stones.

551
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:17,151
However, the executioners, striking each other with stones, couldn't harm the martyrs.

552
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:25,669
Duke Lysias, filled with anger, picked up a stone to strike one of the saints, but by God's wondrous will, the stone struck the governor's face instead.

553
01:04:25,669 --> 01:04:29,200
Enraged, he ordered the saints to be thrown into a frozen lake.

554
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:37,662
By divine will, the ice melted, and the frigid water turned as warm as a bath, so that, strengthened by the Holy Spirit, they burst into praise of God.

555
01:04:37,662 --> 01:04:44,387
One of them, becoming faint-hearted, fled to a nearby bathhouse, but as soon as he felt the heat, he collapsed and died.

556
01:04:44,387 --> 01:04:49,542
Meanwhile, as all who were assigned to guard them fell asleep, only the jailer stayed awake.

557
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:59,910
Hearing their prayers and seeing an immense light and the ice thawed, he looked around to see where the light came from and saw crowns descending upon the saints, numbering thirty-nine.

558
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:46,087
He began to wonder, "There are supposed to be forty; where is the crown for the last one?"
After confessing Christ, he jumped into the lake, completing the designated number.
In the morning, finding them unharmed, their captors broke their legs with clubs and burned their bodies, throwing them into the river.
However, by divine dispensation, their remains were revealed to religious men in the depths of the water and were buried with due honor.
In Nicomedia, the memory of Eunicus, Gorgonius, Firmus, and Agapitus is celebrated on March 12.
In Rome, the blessed memory of the pontiffs Gregory, the teacher, and apostle of the English, is commemorated.

He served as bishop for 13 years, 6 months, and 10 days.

559
01:05:46,704 --> 01:05:51,645
Similarly, there was Innocent, who led the Church for 15 years, 2 months, and 21 days.

560
01:05:51,645 --> 01:06:01,355
He issued a decree regarding the Church of God, condemning Pelagius and Coelestius as heretics, and established that anyone born to Christian parents should be baptized.

561
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:03,308
Pelagius, however, condemned this.

562
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:05,032
This was the work of Innocent.

563
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:10,490
Gregory indeed enhanced it, particularly in the Canon's prayer: arrange our days in your peace.

564
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:18,132
In Nicomedia, there was the blessed martyr Peter, one of the companions of Dorotheus and Gorgonius, who served in the king's chamber.

565
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:25,428
Under Diocletian's orders, he was tortured for speaking out against the torment of martyrs, being hung on the rack and whipped.

566
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:29,450
His skin was stripped away, and he was drenched with vinegar and salt.

567
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:38,815
Despite enduring such torture with strength and resolve, he was placed on a gridiron over coals, not to be burned quickly, but gradually, to prolong his suffering.

568
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:43,929
Thus, Peter was crowned with martyrdom, truly becoming an heir of Peter's faith and name.

569
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:51,111
Similarly, in Nicomedia, holy Egdunus the priest and seven others were suffocated on separate days to instill fear in others.

576
01:07:30,066 --> 01:07:34,375
Likewise, there was Zacharias the pontiff, who served in Rome for 10 years.

577
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:40,662
Here, in the residence of Blessed Gregory, a martyr, his head was found stored in a box.

578
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:44,463
Inside, there was also a document inscribed with Greek letters.

579
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:47,903

584
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:10,712
After piercing His side with a spear, he saw the earthquake and signs, believed in Christ, and repented.

585
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:18,979
He served Christ for 38 years, converting many to the faith, and eventually achieved martyrdom in Cappadocia under the governor Octavius.

586
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:24,289
Though initially struck with physical blindness, he was enlightened after his martyrdom.

587
01:08:24,289 --> 01:08:32,858
In Thessalonica, holy Matrona, a servant of a widow named Plautilla, secretly worshiped Christ and attended church daily with private prayers.

588
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:39,858
When discovered by her mistress, she was tied to a bench and whipped nearly to death, then left locked up overnight.

589
01:08:39,858 --> 01:08:44,504
The next day, she was found miraculously untied and praying with great grace.

590
01:08:44,504 --> 01:08:52,409
Again, she was tied and beaten until she was mute, left for three days, but found miraculously untied and praying on the third day.

591
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:58,503
Finally, she was beaten with sticks until she died, giving up her spirit in the confession of Christ.

On March 16th, in Rome, the martyr Cyriacus, ordained as a deacon by Blessed Pope Marcellus, performed many miracles with Sisinnius under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

596
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:24,994
He expelled demons from possessed bodies and, after enduring many severe tortures, was finally beheaded by the order of Maximian through Carpasian, the deputy.

597

604
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:08,656
She was a servant to a distinguished man named Tertullus and refused to take part in the feasts for his son's birthday, choosing instead to fast in the Christian way.

605
01:10:08,656 --> 01:10:11,380
For this, she was severely whipped by her master.

606
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:19,552
However, since she couldn't be turned away from her service to Christ back to idol worship, she was handed over to the public judge for punishment.

607
01:10:19,552 --> 01:10:25,334
When the executioners attempted to burn her, the prayers of the people granted her a three-day reprieve.

608
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:31,505
After those three days, just as they were about to punish her again, she was miraculously saved by God's mercy.

609
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:39,176
After she prayed to God, a large stone in front of her split in two, enveloping her completely and protecting her from her enemies' wrath.

610
01:10:39,176 --> 01:10:46,681
When the people were ordered by the leader to destroy the stone, a thunderbolt and lightning struck from the sky, killing many of them.

611

In total, two thousand seven hundred were destroyed by divine judgment, while the few who survived converted to the Lord and remained steadfast in the Christian faith.

613
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:09,546
It's famously told that on her birthday, an elderly woman recently entering the monastery wouldn't break her fast because of the upcoming Easter festival.

614
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:14,999
Her daughter, who went to draw water from the cloister's well, fell in and was pulled out dead.

615
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:23,093
Through the merits of the holy virgin, she was brought back to life, bringing joy not only to her mother but also to the entire congregation.

616
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:28,661

01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:40,487

619
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:47,662
It was revealed to Narcissus and many of his clergy that the next day a bishop would arrive to assist in the priestly duties.

620
01:11:47,662 --> 01:11:57,076
This prediction came true, and with everyone in Palestine gathered, especially with Narcissus's support, he took on the leadership of the Jerusalem church with him.

621
01:11:57,076 --> 01:12:07,007

628
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:37,546
Found by hunters under a tree covered in leaves during winter, he became well-known to the people through this fame and established a monastery.

629
01:12:37,546 --> 01:12:45,066
For forty-four years, he served as the Father of many servants of God, and resting in peace, he shone brightly with daily miracles.

01:13:34,008 --> 01:13:37,144
In Alexandria, Saint Serapion the monk was remembered.

641
01:13:37,144 --> 01:13:40,106
Also noted were Joseph, Volutianus, and Philocalus.

642
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:45,334
At the castle Cassinum of the city of Beneventum, Saint Benedict the abbot was celebrated.

643
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:51,665
His life, glorious with virtues and miracles, is detailed by the blessed Pope Gregory in the Dialogues books.

644
01:13:51,665 --> 01:13:57,067
He is also praised for writing the rule for monks with great discretion and clear expression.

645
01:13:57,067 --> 01:14:01,713
In the territory of Lyon, Saint Lupicinus, the abbot of the Virenses, was known.

646
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:12,284
He, along with his brother Romanus, after leading a very austere hermitic life from youth, became the founder of monasteries and a guide for souls, both being performers of miracles.

647
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:22,158
After many struggles against the devil and his angels, and after faithfully serving Christ for many years, they knew their labors were ending and their rewards were near.

648
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,689
Lupicinus decided that they should be buried together in a secluded monastery.

649
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:38,770
Romanus, being of a gentler nature, declined this out of compassion and, with charity preserved, asked to be buried at the entrance of the oratory for the benefit of the poor and especially women in distress.

650
01:14:39,815 --> 01:14:48,882
Initially, the body of Blessed Lupicinus started attracting visitors to the Laconense monastery in the Vesontian territory for reasons that were unclear.

651
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:49,416
March 22.

652
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:55,519
In the city of Narbonne, which gave its name to the region of Narbonensis in Gaul, Saint Paul was born.

653
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:59,727
The blessed apostles ordained him and sent him to the city as a bishop.

654
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:09,149
It's said that he was the same Sergius Paulus, the proconsul, a wise man, from whom the apostle Paul took his name after converting him to the faith of Christ.

655
01:15:09,149 --> 01:15:18,571
He diligently carried out his preaching duties in the region, became renowned for miracles, and was honored for his confession of Christ, and was buried there.

656
01:15:18,571 --> 01:15:20,823
In Africa, Saturninus and nine others.

657
01:15:20,823 --> 01:15:21,357
March 23.

658
01:15:21,357 --> 01:15:33,979
The holy martyrs Victorian, Frumentius, another Prumentius, and two brothers were all tortured with terrible punishments during the Vandal persecution under the Arian king Henry for their steadfast Catholic faith.

659
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:37,179
They were gloriously crowned in the regions of Africa.

660
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:39,668
Also in Africa, Fidelis and twenty others.

661
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,564
In Antioch, Theodore the priest.

662
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:43,697
In Caesarea, Achatius and Alexander.

663
01:15:43,697 --> 01:15:44,231
March 24.

664
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,127

In Mauretania, Secundulus, Verulus, Felix, Saturninus, and many others.

666
01:15:50,335 --> 01:15:52,468
In Rome, Saint Pigmenius the priest.

667
01:15:52,468 --> 01:15:57,564
He raised Julian the Apostate from childhood and also instructed him in holy writings.

668
01:15:57,564 --> 01:16:05,801
When Julian became emperor and turned away from piety, he learned that Pigmenius had buried the bodies of the holy martyrs he had executed.

669
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:10,957
He ordered Pigmenius, saying: Go where you wish, for your life will not be spared here.

670
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:12,912
Yet, I acknowledge your services.

671
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:15,046
Then Saint Pigmenius went to Persia.

672
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:23,579
After four months, he returned and, while climbing the Sacred Way with a boy asking for alms, he encountered Emperor Julian in a golden chariot.

673
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:29,979
Seeing Pigmenius from afar, Julian summoned him and said: Glory to my gods and goddesses, because I see you.

674
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:37,505
To this, Pigmenius, a man of God, immediately replied: Glory to my God Jesus Christ the Nazarene, crucified, because I see you.

675
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:44,683
At the command of an angry Julian, he was ordered to be thrown into the Tiber River from a bridge.

676
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:51,555
His body was later found, collected, and buried in the cemetery of Pontian, not far from the saints Abdon and Sennen.

677
01:16:51,555 --> 01:16:53,846
This event is commemorated on March 25.

678
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:58,368
In the city of Nazareth in Galilee, we remember the Annunciation of the Lord.

679
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:05,005
Outside the gate of Jerusalem, our Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, revealing many hidden truths of the prophets.

680
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:07,942
On Mount Moriah, we recall the sacrifice of Isaac.

681
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:16,164
Also in Jerusalem, the passion of Saint James, the brother of the Lord, who testified to Christ during the Passover celebration to the Jews.

682
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:20,452
He was thrown from the temple's pinnacle and struck with a fuller's club.

683
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:28,616
In Rome, Cyrenius, killed by Claudius and thrown into the Tiber, was found on the island of Lycaonia and buried in the cemetery of Pontian.

684
01:17:28,616 --> 01:17:31,611
This is recorded in the passion of Saint Valentine.

685
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:42,829
In Smyrna, we remember the birth of Saint Irenaeus, bishop, who, during the time of Emperor Maximian under the governor Probus, endured the harshest tortures and was imprisoned for many days.

686
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,415
He was eventually beheaded.

687
01:17:44,415 --> 01:17:46,118
This is observed on March 26.

688
01:17:46,118 --> 01:17:51,404
In Rome, on the Via Lavicana, in his cemetery, we commemorate the birth of Saint Castulus.

689
01:17:51,404 --> 01:17:57,042
As noted in the acts of Saint Sebastian, he was a notary of the palace and a host to the saints.

690
01:17:57,042 --> 01:18:00,038
Captured by persecutors, he was hanged three times.

691
01:18:00,038 --> 01:18:06,322
Persisting in his confession of the Lord, he was thrown into a pit, and a mass of sand was poured over him.

692
01:18:06,322 --> 01:18:09,788
Thus, he achieved the palm of martyrdom and went to Christ.

693
01:18:09,788 --> 01:18:16,953
On the same day, in the Pentapolis of Libya, we honor Bishop Theodore, Deacon Irenaeus, and Readers Serapion and Ammonius.

694
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:24,412
Also in Smyrna, the birth of Saint Montanus, a priest, who, along with his wife Maxima, was captured and thrown into the river.

01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:27,290
Their bodies were found nine miles from the city.

696
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,228
This is commemorated on March 27.

697
01:18:29,228 --> 01:18:33,281
In Jerusalem, we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Also, Donatus, Saturninus, and Martianus.

700
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:44,851
In Egypt, we honor the blessed John the Hermit, a man of admirable holiness.

701
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:55,699
Filled with a prophetic spirit, he not only performed many miracles but also foretold victories over the cruelty of tyrants to the most Christian Emperor Theodosius.

702
01:18:55,699 --> 01:19:02,237
On March 28th, in Caesarea of Palestine, we remember the birth of the holy martyrs Priscus, Malchus, and Alexander.

703
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:09,457
During the persecution by Valerian, while living on a small farm near the city, they were offered heavenly crowns of martyrdom.

704
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:17,018
Inspired by divine fervor for their faith, they voluntarily approached the judge to question his rage against the blood of the pious.

705
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:22,191
In response, he immediately sentenced them to be devoured by beasts for the name of Christ.

706
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:25,829
Also in Rome, there was Pope Sixtus, who served for eight years.

707
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:31,969
He personally buried his accuser Bassus, who died by divine will, using linens and spices, near Saint Peter.

708
01:19:31,969 --> 01:19:38,279
In Chalon-sur-Saône, King Cunderammi of the Franks was a religious man who dedicated himself to spiritual acts.

709
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:42,997
Abandoning worldly grandeur, he distributed his treasures to churches and the poor.

710
01:19:42,997 --> 01:19:47,545
On March 29th, in Nicomedia, we remember Pastor, Victorin, Saturnin, and Julian.

711
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:51,354
In Africa, the holy confessors Armogastus, Archimimus, and Satyrus.

712
01:19:51,354 --> 01:20:01,985
During the Vandalic persecution under the Arian King Geiseric, they were distinguished members of the Church of Christ and often criticized the errors of the Arians with Catholic freedom.

713
01:20:01,985 --> 01:20:08,522
They endured many severe punishments and insults for their confession of truth, completing their glorious struggle.

714
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:14,434
In Burgundy, we commemorate the burial of the blessed Eustasius, abbot and disciple of Saint Columbanus.

715
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:20,972
He was the father of nearly six hundred monks and shone with holiness of life, also becoming renowned for miracles.

716
01:20:20,972 --> 01:20:23,985
In the city of Pisa, we honor Saint Torpetis, martyr.

717
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:28,874
On March 30th, in Rome, we remember Quirinus, tribune and martyr under Emperor Trajan.

718
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:36,935
After following orders to imprison Blessed Pope Alexander and Prefect Hermes, a man's daughter developed a goiter around her neck.

719
01:20:36,935 --> 01:20:46,122
Hearing the prayers of Blessed Hermes and witnessing the miracles the Lord performed through martyrs Alexander and Hermes, he brought his daughter to them for healing.

720
01:20:46,122 --> 01:22:20,193
Blessed Alexander told him, "Take the collar from my neck and place it on her."
When the father did this, by divine will, she was immediately healed. Her name was Balbina.
Consequently, her father Quirinus, along with her, everyone in custody, and their entire household, were baptized.
When the clerk informed Judge Aurelian about this, Aurelian became angry and summoned Quirinus, saying, "I loved you like a son. Yet you mock me, deceived by Alexander."
Quirinus replied, "I have become a Christian. Do you want to kill me? Beat me? Burn me? I will not change. I made all those in prison become Christians, and they refused to leave."
Enraged, Aurelian had his tongue cut out and then hung him on a rack.
When Quirinus did not yield to Aurelian's torture, he ordered his hands and feet to be cut off, and then had him beheaded and thrown to the dogs.
However, Christians retrieved his body and buried it on the Appian Way in the cemetery of Praetextatus.
In the city of Thessalonica: Domninus, Philopolus, Achaicus, Palatinus.
Elsewhere: Victor, the virgin Aquilina.
Aurelian, the deposition of the holy Pastor.
On March thirty-first—in Rome, Saint Balbina the virgin, daughter of the martyr Quirinus.
She often kissed the collar of Blessed Alexander, through which she was healed, but was advised by him to stop kissing it and to seek out the chains of Blessed Peter and kiss them instead.
With great desire and effort, she found them and gave them to the most devout Saint Theodora, sister of Saint Hermes, the prefect and martyr.
Following Blessed Alexander's guidance, Balbina remained in virginity, full of good works. After overcoming the world, she was buried next to her father Quirinus, the martyr.

721
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:28,728
In Africa, we have the saints Anesius, Felix, Diodulus, Protus, Cornelius, and Valeria, along with their companions.

722
01:22:28,728 --> 01:22:35,807
April. The month of April has thirty days, with the new moon on the twenty-ninth.

723
01:22:35,807 --> 01:22:42,222
April first: In Rome, we remember the birth of the blessed Theodora, sister of the renowned martyr Hermes.

724
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:48,335
She was taught, baptized, and guided in the Christian faith by the blessed Pope and martyr Alexander.

725
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:55,052
She was martyred under the rule of Aurelian and laid to rest beside her brother on the Salaria Road, near Rome.

726
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:59,047
In Armenia, we honor Parthenius, Quintianus, Victor, and Secundus.

727
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:02,980
On this day, we also remember Saint Venantius, bishop and martyr.

728
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:09,819
In the Jumnoense region, we celebrate Saint Wiolaricus the confessor, whose tomb is famous for frequent miracles.

729
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:15,810
April second: At Caesarea in Cappadocia, we commemorate the martyrdom of Saint Theodosia, a virgin.

730
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:22,225
During the time of Diocletian, at the age of eighteen, she joined the holy confessors in prison willingly.

731
01:23:22,225 --> 01:23:31,606
Captured by Urban, the prefect, she endured torture on a rack, was burdened with iron, and thrown into prison, where by God's power, her bonds were broken.

732
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:41,289
She was then tied to a rock and cast into the sea but returned unharmed to the shore, and was thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheater, yet remained untouched.

733
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:43,770
She completed her martyrdom by beheading.

734
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:48,551
In Africa, we honor the birth of saints Amphianus, Victor, and fourteen others.

735
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:53,392
In Lyon, France, we remember the burial of Saint Nicetius, bishop and confessor.

736
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:58,779
His life was marked by miracles, and his precious death was also remarkable for miracles.

737
01:23:58,779 --> 01:24:04,952
April third: In Thessalonica, we remember the holy virgins Agape, Irene, and Chionia under Diocletian.

738
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:12,698
They were tormented in prison and thrown into the fire, yet remained unscathed after praying to God and surrendered their souls.

739
01:24:12,698 --> 01:24:17,237
In Scythia, in the city of Tomis, we remember saints Evagrius and Benignus.

740
01:24:17,237 --> 01:24:20,081
In Taurominium, Sicily, we honor Saint Pancras.

741
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:22,986

744
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:39,145
In Milan, we honor the burial of Blessed Ambrose, bishop and confessor.

745
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:49,329
Thanks to his dedication, among the many signs of teaching and miracles, all of Italy was converted to the Catholic faith during the time of the Arian heresy.

746
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:58,411
Appointed to this role by the grace of the office, while he was still a catechumen, he was chosen as bishop by a nursing child during the deposition of the albs.

747
01:24:58,411 --> 01:25:05,124
Guided by angelic suggestion, he spoke to his listeners, expelled demons, performed healings, and even raised the dead.

748
01:25:05,124 --> 01:25:12,119
By enduring all kinds of hardships, he truly earned the reputation of being an imitator of the ancient martyrs and apostles.

749
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:19,622
April 5th - In Thessalonica, the birth of Saint Irene, who, after enduring imprisonment, was struck by an arrow from Count Sisinnius.

750
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:23,401
Her sisters, Agape and Chionia, also became martyrs under his rule.

751
01:25:23,401 --> 01:25:29,550
All of them were imprisoned by Dulcitius, their predecessor, in a very dark cell filled with pots for baking.

752
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:36,038
Overcome with lust for them, he sneaked in at night, only to clumsily roll around with the pots, pans, and kettles.

753
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:43,371
Deprived of his disgraceful intentions by the holy virgins, he became abominable in the eyes of his servants and those around him.

754
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:54,992
Seeking revenge by approaching the imperial palace, he was instead expelled due to his intolerable filth, oblivious to his state with his eyes metaphorically closed, and was stripped of all remaining honor.

755
01:25:54,992 --> 01:25:58,546
In Egypt, the birth of Saints Martian, Nicanor, and Apollonius.

756
01:25:58,546 --> 01:26:01,310
In Caesarea of Lycia, the birth of Saint Amphian.

757
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:06,500
In Cilicia, the birth of Saints Tarachus, Andronicus, and Probus, who endured many torments.

758
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:16,034
After the third interrogation, their bodies were so severely mutilated that they couldn't walk and were carried by soldiers to the amphitheater to be devoured by beasts.

759
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:22,352
However, none of the beasts could be provoked by anyone, not even by the martyrs themselves, to harm the saints.

760
01:26:22,352 --> 01:26:28,049
Consequently, Maximus, the governor, ordered gladiators to kill the holy martyrs of God with a sword.

761
01:26:28,895 --> 01:26:36,355
After this happened, Maximus left the amphitheater, leaving behind ten soldiers to mix the bodies of the martyrs with those of the gladiators.

762
01:26:36,355 --> 01:26:42,816
Not long after, there was an earthquake accompanied by thunder, lightning, and a mighty storm with heavy rain pouring down.

763
01:26:42,816 --> 01:26:51,378
The guards fled in terror, and some religious brothers hiding nearby, guided by a star, found the bodies of the saints and hid them in a cave in a nearby mountain.

764
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:59,888
Although little is noted about their long history, it's fitting to recount the end of gladiatorial games on the occasion of those saints killed by the gladiators.

765
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:15,017
Among the many foolish and sacrilegious customs of the ancients, this one also mocked mortals: the more prominent among them seemed more distinguished if they sent well-fed men into the arena, who after killing either wicked people or even holy martyrs, cruelly perished by mutual wounds.

766
01:27:15,017 --> 01:27:26,311
This folly, which couldn’t be abolished even with the rise of Christianity due to its antiquity, was encountered by a monk from the East who came to Rome for prayer and unexpectedly ran into the gladiators fighting.

767
01:27:26,311 --> 01:27:32,667
Pitying them, he tried to stop the slaughter but was crushed by a shower of stones from the organizers of the spectacles.

768
01:27:32,667 --> 01:27:39,653
Because of his undeserved death, the devout emperor, driven by zeal for God, banned those ill-fated games from being held any longer.

769
01:27:39,653 --> 01:27:42,647
In Alexandria, of Saint Didymus the priest, on April 6th.

770
01:27:42,647 --> 01:27:50,212
In Rome, of Pope and martyr Sixtus, who led the Church for ten years, two months, and one day, and suffered during the reign of Emperor Hadrian.

While dressed in his philosopher's robe, he worked tirelessly for the Christian faith.

825
01:32:50,027 --> 01:32:57,468
He even presented a book against the pagans to Antoninus Pius, his sons, and the senate, unashamed of the cross's disgrace.

826
01:32:57,468 --> 01:33:09,931
Later, he presented a second book to the successors of Antoninus Pius, Antoninus Verus and Aurelius Commodus, defending our religion, and ultimately received the reward of martyrdom for his faithful speech.

835
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:26,492
When they ran out of food, the Lord guided a wealthy head of a household to ensure food was sent to his servants who were suffering from hunger.

836
01:34:26,492 --> 01:34:39,670
Although he didn't know where they lived, he was advised by wise friends to send seventy camels loaded with provisions into the desert without any human guidance, trusting that Almighty God would lead them wherever He wished through His providence.

837
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:45,303
The camels, taking a direct route, reached the dwelling of the holy men through remote and pathless areas.

838
01:34:45,303 --> 01:34:55,665
When the discerning Fronto saw them, he gave thanks to God and, avoiding greed, took half of everything for himself and his companions, sending the other half back to their owner with the camels.

839
01:34:55,665 --> 01:35:01,457
Astonished by the miracle and the benefit, he provided provisions to God's saints in the same way every year.

840
01:35:01,457 --> 01:35:06,665
Sustained by these and the help of other devout people, they continued devotedly in God's service.

846
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:41,471
Due to the envy and persecution of her fiancé and persecutor Aurelian, whom she had rejected for Christ, they were eventually handed over to Aurelian as servants by Emperor Nerva.

847
01:35:41,471 --> 01:35:48,433
Aurelian divided them among his estates as slaves, ordering them to dig the land during the day and eat meager food in the evening.

848
01:35:48,433 --> 01:35:57,891
When they converted many to the Christian faith and increased the number of believers, Aurelian, filled with rage by the devil, sent people to kill them through various tortures.

849
01:35:57,891 --> 01:36:02,515
Eutyches was ordered to be beaten in the middle of the road until he breathed his last.

850
01:36:02,515 --> 01:36:04,800

851
01:36:05,543 --> 01:36:12,729
Victorinus, at a place called Cotiliae where sulfurous waters flow, was hung upside down and tortured for three hours.

852
01:36:12,729 --> 01:36:17,905
After enduring this for three days in the name of Christ, he passed away to the Lord.

853
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:24,907
One day after his burial by order of Aurelian, Christians from Amiternum came and took his body to their territory.

854
01:36:24,907 --> 01:36:30,205
Aurelian also ordered Maron to be crushed by a large stone through his friend, Turgius.

855
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:34,407
However, under the Lord's protection, they could not harm him at all.

856
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:38,121
A consul, following Aurelian's orders, eventually killed him.

857
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:44,089
Christians then took his body and buried it with due honor in the city of Picenum on Mount Aureus.

867
01:37:57,648 --> 01:38:04,543

870
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:23,234
Taken to Rome under Emperor Hadrian, he was celebrated for his holy life and miraculous powers.

871
01:38:23,234 --> 01:38:33,377
Despite enduring a bed of burning iron, a grill over a fire, and a pan boiling with oil, pitch, and resin, he remained unharmed when thrown to lions, who were miraculously tamed.

875
01:38:49,903 --> 01:39:00,274
Nevertheless, by the senate's decree, he was beheaded for Christ, as an ancient law required that Christians brought to judgment could not be released without renouncing their faith.

She also inspired their fiancées, Theodora and Euphrosyne, to embrace the hope of eternal life and to remain steadfast in holy virginity.

887

01:40:31,924 --> 01:40:38,789
On the same day in Gaul, in the city of Évreux, Saint Marcellus, the first bishop and confessor of that city, was born.

When he was compelled by torture to sacrifice to idols and refused, he endured long suffering on the rack and was finally crushed with stones.

896
01:41:27,712 --> 01:41:34,693
In Alexandria, we honor the saints Fortunatus, Arator the priest, Felix, Silvius, and Vitalis, who found peace in prison.

01:42:13,893 --> 01:42:19,686
After all the others were killed before him, he was finally executed and attained the crown of martyrdom.

904
01:42:19,686 --> 01:42:27,796
This occurred on Good Friday of Holy Week, a time when the annual remembrance of Christ's Passion is observed before the feast of the Resurrection.

905
01:42:27,796 --> 01:42:39,106
Among those who suffered with him were Ustazadis, the king's caretaker and chief of the royal household, and the venerable elders Abdella and Ananias, as well as Pusitius, the chief of the royal craftsmen.

906
01:42:39,106 --> 01:43:44,260
When he saw the elder Ananias trembling under the sword, he confidently exclaimed, "Close your eyes for a moment, old man, and be assured, you will soon see the face of Christ." His daughter, a consecrated virgin, was also killed. This took place on the 22nd of April.
In Rome, on the Appian Way, at the cemetery of Callixtus, the birth of Saint Caius, the pope, is commemorated. Having led the Church for 11 years, 4 months, and 12 days, he was crowned with martyrdom under Emperor Diocletian. His brother, the blessed priest Gabinius, had already achieved his glorious triumph through many sufferings under the same wicked ruler on the 19th of February. He established that anyone deserving to become a bishop should first progress through all the ranks, beginning as a doorkeeper, and then serving as a reader, exorcist, subdeacon, deacon, and priest. He also wrote a very useful book on the Incarnation of the Lord.
Also mentioned is Pope Agapitus, who served in Rome for 11 months. He traveled to Constantinople to meet Emperor Justinian and deposed Anthimus, the bishop of Constantinople, who denied the two natures in Christ, and consecrated Menas, a Catholic, in his place.

907
01:43:44,592 --> 01:43:53,809
In Persia, in the city of Cordula, we remember the birth of the holy priests Parmenius, Helina, and Chrysotelis, along with the deacons Luke and Mark from Babylon.

908
01:43:53,809 --> 01:43:57,936
Notably, the first of them could speak even after his tongue was cut out.

909
01:43:57,936 --> 01:44:02,064
They all endured being stretched on the rack and pulled apart with bonds.

910
01:44:02,064 --> 01:44:11,507
Then, with burning plates applied to their sides, they were scorched and torn with nails, and finally, they were killed by the sword in front of the persecutor Decius.

911
01:44:11,507 --> 01:44:14,448
This is documented in the passion of Saint Lawrence.

912
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:23,834
Also in Persia, many holy martyrs, by the order of Sapore, king of the Persians, are celebrated on the anniversary of the Lord's Passion throughout the entire region.

913
01:44:23,834 --> 01:44:27,453
They were seized and killed by the sword for the name of Christ.

914
01:44:27,453 --> 01:44:33,504
In this conflict of faith, Bishop Milesius also suffered, known for his holiness and the glory of miracles.

915
01:44:33,504 --> 01:44:42,834
Bishop Acepsimas, along with his priest Jacob, and bishops Mareas and Bicor, with nearly 200 clergy and 50 monks, as well as many consecrated virgins, were martyred.

916
01:44:42,834 --> 01:44:51,655
Among them, the sister of the holy bishop and martyr Simeon, named Tarbuam, along with her maid, were cruelly killed by being tied to stakes and sawn apart.

917
01:44:51,655 --> 01:45:04,887
In Lyon, France, Saint Epipodius, during the persecution of Antoninus Verus, was seized with his dear colleague Alexander, who was meanwhile thrown into prison, after the glorious struggles of 48 martyrs who suffered in the same city.

918
01:45:04,887 --> 01:45:12,125
First, he was beaten with hard punches, then tortured on the rack, and finally completed his martyrdom by beheading on April 23.

919
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:17,271
In Persia, in the city of Diospolis, we commemorate the passion of Saint George the martyr.

920
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:28,863
Under Dacian, a very powerful king who ruled over 70 kings, he was famous for many miracles and converted many to the Christian faith, including Alexandra, the wife of Dacian, encouraging her to martyrdom.

921
01:45:28,863 --> 01:45:34,800
After many unheard-of trials, he was ultimately beheaded, completing his martyrdom by shedding his blood.

922
01:45:35,592 --> 01:45:44,593
Although his suffering is recorded among the apocryphal writings, the Church of God still honors his distinguished martyrdom among the crowns of the martyrs.

923
01:45:44,593 --> 01:45:45,797
In Rome, Saint Nabor.

924
01:45:45,797 --> 01:45:47,689
In Alexandria, the martyr Corona.

925
01:45:47,689 --> 01:45:53,652
In Gaul, in the city of Valentia, there were Felix the priest, and Fortunatus and Achilleus the deacons.

926
01:45:53,652 --> 01:45:58,985
They were sent by the blessed Irenaeus, bishop and martyr of Lyon, to preach the word of God.

927
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:07,470
After converting a large part of the city to the faith of Christ, they were imprisoned by Duke Cornelius and severely beaten with harsh nerve-whips.

928
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:17,447
Later, with their hands tied behind their backs, their loins and legs were broken, and they were tied to wheels, enduring the bitterness of smoke day and night without cease.

929
01:46:17,447 --> 01:46:21,288
They were stretched on the rack and eventually killed with a sword.

930
01:46:21,288 --> 01:46:26,793
At the monastery of Fontenelle, Saint Wolfram, a bishop renowned for his miracles and teachings.

931
01:46:26,793 --> 01:46:27,309
April 24.

932
01:46:27,309 --> 01:46:36,253
In Babylon, the capital of the Chaldeans, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, who were renamed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were saved from the fiery furnace.

933
01:46:36,253 --> 01:46:39,177
In Alexandria, Victor and Zoticus with many others.

934
01:46:39,177 --> 01:46:42,445
In Africa, Faustinus, Victorinus, and many other martyrs.

935
01:46:42,445 --> 01:46:47,319
At Lugdunum Clavatum, the birth of Saint Alexander the doctor, a citizen of Pergamon.

936
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:51,504
He was brought out of prison three days after the suffering of Epipodius.

937
01:46:51,504 --> 01:46:57,353
He was beaten so cruelly that his ribs were exposed, and his internal organs were completely revealed.

938
01:46:57,353 --> 01:47:01,882
Then, he was fixed to the crossbeam of a cross and released his blessed spirit.

939
01:47:01,882 --> 01:47:04,004
Thirty-four others suffered with him.

940
01:47:04,004 --> 01:47:12,547
In Britain, the burial of Mellitus the bishop, who was the third to govern the Church of Canterbury after Augustine, the first bishop of the English.

941
01:47:12,547 --> 01:47:13,063
April 25.

942
01:47:13,063 --> 01:47:16,159
At Alexandria, the birth of Saint Mark the Evangelist.

943
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:23,039
He was a disciple and interpreter of the apostle Peter, and at the request of the brothers in Rome, he wrote the Gospel.

944
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:27,970
After writing it, he went to Egypt and was the first to proclaim Christ in Alexandria.

945
01:47:29,232 --> 01:49:23,352
Peter also mentioned this Mark in his first letter, symbolically referring to Rome under the name of Babylon: "The church that is in Babylon greets you, and so does my son, Mark."
After establishing and strengthening churches throughout Libya, Marmarica, Ammoniaca, Pentapolis, Alexandria, and all of Egypt, he was eventually captured by the remaining pagans in Alexandria. They saw him holding mass on the holy day, April 24th, and put a rope around his neck, dragging him to the place called Bucolia by the sea under the cliffs where a church was built.
While dragging him, they mockingly said, "Let's drag the ox to Bucolia," referring to his tall stature. From the extreme torture, his flesh fell to the ground, and the rocks were stained with his blood. In the evening, they put him in prison, where around midnight, he was comforted by an angelic visit, then called to the heavenly kingdom by the Lord Himself appearing to him.
In the morning, as he was being dragged to Bucolia, he gave thanks, saying, "Lord, into your hands I commend my spirit," and died, and was buried by religious men in a place of carved stone with honor. He had appointed Anianus as bishop in Alexandria in his place and also appointed other bishops, priests, and deacons for churches far and wide. He suffered in the eighth year of Nero.
In the city of Syracuse in Sicily, the birth of the saints Evodius, Hermogenes, and Callista is commemorated. In Persia, Saint George the martyr is celebrated, according to the calendar of the learned Jerome. His passion is famously observed among the Romans and nearly everyone else on April 23rd, as noted earlier.
I thought it necessary to mention this so that our patriarch Hatto of Mainz, who this year also, from the incarnation of the Lord, received the head of Saint George and another part of his body along with many great relics of saints from the apostolic Formosus, and brought them to his new monastery in Germany. On the feast of Saint George, let him proceed with caution, because many have been accustomed to celebrate his birthday on this day.

946
01:49:23,352 --> 01:49:30,585
The feast of Saint Mark the Evangelist was set by Saint Jerome on the day before April 24th, under the authority of Eusebius of Caesarea.

947
01:49:30,585 --> 01:49:33,542
In Rome, this occasion is known as the Greater Litanies.

948
01:49:33,542 --> 01:49:43,205
As for the reason behind this, we, being barbarians and on the world's edge, are unaware of it, or what might have been established before the Lord's ascension for religious purposes.

949
01:49:43,205 --> 01:49:48,961
If any guilt or impurity was accumulated during indulgent times, it could be cleansed by this three-day fast.

950
01:49:48,961 --> 01:49:53,238
We thought it valuable to share the reason according to our ancestors' tradition.

951
01:49:53,238 --> 01:50:02,848
Saint Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, mentions in a homily about the Rogation Days that these days, observed before the Lord's ascension, were instituted by Mamertus, the bishop of Vienne.

952
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:06,386
He led the city during a time when it was frightened by many signs.

953
01:50:06,386 --> 01:50:13,144
The city was often shaken by earthquakes, and wild deer and wolves entered through the gates and roamed fearlessly, as he wrote.

954
01:50:13,144 --> 01:50:20,906
Throughout the year, as these events unfolded, the people devoutly awaited God's mercy during Easter, hoping the solemn days would end this terror.

955
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:28,615
But on the eve of that glorious night, as Masses were being celebrated, the royal palace within the walls suddenly caught fire with divine flames.

956
01:50:28,615 --> 01:50:34,212
Terrified, everyone left the church, fearing the entire city would either burn or the earth would open up.

957
01:50:34,212 --> 01:50:39,281
The holy priest, prostrate before the altar, pleaded for the Lord's mercy with groans and tears.

958
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:40,443
What more can be said?

959
01:50:40,443 --> 01:50:46,515
The prayer of the illustrious bishop reached heaven and extinguished the fire in the palace with a stream of tears.

960
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:56,601
As the Lord's ascension approached, as mentioned earlier, he proclaimed a fast for the people, established a way of praying, a sequence of eating, and a cheerful administration of almsgiving.

961
01:50:56,601 --> 01:51:04,679
With the terrors ceasing, the fame of this event spread across all provinces, encouraging priests everywhere to follow the example of the priest's faith.

962
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:11,653
This litany is celebrated in all churches in the name of God with heartfelt contrition and spiritual humility.

963
01:51:11,653 --> 01:51:19,407
On April 26th, in Rome, we commemorate the birth of Saint Anacletus, pope, who was martyred during Domitian's persecution after two years.

964
01:51:19,407 --> 01:51:23,678
He built a memorial for Blessed Peter and created burial places for bishops.

965
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:31,995
Ordained as a priest by Blessed Peter, he was initially led to sacrifice to idols but later repented and was beheaded for confessing the true faith.

966
01:51:31,995 --> 01:51:40,143
On the same day, we honor Saint Marcellinus, pope, who led the Church for nine years and four months during the reign of Diocletian and Maximian.

967
01:51:40,143 --> 01:51:51,606
He was beheaded for his faith in Christ by Diocletian, along with Claudius, Cyrenius, and Antoninus, and buried thirty-five days later on the Via Salaria by Marcellus the presbyter and deacons with hymns.

968
01:51:51,606 --> 01:51:56,495
During this time of great persecution, seventeen thousand were martyred within a month.

969
01:51:56,495 --> 01:51:59,979
In Gaul, we commemorate Saint Richarius, bishop and confessor.

970
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:06,104
On April 27th, in Rome, we remember the birth of Saint Anastasius, pope, the forty-first after Blessed Peter.

971
01:52:06,104 --> 01:52:16,387
He served as bishop for three years and ten days, condemned the Manichaeans in Rome, and decreed that no one from overseas could join the clergy without the signature of five bishops.

972
01:52:16,387 --> 01:52:24,704
In Nicomedia, we honor Saint Anthimus, bishop and martyr, who achieved martyrdom by beheading during Diocletian's persecution for confessing Christ.

973
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:29,480
Nearly his entire flock followed him as a good shepherd leading the way to martyrdom.

974
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:37,123
The tyrant, residing in the city, ordered some to be beheaded, others burned with fire, and others placed in boats to be drowned at sea.

975
01:52:37,123 --> 01:52:46,001
The faithful, inspired by God's grace, voluntarily rushed into flames or offered their necks to the swords, as recorded in Ecclesiastical History, Book Seven.

976
01:52:46,001 --> 01:52:49,373
In Tarsus of Cilicia, we remember the birth of Saint Castor.

977
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:54,247
In Lydia, Genesis, Sodalis, Zotici, Elpidius, and Eutychius. April 28th.

978
01:52:54,247 --> 01:53:00,208
At Ravenna, we remember the birth of Saint Vitalis the martyr, along with Saints Gervasius and Protasius.

979
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:03,672
Vitalis entered Ravenna as a soldier with the judge Paulinus.

980
01:53:03,672 --> 01:53:12,642
When he saw a Christian named Ursicinus, a doctor by profession and originally from Liguria, sentenced to death after enduring extreme torture, he stepped in.

981
01:53:12,642 --> 01:54:40,356
The place where Christians were executed was known as "at the Palm" due to the ancient palm trees there.
After suffering severe torture, Ursicinus was brought to the Palm to be executed. He was afraid and hesitated. Vitalis called out loudly, saying, "Do not, Ursicinus, the doctor who once healed others, wound yourself with the dart of eternal death. Having come through extreme suffering to the Palm, do not lose the crown prepared for you by the Lord."
Upon hearing this, Ursicinus knelt and urged the executioner to strike, repenting for his fear, thus making himself a martyr of Christ. Immediately after, Blessed Vitalis took his body and buried it within the city of Ravenna, refusing to willingly appear before the judge.
Consequently, he was held by the consul Paulinus, and after being tortured on the rack, he was commanded to be brought to the Palm. A deep pit was dug until it reached water, and he was placed in it face-up, then crushed with earth and stones.
His blessed wife Valeria, while heading to Milan after her husband's death, encountered people sacrificing to Sylvanus. When they urged her to eat from the idol sacrifices after taking her down from her mule, she testified that it was entirely forbidden for her because she was a Christian. She was beaten so severely by them that her people could barely bring her to the city of Milan, and within two days, she passed to the Lord.
At Alexandria, Saint Theodora the virgin, refusing to sacrifice, was handed over to a brothel but was miraculously rescued by God's favor.

982
01:54:40,584 --> 01:54:48,932
As a group of shameless young men gathered at the cell door, a brother named Didymus, full of faith and divine inspiration, donned a soldier's outfit.

983
01:54:48,932 --> 01:54:54,053
He was the first to rush into the brothel and explained to the holy virgin why he was there.

984
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:58,561
He gave her the soldier's clothes, and he himself dressed in her virgin's attire.

985
01:54:58,561 --> 01:55:03,348
In this way, the virgin left without being recognized and made her escape to the city.

986
01:55:03,348 --> 01:55:09,916
Didymus was brought before the governor, and after boldly explaining everything, he confessed that he was a Christian.

987
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:12,866
He was executed by beheading and his body was burned.

988
01:55:12,866 --> 01:55:23,274
The blessed virgin, having fled the brothel to preserve her purity, returned to the arena out of a desire for the crown and was executed alongside Didymus, and they were honored together.

989
01:55:23,274 --> 01:55:27,282
In Pannonia, there was Bishop Eusebius, along with Tiballus and Pollion.

990
01:55:27,282 --> 01:55:35,185
In Africa, in the province of Numidia, the saints Manilius, Donatus, Maurilius, Lucian, Victorinus, the virgin Narcia, and seventy-two others.

991
01:55:35,185 --> 01:55:37,690
Also, Lucian with two hundred seventy others.

992

997
01:55:56,948 --> 01:56:01,679
In Numidia, at the colony of Cirta, the holy martyrs Agapius and Secundinus, bishops.

998
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:13,089
During the persecution under Valerian, after a long exile in the city, where the pagans' blind fury and military duties tested the faith of the righteous, they became renowned priests and glorious martyrs.

999
01:56:13,089 --> 01:56:19,601
With them suffered the soldier Aemilian, the sacred virgins Tertulla and Antonia, and a certain woman with her twins.

1000
01:56:19,601 --> 01:56:24,221
On April thirtieth, in the city of Saintes, the birth of Saint Eutropius, a martyr.

1001
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:30,511
He was consecrated as a bishop by the blessed Clement, the successor of the apostles, and sent to Gaul to preach.

1002
01:56:30,511 --> 01:56:38,414
After fulfilling this mission, he was killed by a blow to the head with an axe by rising pagans, who were stirred by envy and did not believe.

1003
01:56:39,528 --> 01:56:44,792
In Alexandria, we celebrate the birth of Saint Aphrodisius the priest, along with thirty others.

1004
01:56:44,792 --> 01:56:47,425
In Rome, we honor the burial of Bishop Quirinus.

1005
01:56:47,425 --> 01:56:52,470
We remember the trials of Saints Marianus and James—Marianus, a lector, and James, a deacon.

1006
01:56:52,470 --> 01:57:01,409
Although they had already triumphed over the Decian persecution by confessing Christ, they were captured again with their beloved colleague in the colony of Cirta.

1007
01:57:01,409 --> 01:57:07,496
Enduring severe and brutal tortures, Marian was cruelly suspended by his thumbs with heavy weights on his feet.

1008
01:57:07,496 --> 01:57:12,322
While the others weakened in prison, they found wonderful comfort in divine revelations.

1009
01:57:12,322 --> 01:57:21,700
Later, they were sent to the city of Lambese to face the governor, where they endured a long stay in a prison workhouse but were once again uplifted by divine revelations.

1010
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:25,320
Ultimately, they were executed by the sword alongside many others.

1011
01:57:25,704 --> 01:57:32,568
May. The month of May has thirty-one days, while the moon has thirty.

1012
01:57:32,568 --> 01:57:35,767
May 1st. This day marks the passing of the prophet Jeremiah.

1013
01:57:35,767 --> 01:57:39,020
It's also the beginning of our Lord Jesus Christ's preaching.

1014
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:42,326
Additionally, it's the feast of the apostles Philip and James.

1015
01:57:42,326 --> 01:57:49,737
Philip, who converted almost all of Scythia to the faith of Christ, appointed deacons, priests, and bishops there before returning to Asia.

1016
01:57:49,737 --> 01:57:54,856
He continued preaching for several years, bringing many to Christ through his dedicated service.

1017
01:57:54,856 --> 01:58:04,454
He passed away in the city of Hierapolis in Asia, having extinguished the heresy of the Ebionites, who denied Christ's existence before his incarnation, and he was buried in peace.

1018
01:58:04,454 --> 01:58:11,813
James, also known as the brother of the Lord, is said to have been the son of Mary, the maternal aunt of Jesus, and was surnamed the Just.

1019
01:58:11,813 --> 01:58:16,505
After the Lord's passion, the apostles immediately appointed him as bishop of Jerusalem.

1020
01:58:16,505 --> 01:58:17,732
He was holy from birth.

1021
01:58:17,732 --> 01:58:23,651
He never drank wine or strong drink, ate no meat, never shaved, nor anointed himself with oil, nor used a bath.

1022
01:58:23,651 --> 01:58:26,370
He alone was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies.

1023
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:28,823
He wore linen garments instead of woolen ones.

1024
01:58:28,823 --> 01:59:04,496
When publicly pressured in the council to deny that the Lord Jesus Christ was the Son of God, he boldly declared to the people: "Why do you ask me about the Son of Man? Behold, he sits at the right hand of power and will come on the clouds of heaven."
After being thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, with his legs broken, he still managed to lift his hands to heaven and said, "Lord, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing," before being struck on the head with a fuller’s club and dying.
This is the one about whom the apostle Paul writes to the Galatians: "I saw none of the other apostles, only James, the Lord's brother" (Galatians chapter one).

1025
01:59:04,496 --> 01:59:07,215
The Acts of the Apostles frequently attest to this.

1026
01:59:07,215 --> 01:59:17,613
The Gospel according to the Hebrews, translated into Greek and Latin by the blessed Jerome, reports that after the resurrection of the Savior, the Lord came to James the Just and appeared to him.

1027
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:24,734
Jacob had vowed not to eat bread from the moment he drank from the Lord's cup until he witnessed His resurrection.

1028
01:59:24,734 --> 01:59:48,497
Then, shortly afterward, the Lord said, "Bring the table and the bread." Immediately, it is added: "He took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to James the Just, saying, 'My brother, eat your bread, for the Son of Man has risen from the dead.'"
Some believe this is why it is written in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians that He appeared specifically to him: "Then He was seen by James" (First Corinthians 15).

1029
01:59:48,497 --> 01:59:56,717
James led the Church of the Jerusalemites for 30 years, until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the temple where he had been cast down.

1030
01:59:56,717 --> 02:00:01,414
However, he wrote only one letter, which is included among the seven canonical ones.

1031
02:00:01,414 --> 02:00:17,126
In Gaul, in the Vivarais region, Saint Andeolus, a subdeacon, was sent from the East by Saint Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna and a disciple of the blessed Apostle John, along with the blessed Benignus and Andochius, presbyters, and Thyrsus, a deacon, to preach the word of God in Gaul.

1032
02:00:17,126 --> 02:00:24,395
When Caesar Severus learned of their preaching, he ordered Andeolus to be cruelly whipped with thorny rods and thrown into prison.

1033
02:00:24,395 --> 02:00:32,949
The next day, seeing that he could not be overcome, he ordered a sword to be made from the hardest wood, in the shape of a cross, and had his head split.

1034
02:00:32,949 --> 02:00:39,044
After this was done, his brains were dashed to the ground, and he was gloriously transferred to eternal life.

1035
02:00:39,044 --> 02:00:50,842
Likewise, in Jerusalem, there was the passion of Saint Jude, also known as Quiriacus, a bishop to whom the wood of the Lord's cross was revealed, and his mother Anna, who was tortured by all kinds of sufferings.

1036
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:58,558
Also, in Gaul, in the region of Sidonia, at the place of Agaunum, the passion of King Sigismund, son of King Gundewald of the Burgundians.

1037
02:00:58,558 --> 02:01:08,120
Seeing that he could not resist the Franks, he fled alone, shaved his head, adopted the religious habit, and devoted himself day and night to fasting, vigils, and prayers.

1038
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:12,872
He was captured by the Franks along with his wife and sons and was drowned in a well.

1039
02:01:13,488 --> 02:01:17,656
Afterwards, he was revealed to a certain abbot who buried him with reverence.

1040
02:01:17,656 --> 02:01:27,183
He remains well-known for his miracles, especially as those suffering from chills often seek a special remedy from him, and those who faithfully seek it are never left wanting.

1041
02:01:27,183 --> 02:01:32,758
On May 2nd, we commemorate the birth of our Holy Father Athanasius, bishop and confessor of Alexandria.

1042
02:01:32,758 --> 02:01:37,143
He endured numerous plots from the Arians, particularly from Emperor Constantius.

1043
02:01:37,143 --> 02:01:44,667
He spent six continuous years hiding in a dry cistern, never once seeing the sun, while the full might of the empire conspired against him.

1044
02:01:44,667 --> 02:01:56,901
He was betrayed by a maidservant of the homeowner who sheltered him, but, saved by divine grace, he was restored to his position through the intercession of Constans, the prince of the Gauls, alongside his brother Constantius.

1045
02:01:56,901 --> 02:02:04,425
Again, after the death of Constantius, because of his unwavering commitment to the Catholic faith, he was exiled until the reign of Jovian.

1046
02:02:04,425 --> 02:02:11,733
He was then summoned back with honorific and most respectful letters, regaining authority over the churches and restoring his position.

1047
02:02:11,733 --> 02:02:22,343
In the fortieth year of his priesthood and beyond, after enduring many struggles and earning many crowns of patience, he passed away peacefully during the reign of Emperors Valentinian and Valens.

1048
02:02:22,343 --> 02:02:30,192
He left behind the life of Saint Anthony, the anchorite, written in elegant language and filled with great wisdom, benefiting future generations.

1049
02:02:30,192 --> 02:02:33,548
Also, in Alexandria, Saturninus and Neopolis rested in prison.

1050
02:02:33,548 --> 02:02:37,229
In Auxerre, there were Optatus the bishop and Sanctianus the priest.

1051
02:02:37,229 --> 02:02:49,246
On May 3rd, in Jerusalem, the discovery of the Holy Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by Queen Helena took place, two hundred thirty-three years after the passion of the Lord, during the reign of Emperor Constantine, her son.

1052
02:02:49,896 --> 02:02:55,678
After a long time, it was discovered through divine revelation and confirmed by the resurrection of the dead.

1053
02:02:55,678 --> 02:03:03,742
It became visible to the entire world, with one part left in Jerusalem at the site of the Lord's passion, so it wouldn't be far from the East and South.

1054
02:03:03,742 --> 02:03:09,684
Another part was taken to Constantinople for his son, making it somewhat closer for the North and West to visit.

1055
02:03:09,684 --> 02:03:14,459
This Lord's cross, in its lifeless material, holds a living and undeniably powerful force.

1056
02:03:14,459 --> 02:03:21,833
From that time on, it has nearly daily fulfilled the prayers of countless people without experiencing any loss, remaining almost untouched.

1057
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:27,404
It is continually divided among those who take from it and always appears whole to those who venerate it.

1058
02:03:27,404 --> 02:03:40,083
It is believed to have received this incorruptible power and indestructible firmness from the blood of the one who, after suffering death, did not see corruption, but instead provided immortality and incorruption to all who believe in him.

1059
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:45,707
On the same day, in Rome, on the Nomentana Way, at the seventh milestone, was the birth of Pope Alexander.

1060
02:03:45,707 --> 02:03:51,861
He served as the bishop of the Roman Church, the fifth after blessed Peter, for ten years, two months, and ten days.

1061
02:03:51,861 --> 02:03:57,909
Incomparable in holiness and most renowned in faith, he converted a large part of the city's senators to the Lord.

1062
02:03:57,909 --> 02:04:06,981
He established that water with salt should be blessed in the homes of the faithful and incorporated the Lord's passion into the preaching of priests when celebrating Mass.

1063
02:04:07,512 --> 02:04:12,772
When Emperor Trajan ordered it, Alexander was imprisoned by Aurelian, a commander of the army.

1064
02:04:12,772 --> 02:04:21,279
From there, through a heavenly messenger, he was brought to the house of Quirinus the tribune,
where the blessed Hermes, a prefect, was held in custody.

1065
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:34,824
After he healed Quirinus's daughter, Balbina, of a neck swelling in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and gave sight to her nurse, he strengthened Quirinus himself in the Christian faith and freed those who
were imprisoned by baptizing them.

1066
02:04:34,824 --> 02:04:40,308
Among these, Quirinus, still a pagan, had also held two very holy priests,
Eventius and Theodolus.

1067
02:04:40,308 --> 02:04:47,528
After all these apostolic deeds and many others, Alexander was brought before Aurelian along with the
two aforementioned priests.

1068
02:04:47,528 --> 02:04:52,229
He was lifted onto the rack, tortured with claws, and severely tormented
with lamps.

1069
02:04:52,229 --> 02:05:56,760
When he did not utter any cries, Aurelian asked him,
"Why are you silent?" Saint Alexander replied, "Because during prayer, a Christian speaks with God."
Then, after he was taken down, Aurelian ordered Eventius and Theodolus to be brought in and asked him,
"Who are these?" Saint Alexander said, "Both are holy men, both are priests."
When he found them steadfast in their confession of Christ, he ordered the furnace to be fiercely heated
and the blessed Alexander and Eventius to be thrown in while tied in the middle. The unyielding Theodolus
willingly leaped into the flames, and when they were not harmed by the fire, Aurelian ordered the most
blessed Alexander to be pierced repeatedly until he died, and the two holy priests to be executed by the sword.
Their bodies were collected by the devout woman Severina, who carefully laid Alexander and Eventius in one
tomb and Saint Theodolus in another.
On the same day, the birth of Saint Juvenal, the bishop, was commemorated.
In Asia, Saint Hermogenes of ancient times. In Auxerre, the burial of the saints Eusebius the priest
and Avitus the deacon. On the same day, Heraclius the martyr. April 2nd.

1070
02:05:57,096 --> 02:05:57,698
May second.

1071
02:05:57,698 --> 02:06:06,181
In Palestine, in the city of Gaza, Saint Sylvanus, bishop of the city, was martyred during the persecution under Diocletian, along with many of his clergy.

1072
02:06:06,181 --> 02:06:10,669
Also, at the mines of Phanessa, the holy forty martyrs were all beheaded together.

1073
02:06:10,669 --> 02:06:21,944
In Jerusalem, Bishop Cyriacus, also known as Jude, after discovering the Lord's Cross and growing in the faith of Christ, was appointed bishop of Jerusalem by the blessed Eusebius, bishop of the Roman city.

1074
02:06:21,944 --> 02:06:30,263
When Julian the Apostate heard of his fame, as he was heading to the Persian war, where he was divinely slain, he ordered Cyriacus to be brought to him.

1075
02:06:30,263 --> 02:07:40,814
When he couldn't sway Cyriacus's confession of Christ with threats or promises, he ordered his right hand to be cut off, saying, "With this hand, writing many letters, he has led many away from offering sacrifices to the gods."
Seeing him remain steadfast and unwavering in Christ, Julian ordered boiling lead to be poured into his mouth, intending to melt his internal organs.
When even this didn't weaken his resolve, he ordered a bronze bed to be brought, and had the holy man laid on it with coals placed underneath, salt and fat sprinkled over him, and beaten with rods from above.
As for his mother, who witnessed all these things steadfastly, not only unafraid but resolute, encouraging her son with maternal affection, the tyrant ordered her to be hung by her hair for nearly three hours, scraped with claws, and have great torches, burning with flames, applied to her sides.
Persisting in thanksgiving amidst such immense torture, she surrendered her unsullied spirit to God.
Then the wicked Julian ordered a deep pit to be dug and called many snake charmers to bring the most wicked serpents and throw them into the pit, and Saint Cyriacus to be thrown in among them.
When the serpents were divinely killed, and Ammon, the snake charmer, believed in the miracle, he was beheaded.

1076
02:07:41,088 --> 02:07:45,571
Julian, as was his habit, urged the blessed Cyriacus to renounce the Crucified One.

1077
02:07:45,571 --> 02:07:53,241
After Cyriacus appropriately rebuked him, Julian ordered a large pot filled with oil to be heated and for Saint Cyriacus to be thrown into it.

1078
02:07:53,241 --> 02:09:22,475
When the pot became so hot that those nearby couldn't bear the heat, the saint said, "Step back, little ones, so that none of you are harmed," and after making the sign of the cross on his forehead, he entered the pot as though it were a bath.
Even then, he remained unharmed, so the tyrant ordered him to be struck in the chest with a sword.
He was struck while voicing his confession and gave up his spirit, reaching Christ in the triumph of martyrdom.
Some say the day of his passion is celebrated here, but according to the Martyrology of Saint Jerome, it is held on May 1st.
On the same day, in Nicomedia, we celebrate Saint Antonina.
She endured severe torture, was hung by the arm for three days, and imprisoned for two years, until she was finally burned by fire on the orders of Governor Priscillian.
On the same day in Lauriacum, near Nicor, we celebrate the birth of Saint Florian.
During the reign of Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, under the cruel Governor Aquilinus, he was ordered to be thrown into the River Anisus with a stone tied around his neck after enduring severe beatings and mutilations.
When the executioners, struck by divine fear, hesitated at the wicked act, a particularly bold and unfortunate young man among them threw him from a bridge into the river, and immediately his eyes burst.
However, a wave carried the body of the holy martyr to a secluded spot against a prominent rock, where an eagle guarded it until it was revealed to a devout woman, who was instructed to transfer his body.
May 5th.
From Bethany, on the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem, we commemorate the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven.

1079
02:09:22,584 --> 02:09:29,112
The church, built with royal splendor, stands where His incorruptible body last stood and ascended to the heavens.

1080
02:09:29,112 --> 02:09:33,522
It's believed that this place is sanctified by the imprint of divine majesty.

1081
02:09:33,522 --> 02:09:39,135
Even unbelievers notice it, as it never allows a roof above or marble or any other flooring below.

1082
02:09:39,135 --> 02:09:44,289
In the center of the church, the footprints of God and man are always visible in the sand.

1083
02:09:44,289 --> 02:10:57,826
Visitors to this place can justifiably burst into prophetic praise:
"We worshiped at the place where His feet stood"
Psalm 132.
In Alexandria, we mark the birth of Saint Euthymius, a deacon resting in prison.
In Thessalonica, the burning of Irenaeus, Peregrinus, and Irene took place.
In Gaul, known as Provence, in the city of Arles, there was Saint Hilary, a bishop who was a great, learned, and distinguished man.
He loved poverty and was diligent in providing for the needy, not only with his piety but also through his own labor.
To help the poor, he even engaged in farming beyond his strength and experience, despite being of noble birth and raised very differently.
He didn't neglect spiritual matters either, as he had the grace to teach and offered correction to all without favoritism.
He particularly worked to correct the Pelagian heresy in the "Collator."
Among his works for the benefit of many, he composed the "Life of Saint Honoratus," his predecessor, with immortal genius.
He passed away during the reign of Emperors Valentinian and Marcian.
In Vienne, Nectarius and Nicetius served as bishops.
In Auxerre, the martyrdom of Saint Jovian, a confessor, is remembered.
May 6th.
In Rome, outside the Latin Gate, the martyrdom of Saint John the Apostle is commemorated.

1084
02:10:58,056 --> 02:11:12,800
After being brought from Ephesus, where he usually stayed, to the city of Rome by order of Domitian, the brother of Titus, during the second persecution of Christians, which he carried out after Nero, John was placed before the Senate in a vat of boiling oil at the Latin Gate.

1085
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:21,103
This was done by the wicked emperor, a fierce persecutor of Christians, to weaken the less steadfast members of the Church by removing such a strong leader.

1086
02:11:21,103 --> 02:11:27,863
However, the blessed apostle emerged from this terrible punishment unharmed, just as he remained free from physical corruption.

1087
02:11:27,863 --> 02:11:32,015
Then, exiled to the island of Patmos, he saw and wrote the Book of Revelation.

1088
02:11:32,015 --> 02:11:43,885
To honor his worthy memory and his apostolic steadfastness in the faith and confession of our Lord Jesus Christ, Christians built a church, glorious in his name and memory, at the aforementioned place before the Latin Gate.

1089
02:11:43,885 --> 02:11:52,721
This site continues to attract an annual festival gathering on the 6th of May, a tradition that is also observed with reverence in many places of the Catholic Church.

1090
02:11:52,721 --> 02:12:06,667
After the death of Domitian, when all his decrees were annulled by the judgment of the Senate, among others, the blessed apostle John, condemned for various reasons and sent into exile, was released by the favor of Emperor Nerva and allowed to return to Ephesus.

1091
02:12:06,667 --> 02:12:14,757
There, he brought joy to the Church, which had been distressed and deprived by his absence, and strengthened it forever with his teachings and writings.

1092
02:12:14,757 --> 02:12:22,316
Furthermore, due to Domitian's extreme cruelty and wicked deeds, historians report that both the house and name of the Caesars ended with him.

1093
02:12:22,316 --> 02:12:45,576
Nevertheless, the ancient custom of calling Roman rulers "Caesars" persisted, especially among barbarian nations.
On the same day is the birth of the blessed Evodius, bishop of the Antioch Church, who was the first to be ordained bishop there by the apostles. Regarding him, Paul himself wrote to the Philippians: "I plead with Evodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord Jesus Christ"
from Philippians Chapter Four.

1094
02:12:46,056 --> 02:12:52,464
Also, the birth of the blessed Lucius of Cyrene, who was appointed as the first bishop of Cyrene by the holy apostles.

1095
02:12:52,464 --> 02:12:59,579
He is mentioned by Saint Luke the Evangelist in the Acts of the Apostles, Chapter Thirteen, among the list of the most perfect men.

1096
02:12:59,579 --> 02:13:02,729
Also, Marian and James and many others, according to some.

1097
02:13:02,729 --> 02:13:05,553
In Auxerre, the burial of Saint Valerius the Bishop.

1098
02:13:05,553 --> 02:13:13,102
On May Seventh, we commemorate the birth of Saint Juvenal the martyr and the most blessed and illustrious servant of God, Flavia Domitilla.

1099
02:13:13,102 --> 02:13:20,325
She was the niece of Flavius Clemens the consul, through his sister, and was dedicated to purity with a sacred veil by Saint Clement.

1100
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:31,350
During the persecution under Domitian, in the fifteenth year of his reign, she was exiled to the island of Pontia because of her testimony for Christ, where she endured a long martyrdom with many others.

1101
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:40,148
Eventually, she was transferred to Terracina, a city in Campania, by her fiancé Aurelian, whom she had rejected for Christ and by whose accusation she was exiled.

1102
02:13:40,148 --> 02:13:48,946
There, through her teachings and miracles, she converted her foster sisters and fellow virgins, Euphrosyne and Theodora, and then others to the faith of the Lord.

1103
02:13:48,946 --> 02:13:55,355
Among these great deeds, the aforementioned Aurelian, her most relentless persecutor, was struck down by divine power.

1104
02:13:55,355 --> 02:14:04,153
Luxurius, his brother, set fire to the room where she and the virgins were confined, and she completed her glorious martyrdom during the persecution under Trajan.

1105
02:14:04,153 --> 02:14:12,354
The next day, a holy deacon named Caesarius found the bodies of the saints unharmed: they had departed while praying to the Lord, lying on their faces.

1106
02:14:12,354 --> 02:14:19,197
This same holy deacon and renowned martyr placed their bodies together in a new sarcophagus and buried them deep in the earth.

1107
02:14:19,197 --> 02:14:29,570
Luxurius, as he hurried to a feast, was killed and left swollen as a spectacle and example to the unfaithful when a snake entered his heart through the neck of his garment from a tree branch.

1108
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:35,055
Also in Rome, the burial of Pope Benedict, who served for ten months during the reign of Constantine.

1109
02:14:35,055 --> 02:14:39,183
From a young age, he served in the Church and was always a lover of poverty.

1110
02:14:39,183 --> 02:14:40,867
He was buried near Saint Peter.

1111
02:14:41,736 --> 02:14:50,789
In Nicomedia, we remember the suffering of the holy martyrs Flavius and Augustine, along with the three brothers Marcellinus, Macrobius, and Eutychius.

1112
02:14:50,789 --> 02:14:56,424
In Africa, we honor Celerinus, Maximus, Victurius, Potentilla, Faustina, and countless others.

1113
02:14:56,424 --> 02:15:00,441
At Autun, we commemorate the burial of the blessed Bishop Placitus.

1114
02:15:00,441 --> 02:15:00,801
May 8.

1115
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:03,739
In Milan, we celebrate the feast of Saint Victor.

1116
02:15:03,739 --> 02:15:07,096
Born a Moor, he embraced Christianity from an early age.

1117
02:15:07,096 --> 02:15:13,151
Even as an older man serving in the imperial army, Emperor Maximian forced him to sacrifice to idols.

1118
02:15:13,151 --> 02:15:18,967
Victor bravely stood firm in his faith, enduring imprisonment for six days without food or drink.

1119
02:15:18,967 --> 02:15:24,962
He was severely beaten with rods and whips, and even covered with molten lead but remained unharmed.

1120
02:15:24,962 --> 02:15:28,320
Ultimately, he achieved glorious martyrdom by beheading.

1121
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:35,274
His body was left for the beasts and birds in the forest called Ulmos, yet it remained untouched for an entire week.

1122
02:15:35,274 --> 02:15:39,411
Later, Saint Materno, the bishop, collected and honorably buried him.

1123
02:15:39,411 --> 02:15:48,284
Victor was a fellow citizen of the saints Narbor and Felix, who were beheaded in Africa and later brought to Milan along with Januarius and Marinus.

1124
02:15:48,284 --> 02:15:52,301
In Constantinople, we remember Agathus the soldier and many others.

1125
02:15:52,301 --> 02:15:54,639
In Egypt, we honor Victor and Stephana.

1126
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:58,536

1133
02:16:14,244 --> 02:16:20,659
At the town of Nazianzus, we commemorate the burial of the blessed Bishop Gregory, known as the Theologian.

1134
02:16:20,659 --> 02:16:28,154
He was noble and educated in Athens, a colleague of the blessed Basil, who later became the bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia.

1135
02:16:28,154 --> 02:16:38,106
Fully dedicating himself to God's service, Gregory had such confidence in his love for Basil that he removed him from the teacher's chair and took him to a monastery.

1136
02:16:38,106 --> 02:16:44,941
There, they devoted thirteen years solely to studying the divine Scripture, setting aside all secular Greek books.

1137
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:53,133
Later, he was ordained as a bishop in the town of Nazianzus and dispelled the storm of heresies with the calmness of faith.

1138
02:16:53,133 --> 02:16:58,793
When he was called to Constantinople to address certain issues, he willingly took on the responsibility.

1139
02:16:58,793 --> 02:17:07,935
After strengthening the Catholic faith there, he returned to his humble position to avoid being seen as someone seeking wealth, and he spent the rest of his life there.

1140
02:17:07,935 --> 02:17:16,642
As he grew older and his health declined, he appointed a successor so that someone else could govern the church, allowing him to enjoy a more leisurely old age.

1141
02:17:16,642 --> 02:17:20,234
On May 10th the day marking the burial of the blessed prophet Job.

1142
02:17:20,234 --> 02:17:25,676
In Rome, there were Falto, Piniana, and Anitia, along with Lucina, his wife, and many other martyrs.

1143
02:17:25,676 --> 02:17:37,158
Also in Rome, the elderly priest Calepodius was executed under Emperor Alexander, who ordered Laodicius to kill him and have his body dragged through the city and thrown into the Tiber River on the first of May.

1144
02:17:37,158 --> 02:17:47,824
Fishermen found his body, informed Bishop Callixtus, who then wrapped it in linens and buried it with spices in his cemetery on the Via Aurelia, three miles from the city, in a crypt, on May 10th.

1145
02:17:47,824 --> 02:18:00,504
Then, Palmatius the consul was beheaded by Alexander along with his wife, children, and forty-two others, including the senator Simplicius, who had recently been baptized through the teachings of Pope Callixtus and Priest Calepodius.

1146
02:18:00,504 --> 02:18:04,422
This account is documented in the Passion of the Blessed Pope Callixtus.

1147
02:18:04,422 --> 02:18:11,551
On the same day, we commemorate the feast of the blessed martyr Gordian, who suffered under the rule of the impious Emperor Julian.

1148
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:29,566
When the tyrant ordered Gordian, his deputy who was still a pagan, to carefully examine the priest Januarius to see if he could turn him away from the Christian faith, the holy Januarius instead converted Gordian, along with his wife Marina and their household, totaling fifty-three or more people, and baptized them all.

1149
02:18:29,566 --> 02:18:41,159
Hearing this, the wicked Julian, filled with anger, condemned the holy priest Januarius to exile and placed Gordian in public custody, entrusting him to a man named Clementian, whom he had appointed as his deputy.

1150
02:18:41,159 --> 02:18:45,187
Additionally, he forced Gordian's wife Marina into labor at Aquas Salvias.

1151
02:18:45,187 --> 02:18:55,473
When Clementian realized he couldn't sway Gordian from his faith, he ordered Gordian to be beaten with lead weights and then beheaded, and his body to be thrown before the temple of Apollo.

1152
02:18:55,473 --> 02:19:08,427
When the Christians heard of this, they retrieved his body under the cover of night and placed it about one mile from Rome in a crypt in the cemetery of Praetextatus, where the body of the blessed martyr Epimachus had already been buried.

1153
02:19:08,427 --> 02:19:13,760
It is said that he was one of the seventy disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, on the ninth of May.

1154
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:18,278
The martyrdom of the holy Evellius, once an advisor to Emperor Nero, is also noted.

1155
02:19:18,278 --> 02:19:28,836
Witnessing the steadfastness of the Christians and their martyrdom, especially the patience of the holy Torpetis and the miracles through him, he believed in Christ and suffered for Him as well.

1156
02:19:28,836 --> 02:19:33,082
In Rome, on the Via Salaria, at the twenty-second mile marker, Saint Anthimus.

1157

In Vienne, the blessed bishops Martin and Maternus.

1160
02:19:42,062 --> 02:19:47,994
We note that Maternus instituted solemn litanies before the Ascension of the Lord due to impending disasters.

1161
02:19:48,648 --> 02:20:02,385
The burial of Nepotian, a priest and nephew of Bishop Heliodorus through his sister, is remembered for the epitaph's consolation written by Saint Jerome, turning the world's attention to the mourning and lamentation for its evils and calamities.

1162
02:20:02,385 --> 02:20:04,404
This is commemorated on May twelfth.

1163
02:20:04,404 --> 02:20:09,619
In Rome, at the cemetery of Praetextatus, we remember the holy brothers Nereus and Achilleus.

1164
02:20:09,619 --> 02:20:17,300
They were eunuchs of the blessed Flavia Domitilla and endured a lengthy exile with her on the island of Pontia for their faith in Christ.

1165
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:27,001
Later, under Aurelian, Domitilla's fiancé, who she had rejected for the love of Christ, they were subjected to severe beatings and handed over to Moninius Rufus, the consul.

1166
02:20:27,001 --> 02:20:38,103
Despite being tortured with the rack and flames to force them to sacrifice, they remained steadfast, declaring they had been baptized by the blessed apostle Peter, and refused to sacrifice to idols.

1167
02:20:38,103 --> 02:20:39,449
They were then beheaded.

1168
02:20:39,449 --> 02:20:49,766
Their bodies were taken by their disciple Auspicius, caretaker of the holy virgin Domitilla, and buried in the sand crypt on the Ardeatine Way, one and a half miles from the city wall.

1169
02:20:49,766 --> 02:20:54,589
Also commemorated on the Aurelia Way, at the second mile, is Saint Pancras the martyr.

1170
02:20:54,589 --> 02:20:59,355
At just fourteen years old, he completed his martyrdom under Diocletian by beheading.

1171
02:20:59,355 --> 02:21:05,971
His venerable body was secretly taken at night by the distinguished woman Octavilla, embalmed with spices, and buried.

1172
02:21:05,971 --> 02:21:09,952
On the same day, we remember the blessed Denis, uncle of Saint Pancras.

1173
02:21:09,952 --> 02:21:15,840
Through his diligence, Pancras was baptized, strengthened in the fear of God, and inspired for martyrdom.

1174
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:21,559
Denis, beloved and worthy of God, was peacefully rewarded with heavenly honors at the end of his life.

1175
02:21:21,559 --> 02:21:26,213
We also recall the martyrdom of the noble virgin Sotheris under Emperor Diocletian.

1176
02:21:26,213 --> 02:21:32,830
Alongside her, the martyrdom of Saints John, Achillas, Moses, Aphroditius, and others, totaling five hundred and four.

1177
02:21:32,830 --> 02:21:36,531
In Cyprus, we honor our holy father Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis.

1178
02:21:36,531 --> 02:21:39,895
May thirteenth marks the birth of Saint Mary at the Martyrs.

1179
02:21:39,895 --> 02:21:51,670
The reason for this feast is significant: Under Emperor Phocas, blessed Pope Boniface dedicated a church to the blessed Mary ever virgin and all the Martyrs, after cleansing the old Pantheon temple of idolatry.

1180
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:56,595
The most sacred day of its dedication is celebrated in Rome on May 13th.

1181
02:21:56,595 --> 02:22:01,761
The festival of all Saints is observed with great religious devotion worldwide on November 1st.

1182
02:22:01,761 --> 02:22:06,982
On that same day, there's a commemoration for Saint Servatius, bishop of the Church of Tongeren.

1183
02:22:06,982 --> 02:22:16,390
During the time when the Huns were ravaging Germany, he was warned by divine revelation to move to the village of Maastricht to avoid the destruction of his city and Church.

1184
02:22:16,390 --> 02:22:20,196
There, he passed away and was buried in the middle of the public road.

1185
02:22:20,196 --> 02:22:32,541
To demonstrate his merit to the people, while everything around was covered in snow during winter, his tomb remained uncovered until a basilica was built over it, thanks to the efforts of the citizens and his successor, Munolf.

1186
02:22:32,541 --> 02:22:35,423

1189
02:22:42,656 --> 02:22:46,082
On May 14th, in Egypt, the burial of our holy Father Pachomius.

1190
02:22:46,082 --> 02:22:50,596
He was notable for his apostolic grace and was the founder of monasteries in Egypt.

1191
02:22:50,596 --> 02:22:56,958
He wrote the monastic Rules, which he learned through the dictation of an angel, and also about the timing of Easter.

1192
02:22:56,958 --> 02:23:03,973
In Syria, under Emperor Antoninus and with Sebastian as the leader of Alexandria, the birth of Saints Victor and Corona occurred.

1193
02:23:03,973 --> 02:23:05,822
Victor was a soldier from Cilicia.

1194
02:23:05,822 --> 02:23:15,774
During his confession of faith, Sebastian ordered Victor's fingers to be crushed and pulled from the skin, then to be thrown into a furnace, where he remained unharmed for three days.

1195
02:23:15,774 --> 02:23:21,049
He was then ordered to drink poison but did not die; instead, he converted the poisoner to faith.

1196
02:23:21,049 --> 02:23:26,270
Then, it was ordered to remove the nerves of his body and pour boiling oil on his private parts.

1197
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:30,457
After this, burning torches were applied to his sides while he was suspended.

1198
02:23:30,457 --> 02:23:34,155
Then vinegar and lime were mixed together and poured into his mouth.

1199
02:23:34,155 --> 02:23:35,787
His eyes were then gouged out.

1200
02:23:35,787 --> 02:23:37,907
He was hung upside down for three days.

1201
02:23:37,907 --> 02:23:41,333
Even while still breathing, the judge ordered him to be flayed.

1202
02:23:41,333 --> 02:23:47,696
At this time, Corona, who was the wife of a certain soldier, began to praise Saint Victor for the glory of martyrdom.

1203
02:23:47,696 --> 02:23:52,917
As she did so, she saw two crowns fall from heaven, one sent to Victor and the other to herself.

1204
02:23:54,168 --> 02:23:58,468
As this was announced to everyone listening, she was seized by the leader.

1205
02:23:58,468 --> 02:24:05,674
They ordered two palm trees to be bent toward each other, and Corona was tied to them with hemp ropes by her hands and feet.

1206
02:24:05,674 --> 02:24:08,754
When the trees were released, Corona was torn in two.

1207
02:24:08,754 --> 02:24:10,265
She was just 16 years old.

1208
02:24:10,265 --> 02:24:19,390
Then Victor was also beheaded, and having triumphed in all things, he received the crown of everlasting life and the palm of martyrdom, together with Corona.

1209
02:24:19,390 --> 02:24:20,959
In Asia, blessed Maximinus.

1210
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:23,574

1211
02:24:23,574 --> 02:24:26,480

1213
02:24:28,804 --> 02:24:29,211
May 13.

1214
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:36,592
In Spain, the birth of the blessed confessors Torquatus, Ctesiphon, Secundus, Indaletius, Caecilius, Hesychius, and Euphrasius.

1215
02:24:36,592 --> 02:24:45,890
They were ordained as bishops in Rome by the holy apostles and sent to Spain, which was still entangled in pagan errors at that time, to preach the word of God.

1216
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:53,619
When they arrived at the city of Acci and were taking a brief rest from their journey, they sent disciples into the city to buy food.

1217
02:24:53,619 --> 02:24:59,373
Soon, a crowd of pagans, who were celebrating a festival for their gods, pursued them to the river.

1218
02:24:59,373 --> 02:25:09,543
There, a bridge of remarkable size and strength had been built, and as the saints were crossing, by the will of God, it collapsed completely with the entire crowd of pursuers.

1219
02:25:09,543 --> 02:25:21,399
Terrified by this miracle, others followed the example of a certain great lady, Luparia, who, divinely inspired, received them kindly and believed, abandoning their idols and believing in Christ the Lord.

1220
02:25:21,399 --> 02:25:27,326
After this, they preached in different cities, converting countless multitudes to the faith of Christ.

1221
02:25:27,326 --> 02:25:36,683
Torquatus rested in Acci, Ctesiphon in Vergium, Secundus in Abula, Indaletius in Urci, Caecilius in Iliberis, Hesychius in Carcesa, and Euphrasius in Illiturgis.

1222
02:25:36,683 --> 02:25:41,390
To this day, the illustrious miracle remains, in memory of their precious deaths.

1223
02:25:41,390 --> 02:25:49,991
For on the same feast day in the aforementioned city of Acci, an olive tree miraculously blooms and bears ripe fruit at the tomb of Saint Torquatus.

1224
02:25:51,096 --> 02:25:55,177
On the island of Chios, we have the story of Saint Isidore the martyr.

1225
02:25:55,177 --> 02:25:59,083
It's said that in his basilica, there's a well where he was thrown.

1226
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:06,487
Those who drink from this well, especially if they are possessed or suffering from fever or other ailments, often find healing.

1227
02:26:06,487 --> 02:26:11,385
In Lampsacus, we remember the martyrdom of Saints Peter, Andrew, Paul, and Dionysia.

1228
02:26:11,385 --> 02:26:13,250
In Sardinia, there's Simplicius.

1236
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:52,313
On May 17th—In Tuscany, in the city of Pisa, we celebrate the birth of Saint Torpes the martyr during the reign of Emperor Nero.

1237
02:26:52,313 --> 02:26:59,717
Initially a high-ranking official serving Nero, he was baptized by the blessed priest Antoninus and taught the faith of Christ.

1238
02:26:59,717 --> 02:27:06,305
When Nero discovered he was a Christian, he handed him over to a relative, Satellicus, to force him to sacrifice.

1239
02:27:06,305 --> 02:27:11,494
Yet, strengthened by the Spirit of God, the blessed man remained unwavering in his faith.

1240
02:27:11,494 --> 02:27:16,158
Satellicus had him beaten and tied to a column, whipping him until blood flowed.

1241
02:27:16,158 --> 02:27:22,222
Suddenly, while the martyr was being beaten, the column fell, crushing the judge and fifty men with him.

1242
02:27:22,222 --> 02:27:29,684
Then, seized by the officials, he was placed on a wheel and thrown to wild beasts by Satellicus's son, but he remained unharmed.

1243
02:27:29,684 --> 02:27:39,887
Seeing his steadfastness and virtue, a counselor of Nero named Evellius came to believe in Christ, was baptized, and was soon beheaded in Rome, earning the crown of martyrdom.

1244
02:27:39,887 --> 02:27:47,525
Blessed Torpes, on the order of Sylvius, was taken outside the city of Pisa and completed his martyrdom by beheading on April 29th.

1245
02:27:47,525 --> 02:27:51,431
His feast and the gathering of citizens are celebrated on May 17th.

1246
02:27:52,656 --> 02:28:03,557
It is said that a massive machine, constructed by Nero, the enemy of God, in imitation of the heavens, was cast into the river Auxarum through his merits and prayers, never to be seen again.

1247
02:28:03,557 --> 02:28:06,598
In Alexandria, we commemorate Victorius and Basilius.

1248
02:28:06,598 --> 02:28:08,893

On May eighteenth—in Alexandria, we commemorate Potamon, Hortasius, and Serapion, the priests.

1252
02:28:21,114 --> 02:28:30,696
Also, in Egypt, we remember Dioscorus the reader, who endured many tortures from the governor, including having his nails gouged out and his sides burned with torches.

1253
02:28:30,696 --> 02:28:36,032
However, the brightness of heavenly light frightened the servants, causing them to fall down.

1254
02:28:36,032 --> 02:28:40,966
Ultimately, he completed his martyrdom after being scorched with burning metal sheets.

1255
02:28:40,966 --> 02:28:44,352
In Constantinople, we commemorate Hesychius and Eustachius.

1256
02:28:44,352 --> 02:28:54,048
On May nineteenth—in Rome, we celebrate the birth of Saint Pudentiana the virgin, daughter of Pudens, a disciple of Saint Paul the Apostle, from a distinguished lineage.

1257
02:28:54,048 --> 02:28:56,630
Her mother was Sabinella, sister of Praxedes.

1258
02:28:56,630 --> 02:29:03,400
Their devout father, Pudens, taught them in all aspects of Christian religion and dedicated them as virgins to Christ.

1259
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:10,802
After their father's death, they grew in piety, serving the Lord day and night with hymns and prayers along with their household.

1260
02:29:10,802 --> 02:29:17,400
The blessed Pius, bishop of Rome, baptized the entire family, confirming them with anointing and daily exhortation.

1261
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:30,597
The blessed virgins of Christ, after numerous struggles and tending to many martyrs' burials, dedicated all their wealth to the care of the poor, and faithfully committed to Christ, finally moved from earth to the heavenly realms.

1262
02:29:30,597 --> 02:29:36,048
Pudentiana was laid to rest on May nineteenth in the cemetery of Priscilla, on the Via Salaria.

1263
02:29:36,048 --> 02:29:38,285
Praxedes followed on July twenty-first.

1264
02:29:38,285 --> 02:29:44,711
They maintained the purity of their baptism, received in Christ from the apostles, until the end of their lives.

1265
02:29:44,711 --> 02:29:50,965
Also in Rome, we remember the birth of saints Calocerus and Parthenius, eunuchs of Decius the Emperor's wife.

1266
02:29:52,056 --> 02:30:01,370
When they refused to sacrifice to idols, both the head of the chamber and the chief scribe were executed by Decius and buried by Christians near the Appian Way.

1267
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:03,815
In Alexandria, Saint Irenaeus, the deacon.

1268
02:30:03,815 --> 02:30:08,006
In Africa, Saints Quintus, Primulius, Salustius, and many other martyrs.

1269
02:30:08,006 --> 02:30:14,526
On May 20th, in Rome, on the Via Salaria, we remember the birth of Saint Basilia, a virgin and martyr of Christ.

1270
02:30:14,526 --> 02:30:18,892
She was of royal lineage and engaged to a distinguished man named Pompeius.

1271
02:30:18,892 --> 02:30:24,655
Through the blessed Eugenia and God's holy men, Protus and Hyacinth, she converted to Christianity.

1272
02:30:24,655 --> 02:30:31,467
Her fiancé accused her of being a Christian before Emperor Gallienus, who was then a fierce persecutor of the Church.

1273
02:30:31,467 --> 02:30:36,007
He decreed that she must either return to Pompeius or face death by the sword.

1274
02:30:36,007 --> 02:30:41,654
When confronted, she declared that her true fiancé was the King of Kings, Christ, the Son of God.

1275
02:30:41,654 --> 02:30:45,205
After making this declaration, she was executed by the sword.

1276
02:30:45,205 --> 02:30:49,571
In the city of Nemausus in Gaul, the martyrdom of Saint Baldelius occurred.

1277
02:30:49,571 --> 02:30:55,043
He was captured by pagans during their sacrifices but refused to renounce his faith in Christ.

1278
02:30:55,043 --> 02:31:01,796
Despite beatings and torment, he remained steadfast and achieved martyrdom, shining brightly through numerous signs.

1279
02:31:01,796 --> 02:31:05,522
At Bourges, the burial of Austregisilus, a bishop and companion.

1280
02:31:05,522 --> 02:31:17,165
On May 21st, in the city of Caesarea in Mauretania, we commemorate the birth of Saints Timothy, Pollius, and Eutychius, deacons who spread the word of the Lord and were honored to be crowned together.

1281
02:31:17,165 --> 02:31:22,113
At Caesarea in Cappadocia, we remember the saints Polyeuctus, Victorius, and Donatus.

1282
02:31:22,113 --> 02:31:24,849
In Britain, Timothy the deacon is commemorated.

1283
02:31:24,849 --> 02:31:30,612
At Auxerre, the burial of the blessed Valis, a priest, who inspired the name Valens for our people.

1284
02:31:30,612 --> 02:31:37,016
On May 22nd, in Rome, we celebrate the birth of Saints Faustinus, Timothy, and Venustus with their companions.

1285
02:31:37,016 --> 02:31:41,847
In Corsica, we honor Saint Julia, who was crowned with the punishment of the cross.

1286
02:31:41,847 --> 02:31:47,785
In Africa, we remember Castus and Aemilius, who completed their martyrdom through the fire of passion.

1287
02:31:47,785 --> 02:31:51,686
Blessed Cyprian wrote about them in his book concerning the Fallen.

1288
02:31:51,686 --> 02:31:55,586
In Auxerre, we remember the burial of the blessed Helena, a virgin.

1289
02:31:55,586 --> 02:31:56,285
On May 23rd.

1290
02:31:57,623 --> 02:32:01,287
At Langres, we remember the martyrdom of Saint Desiderius, the bishop.

1291
02:32:01,287 --> 02:32:07,621
When he saw his people being devastated by the army of the Vandals, he went out to plead with their king on their behalf.

1292
02:32:07,621 --> 02:32:13,012
He was immediately ordered to be killed and willingly offered his neck for the people entrusted to him.

1293
02:32:13,012 --> 02:32:15,263
Struck by the sword, he departed to Christ.

1294
02:32:15,263 --> 02:32:18,298
Soon after, his attacker was struck with madness and died.

1295
02:32:18,298 --> 02:32:21,805
This blessed martyr was buried in a basilica within the city walls.

1296
02:32:21,805 --> 02:32:33,425
The faithful people, entrusted to him by Christ, ensured this was done with great love and devotion to protect the citizens, against the terrible custom of some who believed that a city is for the living, not for the dead.

1297
02:32:33,425 --> 02:32:37,665
Several others from his flock suffered with him and were buried in the same city.

1298
02:32:37,665 --> 02:32:42,899
On the same day, in Vienne, we celebrate the birth of Saint Desiderius, the bishop of the same city.

1299
02:32:42,899 --> 02:32:47,557
He suffered in the Lyon region, in the village of Prisciniacum, over the river Calaronus.

1300
02:32:47,557 --> 02:32:51,012
Now, he is buried and honorably preserved in the church of Vienne.

1301
02:32:51,012 --> 02:33:19,224
Since the venerable Father Ado, the bishop of that church in our time, thought it unnecessary to say anything special about him, as he was well-known to all, we, according to what that apostolic man wrote in the year eight hundred seventy, in the third indiction, through the most holy man, Berold, a priest native to those places but now serving Christ in the castle of Zurich, with the relics of the holy martyr Desiderius and other holy pledges, have taken care to briefly convey some things about him to those unaware of these matters.

1302
02:33:19,799 --> 02:33:26,824
Brunichildis, the most immoral queen, was proud of her wealth from Spain and was corrupted by the poison of Arianism and all vices.

1303
02:33:26,824 --> 02:33:46,448
After she expelled the chosen travelers, pilgrims of the world but citizens of the saints and household of God, namely Columbanus and his disciples, including our prominent Gallus, because they could not tolerate her crimes, from the borders of the Franks, Saint Desiderius, without their support, no longer tried to correct a wandering sheep but an untamable beast.

1304
02:33:46,448 --> 02:33:48,754
For his good deeds, he was sent into exile.

1305
02:33:48,754 --> 02:33:56,957
There, for four years, though weary from various labors, he was continually supported and relieved by the grace of God, which accompanied him everywhere.

1306
02:33:56,957 --> 02:34:03,177
Not only did he lack nothing necessary, but he also provided abundantly to all who sought him with devoted kindness.

1307
02:34:03,177 --> 02:34:09,880
A man, completely afflicted with leprosy, was restored to health by the touch of the holy man, in the presence of the people.

1308
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:21,515
A lamp, which he had lit with his own hand upon his first entry to the island where he had been exiled, burned without failing throughout that time, demonstrating the holiness of the servant of God to the inhabitants.

1309
02:34:21,515 --> 02:34:24,464
Its oil restored complete health to many who were sick.

1310
02:34:24,464 --> 02:34:36,153
A small vessel of wine, which his minister carefully preserved for refreshing the poor of Christ, was feared to have been emptied by the many who came by his order, yet was joyfully found refilled by divine generosity.

1311
02:34:36,153 --> 02:34:45,536
When he was long desired by his fellow priests and returned to his seat, he did not allow the fountain of evil to flow freely but tried to contain it within lawful boundaries.

1312
02:34:45,536 --> 02:34:49,504
However, like a raging river, Brunichildis exceeded all limits of justice.

1313
02:34:49,504 --> 02:34:58,834
She committed him, the defender of truth, to the workers of iniquity and ordered him to be taken to the city of Lyon, supposedly for a council, but in reality for punishment.

1314
02:34:59,423 --> 02:35:09,664
While some pretended not to notice the killing of the man of God, others, even more cruel, ended his suffering by first striking him severely on the head with a stone while he was praying.

1315
02:35:09,664 --> 02:35:15,655
Then they pierced his neck with a sharp stake, releasing him from this miserable life through extreme cruelty.

1316
02:35:15,655 --> 02:35:21,592
Saint Desiderius suffered without being accused of any crime, but he was hated by those guilty of wrongdoing.

1317
02:35:21,592 --> 02:35:35,427
On the mentioned day, in the village of Prisciniacum, during the reign of Emperor Maurice and King Theuderic of the Burgundians, he was killed at the instigation of Brunhilda—not a queen but a harlot—with the support of Counts Betto, Ephan, and Gasifred.

1318
02:35:35,427 --> 02:35:39,730
In the time of his successor Etherius, he was moved to Vienna with great honor.

1319
02:35:39,730 --> 02:35:48,227
Outside the city, in the church of the most blessed apostles Peter and Paul, he was buried among his predecessors, martyrs, and confessors on February 11th.

1320
02:35:48,227 --> 02:35:51,986
He continues to appear each day with signs and miracles and lives on.

1321
02:35:51,986 --> 02:35:55,690
On the same day, in Spain, Epictius and Saint Basil were remembered.

1322
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:58,794
In Africa, Quintus, Lucius, and many others were honored.

1323
02:35:58,794 --> 02:36:07,891
May 24th marks the birth of Saint Manaen, foster brother of Herod the Tetrarch, a teacher and prophet, who rests in grace under the New Testament at Antioch in Christ.

1324
02:36:07,891 --> 02:36:15,244
Also remembered is the most blessed Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, mentioned in the Gospel of Luke chapter eight, verse three.

1325
02:36:15,244 --> 02:36:18,403
In the Roman port, Saint Vincent the martyr is celebrated.

1326
02:36:18,403 --> 02:36:23,959
In the city of Nantes in Gaul, the passion of the holy brothers Donatian and Rogatian is commemorated.

1327
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:28,752
They were imprisoned in chains by an impious governor and confined in a prison workshop.

1328
02:36:28,752 --> 02:36:35,996
When brought out, as they could not be forced to deny the name of Christ, they were suspended on a rack and tortured for a long time.

1329
02:36:35,996 --> 02:36:45,310
When even this did not sway them to consent to idols, they were finally martyred, having their necks pierced by a soldier's lance, and their heads were cut off by a sword.

1330
02:36:46,127 --> 02:36:53,220
Because they were unexpectedly summoned to the governor's court due to a common accusation, Rogatianus couldn't undergo baptism.

1331
02:36:53,220 --> 02:38:38,776
I thought it was not just useful but necessary to share what Augustine, the very cautious Church teacher, wrote about this:
"Those who are to be initiated into the sacraments of baptism," he says, "typically first renounce the devil and all his works and pomp. Then, after confessing the one true God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—they are either immersed in water or sprinkled with it.
Similarly, martyrs, who have rejected and renounced idols for the same confession, are plunged into fire or even water, or they are sprinkled with their own blood.
It is customary for those baptized to be anointed with sacred chrism and confirmed by the invocation of the Holy Spirit.
Without the same Spirit's anointing, martyrs wouldn't approach their struggles, nor would they steadfastly endure various tortures.
Baptized and faithful individuals are incorporated into the same by receiving the body and blood of the Lord, and when martyrs suffer for the Lord, they become His body.
Therefore, martyrs obtain all ecclesiastical sacraments more perfectly, as they are taken from this miserable life immediately after receiving them without any contamination.
On the same day, in Istria, the feast day of Saints Zoellus, Servulus, Felix, Sylvanus, and Diocles is celebrated.
On May 25th, in Rome, on the Nomentan Way, in the cemetery of Praetextatus, we observe the feast day of Saint Urban, pope and martyr, whose teachings during Alexander's persecution led many to be crowned with martyrdom.
He decreed that Christians should not reject any food that is reasonable and human.
In Milan, we commemorate the feast day of Saint Dionysius, bishop and confessor.
He was condemned to exile in Cappadocia for his Catholic faith by Emperor Constantius, an Arian, and there he passed away.
The relics of his body were received by Saint Basil, bishop of that city, and were buried with due honor by Saint Ambrose.

1332
02:38:38,831 --> 02:38:42,815
Some say he was exiled to Armenia, in the city of Reditium, where he died.

1333
02:38:42,815 --> 02:38:47,122
However, he was later moved to Milan by Saint Aurelius, the bishop of that city.

1334
02:38:47,122 --> 02:38:54,550
It's believed that Aurelius, who fell ill and died there, was buried in the same tomb as Saint Dionysius, just as they had agreed in life.

1335
02:38:54,550 --> 02:39:04,294
In Rome, during the time of Pope Eleutherius, who was bishop for 15 years, he received letters from Lucius, the king of the Britons, asking to become a Christian under his guidance.

1336
02:39:04,294 --> 02:39:10,054
Timothy, a holy man, reports that Lucius, having rejected worldly pursuits, traveled freely and unburdened.

1337
02:39:10,054 --> 02:39:17,913
He is thought to have converted part of the Bavarians and all of Rhaetia, located in the Alps, to Christianity through his miracles and preaching.

1338
02:39:17,913 --> 02:39:25,073
The tomb of the one resting in Rhaetia, whether it be the former king or a servant of God, is famous for frequent displays of virtue.

1339
02:39:25,073 --> 02:39:33,578
On the same day, in Moesia, in the city of Dorostorum, we honor the birth of the holy martyrs Pasicrates, Valention, and two others who were crowned together.

1340
02:39:33,578 --> 02:39:37,939
On May 26, we celebrate the birth of Saint Quadratus, a disciple of the Apostles.

1341
02:39:37,939 --> 02:39:46,498
Appointed as bishop of Athens in place of the blessed Publius, he gathered the Church, which had been dispersed by great fear, through his faith and diligence.

1342
02:39:46,498 --> 02:39:56,834
When Hadrian spent the winter in Athens, visiting Eleusis and initiating many of the sacred rites of Greece, it allowed those who hated Christians to harass them without the emperor's command.

1343
02:39:56,834 --> 02:40:03,186
Quadratus presented him with a book composed for our religion, full of reason and faith, worthy of apostolic teaching.

1344
02:40:03,186 --> 02:40:11,422
He demonstrated the antiquity of his age, claiming to have healed many who had been afflicted by various calamities in Judea during the time of the Lord.

1345
02:40:11,422 --> 02:40:15,567
He was renowned, along with the daughters of Philip, for his prophetic grace.

1346
02:40:15,567 --> 02:40:21,758
In Africa, on the feast of Saint Quadratus the martyr, sermons by Saint Augustine are known to have been delivered.

1347
02:40:22,511 --> 02:40:29,730
In Rome, the priest Symmitrius and twenty-two others were executed by order of Emperor Antoninus for their faith in Christ.

1348
02:40:29,730 --> 02:40:35,599
Their bodies were gathered by the blessed Praxedes at night and buried in the cemetery of Priscilla.

1349
02:40:35,599 --> 02:40:39,531
In Todi, Tuscany, there were Felicissimus, Heraclius, and Paulinus.

1350
02:40:39,531 --> 02:40:44,050
In the territory of Auxerre, Saint Priscus was martyred before a large crowd.

1351
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:47,747
In Britain, Saint Augustine, bishop and confessor, passed away.

1352
02:40:47,747 --> 02:40:57,665
He was sent by the blessed Pope Gregory as the first to preach the Gospel of Christ to the English people, and he rested in peace, renowned for his virtues and miracles.

1353
02:40:57,665 --> 02:41:03,534
On May 27th—In Alexandria, the birth of the saints Aquilus the priest, Evangelus, and twelve others.

1354
02:41:03,534 --> 02:41:07,936
In Tomis, Elijah, Lucian, Zoticus, Martial, Victor, and Maurinus were born.

1355
02:41:07,936 --> 02:41:09,814
In Sardinia, Salustian was born.

1356
02:41:09,814 --> 02:41:13,335
In Moesia, in the city of Durostorum, Saint Julius was born.

1357
02:41:13,335 --> 02:41:17,267
During a time of persecution, he was a veteran and retired soldier.

1358
02:41:17,267 --> 02:41:21,082
He was captured by officials and brought before Governor Maximus.

1359
02:41:21,082 --> 02:41:28,065
Refusing to sacrifice to idols and steadfastly confessing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he was sentenced to death.

1360
02:41:28,065 --> 02:42:14,957
As he was led to the place of execution, a soldier named Hesychius, who was also detained for his faith in Christ, asked him, "Remember me, for I will follow you soon."
He also asked him to greet Pasicrates and Valentine, servants of God, who had already preceded them to the Lord through their good confession.
Julius, kissing Hesychius, said, "Brother, hurry to come; those you greeted have already heard your message."
Then, having received a cloth, he covered his eyes and accepted the palm of martyrdom as the sword struck.
In the city of Orange in Gaul, Saint Eutropius, bishop, was known for his virtues and miracles, which were eloquently described by Bishop Verus.
On May 28th—In Sardinia, the martyrdom of Saints Aemilius, Felix, Priamus, and Lucian.
In Rome, the birth of Saint Pope John.

1361
02:42:15,719 --> 02:42:29,027
Because he was orthodox and had been warmly welcomed by Justin, the orthodox emperor, during his visit to Constantinople, Theoderic, the Arian king, detained him on his return to Ravenna and led him to his death along with other equally Catholic men.

1362
02:42:29,027 --> 02:42:31,795
Saint Gregory mentions him in the Book of Dialogues.

1363
02:42:31,795 --> 02:42:38,662
His body was moved from Ravenna and buried in the Basilica of Saint Peter the Apostle on May 28, with Olibrius serving as consul.

1364
02:42:38,662 --> 02:42:44,571
At that time, King Theoderic also killed two distinguished senators and former consuls, Symmachus and Boethius.

1365
02:42:44,571 --> 02:42:51,704
Theoderic died suddenly on the ninety-eighth day after Pope John passed away and was thrown into Vulcan’s pot, never to be seen again.

1366
02:42:51,704 --> 02:42:56,388
Also, in the city of Paris, we remember the deposition of Bishop and Confessor Germanus.

1367
02:42:56,388 --> 02:43:01,498
He was born to noble parents and faced numerous malicious plots, but divine grace protected him.

1368
02:43:01,498 --> 02:43:13,422
Not only did he escape alive and unharmed, but he also grew in strength, virtues, and wisdom to the point that he was ordained a priest by Saint Nectarius and reluctantly appointed abbot of the monastery of Saint Symphorian.

1369
02:43:13,422 --> 02:43:25,719
In his leadership, he pleased both divine judgment and human decision to such an extent that he received the keys to the city gate of Paris, first in a vision from the Lord and later through the people's election to the episcopate.

1370
02:43:25,719 --> 02:43:32,905
He administered his office with authority, and following the example of Blessed Martin, he maintained the purpose and virtue of a monk.

1371
02:43:32,905 --> 02:43:45,042
Therefore, living in the flesh but seeking the heavens in spirit, he appeared similar to Martin in all aspects through the display of miracles, and at the age of eighty, he passed away to Christ, called by Him, full of holiness.

1372
02:43:45,042 --> 02:43:49,407
On May 29, in Rome, on the Via Aurelia, we remember the birth of Saint Restitutus.

1373
02:43:49,407 --> 02:43:51,536
On the Via Tiburtina, the seven Germans.

1374
02:43:51,536 --> 02:43:57,977
At Iconium in the province of Isauria, Saint Conon and his son were martyred under Emperor Aurelian, with Judge Domitian.

1375
02:43:57,977 --> 02:44:06,334
Renowned for their faith, when presented to the judge with his twelve-year-old son, they manifested the Holy Spirit dwelling in them through true confession.

1376
02:44:07,079 --> 02:44:13,086
First, they were placed on a hot iron, then on a gridiron with coals underneath, and oil was poured over them.

1377
02:44:13,086 --> 02:44:17,345
Then, thrown into a frying pan, they endured everything in the name of Christ.

1378
02:44:17,345 --> 02:44:26,900
Afterward, they were suspended, and with a strong fire applied below, their hands were crushed with a hot hammer as they praised the almighty God while giving up their spirit.

1379
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:36,510
On the same day, in the region of Anagnia, near the city of Trento, the martyrdom of Saints Sisinnius the Deacon, Martyrius the Reader, and Alexander the Doorkeeper took place.

1380
02:44:36,510 --> 02:44:43,172
Sent by the blessed Vigilius, the Bishop of Trento, to preach in nearby areas, they converted many to the faith of Christ.

1381
02:44:43,172 --> 02:44:48,195
However, those who preferred to remain in the error of paganism killed them in various ways.

1382
02:44:48,195 --> 02:44:58,296
The blessed Sisinnius, along with the others, was killed after prolonged torture, struck on the head with a brass trumpet, and pierced with axes, lying near the threshold of the church.

1383
02:44:58,296 --> 02:45:03,811
Saint Martyrius was also wounded in the head with axes and pierced with stakes, giving up his spirit.

1384
02:45:03,811 --> 02:45:14,786
Then, the pagans took the bodies of Saints Sisinnius and Martyrius, along with Saint Alexander, who was still half-alive, to the altar of Saturn, where a large fire was burning, intending to burn them.

1385
02:45:14,786 --> 02:45:24,942
They beat Saint Alexander with whips and, unable to force him to sacrifice to idols, threw him alive into the fire, completing his martyrdom and receiving the palm of glorious suffering.

1386
02:45:24,942 --> 02:45:34,607
After their death, a shadow covered the entire region, accompanied by frequent lightning strikes, so much so that even the impious confessed this happened because of the saints.

1387
02:45:34,607 --> 02:45:48,421
When the relics were later received with great devotion by the people of Milan, a blind man from the Dalmatian coast, divinely inspired, came and, upon touching the shrine, regained his sight, as the blessed Paulinus writes in the Life of Saint Ambrose.

1388
02:45:48,421 --> 02:45:51,807
In Trier, the burial of Saint Maximinus the Bishop took place.

1389
02:45:51,807 --> 02:45:59,506
His priestly garments were found incorrupt in a bronze urn up to our time, or rather the time of the Normans, as a testimony to his holiness.

1390
02:46:00,216 --> 02:46:04,978
Saint Athanasius, while fleeing from Constantius's persecution, was welcomed with honor.

1391
02:46:04,978 --> 02:46:16,289
However, because some people, either out of fear or blasphemy, were misinterpreting his flight, I felt it was important to share what the devoted steward of the Church, Augustine, thought, using his own words.

1392
02:46:16,289 --> 02:46:29,765
Augustine addressed this in a letter to Honoratus, a bishop who asked for guidance on whether bishops should flee their posts during times of persecution:
In your letter, you ask: If we stay in the Churches, how will we help ourselves or the people?

1393
02:46:29,765 --> 02:46:36,854
Men will fall before our eyes, women will suffer, churches will burn, and we will face torture when they demand what we don't have.

1394
02:46:36,854 --> 02:46:42,375
Augustine replied: God can indeed listen to the prayers of His people and prevent these feared events.

1395
02:46:42,375 --> 02:46:53,253
Yet, because of these uncertainties, we shouldn't abandon our duty, as without it, the people face certain destruction—not in this life, but in the next, which requires much greater care and attention.

1396
02:46:53,253 --> 02:47:01,425
If these feared evils were certain to occur in the places we are, then everyone we need to stay for would flee first, freeing us from the need to stay.

1397
02:47:01,425 --> 02:47:06,404
No one would suggest that ministers should remain where there are no longer people to serve.

1398
02:47:06,404 --> 02:47:17,606
Some holy bishops from Spain fled after part of their congregations had already fled, been killed, besieged, or scattered by captivity; but many more stayed, enduring the same dangers for those who remained.

1399
02:47:17,606 --> 02:47:26,752
If some left their congregations, we say this should not be done: for they were not guided by divine authority but were either misled by human error or overcome by fear.

1400
02:47:27,239 --> 02:47:40,247
Why do they believe they should follow commands without thinking critically, especially when reading about fleeing from city to city, and not avoiding the hired hand who runs away at the sight of the wolf because he doesn't care for the sheep?

1401
02:47:40,247 --> 02:47:46,563
Why don’t they try to understand these two true statements of the Lord in a way that shows they are not contradictory?

1402
02:47:46,563 --> 02:47:56,466
How can this be understood unless we consider, as I’ve mentioned before, that Christ’s ministers should leave places where they’re persecuted if there’s no Christian community to serve?

1403
02:47:56,466 --> 02:48:02,032
Or even if there is a community, and others can fulfill the necessary ministry without the need to flee?

1404
02:48:02,032 --> 02:48:13,113
Just as the Apostle was lowered in a basket and escaped when specifically targeted by the persecutor, while others there didn’t face the same necessity, so the ministry to the Church should not be abandoned.

1405
02:48:13,113 --> 02:48:22,694
Just as Saint Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria, fled when Emperor Constantius sought to capture him, leaving the Catholic community in Alexandria supported by other ministers.

1406
02:48:22,694 --> 02:48:31,687
But when a community remains and ministers flee, withdrawing their ministry, isn’t that a disgraceful escape like that of a hired hand who doesn’t care about the sheep?

1407
02:48:31,687 --> 02:48:40,144
The wolf arrives, not as a human, but as the devil, who often convinces the faithful to become apostates when they lack the daily ministry of the Lord’s body.

1408
02:48:40,144 --> 02:48:46,246
The weak will perish, not because of your knowledge, but because of your ignorance, brother, for whom Christ died.

1409
02:48:46,246 --> 02:48:55,935
As for those who aren’t mistaken but are overcome by fear: why don’t they, with the Lord’s mercy and help, bravely face their fears to prevent far more serious evils from occurring?

1410
02:48:55,935 --> 02:49:00,164
Let this happen where the love of God burns, not where worldly desires smolder.

1411
02:49:00,164 --> 02:49:02,626
For love says: Who is weak, and I am not weak?

1412
02:49:02,626 --> 02:49:05,623
Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with indignation?

1413
02:49:05,623 --> 02:49:07,176
First Corinthians Chapter 11.

1414
02:49:07,871 --> 02:49:09,148
But love comes from God.

1415
02:49:09,148 --> 02:49:12,286
Let us pray, then, that it is given by Him who commands it.

1416
02:49:12,286 --> 02:49:24,413
Through this, may we fear more that Christ's flock is harmed by spiritual wickedness in their hearts, rather than being physically slain, wherever, whenever, with whomever, and by whatever kind of death they are destined to die.

1417
02:49:24,413 --> 02:49:31,807
Let us fear more that, with a corrupted inner sense, the purity of faith is lost, rather than women being violently assaulted in the flesh.

1418
02:49:31,807 --> 02:49:42,817
Physical violence does not violate chastity if the mind remains intact; it is not violated in the flesh when the sufferer's will does not disgracefully use the body, but endures what is done without consent.

1419
02:49:42,817 --> 02:49:50,742
Let us fear more that the living stones are neglected and extinguished, rather than seeing earthly buildings of stone and wood set on fire before us.

1420
02:49:50,742 --> 02:50:00,263
Let us fear more that the members of the body of Christ, deprived of spiritual nourishment, are killed, rather than our own bodies' members being tormented by the enemy's assault.

1421
02:50:00,263 --> 02:50:07,656
Not because these things shouldn't be avoided when possible, but because they should be endured when they can't be avoided without impiety.

1422
02:50:07,656 --> 02:50:13,879
Unless perhaps someone argues that it isn't impious for a minister to withdraw necessary piety when it's most needed.

1423
02:50:13,879 --> 02:50:20,953
Do we not consider, when faced with these extreme dangers and no way to escape, the rush within the Church from all genders and ages?

1424
02:50:20,953 --> 02:50:29,730
Some demand baptism, others seek reconciliation, and some even seek penance itself, all searching for comfort and the preparation and distribution of the sacraments.

1425
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:35,315
If ministers are absent, what a loss occurs for those who leave this world without being reborn or bound!

1426
02:50:35,315 --> 02:50:41,219
How great is the faithful's grief over losing their children, who they will not have with them in eternal life!

1427
02:50:41,219 --> 02:50:47,974
Finally, how great is the groaning of all, and how great is the blasphemy of some over the absence of ministries and ministers!

1428
02:50:47,974 --> 02:50:53,399
See what the fear of temporary evils does, and how much it increases the acquisition of eternal evils.

1429
02:50:54,144 --> 02:51:03,049
However, when ministers are present, they help everyone as much as God allows: some are baptized, others find reconciliation, and no one is denied communion with the body of the Lord.

1430
02:51:03,049 --> 02:51:08,061
Everyone is comforted, strengthened, and encouraged to pray to God, who can prevent all that is feared.

1431
02:51:08,061 --> 02:51:14,923
They are ready for any outcome, so that if they cannot escape this trial, they accept that His will be done, as He cannot wish anything evil.

1432
02:51:14,923 --> 02:51:21,930
You now realize what you wrote but did not see before: how much good Christian people do when Christ's ministers are present during tough times.

1433
02:51:21,930 --> 02:52:32,541
You also see the harm in their absence, as they may seek their own interests instead of those of Jesus Christ, lacking the love described as, "It does not seek its own" from First Corinthians Chapter Thirteen. They do not imitate the one who said, "Not seeking my own benefit, but that of many, that they may be saved" from First Corinthians Chapter Ten.
He would not have avoided the plots of that persecuting leader unless he wanted to preserve himself for others who needed him. For this reason, he says, "I am torn between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better; but to remain in the flesh is necessary for your sake" from Philippians Chapter One.
However, some might say that God's ministers should flee such impending dangers to preserve themselves for the church's benefit in more peaceful times. This is rightly done when there are others who can fulfill the ecclesiastical ministry, ensuring it is not abandoned by all, as we mentioned earlier about Athanasius. The catholic faith, defended against the Arian heretics by his words and care, knows how necessary and beneficial it was for the Church that he remained in the flesh.
We include this summary of the holy Father Athanasius here for its great benefit to the readers, as I believe it will encourage them to explore the entire work, due to its engaging nature.
May thirtieth---Rome, on the Aurelia road, in the cemetery of Saint Felix the Pope.

1434
02:52:32,736 --> 02:52:37,896
After leading the Church for five years during Emperor Claudius's reign, he was martyred.

1435
02:52:37,896 --> 02:52:42,187
He established that masses should be celebrated over the tombs of martyrs.

1436
02:52:42,187 --> 02:52:48,682
In Antioch, Saints Isychius and Palatinus, as Saint Jerome writes, endured many tortures for the name of Christ.

1437
02:52:48,682 --> 02:52:52,567
In Turribus, Sardinia, were the holy martyrs Gabinus and Crispulus.

1438
02:52:52,567 --> 02:52:54,771
In Nicomedia, there were many martyrs.

1439
02:52:54,771 --> 02:53:01,439
On May 31st in Rome, we remember the birth of Saint Petronella, a virgin and daughter of the blessed Apostle Peter.

1440
02:53:01,439 --> 02:53:04,802
At the request of the faithful, he cured her of paralysis.

1441
02:53:04,802 --> 02:53:13,210
However, after demonstrating this miracle of healing in the name of Christ, he instructed her to return to her bed for the salvation of her soul.

1442
02:53:13,210 --> 02:53:19,763
As she grew in the fear of God, not only was she saved, but she also brought healing to many through her prayers.

1443
02:53:19,763 --> 02:53:23,416
Because of her great beauty, Count Flaccus wished to marry her.

1444
02:53:23,416 --> 02:53:31,128
The holy virgin requested a three-day delay, which she spent fasting and praying with her nurse Felicula, who was also a holy virgin.

1445
02:53:31,128 --> 02:53:41,334
When Saint Nicomedes the priest came to celebrate the mysteries of Christ, as soon as she received the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord, she departed to eternal joy.

1446
02:53:41,334 --> 02:53:50,728
On the same day in Aquileia, we commemorate the passion of the holy siblings Cantius, Cantianus, and Cantianilla, who achieved martyrdom under Diocletian's reign.

1447
02:53:50,728 --> 02:53:53,743
In Turribus, Sardinia, we honor Saint Crescentianus.

1448
02:53:53,743 --> 02:54:01,108
In Spain, in the city of Gerunda, we remember the holy Germanus, Victurius, Sylvanus, Telesphorus, Victorinus, and many others.

1449
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:05,085
June: The month of June has 30 days.

1450
02:54:05,085 --> 02:54:10,536
In the second week, there will be a celebration of the Fasts.

1451
02:54:10,536 --> 02:54:18,435
June 1st
In Rome, we commemorate the dedication of Saint Nicomedes, a priest and martyr, whose martyrdom is celebrated on September 15.

1452
02:54:18,435 --> 02:54:27,856
Also in Rome, we recognize the birth of Lycia, a virgin, and Auceias, a king of the barbarians, along with Rogatus, Germanus, Sylvanus, and more than 300 others.

1453
02:54:27,856 --> 02:54:31,249
In Thessalonica, we celebrate the birth of Saint Octavius.

1454
02:54:31,249 --> 02:54:33,765
In Antioch, we remember Zosimus and Thecla.

1455
02:54:33,765 --> 02:54:40,729
At Caesarea in Palestine, we honor the passion of Saint Pamphilus, a priest known for his admirable faith and holiness.

1456
02:54:40,729 --> 02:54:44,590
He was crowned with martyrdom during the persecution of Maximinus.

1457
02:54:44,590 --> 02:54:48,686
His life was recorded by Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, in three books.

1458
02:54:48,686 --> 02:56:11,542
The blessed Jerome also writes that he found some volumes written in Pamphilus's hand:
"These," he says, "I embrace and cherish as if they were the treasures of Croesus.
For if it is a joy to have even one letter from a martyr, how much more to have so many thousands of verses, which seem to be marked with the traces of his own blood."
On the same day, we remember the burial of Saint Caprasius, abbot of the monastery of Lerins.
In Vienne, we commemorate Claudius and Helladius, bishops.
June 2:
In Rome, we celebrate the birth of Saints Marcellinus, a priest, and Peter, an exorcist.
They converted many in prison to the faith of Christ, and after enduring severe imprisonment and many tortures, were beheaded during the persecution of Diocletian, under the judge Severus.
Their executioner witnessed their souls, beautifully adorned, being carried to heaven by angels, and, repenting, was baptized by Pope Julius in his old age, taking the name Dorotheus.
Of the many who, through their teaching, believed in Christ and were baptized, 300 men and even more women, Artemius was beheaded along with his wife Candida and daughter Paulina, who was freed from a demon by the blessed Peter the exorcist.
Also in Rome, we remember 180 martyrs and many more, whose names are known only to God.
At Lyon in Gaul, we honor the birth of 48 martyrs during the times of Marcus Aurelius Verus, Antoninus, and Lucius, his sons.

1459
02:56:11,951 --> 02:56:22,824
During a time when persecutions against Christians were fiercely stirred up across many provinces of the Roman Empire due to public outcry and unrest, countless thousands of martyrs arose in various places.

1460
02:56:22,824 --> 02:56:29,474
In the cities of Lyon and Vienne in Gaul, the treatment of God's servants surpassed all descriptions of torture and suffering.

1461
02:56:29,474 --> 02:56:34,910
Initially, they were forbidden to live in their homes, then they were denied the use of wine and baths.

1462
02:56:34,910 --> 02:56:39,290
Eventually, they were prohibited from appearing in public or private places at all.

1463
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:49,318
Finally, when a certain tribune and the city's leaders were present, the Christians were seized by the people's shouts and thrown into prison until they could be brought before the governor.

1464
02:56:49,318 --> 02:56:55,757
The governor showed such cruelty to each of those who arrived that no one could fully describe the forms of his brutality.

1465
02:56:55,757 --> 02:57:09,479
Among these martyrs, although all were found to be faithful and brave in Christ, certain individuals stood out before God and humans: Photinus, the bishop, who was burdened with ninety years of age, was taken from the church to the tribunal and then to prison.

1466
02:57:09,479 --> 02:57:13,860
After enduring extreme beatings and injuries, he soon after peacefully passed away.

1467
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:18,715
Zacharias, the priest, gave his life in defense of his brothers, following Christ's example.

1468
02:57:18,715 --> 02:57:24,099
There was also Repagatus, who, being very noble and learned, was killed as an advocate for Christians.

1469
02:57:24,099 --> 02:57:35,340
A deacon, holy in name and deeds, suffered unheard-of tortures, such as having burning copper and iron plates applied to the most sensitive parts of his body and being placed on an iron chair with fire underneath.

1470
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:38,138
Yet, he could not be swayed from his faith in Christ.

1471
02:57:38,138 --> 02:57:42,782
Along with Attalus and Maturus, who were beheaded, they achieved the crown of martyrdom.

1472
02:57:43,415 --> 02:57:49,959
Blandina, a woman whose fragility was a concern for everyone, endured tortures from dawn until evening.

1473
02:57:49,959 --> 02:57:56,502
Eventually, her torturers admitted defeat; even after a second round of torture, she remained unbroken.

1474
02:57:56,502 --> 02:58:03,299
On the third day, she was tied to a stake, stretched out like a cross, and prepared as food for the beasts.

1475
02:58:03,299 --> 02:58:08,381
However, when none of the beasts dared to touch her, she was returned to prison.

1476
02:58:08,381 --> 02:58:16,321
On the fourth day, she endured beatings, burns on grates, and many other hardships, before finally being killed by the sword.

1477
02:58:16,321 --> 02:58:22,166
There was also a 15-year-old boy named Ponticus, who endured various torments alongside her.

1478
02:58:22,166 --> 02:58:27,311
Strengthened by her maternal encouragement, he achieved martyrdom before she did.

1479
02:58:27,311 --> 02:58:35,061
Alexander, a physician by profession and Phrygian by birth, overcame all types of torture and went victoriously to Christ.

1480
02:58:35,061 --> 02:58:41,477
You can read more about him in the fifth book of Church History, from which these accounts are drawn.

1481
02:58:41,477 --> 02:59:05,045
The names of these martyrs include: Photinus the bishop, Zacharias the priest, Sanctus the deacon, Vetitius, also known as Repagatus, Macharius, Asclepiades, also called Alcibiades, Silvius, Primus, Ulpius, Vitalis, Comminus, October, Philominus, Geminus, Vilia, Albina, Grata, Rogata, Aemilia, Potamia, Pompeia, Rhodana, Biblis, Quarta, Matema, Elpis, also called Ammas.

1482
02:59:05,045 --> 02:59:07,967
These individuals were killed in various ways.

1483
02:59:07,967 --> 02:59:25,246
Those thrown to the beasts included: the aforementioned Sanctus, Maturus, Attalus, Alexander, Ponticus, Blandina, Aristeus, Cornelius, Zosimus, Titus, Julius, Zoticus, Apollonius, Geminianus, Julia, Ausonia, Aemilia, Jannica, Pompeia, Domna, Justa, Throphima, and Antonia.

1484
02:59:25,246 --> 02:59:29,947
The remains of all of them were burned and scattered into the Rhone River.

1485
02:59:29,947 --> 02:59:41,318
However, through revelations by the martyrs themselves, they were gathered and placed in the Church of the Apostles, where they are said to live before God with frequent miracles.

1486
02:59:42,143 --> 02:59:50,786
The citizens of Lyon celebrate this feast joyfully, gathering from all directions and moving down the river with hymns and songs of thanksgiving.

1487
02:59:50,786 --> 02:59:59,190
They hold a festive mass in the church, dedicating it to the Lord, and refer to this day as the Day of Miracles, following ancient tradition.

1488
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:05,509
The location of their suffering is called Athenaco, which is why they are known as the Athenacian martyrs.

1489
03:00:05,509 --> 03:00:12,125
On June 3rd in Rome, we remember the holy martyrs Marcellus, Avidius, Gaius, Donatus, and more than 150 others.

1490
03:00:12,125 --> 03:00:18,204
In Africa, we honor Quirinus, Abidianus, Neophorus, Pambo, Januaria, Demetria, Zincus, and 149 others.

1491
03:00:18,204 --> 03:00:24,821
In Aritium, a city in Tuscany, the holy martyrs Pergentinus and Laurentinus, who were brothers, are remembered.

1492
03:00:24,821 --> 03:00:37,159
During Decius's persecution, under Judge Tertius, while still children, they endured severe tortures and performed many miracles before being beheaded and buried in the same city, along with over 400 others.

1493
03:00:37,159 --> 03:00:41,391
In Campania, we remember blessed Erasmus, bishop of Antioch and martyr.

1494
03:00:41,391 --> 03:00:46,636
He led an eremitic life on Mount Lebanon for seven years, performing many wonders there.

1495
03:00:46,636 --> 03:00:54,921
Later, he was captured by Emperor Diocletian, who ordered him to be cruelly beaten with lead whips and tortured for a long time with clubs.

1496
03:00:54,921 --> 03:01:01,835
Afterwards, he was covered with melted resin, sulfur, lead, pitch, wax, and oil, yet miraculously appeared unharmed.

1497
03:01:01,835 --> 03:01:06,663
Seeing this, many people turned away from idols and embraced the Christian faith.

1498
03:01:06,663 --> 03:01:13,696
Then, bound with heavy iron weights, he was imprisoned under harsh conditions, but was freed by an angelic visitation.

1499
03:01:13,696 --> 03:01:26,392
However, his fame reached Emperor Maximian, and he was tortured again with even harsher punishments, including wearing a heated bronze tunic and being thrown into a boiling pot of lead, pitch, wax, resin, and oil.

1500
03:01:26,392 --> 03:01:35,333
Yet, through the power of the Lord, he emerged unharmed and, supported by angelic guidance, reached Campania, where he continued to strengthen others.

1501
03:01:36,167 --> 03:01:40,030
He strengthened many in faith or converted them to Christianity.

1502
03:01:40,030 --> 03:01:43,892
Called by the Lord, he rested in peace, known for his martyrdom.

1503
03:01:43,892 --> 03:01:48,298
The burial of Saint Leifard, a priest, took place in Orléans on June 4th.

1504
03:01:48,298 --> 03:01:53,186
In the city of Novidunum, there were Zoticos, Attalos, Eutyches, and many others.

1505
03:01:53,186 --> 03:01:57,229
In Sicily, the holy martyrs Expergentius and Cista were celebrated.

1506
03:01:57,229 --> 03:02:01,816
In Pannonia, in the city of Sabaria, Rutulus and two others were recognized.

1507
03:02:01,816 --> 03:02:06,161
In Illyricum, in the city of Fiscia, Saint Quirinus, a bishop, was born.

1508
03:02:06,161 --> 03:02:13,221
During the persecution under Maximian, for his faith in Christ, he was tied to a millstone and thrown into the river.

1509
03:02:13,221 --> 03:02:19,196
He spoke for a long time to those around him, encouraging them not to be frightened by his example.

1510
03:02:19,196 --> 03:02:22,877
Through prayer, he finally obtained his wish to be submerged.

1511
03:02:22,877 --> 03:02:26,800
His remains were transferred to Rome and placed in the Catacombs.

1512
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:31,869
On June 5th, in Egypt, the holy martyrs Marcian, Nicander, and Apollonius were born.

1513
03:02:31,869 --> 03:02:37,964
In Rome, at the seventh milestone, Felicula and Felicitas, along with many others, were commemorated.

1514
03:02:37,964 --> 03:02:44,301
In Istria, Zoilus, Satyrus, Tymon, Saturninus, Servulus, Felix, Sylvanus, and Fortunatus were remembered.

1515
03:02:44,301 --> 03:02:52,810
Also in Rome, Saint Boniface, a martyr under Diocletian and Maximian, suffered at Tarsus in Cilicia but was buried in Rome on the Via Latina.

1516
03:02:52,810 --> 03:02:55,707
He was the steward of a noblewoman named Aglaes.

1517
03:02:55,707 --> 03:03:04,819
While in a sinful relationship with her, both were eventually moved by divine prompting and decided to send Boniface to seek the bodies of the martyrs.

1518
03:03:04,819 --> 03:03:10,734
They hoped that by serving and honoring them, they might deserve to be saved through their merits.

1519
03:03:11,759 --> 03:03:17,813
After several days, he arrived in Tarsus and rushed to the site where the holy martyrs were facing their trials.

1520
03:03:17,813 --> 03:03:31,975
He saw one person hanging by their feet over a fire, another stretched out on four pieces of wood enduring prolonged suffering, another being torn with claws, another with their hands cut off, and another with a stake fixed in their neck, lifted from the ground.

1521
03:03:31,975 --> 03:03:40,786
Witnessing these various tortures arranged by the cruel executioner, he was filled with love for Christ and began to call out to the great God of the holy martyrs.

1522
03:03:40,786 --> 03:05:02,405
He ran to them, sat at their feet, kissed their chains, and said,
"Fight on, martyrs of Christ, trample the devil, persevere a little longer. The labor is indeed small, but the rest is great, and the satisfaction afterward is indescribable."
Judge Simplicius, seeing this, ordered him to be brought before the court and asked,
"Who are you?"
Saint Boniface replied,
"I am a Christian, and my name is Boniface."
The judge, angered, ordered him to be hung and his body to be scraped with claws until his bones were visible. Then, sharp reeds were driven under the nails of his hands. Despite this, the holy martyr, looking up to heaven, cheerfully endured the pain.
Seeing this, the cruel judge ordered his mouth to be opened and boiling lead to be poured in. The holy martyr said,
"I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God."
Then, the judge ordered a pot to be brought and filled with pitch, and the holy martyr to be thrown headfirst into the boiling pitch. But since he was unharmed, the cruel judge ordered his head to be cut off with a sword. After this was done, a great earthquake occurred, causing many unbelievers to witness the power of Christ in the martyr and believe.
His companions took his body, anointed it with spices, and brought it to the city of Rome. An angel of the Lord appeared to his former mistress, informing her of the blessed martyr's deeds. She immediately met the holy body with all reverence, built a worthy memorial for it, and laid it to rest five miles from the city of Rome.

1523
03:05:02,567 --> 03:05:11,242
Blessed Aglae gave up the world's vanities, distributing all her possessions to the needy and monasteries, and freeing her entire household from servitude.

1524
03:05:11,242 --> 03:05:16,390
She gained such grace from the Lord that she became renowned for virtuous signs in His name.

1525
03:05:16,390 --> 03:05:22,770
Living in a nun's habit for 13 years, she completed her life with pious deeds and was buried near the same martyr.

1526
03:05:22,770 --> 03:05:29,597
Blessed Boniface was martyred on May 14th in the city of Tarsus, Cilicia's metropolis, but was buried on June 5th in Rome.

1527
03:05:29,597 --> 03:05:34,018
On the same day in Frisia, Saint Boniface, the bishop, also suffered martyrdom.

1528
03:05:34,018 --> 03:05:39,447
He came from Britain, preached the Christian faith, and converted many in Frisia to Christianity.

1529
03:05:39,447 --> 03:05:52,654
Ultimately, he was slain by the remaining pagans with a sword, achieving martyrdom alongside Bishop Eoban and other servants of God, named Wintrug, Walthere, Skirwald, Bosan, Hamund, Hethere, Wacchar, Gundachar, Willehere, and Hadovolf.

1530
03:05:52,654 --> 03:05:59,593
Among them was Willibald, a priest renowned for his virtues and teachings, and his sister Waldburga, noted for her holiness.

1531
03:05:59,593 --> 03:06:08,715
On June 6th is the commemoration of Saint Philip, one of the first seven deacons ordained by the apostles along with blessed Stephen, right after Christ's passion.

1532
03:06:08,715 --> 03:06:17,837
According to the Acts of the Apostles, chapter six, verse eight, he performed signs and wonders, converting the Samaritans to Christ's faith through his preaching.

1533
03:06:17,837 --> 03:06:30,204
He baptized the eunuch, a diligent student of the Scriptures under Queen Candace of the Ethiopians, at a spring near the village of Betsura, in the tribe of Judah, on the road from Elijah to Hebron, at the 20th milestone.

1534
03:06:30,204 --> 03:06:39,270
He later rested in Caesarea, where his three daughters, virgins and prophets, are buried, while his fourth daughter, filled with the Holy Spirit, died in Ephesus.

1535
03:06:39,270 --> 03:06:45,594
However, some believe they are buried in Hierapolis, where Philip the apostle, one of the twelve, is also buried.

1536
03:06:45,594 --> 03:06:48,448
Some writers have thought these were his daughters.

1537
03:06:49,175 --> 03:07:01,399
The authority of blessed Luke challenges their opinion by recounting this story:
We entered the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven; he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.

1538
03:07:01,399 --> 03:07:13,319
(Acts chapter twenty-one)
In Tarsus of Cilicia, twenty people were martyred under the judge Simplicius during the reign of Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, glorifying God through various tortures.

1539
03:07:13,319 --> 03:07:17,252
This was previously mentioned in the passion of blessed Boniface.

1540
03:07:17,252 --> 03:07:21,790
In Rome, the saints Artemius, his wife Candida, and their daughter Paulina.

1541
03:07:21,790 --> 03:07:27,297
Artemius, who was the keeper of the prison, held the blessed Peter the exorcist in custody.

1542
03:07:27,297 --> 03:07:37,765
After his only daughter Paulina was freed from a demon, he believed in Christ and was baptized by the blessed presbyter Marcellinus along with his household and many others.

1543
03:07:37,765 --> 03:07:45,450
The judge Serenus, troubled by this news, ordered that Artemius, Candida, and Paulina be buried under a great weight of rubble.

1544
03:07:45,450 --> 03:07:55,373
Thus, the saints were led to their place of passion; blessed Artemius was struck by the sword, while holy Paulina and Candida were buried beneath stones in a crypt.

1545
03:07:55,373 --> 03:07:58,701
In Noviodunum, Amantius, Lucius, and blessed Alexander.

1546
03:07:58,701 --> 03:08:01,001
In Alexandria, Donatus and Peregrinus.

1547
03:08:01,001 --> 03:08:05,358
June seventh—In Caesarea of Cappadocia, the martyrdom of blessed Lucian.

1548
03:08:05,358 --> 03:08:10,259
In Byzantium, the birth of saints Primus, Fortunatus, Macer, and Macarius, monks.

1549
03:08:10,259 --> 03:08:15,281
In Constantinople, formerly Byzantium, the birth of Saint Paul, bishop of the city.

1550
03:08:15,281 --> 03:08:27,928
During the time of Arian conflict, he was expelled by Emperor Constantius to a small town in Cappadocia called Cucusus for his Catholic faith and was strangled by Arian plots, ascending to the heavenly realms.

1551
03:08:27,928 --> 03:08:32,769
In Africa, Victurius, Evasus, Privitus, Januaria, Donata, Spisma, and Quirillus.

1552
03:08:32,769 --> 03:08:35,734
June eighth—In Egypt, the birth of Saint Marcian.

1553
03:08:35,734 --> 03:08:37,791
In Caesarea of Palestine, Cristus.

1554
03:08:37,791 --> 03:08:40,816
In the city of Doroscoro, the birth of Saint Mark.

1555
03:08:40,816 --> 03:08:43,660
In Nicomedia, Eutychius, Nestorius, and Marina.

1556
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:46,202
In Sardinia, the birth of Saint Salustian.

1557
03:08:47,351 --> 03:08:52,741
In Gaul, in the city of Soissons, the feast of Saint Medard, bishop and confessor, is celebrated.

1558
03:08:52,741 --> 03:08:58,909
His life, filled with virtues, was nobly chronicled in both prose and verse by Fortunatus, the bishop of Paris.

1559
03:08:58,909 --> 03:09:04,577
Saint Medard was generous in charity, distinguished in virtues, and renowned for his prophetic spirit.

1560
03:09:04,577 --> 03:09:11,022
He led the bishopric of Vermand for fifteen years and indeed guided the entire West with his examples and teachings.

1561
03:09:11,022 --> 03:09:18,468
His soul was taken to heaven by angels, and his body was brought to Soissons, where it was honorably buried and is famed for miracles.

1562
03:09:18,468 --> 03:09:22,080
In Angers, the feast of Saint Licinius, bishop, is also observed.

1563
03:09:22,080 --> 03:09:25,969
On the same day, the celebration of Carlenius, confessor, takes place.

1564
03:09:25,969 --> 03:09:34,137
On June 9th in Rome, on the Caelian Hill, we remember the birth of the holy martyrs Primus and Felician under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

1565
03:09:34,137 --> 03:09:40,749
These glorious martyrs, steadfast in the Lord, were accused by temple priests before the emperors for being Christians.

1566
03:09:40,749 --> 03:09:49,362
As Roman citizens, they were brought before the emperors, who ordered their imprisonment, bound with iron, where an angel of the Lord came to comfort them.

1567
03:09:49,362 --> 03:09:56,030
After several days, the emperors summoned them again and instructed the soldiers to take them to the temple of Hercules.

1568
03:09:56,030 --> 03:09:59,586
If they refused to sacrifice, they were to be severely tortured.

1569
03:09:59,586 --> 03:10:08,032
However, unable to change their minds, as they preferred to die for the name of Christ, the soldiers stretched them out and beat them harshly with rods.

1570
03:10:08,032 --> 03:10:18,144
When the soldiers reported this to the emperors, they were enraged and commanded that they be handed over to Promotus, the governor of Nomentum, to be executed with various tortures.

1571
03:10:18,144 --> 03:10:29,480
The soldiers took them along the road called Nomentana, at the thirteenth milestone, bound with iron, and imprisoned them near the city forum, where they were once again uplifted by an angelic visitation.

1572
03:10:29,480 --> 03:10:35,814
After a long time, Promotus ordered that the holy men of God, Primus and Felician, be brought before his tribunal.

1573
03:10:36,647 --> 03:10:43,056
During their first, very public questioning, the governor ordered the blessed Felician to be beaten with leaded whips.

1574
03:10:43,056 --> 03:10:50,279
When Felician remained steadfast despite the torture, the governor had him tied to a post with spikes driven into his hands and feet.

1575
03:10:50,279 --> 03:10:54,244
He was tortured for a long time without any food or water for three days.

1576
03:10:54,244 --> 03:10:57,340
Throughout those days, Felician continuously praised God.

1577
03:10:57,340 --> 03:11:02,825
The governor then ordered him to be beaten with whips again, taken down from the post, and locked up.

1578
03:11:02,825 --> 03:11:06,735
Later, in the presence of Felician, the holy Primus was brought forward.

1579
03:11:06,735 --> 03:11:15,534
After Primus endured severe beatings with clubs, he was placed on the rack and laid on a bed, where the governor ordered boiling lead to be poured into his mouth.

1580
03:11:15,534 --> 03:11:18,032
Yet the holy, unconquerable martyrs persisted.

1581
03:11:18,032 --> 03:11:24,060
Frustrated, the governor ordered them to be taken to the amphitheater, where two lions were released upon them.

1582
03:11:24,060 --> 03:11:31,935
However, the lions fell at the saints' feet, and when fierce bears were let loose, they too lost their ferocity because of the martyrs' strength.

1583
03:11:31,935 --> 03:11:37,964
Witnessing these miracles, nearly fifteen hundred people, who had come for the spectacle, believed in the Lord.

1584
03:11:37,964 --> 03:11:43,069
However, seeing the martyrs' invincibility, the governor ordered their execution by the sword.

1585
03:11:43,069 --> 03:11:51,759
That night, Christians took their bodies and buried them near the Nomentan arches within the sandpit on the ninth of June, thirteen miles from the city of Rome.

1586
03:11:51,759 --> 03:12:01,480
In Gaul, in the city of Agen, at the place called Pompeiaco, the martyrdom of Saint Vincent, deacon and martyr, is noted, as mentioned in the Book of Miracles by Gregory of Tours.

1587
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:04,087
Also in Rome, the martyrdom of fifteen soldiers.

1588
03:12:04,847 --> 03:12:15,763
In Scotland, on the island of Ireland, the burial of Saint Columba, also known to his people as Columbkille, is significant because he was the founder, builder, and leader of many monasteries and churches.

1589
03:12:15,763 --> 03:12:26,785
He was so influential that the abbot of the monastery he last led, and where he is buried, is considered, against usual ecclesiastical practice, as the foremost of all the bishops of Ireland, and rightly so.

1590
03:12:26,785 --> 03:12:36,743
This same saint, through the presence of the Holy Spirit, is believed to be unrivaled after the apostles and the remarkable Martin in prophecy, teaching, miracles, and angelic visitation.

1591
03:12:36,743 --> 03:12:39,458
This can be understood even from these few stories.

1592
03:12:39,458 --> 03:12:47,978
While he was on a certain island writing, and a very tall house was being constructed on another, someone began to fall from the top of this enormous structure.

1593
03:12:47,978 --> 03:12:53,143
In the face of this sudden danger, he called out to the angel of God standing by him, Help, help!

1594
03:12:53,143 --> 03:13:00,757
And behold, in the blink of an eye, the falling man was saved by the angel, as if the angel was more focused on the builder than on the writer.

1595
03:13:00,757 --> 03:13:14,974
When a severe illness, or rather an unbearable plague and pestilence, was devastating nearly all the people, he blessed a stone from the shore and instructed that wherever it was placed in water, the water should be given to the sick to drink or be sprinkled on them.

1596
03:13:14,974 --> 03:13:27,807
The stone, placed in water and floating against its nature like foam, testified to having received divine blessing in this way, healing all diseases and making it more precious than gold and all jewels, and more effective than all medicines.

1597
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:35,102
To add to the miracle, during that time, no one destined to die could ever find it, no matter how diligently and carefully they searched.

1598
03:13:35,102 --> 03:13:45,432
With this miraculous healing in mind, I wish to recall another instance of miraculous provision during times of scarcity, so that the wise reader may learn to appreciate from these two examples.

1599
03:13:45,432 --> 03:13:53,366
To a certain poor person, lacking all necessities, the saint sharpened a stick into a spit, which he instructed him to place in the woods and waters.

1600
03:13:53,951 --> 03:13:58,912
While he was doing this, he became so wealthy that his house couldn't contain all his riches.

1601
03:13:58,912 --> 03:14:05,100
His wife, tired of both land and sea pleasures, had the same food prepared by her husband, but to her own detriment.

1602
03:14:05,100 --> 03:14:12,195
Blessed Columba, through his teachings, matched all those before him and is rightly considered to have surpassed them in this regard.

1603
03:14:12,195 --> 03:14:17,636
During the last three days of his life, all the mysteries of the holy Scriptures were revealed to him.

1604
03:14:17,636 --> 03:15:31,730
These mysteries were either completely hidden from previous mortals or, as the Apostle says: "Through a glass, darkly" known but needed to be discovered and clarified.
They were not written down either due to the absence of Battheneus, his closest disciple, or because of the unworthiness of humanity.
Moreover, he surpassed all mortals in the gift of prophecy, able to perceive things hidden from others, whether near or far, past or future, in a single, unavoidable glance.
A vessel filled with milk was presented to him for a solemn blessing.
When he blessed it, the vessel immediately cracked, and he scolded the servant for not marking it with the sign of the holy cross before pouring, to prevent the ancient enemy from having any place in it.
Similarly, he blessed something resembling milk, extracted from a bull’s testicles, from afar, transforming it into its proper nature, which is blood.
He foresaw and sometimes quelled the wars of neighboring kings, and at other times supported those with just causes, while, united with divine justice, he ignored and did not help the unjust.
He also foresaw the sudden destruction of the city now called Nova in Italy, through an earthquake or as a sign of heavenly wrath, and announced it to others, who marveled at his vision.
He also predicted that French sailors, as indeed happened, would report the same event in Scotland that year.

1605
03:15:31,943 --> 03:15:43,220
On the last day of his mortal life, which was a Saturday, he had reached the thirty-third psalm in his writings, up to the verse: "Those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing" (Psalm 34:10).

1606
03:15:43,220 --> 03:15:59,685
He then said to those present:
"Let Baitheneus write what remains," so that the one who was to succeed him in leading the brothers would not only teach but also draw the disciples to himself through writing: "Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord" (Psalm 34:11).

1607
03:15:59,685 --> 03:17:27,871
He added: "This day is called the Sabbath, meaning rest, in the Holy Scriptures, in which eternal rest is prepared for me. For this night, I go to the Lord Jesus Christ, the author of the great resurrection. And know this: for a continuous number of days, the sea will be closed by a great storm, so that my burial may be celebrated not superstitiously by common crowds, but religiously by my holy brothers."
Though he had many disciples or companions equal to his holiness, he left one, namely Comgell, known as Faustus in Latin, the teacher of the most blessed Columbanus, our master, lord, and Father Gall, as his sole heir, following the example of Isaac.
On June 10th, on the Via Aurelia in Rome, at the thirteenth milestone, the birth of Saint Basilides, martyr, Tripodis and Mandalis, occurred under Emperor Aurelian, with Platon as governor, alongside twenty other martyrs. However, in some manuscripts, instead of Tripodis and Mandalis, it is written as Tripolis Magdaletis.
On the same day, blessed Getulius the martyr, during the time of Emperor Hadrian and under the judge Licinius, was known for his deep knowledge of divine law. Through his teaching, many were instructed in the faith of Christ. Hearing of his fame, Emperor Hadrian sent the deputy Cerealis to capture him: but upon hearing his words of truth, he believed in Christ and was baptized by blessed Pope Sixtus. Through the instruction of Saint Getulius, he was strengthened in the faith of Christ.
When Hadrian learned of this, he sent the consul Licinius to capture the deputy Cerealis.

1608
03:17:27,984 --> 03:17:35,374
When the blessed Getulius, his brother Amantius, and their very holy friend Primitivus were discovered, they were all arrested together.

1609
03:17:35,374 --> 03:17:40,048
By the order of Licinius, they were stripped, beaten, and then imprisoned for 27 days.

1610
03:17:40,048 --> 03:17:45,591
Upon reaching Rome and informing Hadrian of these events, they received orders to be burned with fire.

1611
03:17:45,591 --> 03:17:51,352
However, Saint Getulius survived the fire and completed his martyrdom when his head was struck with clubs.

1612
03:17:51,352 --> 03:17:59,612
The blessed martyrs were martyred on the estate of Capreolis, on the Via Salaria, about 13 miles from Rome, above the Tiber River, in the Sabine region.

1613
03:17:59,612 --> 03:18:04,286
Their bodies were gathered by the blessed Symphorosa, the wife of the martyr Getulius.

1614
03:18:04,286 --> 03:18:08,199
She was martyred not long after with her seven sons on the 27th of June.

1615
03:18:08,199 --> 03:18:13,144
She buried them in her family estate in the sandpit, in the place and town mentioned above.

1616
03:18:13,144 --> 03:18:15,481
In Nicomedia, the feast of Saint Zacharias.

1617
03:18:15,481 --> 03:18:18,253
In Auxerre, the burial of Saint Censorious, bishop.

1618
03:18:18,253 --> 03:18:23,307
On the third day before the Ides of June, in Cyprus, the birth of Saint Barnabas the Apostle.

1619
03:18:23,307 --> 03:18:33,904
Although named Joseph by his parents, he was called Barnabas, or son of consolation, by the apostles because he sold a field he owned and laid the money at the apostles' feet to comfort the poor.

1620
03:18:33,904 --> 03:18:51,675
Though he was a Jew by ethnicity, a Levite by heritage, and from Cyprus by nationality, he worked not only to convert other Jews to the faith of Christ but also to unite the Apostle Paul, who was called by Christ from heaven but viewed with suspicion by Christians due to his previous persecution, with the company of apostles.

1621
03:18:51,675 --> 03:18:56,946
With whom he was ordained as an apostle to the Gentiles, he endured many wrongs from unbelievers.

1622
03:18:56,946 --> 03:19:08,848
Yet, due to an issue with Mark, their common disciple, or rather by divine dispensation, he was separated from him in body but united in spirit, nevertheless fulfilling the work of evangelical preaching assigned to him.

1623
03:19:08,848 --> 03:19:19,608
One testimony from the blessed Luke should suffice for believers regarding his sanctity: he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, as written in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter eleven.

1624
03:19:20,424 --> 03:19:24,325
The body of this person was discovered during the reign of Emperor Zeno.

1625
03:19:24,325 --> 03:19:31,369
It was revealed by him, and he is said to have written a letter for the edification of the Church, which is considered apocryphal.

1626
03:19:31,369 --> 03:19:36,246
On the same day in Corinth, we remember Sosthenes, a disciple of the blessed Apostle Paul.

1627
03:19:36,246 --> 03:19:48,004
After being mistreated by the Jews, with Gallio the proconsul showing indifference, he converted to Christianity and was honorably mentioned by the blessed Paul in the apostolic letters in First Corinthians chapter 1.

1628
03:19:48,004 --> 03:19:57,215
Also in Aquileia, we commemorate the holy martyrs Felix and Fortunatus, who suffered under the persecution of Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, with Euphemio as governor.

1629
03:19:57,215 --> 03:20:06,156
These brothers, fervent in their faith in Christ, were betrayed by Apamius, one of the governor's officials, and brought in chains before Judge Euphemio in Aquileia.

1630
03:20:06,156 --> 03:20:12,496
There, as they steadfastly professed Christ, they were first placed on the rack with burning torches set beside them.

1631
03:20:12,496 --> 03:20:16,722
However, when the martyrs began singing psalms, the torches were extinguished.

1632
03:20:16,722 --> 03:20:19,865
They were then covered in burning oil over their stomachs.

1633
03:20:19,865 --> 03:20:27,451
Finally, while they persisted in their confession of Christ, they were taken outside the city and beheaded near the river close to the city.

1634
03:20:27,451 --> 03:20:33,303
Later, their bodies were secretly taken by devout men of that city, wrapped in spices and linen, and buried.

1635
03:20:33,303 --> 03:20:36,987
Citizens from Vicetia attempted to bring their bodies to their city.

1636
03:20:36,987 --> 03:20:50,209
Though the people of Aquileia resisted, a divine intervention resolved the pious dispute: Vicetia would have Felix, and Aquileia would keep Fortunatus, but Aquileia would retain the head of Saint Felix, and Vicetia the head of Saint Fortunatus.

1637
03:20:50,209 --> 03:20:54,110
This arrangement remains in praise of our Lord Jesus Christ to this day.

1638
03:20:54,110 --> 03:21:00,287
In Rome, we commemorate Pope Anacletus, who first constructed and built the memorial of the blessed Apostle Peter.

1639
03:21:00,287 --> 03:21:03,755
He was ordained a presbyter by Peter and was buried next to him.

1640
03:21:03,755 --> 03:21:06,573
June 12th in Rome marks the birth of Saint Cyrenius.

1641
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:17,637
Under the order of Emperor Claudius the Second, after losing all his possessions and enduring a lengthy imprisonment, he was beheaded at night, and his body was thrown into the Tiber River.

1642
03:21:17,637 --> 03:21:22,277
It was later found on the island of Lycaonia and was honorably buried by the faithful.

1643
03:21:22,277 --> 03:21:28,428
We don't know exactly how or when it was brought to Rome, but we believe it wasn't unknown to the blessed Gregory.

1644
03:21:28,428 --> 03:21:38,788
In Rome, Nabor and Nazarius, along with the martyr Gorgonius, who I believe is mentioned in ecclesiastical history, were transferred from Rome to Gaul with the permission of Pope Paul of Rome.

1645
03:21:38,788 --> 03:21:45,694
More precisely, they were taken to ancient France by Ruodgang, Bishop of Metz, in the year of our Lord seven hundred sixty-five.

1646
03:21:45,694 --> 03:21:59,723
He placed Saint Gorgonius in a monastery called Gorzia, Saint Nabor in another monastery called Nova Cella, and Saint Nazarius in a monastery called Loresham, where signs and miracles, particularly in restoring health to the sick and weak, are often witnessed.

1647
03:21:59,723 --> 03:22:05,010
On the same day in Milan, the birth of the holy martyrs Nazarius and the boy Celsus is celebrated.

1648
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:10,729
Blessed Nazarius' father was African, and his mother, Perpetua, was baptized by the blessed Apostle Peter.

1649
03:22:10,729 --> 03:22:14,183
Saint Nazarius himself was taught and baptized by Saint Clement.

1650
03:22:14,183 --> 03:22:24,758
During the frenzy of persecution stirred up by Nero, Anulinus kept Nazarius and the blessed boy Celsus, whom he had raised, imprisoned for a long time before ordering their execution by the sword.

1651
03:22:24,758 --> 03:22:31,448
Christians secretly buried their bodies on July twenty-eighth outside the gate known as the Roman Gate in their own gardens.

1652
03:22:31,448 --> 03:22:41,592
The blessed martyrs revealed themselves to a man named Caeratius, whose wife was Fortunata, and through a vision, warned him to hide them due to the persecution incited by the wicked Nero.

1653
03:22:41,592 --> 03:22:45,585
They remained hidden until the time of the Emperors Honorius and Arcadius.

1654
03:22:45,585 --> 03:22:48,930
Through God's revelation, the blessed Ambrose discovered them.

1655
03:22:49,631 --> 03:22:55,060
When the tomb where the body of the blessed Nazarius lay was opened, those present saw something remarkable.

1656
03:22:55,060 --> 03:23:03,956
As Saint Paulinus writes, the martyr's blood appeared so fresh that it seemed as if it had been shed that very day, even though the time of his suffering was unknown until then.

1657
03:23:03,956 --> 03:23:14,763
His head, which had been severed by the wicked, remained intact and incorrupt, with hair and beard so perfectly preserved that it looked as if it had been freshly washed and arranged in the tomb at that very moment.

1658
03:23:14,763 --> 03:23:19,487
The fragrance that filled the air was so exquisite it surpassed the sweetness of all perfumes.

1659
03:23:19,487 --> 03:23:30,495
Once the body was lifted and placed on a bier, the holy bishop went immediately to the martyr Saint Celsus, who was also in the same garden, for prayer, and then transferred both to the Basilica of the Apostles in Rome.

1660
03:23:30,495 --> 03:23:32,857
They were discovered and moved on June twelfth.

1661
03:23:32,857 --> 03:23:35,571
Their martyrdom is commemorated on July twenty-eighth.

1662
03:23:35,571 --> 03:23:43,664
However, their most celebrated public commemoration is held on the day of the holy martyrs Protasius and Gervasius, as if they were companions from the same era.

1663
03:23:44,015 --> 03:23:50,079
In Antioch, Saint Marina the virgin endured many tortures for the name of Christ under the prefect Olibrius.

1664
03:23:50,079 --> 03:23:54,009
These tortures included chains, imprisonment, scourging, and the rack.

1665
03:23:54,009 --> 03:24:01,813
The devil, appearing as a dragon and an Ethiopian, tried to attack and defeat her, but she drove him away using the sign of the holy cross.

1666
03:24:01,813 --> 03:24:08,606
Eventually, she was beheaded by the same prefect, ending her mortal life and receiving true and eternal life from Christ.

1667
03:24:08,606 --> 03:24:12,256
In Ravenna, there were Macharius, Felix, Aemilius, and Crispinus.

1668
03:24:12,256 --> 03:24:16,579
On June 19th, in Milan, we remember the holy martyrs Gervasius and Protasius.

1669
03:24:16,579 --> 03:24:24,270
These blessed individuals, taught by Saint Paul the Apostle, spent ten years confined to a room, devoted to reading, prayer, and fasting.

1670
03:24:24,270 --> 03:24:30,671
In the tenth year, they were betrayed by the temple priests to Count Astatium, who captured and interrogated them.

1671
03:24:30,671 --> 03:24:39,766
Their path to martyrdom unfolded as follows: when threats and flattery failed to make them deny their faith, Gervasius was beaten with leaded whips until he died.

1672
03:24:39,766 --> 03:24:42,573
Protasius was beaten with clubs and then beheaded.

1673
03:24:42,573 --> 03:24:49,703
Their bodies were secretly taken by a devout man named Philip and his son, and they were buried in a marble coffin at his home.

1674
03:24:49,703 --> 03:25:00,595
Years later, during Emperor Theodosius's reign, the blessed Ambrose discovered their graves through divine revelation, and their bodies were found uncorrupted, as if they had died that very day.

1675
03:25:00,595 --> 03:25:07,894
When their remains were brought into the city, a man who had been blind for a long time regained his sight by touching their bier.

1676
03:25:07,894 --> 03:25:15,193
Also, in the same place, according to the Martyrology of Saint Jerome, we remember the birth of Saint Nazarius and the boy Celsus.

1677
03:25:15,193 --> 03:25:22,547
In Ravenna, Saint Ursicinus the martyr remained steadfast in confessing the Lord, despite severe tortures under the judge Paulinus.

1678
03:25:22,547 --> 03:25:30,183
He completed his martyrdom by beheading and was buried in the city by the blessed Vitalis, the father of Saints Gervasius and Protasius.

1679
03:25:30,183 --> 03:25:32,653
In Rome, Pope Sylvester served for one year.

1680
03:25:33,551 --> 03:25:41,277
With the consent of Emperor Justinian, he was deposed by the patrician Belisarius, became a monk, and died as a confessor in exile.

1681
03:25:41,277 --> 03:25:50,122
On June 20th—In Rome, we remember the passing of Blessed Novatus, the brother of the priest Timothy, both of whom were taught by the blessed apostles.

1682
03:25:50,122 --> 03:26:04,157
Pastor mentions Novatus in the accounts of Pudentiana and Praxedis, the virgins, stating that after Blessed Pudentiana's death, he was visited by Blessed Bishop Pius and Saint Praxedes, along with many martyrs, before departing to Christ.

1683
03:26:04,157 --> 03:26:10,879
In the city of Tomis, we honor Paul, Cyriacus, Paula, Feliciana, Felix, Aemilius, Vitalis, Crispina, and Martyria.

1684
03:26:10,879 --> 03:26:14,477
We also commemorate the translation of Saint Zeno the martyr.

1685
03:26:14,477 --> 03:26:21,022
On June 21st—In Sicily, in the city of Syracuse, we celebrate the birth of the holy martyrs Rufinus and Martia.

1686
03:26:21,022 --> 03:26:26,094
In Rome, we remember Saint Demetria, a virgin who was the daughter of Blessed Faustus.

1687
03:26:26,094 --> 03:26:39,303
When brought before the impious Julian for her faith in Christ, she gave up her spirit in her confession and was buried by Blessed John the priest, next to her mother Dafrosa and her sister Viviana, near the Licinian Palace.

1688
03:26:39,303 --> 03:26:49,858
At the city of Mainz, we celebrate the birth of Saint Alban the martyr, who, under Emperor Theodosius, traveled from the island of Namsia with Saint Theonestus and Ursus to Milan.

1689
03:26:49,858 --> 03:27:04,601
From there, with the help of the Lord, he reached Gaul and, remaining dedicated to the Lord and ready for martyrdom in the Savior's name, after Blessed Ursus completed his martyrdom in the city of Augusta, Saint Alban and Theonestus arrived in Mainz.

1690
03:27:04,601 --> 03:27:10,203
While preaching the word of God there, he fulfilled his martyrdom and was buried near the city.

1691
03:27:10,203 --> 03:27:14,272
In Caesarea, we commemorate the passing of Saint Eusebius the bishop.

1692
03:27:14,272 --> 03:27:23,530
On June 22nd—In Antioch, we celebrate the birth of the holy martyrs Agathalica, Julian, Graph, and another 814 whose names God has in the book of the living.

1693
03:27:23,530 --> 03:27:33,201
In Britain, we remember Saint Alban the martyr, who during the time of Diocletian in the city of Verulamium, after being beaten and severely tortured, was beheaded.

1694
03:27:33,201 --> 03:27:37,742
As his head fell to the ground, the eyes of the one who struck him also fell.

1695
03:27:38,567 --> 03:27:45,753
One of the soldiers suffered alongside him because he was ordered to strike him but refused, being terrified by a divine miracle.

1696
03:27:45,753 --> 03:27:51,100
He witnessed the blessed martyr, on his way to martyrdom, make a river crossable through prayer.

1697
03:27:51,100 --> 03:28:00,068
At that time, a severe persecution reached Britain, condemning Aaron and Julius, along with eight hundred and eighty-nine others, to death with joyful sacrifice.

1698
03:28:00,068 --> 03:28:03,689
In the city of Nola in Campania, Saint Paulinus served as bishop.

1699
03:28:03,689 --> 03:28:11,487
During the time of the Vandals, after everyone else had been taken, he offered himself to the barbarians in exchange for the son of a widow.

1700
03:28:11,487 --> 03:28:17,893
Identified by their king because of a frightening vision, he secured the release of all the captives from his city.

1701
03:28:17,893 --> 03:28:23,129
Returning from Africa with ships full of grain, he came back to his position with great honor.

1702
03:28:23,129 --> 03:28:28,031
He was renowned not only for his wisdom and holiness but also for his power over demons.

1703
03:28:28,031 --> 03:28:33,155
On the same day, we remember the deposition of blessed Nicetius, bishop of the city of Rome.

1704
03:28:33,155 --> 03:28:44,017
June 23rd — In Nicomedia, the suffering of the holy virgins Pistis, Elpis, and Agapis, known in Latin as Faith, Hope, and Charity, and their mother Sophia, meaning Wisdom, along with many others.

1705
03:28:44,017 --> 03:28:51,481
In Rome, Saint John the priest was ordered to be beheaded by the wicked Julian on the Via Salaria Vetus, before the statue of the Sun.

1706
03:28:51,481 --> 03:28:57,162
His body was collected by the blessed Concordius the priest and buried next to the council of martyrs.

1707
03:28:57,162 --> 03:29:01,619
In Britain, we commemorate the deposition of Saint Etheldreda, virgin and queen.

1708
03:29:01,619 --> 03:29:04,515
Her body, buried for ten years, was found incorrupt.

1709
03:29:04,515 --> 03:29:06,855
Also, the vigil of Saint John the Baptist.

1710
03:29:06,855 --> 03:29:16,825
July 8th — In the province of Palestine, in the city of Sebasta, formerly Samaria and known as Shechem many centuries earlier, we celebrate the nativity of Saint John the Baptist.

1711
03:29:16,825 --> 03:29:22,729
Though his body was beheaded in the fortress of Machaerus in Arabia, it was buried there by his disciples.

1712
03:29:22,729 --> 03:29:34,093
Indeed, according to the Gospel of Saint Luke and the Book of Joshua, he is believed to have been born and raised in the city of Hebron in Judea, a designated refuge for priests, the descendants of Aaron.

1713
03:29:35,039 --> 03:29:49,460
The holiness of his life, the austerity of his conduct, the quality of his preaching, and the depth of his suffering for the defense of truth are celebrated not only in the writings of the evangelists but also through the testimony of the Lord Himself, the true judge.

1714
03:29:49,460 --> 03:29:54,249
In Ephesus, we commemorate the resting place of the blessed John, apostle and evangelist.

1715
03:29:54,249 --> 03:30:05,872
Although his praises are more fittingly proclaimed on the sixth day before the Kalends of January, when his feast is celebrated throughout the Church, some of them are also remembered here for the benefit of readers.

1716
03:30:05,872 --> 03:30:21,584
So, in the sixty-eighth year after the Lord's passion, knowing the day of his departure was near, he gathered his disciples and, during the sacred solemnities of God's Masses, persistently advised them about the disdain for the world and its desires, as well as the importance of mutual love.

1717
03:30:21,584 --> 03:30:32,400
He repeated and spoke about these matters so often that, even when they grew weary of hearing the same message, they asked him to speak of other things because these were more than sufficient for them.

1718
03:30:32,400 --> 03:30:41,978
To which he replied: Because the keeping of holy and pure love is either scarcely preached worthily by any mortal or maintained unblemished amidst worldly scandals until the end.

1719
03:30:41,978 --> 03:30:55,753
Having said this, he gave peace to all, and after receiving the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, both for himself and them, he lay down in the tomb as if in a bed, believed to be as free from the pain of death as he was from the corruption of decay.

1720
03:30:55,753 --> 03:31:03,286
At Autun, the burial of Saint Simplicius, bishop, along with Festus and Lucerius, is observed on the seventh day before the Kalends of July.

1721
03:31:03,286 --> 03:31:09,044
At Berea of Pyrrhus, we commemorate the birth of Saint Sosipater, disciple of the blessed Paul the apostle.

1722
03:31:09,044 --> 03:31:27,715
In Alexandria, Saint Gallicanus, a martyr and leader of the Roman army, when besieged by the Scythian people in the city of Philippopolis of Thrace, on the advice of Saints John and Paul, renounced the worship of idols and entrusted himself to the defense of the Lord Jesus Christ, and both he and all of Thrace were freed from the enemy's attack.

1723
03:31:28,199 --> 03:31:36,896
Upon returning to Rome and embracing Christianity, he freed five thousand of his servants, granting them freedom as Roman citizens, along with land and houses.

1724
03:31:36,896 --> 03:31:47,835
He distributed all his possessions to the poor, except for the inheritance rights of his daughters, Attica and Artemia, who had been converted to Christianity by the devout virgin Constantina Augusta.

1725
03:31:47,835 --> 03:31:55,055
He joined a holy man in Ostia named Hilarinus and helped expand his dwelling to accommodate travelers, supporting them in many ways.

1726
03:31:55,055 --> 03:32:04,626
With the assistance of his servants, whom he had already freed and thus drawn closer to him, he continuously provided services of holy devotion to all in need and to the sick.

1727
03:32:04,626 --> 03:32:15,565
When Julian the Apostate became Caesar and decreed that Christians could own nothing, Gallicanus, in the few houses he had reserved for serving the poor, was regarded as having Christ as his defender.

1728
03:32:15,565 --> 03:32:24,481
Anyone attempting to maliciously enter or claim these houses for the treasury was immediately afflicted, either possessed by the devil or covered in leprous spots.

1729
03:32:24,481 --> 03:32:29,677
When this reached Julian, he ordered Gallicanus to either sacrifice to the gods or leave Italy.

1730
03:32:29,677 --> 03:32:35,584
Blessed Gallicanus soon left everything and went to Alexandria, joining the confessors of Christ for a year.

1731
03:32:35,584 --> 03:32:40,889
Later, he retreated to the desert, where Raucianus, a count, forced him to sacrifice to the gods.

1732
03:32:40,889 --> 03:32:47,070
When he refused, he was struck with a sword and became a martyr of Christ, joyfully going to the Lord in triumph.

1733
03:32:47,070 --> 03:32:53,907
A basilica was immediately built in his name, where the martyr's benefits have been abundant from then until now and forever.

1734
03:32:53,907 --> 03:32:59,868
In Rome, the virgin Luceia and King Auceia, along with twenty-two others, were crowned together in martyrdom.

1735
03:32:59,868 --> 03:33:04,353
On June 26th, in Rome, the feast of Saints John and Paul, brothers, is celebrated.

1736
03:33:04,353 --> 03:33:10,424
John was the steward, and Paul was the chief officer of the virgin Constantia, daughter of Emperor Constantine.

1737
03:33:11,135 --> 03:33:17,982
Every day, they provided support to groups of Christians with resources left by the most sacred Virgin of Christ, Constantia.

1738
03:33:17,982 --> 03:33:21,598
This eventually caught the attention of the wicked Emperor Julian.

1739
03:33:21,598 --> 03:33:30,964
When he couldn't persuade them to abandon their love for Christ and worship idols, even with threats or persuasion, he gave them a ten-day period to turn towards his gods.

1740
03:33:30,964 --> 03:33:37,264
During this time, the holy ones of God invited Christians to join them and prepared to leave behind all they could.

1741
03:33:37,264 --> 03:33:42,139
Throughout the ten days, they continuously performed charitable acts, both day and night.

1742
03:33:42,139 --> 03:33:49,040
At the end of the tenth day, while praying inside their house at dinnertime, they were captured by Terentianus, the commander.

1743
03:33:49,040 --> 03:33:53,696
No matter the reasoning or threats, they remained steadfast in their love for Christ.

1744
03:33:53,696 --> 03:33:58,900
Through Terentianus, they were beheaded, and they were buried in a pit made inside their house.

1745
03:33:58,900 --> 03:34:02,296
Rumor spread that they had been exiled by the Emperor's order.

1746
03:34:02,296 --> 03:34:08,322
Demons were expelled from possessed bodies inside the house of John and Paul, confessing their holy suffering.

1747
03:34:08,322 --> 03:34:17,743
This even led to Terentianus's only son, who had executed them, entering the saints' house, where a demon declared through his mouth that John and Paul were tormenting him.

1748
03:34:17,743 --> 03:34:24,919
Then Terentianus, moved by divine grace and reborn in Christ, prayed over the saints' bodies until he obtained healing for his son.

1749
03:34:24,919 --> 03:34:28,041
In Alexandria, there were Agathon, Diogenes, and Bigatus.

1750
03:34:28,041 --> 03:34:31,492
In Africa, there were Gaudentius, Felix, Agapitus, and Emerita.

1751
03:34:31,492 --> 03:34:34,669
This occurred on the fifth day before the Kalends of July.

1752
03:34:34,669 --> 03:34:39,927
In Galatia, there was the birth of the blessed Crescent, a disciple of the blessed Apostle Paul.

1753
03:34:39,927 --> 03:34:44,419
He traveled to Gaul, converting many to the faith of Christ through his preaching.

1754
03:34:44,419 --> 03:34:51,978
Returning to the nation where he was appointed bishop, he strengthened the Galatians in the Lord's work until the blessed end of his life.

1755
03:34:51,978 --> 03:35:05,782
In Tibur, a city in Italy, was the birth of Saint Symphorosa, the wife of the blessed martyr Getulius, along with her seven sons, Crescent, Julian, Nemesius, Primitivus, Justin, Stacteus, and Eugene, with whom she suffered under Emperor Hadrian's rule.

1756
03:35:06,767 --> 03:35:10,804
He ordered Symphorosa to be beaten with palms and then hung by her hair.

1757
03:35:10,804 --> 03:35:16,579
When he couldn't overcome her, he commanded that she be thrown into the river with a stone tied to her.

1758
03:35:16,579 --> 03:35:22,577
Her brother, Eugenius, an official of the Tiburtine court, collected her body and gave her a proper burial.

1759
03:35:22,577 --> 03:35:33,958
In the morning, the emperor had seven stakes set up, and her sons were stretched on racks:
Crescent was pierced in the throat, Julian in the chest, Nemesius in the heart, and Primitius through the navel.

1760
03:35:33,958 --> 03:35:38,836
Justin was stretched through his limbs and cut through each joint and node of his body.

1761
03:35:38,836 --> 03:35:42,760
Stacteus was pinned to the ground with countless spears until he died.

1762
03:35:42,760 --> 03:35:45,731
Eugenius was split from the chest to the lower parts.

1763
03:35:45,731 --> 03:36:52,671
The priests of the sacred rites named that place "to the seven Bithanatos," where their bodies rest on the Tiburtine Way, nine miles away.
On the same day in Spain, in the city of Cordoba, the saints Zoellus and nineteen others were born.
At Ephesus, the feast of the Seven Sleeping Brothers is celebrated:
Maximian, Malchus, Martinian, Dionysius, John, Serapion, and Constantine.
These brothers, fleeing the Decian persecution after enduring many severe tortures, hid themselves in a large cave on Mount Caelius and remained there in constant prayer.
Upon hearing this, Emperor Decius ordered the cave's entrance to be sealed, leaving them to perish inside.
After 372 years, in the thirtieth year of Theodosius' reign, the son of Emperor Arcadius, when a heresy arose intending to nullify the hope of faith and the resurrection of the dead, these seven brothers were awakened by divine providence from their long sleep.
They were discovered because they brought very ancient coins from their time to the market to buy their daily sustenance.
Brought before the people of that age, they were compelled to return what they were thought to be holding, as if they had discovered ancient treasures.

1764
03:36:53,063 --> 03:37:03,459
After much struggle and severe tribulation faced by the saints, they suspected that they had left the city in the evening and returned in the morning, although it seemed different to them.

1765
03:37:03,459 --> 03:37:09,873
Eventually, when Marinus, the bishop of the Ephesians, arrived, it was difficult to uncover the truth of the matter.

1766
03:37:09,873 --> 03:37:22,038
They were freed from the hands of the violent, and when Emperor Theodosius was summoned from distant parts of the world, they served as a testimony to the future resurrection and returned to their original resting place.

1767
03:37:22,038 --> 03:37:28,010
In the city of Amiens, the bodies of the saints Fuscian, Victoricus, and Gentian were discovered on June 28.

1768
03:37:28,010 --> 03:37:30,886
In Lyon, Gaul, Saint Irenaeus, the bishop, was born.

1769
03:37:30,886 --> 03:37:37,245
He succeeded the blessed Pothinus, who was nearly ninety years old when he was crowned for his martyrdom in Christ.

1770
03:37:37,245 --> 03:37:44,433
It is known that he was a disciple of the most blessed Polycarp, who was a disciple of Saint John the Apostle, priest, and martyr.

1771
03:37:44,433 --> 03:38:00,469
During the persecution of Severus, almost all the people of his city were gloriously crowned with martyrdom, and he was buried by the priest Zacharias in the crypt of the basilica of Saint John the Baptist under the altar, with Epipodius on one side and Alexander, the martyr, on the other.

1772
03:38:00,469 --> 03:38:06,662
On the same day in Alexandria, the passion of the holy martyrs Plutarch, Serenus, Heraclides, and Hero occurred.

1773
03:38:06,662 --> 03:38:11,915
Also, Serenus, Potamiena, Marcella, and the catechumen Hera received baptism through martyrdom.

1774
03:38:11,915 --> 03:38:22,255
Among them, Potamiena was the foremost, a virgin who endured immense and countless struggles for her virginity and later suffered exquisite and unheard-of tortures for Christ's martyrdom.

1775
03:38:22,255 --> 03:38:28,780
Ultimately, with her venerable mother Marcella, she was consumed by fire's torments and ascended from earth to heaven.

1776
03:38:28,780 --> 03:38:32,043
On the same day, the burial of Saint Leo, Pope, took place.

1777
03:38:32,043 --> 03:38:39,120
He was the forty-seventh to sit in the city of Rome after the blessed Apostle Peter, serving for 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days.

1778
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:50,345
He was abundant in teaching and explaining the Catholic faith with many bishops, condemning the Eutychian and Nestorian heresies, and through his efforts, the most holy Council of Chalcedon was convened.

1779
03:38:51,119 --> 03:39:00,602
Here, he decided to stay within the action: the holy sacrifice, and not accept the blessed head covering for a nun from a bishop unless her virginity was proven beforehand.

1780
03:39:00,602 --> 03:39:03,854
In Africa, Fabian and Felix, along with many other martyrs.

1781
03:39:03,854 --> 03:39:06,666
The vigil of the most holy apostles Peter and Paul.

1782
03:39:06,666 --> 03:39:15,321
June 29th—in Rome, we celebrate the birth of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, who suffered under Emperor Nero during the consulship of Bassus and Tuscus.

1783
03:39:15,321 --> 03:39:36,214
Peter, after converting many thousands of Jews to the Lord Jesus Christ, following the calling of Cornelius and many Gentiles, after leading the Church of Antioch and preaching to the believers from the circumcision in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia in the second year of Claudius, was directed by God to confront Simon Magus and to enlighten the Western people.

1784
03:39:36,214 --> 03:39:39,798
He came to Rome as a remedy for those suffering in soul and body.

1785
03:39:39,798 --> 03:39:56,832
There, he held the priestly chair for twenty-five years until the last year of Nero, by whom he was crucified, crowned with martyrdom, with his head turned to the ground according to his request, and his feet facing upwards, because he believed himself unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his Lord.

1786
03:39:56,832 --> 03:40:00,746
He was buried in the same city, in the Vatican, near the Triumphal Way.

1787
03:40:00,746 --> 03:40:05,267
He is venerated worldwide and helps in countless ways all who seek him with faith.

1788
03:40:05,267 --> 03:40:08,023
He wrote two Epistles, which are called Canonical.

1789
03:40:08,023 --> 03:40:15,686
The second is denied by many due to its stylistic differences from the first, but it is truly recognized as his by all sound-minded people.

1790
03:40:15,686 --> 03:40:22,081
He ordained two bishops, Linus and Cletus, who performed all the priestly duties in Rome for the people or visitors.

1791
03:40:22,081 --> 03:40:33,658
He devoted his efforts to prayer and preaching, just as in Jerusalem, where deacons were appointed for the ministry of widows and orphans, he was always dedicated to prayer and the word with the other apostles.

1792
03:40:34,319 --> 03:40:43,472
Paul, after the Lord's passion in the twenty-fifth year, which was during the second year of Nero, spread the Gospel of Christ from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum.

1793
03:40:43,472 --> 03:40:46,979
He was sent to Rome in chains but was miraculously freed by God.

1794
03:40:46,979 --> 03:40:56,350
He was placed under house arrest and, as he writes in the Second Letter to Timothy, chapter four, was saved from the lion's mouth, referring to the fierce persecutor Nero.

1795
03:40:56,350 --> 03:41:09,503
He preached the Gospel of Christ in the western regions as well and, in the fourteenth year of Nero, on the same day as Peter, was beheaded in Rome for Christ and buried on the Ostian Way in the thirty-seventh year after the Lord's passion.

1796
03:41:09,503 --> 03:41:24,793
He wrote nine, or rather ten, letters according to the Decalogue of the law, to seven churches:
one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, one to the Galatians, one to the Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one to the Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, and one to the Hebrews.

1797
03:41:24,793 --> 03:41:37,562
Although some have doubted the letter to the Hebrews due to differences in language and ideas and because his name is not in the title, it is now undoubtedly considered among the canonical Scriptures as from the blessed apostle Paul.

1798
03:41:37,562 --> 03:41:43,591
Furthermore, there are four other letters to his disciples: two to Timothy, one to Titus, and one to Philemon.

1799
03:41:43,591 --> 03:41:48,249
Some also read a letter to the Laodiceans, which is considered worthless by the wise.

1800
03:41:48,249 --> 03:41:58,826
Having mentioned what pertains to his apostleship or martyrdom, let us briefly recall, although out of order, some aspects of his genealogy, education, and election for the benefit of scholars.

1801
03:41:58,826 --> 03:42:05,676
Saul, therefore, or rather Saul in Hebrew, was from the tribe of Benjamin, where his name was prominent because of King Saul.

1802
03:42:05,676 --> 03:42:12,088
He was born in the town of Giscala; when it was captured by the Romans, he and his family moved to Tarsus in Cilicia.

1803
03:42:12,088 --> 03:42:14,445
They sent him to Jerusalem for his studies.

1804
03:42:15,047 --> 03:42:19,420
Gamaliel was highly skilled in ancient law and later embraced the Gospel of Christ.

1805
03:42:19,420 --> 03:42:24,741
He was so well-educated that he was called the chosen vessel by the giver of spiritual gifts himself.

1806
03:42:24,741 --> 03:42:35,541
Even though he agreed with the Jews who persecuted Christians, including the execution of Stephen, the first martyr of Christ, he fiercely opposed all those associated with this name throughout the region.

1807
03:42:35,541 --> 03:42:40,124
As he admits, he persecuted the followers of Jesus of Nazareth even in foreign nations.

1808
03:42:40,124 --> 03:42:50,187
On his way to Damascus, the capital of Syria, he was compelled by a sudden revelation, a fitting punishment, to convert to faith, transforming from a persecutor into a teacher of the nations.

1809
03:42:50,187 --> 03:42:57,931
When Sergius Paulus, the proconsul of Cyprus, first believed through his preaching, Paul took his name after converting him to the faith of Christ.

1810
03:42:57,931 --> 03:43:06,835
Since we've mentioned a few things about the origin or calling of the blessed Paul, let's share some details about the other apostles for the instruction of the curious.

1811
03:43:06,835 --> 03:43:15,791
First, it's important to know that although the twelve apostles were chosen by the Lord, the homeland, tribe, or even the calling of some of them isn’t clearly expressed.

1812
03:43:15,791 --> 03:43:22,481
However, by carefully examining the pages of the divine Scripture, these details can be found by those who seek them earnestly.

1813
03:43:22,481 --> 03:43:30,858
Concerning Peter, Andrew, and Philip, they were from Bethsaida, a place that symbolically represents our hunters; anyone who reads the Gospel is aware of this.

1814
03:43:30,858 --> 03:43:39,234
Luke also hints at this about James and John when he mentions they were companions of Simon, who, because of his steadfast faith, was called Peter by the Lord.

1815
03:43:39,234 --> 03:43:50,930
Regarding James the Lesser, often called the brother of the Lord by both the faithful and the Jewish historian Josephus, and his brothers Simon and Jude, or Thaddeus, it's undeniable that they were from the tribe of Judah.

1816
03:43:50,930 --> 03:43:57,831
As for the calling of Matthew, although it's clearly described by three evangelists, his tribe or homeland seems to be unmentioned.

1817
03:43:58,463 --> 03:44:10,228
However, while Mark and Luke refer to him as Levi—without explicitly mentioning his name—or Dionymon according to some, or from the tribe of Levi according to more thorough sources, they make this clear.

1818
03:44:10,228 --> 03:44:20,950
Furthermore, regarding Bartholomew and Thomas, there's little else noted in certain apostolic writings except that they were chosen from among the many disciples for the apostolic rank.

1819
03:44:20,950 --> 03:44:30,570
But if anyone delves deeper into these texts, exploring the profound treasures of sacred Scripture, they will marvel, rejoicing at uncovering the riches of Jerusalem.

1820
03:44:30,570 --> 03:44:47,030
As sung in the psalm about the resurrection and ascension of the Lord, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the apostles, the belief of the nations, or the cruelty of the persecutors, in Psalm Sixty-Eight: In the churches, bless God the Lord from the fountains of Jerusalem.

1821
03:44:47,030 --> 03:45:05,285
There, Benjamin, the young man, namely Paul, as Luke also mentions, is beside the feet of the young man, in Acts Chapter Seven;
—in a state of mental ecstasy, as he himself professes: Whether we are out of our mind, it is for God; whether we are in our right mind, it is for you, in Second Corinthians Chapter Five.

1822
03:45:05,285 --> 03:45:08,994
—Leaders of Judah, their chiefs, namely James, Simon, and Judas.

1823
03:45:08,994 --> 03:45:11,370
—Leaders of Zebulun, leaders of Naphtali.

1824
03:45:11,370 --> 03:45:24,642
Undoubtedly, all the others, except Judas Iscariot, which means meditation of death, can be appropriately understood, even by changing the letters, because from the tribe of Issachar, which in Latin means reward, he is expressed.

1825
03:45:24,642 --> 03:45:30,148
His birth and the heir of that name, by destroying himself, is commended by the Gospel writers.

1826
03:45:30,148 --> 03:45:34,668
Having briefly mentioned these things in detail, let us return to the subject.

1827
03:45:34,668 --> 03:45:44,463
On the same day, that is, on the third day before the Kalends of July, which is the day before those Kalends, at Rome, the suffering of nine hundred seventy-six martyrs.

1828
03:45:44,463 --> 03:45:47,766
In Persia, the birth of the holy apostles Simon and Jude.

1829
03:45:47,766 --> 03:45:55,416
On the second day before the Kalends of July—at Rome, or rather throughout the world of Christ, the feast of Saint Paul the Apostle.

1830
03:45:56,111 --> 03:46:01,688
Today, we celebrate the birthday of the blessed Lucina, who was baptized and taught by the apostles.

1831
03:46:01,688 --> 03:46:10,834
She generously shared her resources with the saints, always striving to support those in chains and jail, and devoted herself to respectfully serving their burials.

1832
03:46:10,834 --> 03:46:21,095
By sharing in their merits, she also achieved a precious death through her confession of Christ, and by fulfilling her vows to the Lord, she earned her place in the heavenly Jerusalem.

1833
03:46:21,095 --> 03:46:27,061
In Rome, she was honorably buried in the remarkable crypt she constructed for the interment of the martyrs.

1834
03:46:27,061 --> 03:46:30,240
In Africa, we celebrate the feast of Timothy and Zoticus.

1835
03:46:30,240 --> 03:46:33,363
In Agrippina, it's the feast of Asclepius and Pamphilus.

1836
03:46:33,363 --> 03:46:37,657
In Limoges, we commemorate the burial of Saint Martial, bishop and confessor.

1837
03:46:37,991 --> 03:46:43,415
July. The month of July has 31 days.

1838
03:46:43,415 --> 03:46:47,985
July 1st—On Mount Or, it marks the burial of Aaron, the first priest under the law.

1839
03:46:47,985 --> 03:46:52,664
In Rome, we commemorate the birth of Saint Caius, pope, alongside many other martyrs.

1840
03:46:52,664 --> 03:46:55,692
In Mesopotamia, Zoellus is remembered with many others.

1841
03:46:55,692 --> 03:47:01,637
Uronis and Monegunda, a most holy woman, were enclosed near Saint Martin, and are famous for their miracles.

1842
03:47:01,637 --> 03:47:11,546
In the Lyon region, at a place called the Valley of Vebrona, we remember the burial of the man of God, the blessed Domitian, an abbot who was the first to live a hermit life there.

1843
03:47:11,546 --> 03:47:17,987
He gathered many in the service of God, founded a monastery, and was known for great virtues and remarkable miracles.

1844
03:47:17,987 --> 03:47:19,473
He lived to a good old age.

1845
03:47:19,473 --> 03:47:23,106
On the same day, we remember the burial of Areleffus, a confessor.

1846
03:47:23,106 --> 03:47:29,382
Dedicated to God since childhood, he sought a monastic life and was ordained a priest by Saint Maximin of Orléans.

1847
03:47:29,382 --> 03:47:37,475
Along with his companion Avitus, he yearned for a solitary life, but his growing merits made it impossible for him to remain hidden by divine will.

1848
03:47:37,475 --> 03:47:43,915
He built monasteries in various locations and was renowned for many virtues both during his life and after his death.

1849
03:47:43,915 --> 03:48:27,570
The term "virtue" sometimes refers to holiness of life and sometimes to the power of miracles. One of the miracles attributed to his holiness is worth mentioning in this brief ecclesiastical history to caution against reckless behavior.
A certain woman named Gunda, hearing that Saint Areleffus had forbidden women—often seen as softening male strength—from entering his monastery, disguised herself in men's clothing to mock the holy man.
Thinking she had succeeded, she mingled among the men at the convent; but suddenly, she lost her sanity and began exposing herself, which is shameful to describe.
Like Lot's wife, though not turned into a pillar of salt, she became a warning through her punishment, instilling fear of curiosity in those present and those who would come after.
July 2nd.

1850
03:48:28,175 --> 03:48:28,449
July.

1851
03:48:28,449 --> 03:48:37,023
In Rome, the saints Processus and Martinianus began to marvel at the wonders performed by the Lord Jesus Christ through His blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.

1852
03:48:37,023 --> 03:48:45,378
At that time, the esteemed apostles were entrusted to a distinguished man named Paulinus, who was in charge of the Mamertine Prison on the Tarpeian Rock.

1853
03:48:45,378 --> 03:48:48,874
There, they made water flow from the rock through their prayers.

1854
03:48:48,874 --> 03:48:55,536
Then, Processus and Martinianus were baptized by the blessed apostle Peter, along with forty-seven others of both genders.

1855
03:48:55,536 --> 03:49:01,653
When Paulinus heard about this, he sent soldiers to arrest them and ordered them to be thrown back into custody.

1856
03:49:01,653 --> 03:49:05,203
The following day, they were brought out, and with steadfastness.

1857
03:49:05,203 --> 03:49:05,257
.

1858
03:49:05,257 --> 03:49:05,312
.

1859
03:49:05,639 --> 03:49:10,727
Here, several pages are missing in the manuscript.

1860
03:49:10,727 --> 03:50:54,839
On the other hand, Rusticus remarked, "Now, we see that you are irreligious, an enchanter, and a magician who eats in the morning, milks deer, and hangs clothes from the sun's rays unless you make the child speak in the name of God."
Finally, after much resistance, the holy man, compelled to set aside his humility somewhat and reveal his power, turned to the child and said, "I adjure you by Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, to declare before everyone who your father is and who your mother is."
The little child, endowed with the power to speak by the author of all, responded in the most perfect speech, "My father is this bishop Rusticus, and my mother is that nun."
Thus, that stubborn bishop was exposed in his crime, received counsel for repentance from God's true servant, and the holy priest Goar, glorified by Christ, returned to his place and rested in peace, growing in virtue day by day.
On July 7th, in Alexandria, Egypt, we celebrate the birth of Saint Pantaenus, an apostolic man adorned with all wisdom.
He was so dedicated and loving toward the word of God that he set out with zeal and devotion to preach the Gospel of Christ to all nations hidden in the farthest reaches of the East, reaching as far as India.
There, he found that Bartholomew, one of the twelve apostles, had preached the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the Gospel of Matthew.
Returning, he brought with him the text written in Hebrew letters to Alexandria, where he concluded his illustrious and noble life with a blessed end.
There also are the saints Heraclius, Helias, Apollonius, and Publius, along with twenty others.
In Rome, we remember the martyrdom of the blessed martyrs Nicostratus, the first of the treasury, Claudius the commentator, Castorius or Castulus, Victorinus, Symphorian, or, as contained in the Book of Sacraments, Sempronian.

1861
03:50:54,839 --> 03:51:03,378
We used to think we celebrated their birthday on the sixth day of the Ides of November, until the venerable Father Ado suggested others to be honored for them.

1862
03:51:03,378 --> 03:51:06,923
We'll discuss this more conveniently in due time, life permitting.

1863
03:51:06,923 --> 03:51:12,078
Blessed Sebastian taught them to believe in Christ, and Saint Polycarp the priest baptized them.

1864
03:51:12,078 --> 03:51:18,791
While searching for the bodies of the saints by the Tiber, they were captured and brought to Fabian, the prefect of the city.

1865
03:51:18,791 --> 03:51:23,624
He spent ten days trying to persuade them with threats and flattery to sacrifice to idols.

1866
03:51:23,624 --> 03:51:29,907
But since he couldn't sway them from their steadfast faith, he reported them to the emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

1867
03:51:29,907 --> 03:51:37,264
They ordered them to be tortured, and when they couldn't be compelled to yield by any means, they ordered them to be thrown into the sea.

1868
03:51:37,264 --> 03:51:46,931
Weighted down with heavy burdens, they were cast into the waves of the sea, so that in a pure place among the waters, they might be deemed worthy to receive the crown of martyrdom.

1869
03:51:46,931 --> 03:51:51,925
On July 8th, in Asia Minor, the birth of Saint Aquila and his wife Priscilla is commemorated.

1870
03:51:51,925 --> 03:52:02,827
It's recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter eighteen, that the blessed apostle Paul stayed and worked with them because they shared the same trade, after they came to Achaia from the city of Rome.

1871
03:52:02,827 --> 03:52:11,312
In Palestine, Saint Procopius the martyr was taken from Scythopolis to Caesarea, and after his first bold response, he was beheaded by the angry judge Fabian.

1872
03:52:11,312 --> 03:52:15,447
In Nicaea, Senator Sostratus, Severus, and Honoratus, along with many others.

1873
03:52:15,447 --> 03:52:18,562
In Tauromenium, Sperus and Cornelianus, with sixty others.

1874
03:52:18,562 --> 03:52:32,632
In the district of Austria, at the castle or rather the city known in German as Wurzburg, located near the Main River, the martyrdom of Saint Kilian, the first bishop of that city, and his two disciples, the priest Colonatus and the deacon Totnan, is remembered.

1875
03:52:32,632 --> 03:52:42,352
Coming from Hibernia, the island of the Scots, and having received authority from the pope of the Apostolic See, they preached the name of Christ in that place and its surroundings.

1876
03:52:43,103 --> 03:52:55,076
When many people were being converted to the Lord by this apostolic man through signs and preaching, he was killed by the local duke, Cozpert, who was upset because he tried to stop Cozpert from marrying his brother's wife.

1877
03:52:55,076 --> 03:53:00,714
This act was carried out with the help of the highly incestuous Geila and her equally zealous companions.

1878
03:53:00,714 --> 03:53:06,995
Numerous miracles always occur at their memorials, but their sacred deaths were first made known through these signs.

1879
03:53:06,995 --> 03:53:19,505
The person who killed them while they were praying in the quiet of night went mad, running around, shouting that he was guilty of killing the saints, and biting himself because he felt consumed by an invisible fire from Saint Kilian.

1880
03:53:19,505 --> 03:53:20,740
He confessed his crime.

1881
03:53:20,740 --> 03:53:26,055
Geila was also possessed by an evil spirit, and her unworthy life ended with a well-deserved death.

1882
03:53:26,055 --> 03:53:32,444
Cozpert, however, was killed by his own servants with a sword, and his son was expelled from the kingdom by the people.

1883
03:53:32,444 --> 03:53:47,155
To further prove the sanctity of the martyrs, when their remains were uncovered for transfer many years later, their books and clothes, buried with them, were found undamaged, as if they had been stored above ground, which was surprising given the region's extreme dampness.

1884
03:53:47,155 --> 03:53:55,155
On the 9th of July—In Rome, at Gutta, which flows continuously, we commemorate the birth of Saint Zeno and ten thousand two hundred and three others.

1885
03:53:55,155 --> 03:53:57,034
Also remembering Florian and Faust.

1886
03:53:57,034 --> 03:54:05,625
In the city of Tyre, not far from Rome, during the reign of Emperor Decius, there was Anatolia, who healed many sick, lunatics, and possessed people in Picenum.

1887
03:54:05,625 --> 03:54:13,893
She was taken by order of Faustinus to the city of Tyre, tortured with various wounds, and locked in with a snake for a whole night but remained unharmed.

1888
03:54:13,893 --> 03:54:22,591
Moreover, she saved Marsus, who had released the snake, named Audax, from being devoured by his own snake in the morning and converted him to the faith of Christ.

1889
03:54:22,591 --> 03:54:27,262
After confessing the truth, he was imprisoned and soon received the crown of martyrdom.

1890
03:54:27,959 --> 03:54:33,698
The Virgin of Christ herself was pierced by a sword while she stood with outstretched hands in prayer.

1891
03:54:33,698 --> 03:54:37,524
The sword, entering through her right side, exited through her left.

1892
03:54:37,524 --> 03:54:43,713
She suffered on the seventh day before the Ides of July and was buried in the morning by the citizens of Tyre.

1893
03:54:43,713 --> 03:54:46,582
In Milan, we celebrate the birth of Saint Mochimus.

1894
03:54:46,582 --> 03:54:51,983
In Egypt, Bishop Cyril faced a trial by fire when he was thrown into flames by the leader Lycus.

1895
03:54:51,983 --> 03:54:56,765
Remarkably, he emerged unharmed, and, amazed by this miracle, the judge released him.

1896
03:54:56,765 --> 03:55:07,624
When Cyril resumed preaching the word of God and converting many to the faith of Christ, the judge, overtaken by impiety, ordered his beheading, and Cyril achieved the desired end of martyrdom.

1897
03:55:07,624 --> 03:55:11,506
Similarly, in Egypt, we honor Saint Serapion, a bishop and confessor.

1898
03:55:11,506 --> 03:55:19,383
In the city of Martulana, Saint Bricius, also a bishop and confessor, was struck on the mouth with a stone and cruelly tortured on the rack.

1899
03:55:19,383 --> 03:55:23,771
Despite being thrown into prison, he persevered in his confession of the Lord.

1900
03:55:23,771 --> 03:55:28,441
That night, a severe earthquake struck the city, killing many, including Martianus.

1901
03:55:28,441 --> 03:55:38,736
Strengthened by a holy angel and the blessed Apostle Peter, the confessor of Christ was inspired to preach the Gospel, leading many to believe in Almighty God, and he rested in peace.

1902
03:55:38,736 --> 03:55:44,081
His soul was seen by those present being received into heaven in the form of a snow-white dove.

1903
03:55:44,081 --> 03:55:54,433
On the sixth day before the Ides of July in Rome, we remember the birth of seven brothers, sons of Saint Felicitas: Januarius, Felix, Philip, Sylvanus, Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial.

1904
03:55:54,433 --> 03:56:01,804
Under the city prefect Publius, during the reign of Emperor Antoninus, they were subjected to various tortures by different judges.

1905
03:56:01,804 --> 03:56:07,036
Of these, Januarius, after being beaten with rods and imprisoned, was killed by leaden whips.

1906
03:56:07,036 --> 03:56:09,793
Felix and Philip were beaten to death with clubs.

1907
03:56:09,793 --> 03:56:12,550
Sylvanus met his end by being thrown off a cliff.

1908
03:56:12,550 --> 03:56:20,539
Alexander, Vitalis, and Martial were sentenced to death, but even in death, they remained united in the love of Christ and the unity of faith.

1909
03:56:21,551 --> 03:56:31,363
In Rome, at the tenth milestone on the Plautilla estate known as Buxo, the holy sisters Rufina and Secunda, daughters of the esteemed Asterius and Aurelia, were martyred.

1910
03:56:31,363 --> 03:56:43,945
During the persecution by Valerian and Gallienus, under the judges Junius the prefect and Archisilaus the count, they were beheaded at this location because they refused to marry their fiancés who had renounced Christ.

1911
03:56:43,945 --> 03:56:53,237
In Africa, the holy martyrs Januarius, Marinus, Nabor, and Felix were beheaded for their steadfast Christian faith; their bodies were later transferred to Milan.

1912
03:56:53,237 --> 03:56:59,528
On July 9th, in Rome, the passion of the holy martyrs Stephen, Leontius, Maurice, and many others took place.

1913
03:56:59,528 --> 03:57:02,991
In Africa, the martyrdom of Marianus and Januarius occurred.

1914
03:57:02,991 --> 03:57:13,495
In Lesser Armenia, in the city of Nicopolis, the holy martyrs Januarius and Pelagia were tortured on the rack, with claws and shards of pottery for four days, and achieved martyrdom.

1915
03:57:13,495 --> 03:57:20,074
The transfer of Saint Benedict the abbot from the fortress of Cassino or Cassiani to Gaul or Aquitaine took place.

1916
03:57:20,074 --> 03:57:30,232
After his monastery was devastated by invaders, as he had predicted during his lifetime, he pleaded with Almighty God that only the men would be spared due to his intercession.

1917
03:57:30,232 --> 03:57:44,949
His body was discovered by some religious men, revealed by the Lord, and was transferred to Gaul, where it was worthily buried in the territory of Orléans, at the monastery called Fleury, and has been continuously honored by the devotion of many faithful.

1918
03:57:44,949 --> 03:57:53,491
The bones of the blessed virgin Scholastica, his sister, were also transferred and buried in the area of Le Mans with the devotion of the religious.

1919
03:57:53,491 --> 03:58:09,766
The same man of God saw her soul leaving the body and entering the secrets of heaven in the form of a dove, and he ordered her body to be placed in the same sepulcher with his, so that their bodies would not be separated in burial, just as their minds had always been united in God.

1920
03:58:10,343 --> 03:58:18,834
But woe to those unfortunate ones, because their actions have caused things that were meant to be united by the will of the Holy Spirit to be separated.

1921
03:58:18,834 --> 03:58:24,699
However, the place, honored with the relics of the saints, did not remain empty of the faithful for long.

1922
03:58:24,699 --> 03:58:32,519
The brothers who managed to escape the enemies gathered once more, and with others joining in place of those dispersed, they grew in number.

1923
03:58:32,519 --> 03:58:41,735
They cared for the sacred ashes with great reverence, acting more cautiously, until recently they were scattered in all directions due to the threat of the Saracens.

1924
03:58:41,735 --> 03:58:52,125
On July twelfth at Aquileia, we commemorate the birth of Saint Hermagoras, or as ancient texts say, Hermechora, the first bishop of that city and a disciple of Saint Mark the Evangelist.

1925
03:58:52,125 --> 03:59:59,768
Also remembered is Fortunatus, about whom Bishop Fortunatus remarked, "And Aquileia boasts of its own Fortunatus."
In Cyprus, we honor Blessed Nason, an early disciple of Christ.
In Rome, at the Vatican, we remember the burial of Saint Pius, the Pope, who served as bishop for eighteen years.
During his time, Hermes wrote a book called "The Shepherd," because an angel appeared to him as a shepherd.
In Milan, we recall the transfer of the holy martyrs Nabor and Felix, who were beheaded on July tenth in Africa along with Januarius and Marinus, and on this day were brought to Milan.
It is believed that Blessed Victor, in his passion, prayed: "Do not separate me, Lord, from my fellow citizens, your martyrs Nabor and Felix."
In Lyon, France, we remember the burial of Viventiolus, the bishop.
On July thirteenth, we commemorate the passing of Ezra, the restorer of divine law.
In Alexandria, we remember Serapion, Evangelus, Zeno, and others, along with the virgin Trophima.
In Rome, we honor Saint Cletus, the Pope, who served as bishop for twelve years.
As the deputy bishop of Blessed Peter the Apostle, by his command, he ordained twenty-five priests in the city of Rome and was buried next to his body.

1926
04:00:00,047 --> 04:00:12,872
In Africa, we celebrate the birth of the holy confessors and the most victorious martyrs: Eugenius, the Bishop of Carthage, who was renowned for his faith, virtues, and miracles, along with all the clergy of the same Church.

1927
04:00:12,872 --> 04:00:21,689
Nearly five hundred of them, including many readers and even children, were joyfully exiled in the Lord, having suffered through slaughter and starvation.

1928
04:00:21,689 --> 04:00:27,700
Among them were the noble archdeacons, Salutaris and Mauritta, who were second in the order of ministers.

1929
04:00:27,700 --> 04:00:37,605
They endured many punishments for their Catholic confession and, having become confessors for the third time, were honored with the title of glorious perseverance in Christ.

1930
04:00:37,605 --> 04:00:41,097
In Antioch, we remember the martyrdom of Margaret the virgin.

1931
04:00:41,097 --> 04:00:46,650
Consul Olybrius, attempting to sway her from the faith of Christ, subjected her to many torments.

1932
04:00:46,650 --> 04:00:50,200
These included being hung on a rack and torn with sharp claws.

1933
04:00:50,200 --> 04:01:01,078
Later, she was thrown into a dark prison, where she overcame many temptations of the devil, which appeared to her in the form of a dragon and an Ethiopian, all in the name of the Lord Jesus.

1934
04:01:01,078 --> 04:01:04,170
Ultimately, she was beheaded and entered eternal rest.

1935
04:01:04,170 --> 04:01:09,494
On July twelfth, in Alexandria, we commemorate the holy martyrs Mammarius, Peter, and others.

1936
04:01:09,494 --> 04:01:11,154
In Africa, Donata stands out.

1937
04:01:11,154 --> 04:01:21,288
In Pontus, we honor Saint Phocas, or Phocatis, the Bishop of Sinope, who, under Emperor Trajan and the African prefect, overcame imprisonment, chains, iron, and fire for Christ.

1938
04:01:21,288 --> 04:01:25,295
His relics are kept in the Basilica of the Apostles in Vienne, France.

1939
04:01:25,295 --> 04:01:38,234
In Lyon, France, we remember Saint Justus, bishop and confessor, who, filled with divine contemplation, passed away in a hermitic life and was gloriously brought back to his city, leaving noteworthy works in the Song of Songs.

1940
04:01:38,234 --> 04:01:40,238
We also honor Saint Amicus, bishop.

1941
04:01:40,238 --> 04:01:49,685
On July thirteenth, in the city of Nisibis, we celebrate the birth of Saint Jacob, bishop, a man of great virtue, whose prayers often delivered the city from danger.

1942
04:01:50,543 --> 04:02:01,319
This was one of the confessors during the persecution under Maximinus and one of those who opposed the homoousion at the Council of Nicaea, condemning the perversity of Arius.

1943
04:02:01,319 --> 04:02:07,661
By the order of Emperor Constantine, he was buried within his city's walls for protection and security.

1944
04:02:07,661 --> 04:02:13,325
However, due to the zeal of Julian the Apostate, he was moved and reburied outside the city.

1945
04:02:13,325 --> 04:02:19,051
Shortly after, the city, deprived of the relics of such a great patron, fell to Persian rule.

1946
04:02:19,051 --> 04:02:30,011
Even while alive, he performed many signs, and he alone was granted the sight of Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat in Armenia, which no one else among his companions was allowed to see.

1947
04:02:30,011 --> 04:02:34,321
In the Roman port, there were Eutropius, Zozima, and Bonosae, sisters.

1948
04:02:34,321 --> 04:02:38,324
At Alexandria, the saints Philip, Zeno, Narses, and ten children.

1949
04:02:38,324 --> 04:02:46,266
At Carthage, the saints Catulinus the deacon, Januarius, Florentius, Julia, and Justa, who are placed in the Basilica of Faustus.

1950
04:02:46,266 --> 04:02:50,515
In Sirmium, Agrippinus, Secundus, Maximus, Fortunatus, and Martialis.

1951
04:02:50,515 --> 04:02:57,780
On July 16th—In Ostia, we commemorate the birthday of Saint Hilarinus, a joyful supporter and sustainer of the saints.

1952
04:02:57,780 --> 04:03:04,923
During Julian's persecution, when he refused to sacrifice to idols, he was beaten with clubs and achieved martyrdom.

1953
04:03:04,923 --> 04:03:14,528
At Antioch in Syria, Saint Eustathius, the bishop and confessor, was exiled to Janopolis, a city of Thrace, under Prince Constantius for his Catholic faith.

1954
04:03:14,528 --> 04:03:16,622
It was there that he first rested.

1955
04:03:16,622 --> 04:03:19,269
Also, Theodosius, Dionysius, and Theodotus.

1956
04:03:19,269 --> 04:03:27,150
In Caesarea of Cappadocia, Saint Paul, whose deeds were known to Saint Jerome, as he confessed, but are unknown to our slowness.

1957
04:03:27,150 --> 04:03:41,066
In the same city, we remember the passion of Saint Mammatus, who, called divinely to Mount Sinai and receiving a staff fallen from heaven to perform miracles, touched the earth with it, and immediately the Gospel sprang forth.

1958
04:03:41,066 --> 04:03:49,378
As he began to read it, all kinds of wild animals became gentler than tame ones, with nursing females offering themselves to be milked.

1959
04:03:49,378 --> 04:03:57,321
After pressing the curds into cheese, he went to Caesarea of Palestine and ministered to widows, the weak, and other poor people.

1960
04:03:58,367 --> 04:04:06,787
When the Jewish people of Jerusalem, who were envious of all good things, saw this, they reported him as being involved in magic to the governor of Cappadocia.

1961
04:04:06,787 --> 04:04:11,076
This governor had been appointed by the tyrant Alexander to manage those regions.

1962
04:04:11,076 --> 04:04:15,683
When the governor sent soldiers to arrest him, Saint Mamas welcomed them with kindness.

1963
04:04:15,683 --> 04:04:18,066
After their meal, he read the Gospel to them.

1964
04:04:18,066 --> 04:04:22,673
A large number of wild animals gathered, making the soldiers fear they couldn't escape.

1965
04:04:22,673 --> 04:04:31,040
The kind man gently reassured them and sent them ahead, while he commanded the fierce lion to follow him to the theater, trailing closely behind the soldiers.

1966
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:38,083
He was handed over to the governor, cruelly interrogated, and even more cruelly torn with claws on the rack, then thrown into prison.

1967
04:04:38,083 --> 04:04:41,366
There, he found forty others suffering from hunger and thirst.

1968
04:04:41,366 --> 04:04:50,103
He revived them with honey and milk sent to him from heaven by a dove and invisibly absolved them with the keys of his merits, while he remained alone in the prison.

1969
04:04:50,103 --> 04:04:57,305
He was brought again before the governor, thrown into a fiery furnace, and after five days was found unharmed among the choir of angels.

1970
04:04:57,305 --> 04:05:06,572
He was exposed to an excessively cruel bear, which rushed at him with great force but suddenly retreated and sat down, as if accusing itself of its boldness by divine command.

1971
04:05:06,572 --> 04:05:10,279
A leopard was also released on him but was more obedient than harmful.

1972
04:05:10,279 --> 04:05:14,992
Then the governor, full of anger, ordered a very fierce lion to be brought to devour him.

1973
04:05:14,992 --> 04:05:41,839
And behold, the Arab lion, rushing into the theater with great speed, was tamed by the constant reading of the Gospel and spoke to blessed Mamas with these words:
"Greetings, proven servant of God, in whom the Holy Spirit has made a sweet dwelling for itself. Behold, by angelic command, I have been given a voice for a time; your faith has surpassed the laws of nature, and for you, the human voice is granted to mute animals. I fulfill my duty to the shepherd, remembering whom we obeyed on the mountain."

1974
04:05:42,527 --> 04:05:45,536
As he spoke, the theater doors were shut by angels.

1975
04:05:45,536 --> 04:05:49,901
Suddenly, he started raging through the crowd with terrifying expressions.

1976
04:05:49,901 --> 04:05:58,454
He gently tore some, caught others with his mouth, crushed some with his embrace, broke others with his claws, and consumed some with fear alone.

1977
04:05:58,454 --> 04:06:04,942
Once all the pagans or Jews were wiped out, life was granted to the governor and his duty, by Mamma's command.

1978
04:06:04,942 --> 04:06:11,490
Returning injury for favors, he ordered the release of the lion, believing all hope of his victory lay with it.

1979
04:06:11,490 --> 04:06:17,565
But as the beast came closer, it licked the saint's feet, seeking forgiveness, and rolled at his knees.

1980
04:06:17,565 --> 04:06:24,349
Then everyone attempted to stone him, but to no avail, as the blows, flying here and there, didn't harm the martyr.

1981
04:06:24,349 --> 04:06:27,357
Thus, he left unharmed, fulfilling his vows to God.

1982
04:06:27,357 --> 04:07:30,944
And behold, a voice came from heaven, saying: "Ascend, Mamma, heaven is open to you, and all the gates of paradise are unlocked. Now the Lord rejoices for you, rewarding you for your triumphs: Now Christ awaits you with a crown, hurry with the Holy Spirit, who guides you."
Hearing these victorious words, the martyr joyfully prayed and rested in peace.

The governor ordered that wherever he went, they were to follow him barefoot.

1991

When Matthias took the place of Judas the traitor, the blessed Joseph continued his mission of preaching and holiness.

2003
04:09:37,488 --> 04:09:45,206
He endured many persecutions for his faith in Christ from the Jews and eventually passed away in Judea, achieving a most victorious end.

She, alongside her sister, the blessed Potentiana or Pudentiana, was educated in chastity and divine law by their most holy father Pudens, who was taught in the faith by the blessed apostle Paul.

2011
04:10:21,808 --> 04:10:26,348
After their father's death, she devoted herself to vigils, prayers, and fasting.

2012
04:10:26,348 --> 04:10:32,420
With her blessed sister, she gave away her entire inheritance to support the poor and the saints of Christ.

2013
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:47,118
In the church dedicated by their father Pudens in the name of the blessed Pastor, she and her sister, guided by the blessed Pius, bishop of the holy and apostolic see, endeavored to build a baptismal font so their household could be baptized on Easter Sunday.

Blessed Pius baptized ninety-six of them in the saving waters.

2015

2018
04:11:10,328 --> 04:11:17,024
During the persecution by Diocletian and Maximian, though he was a soldier, he refused to serve or sacrifice to idols.

2019
04:11:17,024 --> 04:11:24,402
Initially, he was imprisoned by his tribune Austerius, but each night, an angel would bring him out to visit and console the sick.

2020
04:11:24,402 --> 04:11:33,538
Then, on orders from Prefect Eutychius, his arms were tied with thin leather straps, his feet bound with rope, and he was dragged through the middle of the city.

2021
04:11:34,559 --> 04:11:39,077
After this, he was brutally beaten with clubs, hung up, and tortured with whips.

2022
04:11:39,077 --> 04:11:46,363
When they brought out an altar for him to sacrifice on, he couldn’t bear to look at it and kicked it away from the priest’s hand.

2023
04:11:46,363 --> 04:11:48,847
The governor ordered his foot to be cut off.

2024
04:11:48,847 --> 04:11:57,036
In the end, he remained steadfast in his faith in Christ and was sent to a flour mill, where animals usually suffer from dizziness and weariness.

2025
04:11:57,036 --> 04:11:59,860
There, he was crushed and completed his martyrdom.

2026
04:11:59,860 --> 04:12:03,700

2031
04:12:28,718 --> 04:12:31,937

Wherever he went, he showed countless virtues and endured many sufferings.

2036
04:13:25,079 --> 04:13:29,361
Due to relentless and frequent torment, he suffered for an extended period.

2037
04:13:29,361 --> 04:13:34,785
He was subjected to being barefoot on burning coals, hung on a rack, and tortured very cruelly.

2038
04:13:34,785 --> 04:13:40,551
His mouth was smashed with a rock, and he was imprisoned in a dreadful jail with a heavy iron weight.

2039
04:13:40,551 --> 04:13:42,549
He was stretched on a wooden frame.

2040
04:13:42,549 --> 04:13:45,917
While neglected by people, he was publicly fed by an angel.

2041
04:13:45,917 --> 04:13:51,455
Later, he was chained and sent into exile, where he was beaten and wounded with clubs once again.

2042
04:13:51,455 --> 04:13:59,048
He was sent back to prison and beaten, thus completing his martyrdom under Emperor Vespasian, with Demosthenes the patrician present.

2043
04:13:59,048 --> 04:14:02,017
He led the Church for 28 years, 1 month, and 4 days.

In Tuscany, near the city of Tyre, which is next to Lake Bolsena, is the martyrdom of Saint Christina the Virgin.

2050
04:14:24,168 --> 04:14:33,417
While still very young, strengthened by the faith and grace of Christ, she destroyed the golden idols of her father Urban, the prefect, and gave them to the poor.

2051
04:14:33,417 --> 04:14:39,468
For this, by her father's order, she was slapped, torn by whips, loaded with iron, and thrown into prison.

2052
04:14:39,468 --> 04:14:45,634
After being tortured for a long time and very cruelly, she threw pieces of her flesh into her father's face.

2053
04:14:45,634 --> 04:14:52,485
When she was bound to a wheel with fire set beneath and oil poured over, a flame burst out and killed a thousand pagans.

2054
04:14:52,485 --> 04:14:56,538
Again given to prison, she was healed and restored by an angel's visit.

2055
04:14:56,538 --> 04:15:01,220
Then, thrown into the sea with a heavy stone, she was saved by angelic protection.

2056
04:15:01,220 --> 04:15:11,210
Her father's successor, Dion, afflicted her with many tortures again; but as she prayed, the statue of Apollo, which she was ordered to worship, was suddenly reduced to ashes.

2057
04:15:11,210 --> 04:15:15,721
With this miracle, three thousand people were converted to the faith of Christ.

2058
04:15:16,919 --> 04:15:22,811
Recently, Julianus, the successor of Dion, faced a blazing furnace where she remained unharmed for five days.

2059
04:15:22,811 --> 04:15:28,000
She later encountered serpents sent by a sorcerer but overcame them through her faith in Christ.

2060
04:15:28,000 --> 04:15:32,161
Even after her tongue was cut off, she was ordered to be pierced with arrows.

2061
04:15:32,161 --> 04:15:35,999
Thus, the blessed virgin completed her martyrdom at just ten years old.

2062
04:15:35,999 --> 04:15:44,917
In the city of Emerita in Spain, Saint Victor, a soldier, along with his brothers Stercatius and Antinogenes, endured various tortures and completed their martyrdom.

2063
04:15:44,917 --> 04:15:48,700
On the same day, we celebrate the feast of Saints Nicaea and Aquilina.

2064
04:15:48,700 --> 04:15:55,943
They were converted to Christ through the preaching of the blessed martyr Christopher and received the palm of martyrdom by beheading.

2065
04:15:55,943 --> 04:16:01,564
July 25th marks the Feast of Saint James the Apostle, son of Zebedee and brother of John the Evangelist.

2066
04:16:01,564 --> 04:16:07,563
He was beheaded in Jerusalem by order of King Herod, as recorded in chapter twelve of the Acts of the Apostles.

2067
04:16:07,563 --> 04:16:17,833
The sacred bones of this blessed apostle were transported to Spain, laid to rest at the farthest ends of the land facing the British sea, and are venerated with great honor by those nations.

2068
04:16:17,833 --> 04:16:25,832
This reverence is fitting because it is said that through his presence, teachings, and miracles, these people were converted to the faith of Christ.

2069
04:16:25,832 --> 04:16:29,507
To affirm their faith, the apostle Paul also promised to visit them.

2070
04:16:29,507 --> 04:16:34,642
In the province of Lycia, in the city of Samona, we commemorate the birth of Saint Christopher.

2071
04:16:34,642 --> 04:16:39,723
He was beaten with iron rods but was saved by Christ's power from the flames of a raging fire.

2072
04:16:39,723 --> 04:16:43,993
He was eventually pierced with arrows and completed his martyrdom by beheading.

2073
04:16:43,993 --> 04:16:52,965
In Spain, in the city of Barcelona, the martyr Cucufas, originally from the city of Scillitana, suffered under the rule of proconsuls Galerius, Maximian, and Rufinus.

2074
04:16:52,965 --> 04:17:01,342
Initially, he was severely tortured and beaten, then bound in chains, stretched on a grill, and covered with vinegar and mustard, with orders to roast him.

2075
04:17:01,342 --> 04:17:09,071
When he appeared unharmed by the fire and flames, the wicked judge ordered him to be taken outside the city and thrown into a large fire again.

2076
04:17:09,071 --> 04:17:14,963
When the fire was extinguished by divine will, he was bound with iron once more and thrown back into custody.

2077
04:17:15,935 --> 04:17:23,687
Comforted by divine brilliance, he was once again cruelly beaten with iron thorns and bulls, and finally met his end by the sword.

2078
04:17:23,687 --> 04:17:28,279
His body was initially buried by Christians of the time, but was later moved.

2079
04:17:28,279 --> 04:17:38,595
Not far from the city of Paris, it was laid to rest in the church of the blessed martyrs Dionysius, Rusticus, and Eleutherius, and was honored until the time of the Normans.

2080
04:17:38,595 --> 04:17:45,035
In Rome, Pope and martyr Eutychian made a decree that only beans and grapes were to be blessed on the altar.

2081
04:17:45,035 --> 04:17:50,581
During his papacy, he personally buried three hundred forty-one martyrs in various locations.

2082
04:17:50,581 --> 04:17:58,094
He also declared that no faithful person should bury a martyr without a dalmatic or purple tunic until it was reported to him.

2083
04:17:58,094 --> 04:18:06,860
July 26th:
The birth of blessed Erastus, who was left as bishop by blessed Paul in Philippi and was crowned with martyrdom there, resting in peace.

2084
04:18:06,860 --> 04:18:13,359
In the Roman harbor, Hyacinthus, under consul Leontius, Luxurius from the city of Terracina, handed him over.

2085
04:18:13,359 --> 04:18:19,442
Cast into the fire, he was unharmed: then thrown into a strong torrent, he emerged safely on the bank.

2086
04:18:19,442 --> 04:18:25,166
When this was reported to Leontius, he sent a spearman with soldiers to strike him with a sword.

2087
04:18:25,166 --> 04:18:30,175
A matron named Julia then collected his body and buried it with honor on her estate.

2088
04:18:30,175 --> 04:18:37,331
In Laodicea of Phrygia, the commemoration of Jovian, Julian, Aemilius, Felix, Martian, Maxima, Saturninus, and Gloriosa.

2089
04:18:37,331 --> 04:18:45,619
July 27th:
In Nicomedia, the birth of blessed Hermolaus the priest, whose teachings converted the blessed Pantaleon to the Christian faith.

2090
04:18:45,619 --> 04:18:50,450
This holy priest, held by Maximian, was sentenced to death for confessing Christ.

2091
04:18:50,450 --> 04:18:55,280
Likewise, the passion of the saints Julia, Jocunda, and Januarius occurred there.

2092
04:18:55,280 --> 04:18:57,486
In Sicily, the memory of monk Simeon.

July 28th:
In Laodicea of Phrygia, the birth of the saints Auxentius, Prudentius, Theophilus, Philip, Alexander, Zoticus, Byssia, Secunda, and Macarius.

2096
04:19:17,879 --> 04:19:23,656
In Nicomedia, Saint Pantaleon, a young boy, was studying medicine under the orders of Maximianus.

2097
04:19:23,656 --> 04:19:33,421
He was converted to Christianity by the priest Hermolaus and performed many miracles, eventually bringing his father, Eustorgius, a senator, to the Christian faith.

2098
04:19:33,421 --> 04:19:38,364
Because of this, Maximianus subjected him to torture on the rack and burning lamps.

2099
04:19:38,364 --> 04:19:42,890
However, during these torments, the Lord appeared to him, and he was cooled.

2100
04:19:42,890 --> 04:19:46,165
Finally, he met his martyrdom by the strike of a sword.

2101
04:19:46,165 --> 04:19:51,643
In Milan, we remember the saints Gervasius and Protasius, Nazarius, and Celsus, a young boy.

2102
04:19:51,643 --> 04:19:56,228
In Lyon, Peregrinus, whose blessedness is confirmed by the glory of miracles.

2103
04:19:56,228 --> 04:20:10,579
In Rome, Pope Victor, a martyr, who established that wherever the Catholic Church had need, anyone converting from paganism to the Christian faith could be baptized, whether in a font, river, or sea, after making a true declaration of faith.

2104
04:20:10,579 --> 04:20:16,296
Also, Pope Innocent, who made decrees about the entire Church, monastic rules, Jews, and pagans.

2105
04:20:16,296 --> 04:20:24,275
He discovered many Cataphrygians and exiled them to monasteries; he also found the heretics Pelagius and Celestine and condemned them.

2106
04:20:24,275 --> 04:20:30,409
He established that those born to a Christian must be reborn through baptism, which Pelagius condemned.

2107
04:20:30,409 --> 04:20:36,423
In Milan, we commemorate the holy martyrs Gervasius and Protasius, Nazarius, and Celsus, a young boy.

2108
04:20:36,423 --> 04:20:43,152
On July 29th, in Rome, on the Via Aurelia, the birth of Saint Felix, Pope, under Constantius, son of Constantine.

2109
04:20:43,152 --> 04:20:56,431
Emperor Constantius, supporting the council of heretics and Valens and Ursatius, Arians, as he himself was an Arian rebaptized by Eusebius of Nicomedia, expelled Saint Felix, the bishop of the city, from his episcopal seat.

2110
04:20:56,431 --> 04:21:02,207
A great persecution arose among the clergy, leading to the martyrdom of many priests and clerics.

2111
04:21:02,207 --> 04:21:07,448
The deposed and most blessed Pope Felix lived on his small estate on the Via Portuensis.

2112
04:21:07,448 --> 04:21:13,879
But later, due to the actions of the heretics, he was brought into the city and beheaded, becoming a martyr.

2113
04:21:14,831 --> 04:21:22,051
On the same day, we commemorate the holy martyrs Simplicius, Faustinus, and Beatrice, during the reign of Diocletian and Maximian.

2114
04:21:22,051 --> 04:21:36,490
After enduring many different torments, they were sentenced to death by beheading, with stones tied around their necks, and were thrown from the bridge commonly known as the Stone Bridge, but referred to by scholars as the Lepidus Bridge, into the Tiber River.

2115
04:21:36,490 --> 04:21:48,208
Their bodies, discovered by God's will, were retrieved by their blessed sister Beatrice and the most blessed priests Crispus and John, and were buried in a place called the Sixth Philippi, on the Portuense Road.

2116
04:21:48,208 --> 04:21:57,760
Upon learning of this, Lucretius, a neighboring landowner, had Saint Beatrice strangled at night and, believing no one could stop him, seized the possessions of the saints.

2117
04:21:57,760 --> 04:23:03,401
While a certain woman was nursing her young son, the infant, as Lucretius and his accomplices were feasting, suddenly spoke these words:
"Hear, Lucretius: you have killed and seized, and behold, you are given into the possession of the enemy."
At these words, Lucretius was possessed by an evil spirit right there at the feast, tormented for three hours, and then died, earning eternal death.
We also remember the resting of the blessed Bishop Lupus of Troyes.
He traveled to Britain with the blessed Bishop Germanus of Auxerre, and after serving as a priest there for fifty years, ascended to Christ, whom he always loved, victorious over the world and the devil.
Among other miracles, during the time of King Attila, who ravaged Gaul most cruelly, as sung in his hymn:
"While wars destroyed everything, by praying, he protected Troyes."
We also honor Prosper, Bishop of Orléans, a very holy and learned man, who wrote many works for the benefit of the Church, and especially took care to defend the grace of God against the pride of heretics.
On July 30th, in Rome, in the cemetery of Pontianus, at the Bear with a Cap, we celebrate the birth of the holy martyrs Abdon and Sennes.

2118
04:23:03,623 --> 04:23:06,797
Decius had them captured in the Persian city called Cordula.

2119
04:23:06,797 --> 04:23:11,293
They were bound in chains and brought to Rome, adorned with gold and precious stones.

2120
04:23:11,293 --> 04:23:21,766
Presented in the temple of Intelludi to Decius and the senate, they became a spectacle for all the Roman people because they were noble sub-leaders and divinely enlightened by the Lord Jesus Christ.

2121
04:23:21,766 --> 04:23:28,431
Then, in anger, Decius ordered Prefect Valerian to let them be devoured by wild beasts if they refused to worship the god Sol.

2122
04:23:28,431 --> 04:23:32,292
He took them before the statue of Sol near the amphitheater to sacrifice.

2123
04:23:32,292 --> 04:23:37,370
But when they refused and spat on the statue, Valerian commanded they be beaten with lead whips.

2124
04:23:37,370 --> 04:23:42,712
Then, when they were brought into the amphitheater, two lions and four bears were released upon them.

2125
04:23:42,712 --> 04:23:48,001
The animals roared but came to the saints' feet and did not harm them; instead, they protected them.

2126
04:23:48,001 --> 04:23:55,618
Valerian, filled with fury, ordered gladiators to enter, kill the blessed sub-leaders, bind their feet, and throw them before the statue of Sol.

2127
04:23:55,618 --> 04:23:58,315
There, the bodies of the saints lay for three days.

2128
04:23:58,315 --> 04:24:07,413
After three days, a subdeacon named Quirinus secretly collected the bodies at night, placing them in a leaden box in his home on the third day before the Kalends of August.

2129
04:24:07,413 --> 04:24:10,428
They remained hidden there until the time of Constantine.

2130
04:24:10,428 --> 04:24:15,929
Then, the blessed martyrs were revealed, lifted, and transferred to the cemetery of the blessed Pontian.

2131
04:24:15,929 --> 04:24:22,329
In Africa, in the city of Tyburbolucernaria, the martyrdom of the holy virgins Maxima, Donatilla, and Secunda took place.

2132
04:24:22,329 --> 04:24:26,825
Under the persecution of Gallienus, they suffered at the hands of the judge Anulinus.

2133
04:24:26,825 --> 04:24:34,600
He tried to force them to deny Christ through prolonged hunger and thirst, but when scorned, he ordered them to be given vinegar and gall to drink.

2134
04:24:34,600 --> 04:24:39,943
As they were cruelly beaten before him, he commanded lime to be sprinkled and rubbed on their wounds.

2135
04:24:39,943 --> 04:24:44,227
They were stretched and tortured on the rack and offered a drink called 'stativa.

2136
04:24:44,227 --> 04:24:49,940
'
Afterward, they were laid on a griddle over burning coals, and burning coals were brought over their hair.

2137
04:24:49,940 --> 04:24:53,959
Finally, they were thrown as a spectacle in the theater and trampled by all.

2138
04:24:54,911 --> 04:25:05,681
When he realized they were unbeatable in all things, he condemned them to face the beasts, and, bound in chains, ordered them to be brought back into the theater for the people's spectacle.

2139
04:25:05,681 --> 04:25:11,378
As they entered the center of the arena, they kissed each other to embrace their martyrdom in peace.

2140
04:25:11,378 --> 04:25:16,621
A ferocious and savage bear was released, but it became gentle and began to lick their feet.

2141
04:25:16,621 --> 04:25:21,920
Then Anulinus, filled with rage, commanded the holy martyrs of God to be killed by the sword.

2142
04:25:21,920 --> 04:25:28,073
Also in Africa, Rufus, Priscus, Paterna, Septima, Option, Ammonius, Justus, Julia, Potamia; and also Maxima.

2143
04:25:28,073 --> 04:25:30,979
At Auxerre, the burial of the blessed bishop Ursus.

2144
04:25:30,979 --> 04:25:35,424
On July 31st, at Caesarea, we remember the passion of Saint Fabius the martyr.

2145
04:25:35,424 --> 04:25:41,008
When he refused to carry the official standards, he was first thrown into prison for several days.

2146
04:25:41,008 --> 04:25:46,250
Then, brought before the tribunal and questioned repeatedly, he continued to confess Christ.

2147
04:25:46,250 --> 04:25:52,289
Soon after, he was sentenced to death by the furious judge, and his body was denied burial for three days.

2148
04:25:52,289 --> 04:25:57,759
Later, enclosed in a net, it was sunk separately into the depths of the sea along with the head.

2149
04:25:57,759 --> 04:26:06,135
But by the power of the Lord, the net broke, and the limbs were reunited with the head, with the neck joining the shoulders, marked by his passion.

2150
04:26:06,135 --> 04:26:15,480
Thus restored to wholeness, the body was carried by a gentle wave to the coastline of Cartagena, where it was buried with fitting honor by the faithful in a church.

2151
04:26:15,480 --> 04:26:22,545
In Africa, in the city of Sinnada, we commemorate the birth of the holy martyrs Democritus, Secunda, Dionysius, and Thyrsus.

2152
04:26:22,545 --> 04:26:35,195
At Auxerre, we remember the burial of Saint Germanus, bishop and confessor, renowned for his many virtues, teachings, and moderation, who also defended the faith of the Britons against the Pelagian heresy on two occasions.

2153
04:26:35,195 --> 04:26:40,209
However, his feast is more widely celebrated on October 1st among the Gallican Churches.

2154
04:26:41,063 --> 04:26:46,679
August has 31 days; the moon has 29.

2155
04:26:46,679 --> 04:26:47,276
August 1st.

2156
04:26:47,276 --> 04:26:52,478
In Antioch of Syria, the birth of the seven Maccabee brothers with their mother is commemorated.

2157
04:26:52,478 --> 04:26:59,251
As blessed Augustine says, they were found faithful, being tested with various sufferings before the times of revealed grace.

2158
04:26:59,251 --> 04:27:08,789
The cruel forerunner of the Antichrist, Antiochus, exiled them from their homeland and consecrated their native land with the shedding of holy blood, out of envy and ignorance.

2159
04:27:08,789 --> 04:27:11,661
In Rome, there is a station at Saint Peter in Chains.

2160
04:27:11,661 --> 04:27:15,183
This church was the first one he built and consecrated in Europe.

2161
04:27:15,183 --> 04:27:30,139
In this church, the chains with which he was bound in Jerusalem and from which he was released by angelic visitation, have been placed by the care of the faithful and are sought and venerated by the devotion of the whole world, as an ancient couplet also testifies about them.

2162
04:27:30,139 --> 04:27:34,095
In Arabia, in the city of Philadelphia, a synod of martyrs is celebrated.

2163
04:27:34,095 --> 04:27:41,573
There, also, the birth of the holy martyrs Cyril, Aquila, Peter, Domitian, Rufus, and Menander, who were crowned together on the same day.

2164
04:27:41,573 --> 04:27:46,125
In Italy, in the city of Vercelli, we remember Saint Eusebius, bishop and confessor.

2165
04:27:46,125 --> 04:27:52,844
He was exiled by the prince Constantine to Scythopolis of Arabia, and then to Cappadocia, for confessing the Catholic faith.

2166
04:27:52,844 --> 04:28:04,603
Under the emperor Julian, he returned to his church, and finally, while the Arians were persecuting, he suffered persecution by being dragged over stairs, but he was saved by the protection of Jesus Christ the Savior.

2167
04:28:04,603 --> 04:28:07,583
He completed his confession in peace within the Church.

2168
04:28:07,583 --> 04:28:13,653
Previously, it had been revealed in a vision that he would fly from mountain to mountain on the first of August.

2169
04:28:13,653 --> 04:28:26,712
The Fathers interpret this as him being lifted by the grace of the Holy Spirit from the humanity of Christ, whom he confessed on earth to be the true God made man for us, to the vision of God the Father in heaven on the same first of August.

2170
04:28:26,712 --> 04:28:30,234
In Spain, in the city of Gerunda, we honor Saint Felix, a martyr.

2171
04:28:30,234 --> 04:28:41,180
He was originally from the city of Scillitana, and when he heard about the persecutions against Christians in Spain, he quickly embarked on a merchant ship out of love for martyrdom and hurried to them.

2172
04:28:42,047 --> 04:28:49,494
After spreading the word of God in Barcelona, Empúries, and Girona, and strengthening many in the faith of Christ, his fame spread widely.

2173
04:28:49,494 --> 04:28:53,595
By the order of Dacianus, he was suddenly arrested by Rufinus, the official.

2174
04:28:53,595 --> 04:28:59,746
As he steadfastly confessed the name of Christ, he was first beaten with clubs and thrown into a deep prison cell.

2175
04:28:59,746 --> 04:29:04,549
With his hands and feet tied, and denied food and drink, he was cast into a filthy place.

2176
04:29:04,549 --> 04:29:10,700
After this, he was bound with heavier chains and dragged through the streets by wild mules, nearly torn to pieces.

2177
04:29:10,700 --> 04:29:15,664
Then he was sent to prison, where he was visited and freed by an angel at night, and healed.

2178
04:29:15,664 --> 04:29:18,416
When day came, he was called back to endure trials.

2179
04:29:18,416 --> 04:29:23,866
He was flayed with claws and hung upside down from the third hour until evening, yet he felt no pain.

2180
04:29:23,866 --> 04:29:31,690
Rufinus then ordered him to be taken back to prison, where throughout the night a great light shone, and the voices of angels singing were heard.

2181
04:29:31,690 --> 04:29:39,083
When the guards reported this to Rufinus, he ordered that, with his hands tied behind his back, he be plunged into the depths of the sea.

2182
04:29:39,083 --> 04:29:45,396
His bonds were immediately broken, and with angels holding his hands, he walked over the waves and reached the shore.

2183
04:29:45,396 --> 04:29:54,569
Rufinus ordered once more for his skin to be stripped with claws, and then to be torn to the bone, with his wounds renewed until he gave his unconquered spirit to Christ.

2184
04:29:54,569 --> 04:30:00,019
His body was laid to rest in Girona in the monument he had prepared for himself on the 5th of August.

2185
04:30:00,019 --> 04:30:04,983
In France, in the city of Bourges, the deposition of the blessed Bishop Arcadius took place.

2186
04:30:04,983 --> 04:30:13,455
On the 2nd of August, in Rome, in the cemetery of Callistus, the birth of Saint Stephen, Pope and Martyr, occurred under the emperors Valerian and Gallienus.

2187
04:30:13,455 --> 04:30:19,066
He decreed that priests and deacons should not wear sacred garments in daily use, except only in church.

2188
04:30:19,066 --> 04:30:26,081
When fierce persecution raged, he gathered all his clergy and encouraged them to eagerly accept the crown of martyrdom for Christ.

2189
04:30:26,081 --> 04:30:32,610
He ordained three priests, seven deacons, and sixteen clerics, with whom he continuously taught about the kingdom of God.

2190
04:30:33,527 --> 04:30:38,701
By God's grace, many Gentiles, including respectable individuals, came to be baptized by him.

2191
04:30:38,701 --> 04:30:47,045
Among them was Nemesius, a tribune, with his entire household, and his daughter Lucilla, who was blind but received sight through the blessed Stephen.

2192
04:30:47,045 --> 04:30:52,608
Also, Olympius, another tribune, along with his wife Exuperia, their son Theodulus, and many others.

2193
04:30:52,608 --> 04:30:57,504
Later, they achieved the glorious reward of martyrdom through their confession of faith.

2194
04:30:57,504 --> 04:31:02,399
The blessed Stephen celebrated Masses and held councils in the catacombs of the martyrs.

2195
04:31:02,399 --> 04:31:10,632
Valerian and Gallienus, with great effort, sent soldiers to search for him and captured him, along with a multitude of clergy, priests, and deacons.

2196
04:31:10,632 --> 04:31:19,755
When brought before Valerian's tribunal, he entered alone and, condemned to death, was taken by soldiers outside the walls of the Appian Gate to the temple of Mars.

2197
04:31:19,755 --> 04:31:24,261
There, he was given the choice to either worship the image of Mars or face death.

2198
04:31:24,261 --> 04:31:35,109
While the blessed Stephen prayed to his God, a great thunderclap occurred with terrifying lightning, causing a large part of the sacrilegious temple to collapse, and the frightened soldiers fled.

2199
04:31:35,109 --> 04:31:44,009
He, along with all the Christians, went to the cemetery of Saint Lucina, and after consoling them with many words, offered a sacrifice to Almighty God for them.

2200
04:31:44,009 --> 04:31:48,626
Hearing of these events, Valerian sent many soldiers to punish the blessed Stephen.

2201
04:31:48,626 --> 04:31:58,584
Upon arriving, they found him offering a sacrifice to God; fearless and steadfast at the altar, he completed his service, and they beheaded him in the same place, in his own seat.

2202
04:31:58,584 --> 04:32:06,150
In Antioch, the nativity of the relics of Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Christ and the first deacon in the Church, is commemorated.

2203
04:32:06,150 --> 04:32:12,602
It is said that one of the stones that struck him during his martyrdom is there, and many healings occur through it.

2204
04:32:12,602 --> 04:32:23,005
On the same day, the passion of Saint Theodota with her three sons took place in the province of Bithynia, in the city of Nicaea, during the time of Diocletian, under the count Leucadius.

2205
04:32:23,005 --> 04:32:27,233
He sent her bound in iron with her sons to the consul of Bithynia, Nicetius.

2206
04:32:27,233 --> 04:32:33,741
He ordered her firstborn son, Evodius, who boldly confessed Christ, to be beaten with clubs in his mother's presence.

2207
04:32:34,631 --> 04:32:44,750
While the devoted mother continued to encourage her son with sacred exhortations, Nicetius ordered a man named Hirtacus to first mock her and then place her among public prostitutes.

2208
04:32:44,750 --> 04:32:51,033
When he tried to seize her, an angel of God struck him on the nose, causing a severe nosebleed, and he retreated.

2209
04:32:51,033 --> 04:32:59,150
Then, in a fit of great fury, Consul Nicetius ordered a large fire to be lit and for the blessed Theodota and her three sons to be thrown into it.

2210
04:32:59,150 --> 04:33:03,153
Thus, having completed her confession of Christ, she ascended to heaven.

2211
04:33:03,153 --> 04:33:08,713
In Italy, in the city of Verona, the birth of Saints Felix and Nicetius is commemorated on August 3.

2212
04:33:08,713 --> 04:33:15,551
In Jerusalem, the discovery, or rather the taking, of the body of Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Christ, is remembered.

2213
04:33:15,551 --> 04:33:20,221
He was stoned by the Jews and for a time was not allowed to be buried by Christians.

2214
04:33:20,221 --> 04:33:33,398
Eventually, through the compassion of the blessed Gamaliel, he was taken and buried on Gamaliel's estate and mourned, as Gamaliel himself later revealed in a divine vision to a priest named Lucian in the seventh year of Emperor Honorius.

2215
04:33:33,398 --> 04:34:27,995
Saint Luke also briefly mentioned it, saying Acts 8: "Devout men took care of Stephen and made great lamentation over him."
We will more conveniently reveal the details of this vision, God willing, at the appropriate time, on the seventh day before the Kalends of January, when his sacred body was uncovered and transferred to Jerusalem.
Some readers, not fully understanding this revelation, think it happened at this time, but it began in early December and was undoubtedly completed by the end of the same month, so that the celebration of the first martyr of Christ would precede the birth of Jesus Christ.
In Rome, the birth of Saints Diogenes and Stephen, martyrs, is commemorated.
In Constantinople, Saint Achillas is remembered.
In Autun, the deposition of Saint Euphronius, bishop, is commemorated.
On August 4, the feast of Saint Aristarchus is celebrated, about whom the Apostle Paul writes to the Colossians: "Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you" (Colossians 4).

2216
04:34:28,439 --> 04:34:38,165
Regarding this captivity, I've discovered that some scholars of the Holy Scriptures have made a significant error, believing that souls are taken from heaven and condemned to bodies.

2217
04:34:38,165 --> 04:34:50,188
Others, with a more pious but historically inconsistent view, interpreted that the blessed Apostle Aristarchus was called a fellow prisoner by Paul because he alone truly felt and endured the captivity that we all experience.

2218
04:34:50,188 --> 04:35:07,234
What I've learned from my predecessors, I will pass on to future generations without envy: When the Jews rebelled against the Romans, the Romans, as usual, pretended to ignore the insult but spared Judea while devastating Bashan and Galilee or Gilead, and invading Giscala, the homeland of blessed Paul and Aristarchus.

2219
04:35:07,234 --> 04:35:10,387
They transported the children and their parents to Cilicia.

2220
04:35:10,387 --> 04:35:20,807
Thus, the Apostle, feeling like a stranger in many ways, constantly longed with the holy Fathers for the heavenly Jerusalem, yet frequently visited the earthly one to learn, as we have indicated.

2221
04:35:20,807 --> 04:35:32,883
In Rome, in a sandy crypt, the blessed martyr Tertullinus, whom blessed Pope Stephen consecrated as a priest in his white garments after baptism, was seized by the prefect Marcus two days later and brought to Emperor Valerian.

2222
04:35:32,883 --> 04:35:36,250
Valerian ordered him to be stretched out and beaten with clubs.

2223
04:35:36,250 --> 04:35:41,594
While he gave thanks to Christ amid the beatings, Valerian commanded fire to be placed at his sides.

2224
04:35:41,594 --> 04:35:55,113
Even as he remained joyful and steadfast, he was handed over to Sapricius, the prefect, who first ordered his mouth to be smashed with stones, then stretched him on the rack, tortured him with tendons for a long time, and finally roasted him with fires.

2225
04:35:55,113 --> 04:35:59,121
Strengthened by the grace of the Holy Spirit, he confessed Christ the Lord.

2226
04:35:59,121 --> 04:36:04,037
Sapricius reported this to Valerian, who sent back the order for Tertullinus to be beheaded.

2227
04:36:04,037 --> 04:36:11,144
Sapricius then commanded that he be taken down from the rack, led along the Via Lavicana to the second milestone, and there beheaded.

2228
04:36:11,144 --> 04:36:18,678
Pope Stephen and the clergy gathered his body, and after singing hymns of thanks to God, they buried it in the same place in the sandy crypt.

2229
04:36:19,319 --> 04:36:23,290
In Rome, on the Tiburtine Way, Crescentian and Justus are commemorated.

2230
04:36:23,290 --> 04:36:32,293
We also remember Justin the priest, who, as recounted in the passion of Saint Lawrence, converted many to Christianity and buried the bodies of numerous martyrs.

2231
04:36:32,293 --> 04:36:37,774
In Lyon, France, the arrival of the body of Saint Justus, a bishop from the desert, is celebrated.

2232
04:36:37,774 --> 04:36:44,204
On August 5th in France, in the city of Châlons, we remember the burial of Saint Memmius, the bishop and confessor.

2233
04:36:44,204 --> 04:36:51,866
It is said that he was ordained by the blessed Apostle Peter and sent to France with Saint Denis and Eucherius to preach the word of God.

2234
04:36:51,866 --> 04:36:57,066
After living an extraordinary life and performing many miracles, he moved on to eternal life.

2235
04:36:57,066 --> 04:37:05,119
In Rome, Pope Hormisdas, who served for 17 years, organized the clergy and taught the psalms, and was buried in the church of the blessed Peter.

2236
04:37:05,119 --> 04:37:09,257
In Augusta Euphratensis, we celebrate the birth of Saint Afra, the martyr.

2237
04:37:09,257 --> 04:37:21,224
Due to the similarity of names, Augusta and Afra, some believed that on this day in Augsburg, Recia, or Vindelica, the passion of Saint Afra was fulfilled, about which we will speak more in the future, God willing.

2238
04:37:21,224 --> 04:37:24,859
In Autun, we commemorate the burial of Saint Cassian, the bishop.

2239
04:37:24,859 --> 04:37:28,550
Elsewhere, we celebrate the birth of Saints Florian and Celestine.

2240
04:37:28,550 --> 04:37:36,155
On August 6th in Rome, on the Appian Way, in the cemetery of Callixtus, we commemorate the birth of Saint Sixtus, the bishop and martyr.

2241
04:37:36,155 --> 04:37:43,872
Also remembered are the deacons Felicissimus and Agapitus, in the cemetery of Praetextatus, under the Emperor Decius and Prefect Valerian.

2242
04:37:43,872 --> 04:37:51,869
They captured the most blessed elder, Saint Sixtus, the Roman bishop, along with all his clergy, and held them in public custody for many days.

2243
04:37:51,869 --> 04:38:04,619
Later, Decius ordered the blessed Sixtus, along with the two deacons, Felicissimus and Agapitus, to be presented to him in the temple of Intellus, and when they refused to sacrifice to idols, they were placed in private custody.

2244
04:38:04,619 --> 04:38:15,804
When they were presented again to Decius and Valerian, on Valerian’s suggestion, Decius ordered them to be taken to the temple of Mars, and if they refused to sacrifice, they should be executed there.

2245
04:38:15,804 --> 04:38:23,465
When they were brought to the temple, the blessed Sixtus spoke to the temple of Mars: May Christ, the Son of the living God, destroy you.

2246
04:38:24,359 --> 04:38:29,837
And when all the Christians responded, Amen, suddenly part of the temple collapsed and shattered.

2247
04:38:29,837 --> 04:38:37,459
The blessed Lawrence cried out, saying, Do not abandon me, Holy Father, because I have already spent the treasures you entrusted to me.

2248
04:38:37,459 --> 04:38:47,962
The soldiers who heard about the treasures seized the blessed Lawrence, the archdeacon, and led the holy Sixtus, Felicissimus, and Agapitus to the hill of Mars, where they were beheaded.

2249
04:38:47,962 --> 04:38:56,092
That night, the clergy and many Christians gathered to collect the bodies of the saints, and they were honorably buried in the mentioned places.

2250
04:38:56,092 --> 04:39:03,602
Also beheaded with them were four others: Januarius, Magnus, Vincentius, and Stephanus the subdeacons, as recorded in the papal acts.

2251
04:39:03,602 --> 04:39:07,950
Saint Quartus also suffered with them, as noted by the great scholar Cyprian.

2252
04:39:07,950 --> 04:39:14,443
This blessed Sixtus was born and educated in Athens; initially a philosopher, he later became a disciple of Christ.

2253
04:39:14,443 --> 04:39:18,283
He served as bishop for one year, ten months, and thirty-three days.

2254
04:39:18,283 --> 04:39:23,703
In Rome, there were one hundred sixty-five soldiers, and the martyrdom of Saint Afra the virgin.

2255
04:39:23,703 --> 04:39:33,528
On the same day in Spain, in the city of Complutum, Justus and Pastor, brothers, who were still children in school, threw down their tablets and ran voluntarily to martyrdom.

2256
04:39:33,528 --> 04:39:44,030
They were immediately ordered to be held by Count Dacian, and with mutual encouragement, they strengthened each other and were led outside the city to be executed in the Field of Praise.

2257
04:39:44,030 --> 04:39:48,322
On August seventh in Rome, the passion of twenty-five holy martyrs occurred.

2258
04:39:48,322 --> 04:39:53,178
Likewise, the holy martyrs Peter and Juliana, with eighteen others, were commemorated.

2259
04:39:53,178 --> 04:39:58,598
In Tuscany, in the city of Arezzo, the birth of Saint Donatus, bishop and martyr, is celebrated.

2260
04:39:58,598 --> 04:40:06,334
He was raised by the holy priest Pigmentius under the title of the blessed Pastor and was well-educated in both divine and human letters.

2261
04:40:06,334 --> 04:40:09,891
Together with him, Julian grew up and was ordained a subdeacon.

2262
04:40:09,891 --> 04:40:14,408
However, later, he rejected this rank, became an apostate, and aspired to power.

2263
04:40:15,311 --> 04:40:21,910
At that time, the blessed Pigmenius was imprisoned in Rome, and the holy parents of Donatus were killed by the sword.

2264
04:40:21,910 --> 04:40:29,807
Donatus, a reader, fled to the city of Arelium and lived with the devout monk Hilarinus, serving the Lord with constant prayers and fasting.

2265
04:40:29,807 --> 04:40:39,451
A woman named Suranna, a non-believer and pagan who was blind, along with her only son, Herculius, sought out the cell of the blessed Hilarinus, where Donatus was staying.

2266
04:40:39,451 --> 04:40:45,148
Hilarinus and Donatus led her, instructing her in the faith of Christ, to the blessed bishop Satyrus.

2267
04:40:45,148 --> 04:40:52,254
He accepted her faith, gave thanks to God, and prescribed a fast for her, asking her to humble herself in sackcloth and ashes.

2268
04:40:52,254 --> 04:40:55,920
He then instructed her in the faith and baptized her and her son.

2269
04:40:55,920 --> 04:40:58,176
Immediately, Suranna's eyes were opened.

2270
04:40:58,176 --> 04:41:02,971
Upon hearing this, Apronianus brought his demon-possessed son to the blessed Donatus.

2271
04:41:02,971 --> 04:41:10,134
When Donatus prayed with the blessed bishop Satyrus and the blessed Hilarinus, the demon was cast out, leaving the boy healthy.

2272
04:41:10,134 --> 04:41:17,522
Not long after, a man named Eustasius, the governor of Tuscany and tax collector, found himself detained while his enemies arrived.

2273
04:41:17,522 --> 04:41:23,895
His wife, Euphrosyna, hid the tax money, and a few days later, while her husband was still away, she passed away.

2274
04:41:23,895 --> 04:41:31,002
Upon his return, Eustasius was summoned for the tax money and went to the blessed Satyrus and Donatus, explaining his anxiety.

2275
04:41:31,002 --> 04:42:00,331
Donatus stood over his wife's grave and cried out: "Euphrosyna, by Christ crucified, I adjure you to tell us what happened to the tax money, because your husband is greatly troubled by the collectors because of it."
She immediately responded from the grave: "The money you seek is hidden at the entrance of the house, buried underground."
After recovering the money, Eustasius was freed from the accusation.
With the return of the blessed Satyrus and his fathers, the blessed Donatus took on the priesthood in his place.

2276
04:42:01,007 --> 04:42:11,904
One day, after celebrating mass for the people, and when the congregation was reverently refreshed by the body and blood of Christ, a deacon named Anthimus was distributing the sacred blood of Christ.

2277
04:42:11,904 --> 04:42:15,936
Suddenly, due to a rush by pagans, he fell and shattered the holy chalice.

2278
04:42:15,936 --> 04:42:19,041
Both he and the followers of Christ were deeply saddened.

2279
04:42:19,041 --> 04:42:22,637
The Lord quickly lifted their sadness through the blessed Donatus.

2280
04:42:22,637 --> 04:42:27,050
The fragments of the Lord's chalice were gathered and brought to the blessed man.

2281
04:42:27,050 --> 04:42:31,518
Receiving them with tears, he prayed and restored the vessel to its original form.

2282
04:42:31,518 --> 04:42:36,912
Amazed by this miracle, the pagans, along with the Christians, acknowledged the divinity of Christ.

2283
04:42:36,912 --> 04:42:41,052
Around seventy-eight souls, believing in Christ, were saved through baptism.

2284
04:42:41,052 --> 04:42:45,683
The Lord, glorifying His holy one with many signs, led him to the crown of martyrdom.

2285
04:42:45,683 --> 04:42:50,696
Eventually, during the time of Emperor Julian, he was arrested by Quadratianus, the prefect.

2286
04:42:50,696 --> 04:42:54,891
Along with him, the man of God, Hilarinus, was ordered to sacrifice to idols.

2287
04:42:54,891 --> 04:43:04,589
Faithfully resisting, Quadratianus ordered Anthimus's mouth to be crushed with stones, while Hilarinus the monk was beaten with clubs in his presence until he gave up his spirit.

2288
04:43:04,589 --> 04:43:07,259
Then the blessed Donatus was thrown into custody.

2289
04:43:07,259 --> 04:43:16,194
While the Lord performed countless miracles through His servant, Quadratianus sent for him and struck him with a sword on the seventh day before the Ides of August.

2290
04:43:16,194 --> 04:43:23,222
The Christians buried his body with reverence near the city, and the bones of the martyr Hilarinus are kept in the city of Ostia.

2291
04:43:23,222 --> 04:43:27,363
In Milan, Saint Faustinus was martyred during the time of Aurelius Commodus.

2292
04:43:27,363 --> 04:43:31,721
In the province of Rhaetia, in the city of Augusta, was the birth of Saint Afra.

2293
04:43:31,721 --> 04:43:42,454
Although she was a pagan and a prostitute, through the teachings of Saint Narcissus, bishop of Girona, and guided by God's grace, she converted to Christ and was baptized with her entire household.

2294
04:43:42,454 --> 04:43:51,716
For confessing the Lord, she was handed over to the fire with her mother Hilaria and the girls, Digna, Eumenia, and Euprepia, on the eighth day before the Ides of August.

2295
04:43:51,716 --> 04:43:53,732
In Rome, the birth of Saint Cyriacus.

2296
04:43:54,767 --> 04:44:02,447
After a lengthy imprisonment under Maximian, alongside his fellow deacon Sisinnius, Largo, and Smaragdus, he performed numerous miracles.

2297
04:44:02,447 --> 04:44:09,005
This included healing and baptizing Diocletian's daughter, Artemia, from demonic possession at the emperor's request.

2298
04:44:09,005 --> 04:44:16,685
He was also sent by Diocletian to Persia to similarly free and baptize King Shapur's daughter, Jobia, along with the king and 330 others.

2299
04:44:16,685 --> 04:44:23,691
Upon returning to Rome after Diocletian's death, he was arrested by Maximian's son for converting his sister to Christianity.

2300
04:44:23,691 --> 04:44:29,801
Maximian ordered that on the day of his procession, he be dragged naked and chained in front of his carriage.

2301
04:44:29,801 --> 04:44:39,218
Afterwards, he was taken from prison with his companions Largo, Smaragdus, and Crescentianus, and by the order of the deputy Carpasius, his head was covered with pitch.

2302
04:44:39,218 --> 04:44:44,880
Four days later, he was taken from prison again, stretched on a rack, tortured, and beaten with rods.

2303
04:44:44,880 --> 04:44:50,709
A few days after that, on Maximian's orders, he was beheaded along with Largo, Smaragdus, and 20 others.

2304
04:44:50,709 --> 04:44:56,707
Their bodies were collected at night by the priest John and buried on the Via Salaria on the 15th of March.

2305
04:44:56,707 --> 04:45:04,667
Eight days later, the blessed Bishop Marcellus, along with the devout matron Lucina, anointed the bodies of the saints with spices and linens.

2306
04:45:04,667 --> 04:45:13,411
They then transferred them to his estate on the Via Ostiensis, seven miles from Rome, and personally reburied them in stone sarcophagi on the 8th of August.

2307
04:45:13,411 --> 04:45:22,155
Meanwhile, the deputy Carpasius seized the house of Cyriacus, which had been given to him by Emperor Diocletian, and Maximian immediately granted it to him.

2308
04:45:22,155 --> 04:45:33,927
Upon entering, Carpasius found the place where Saint Cyriacus the deacon had built a fountain, consecrated by the blessed Bishop Marcellus, where those coming to the faith were baptized by the blessed Cyriacus.

2309
04:45:33,927 --> 04:45:42,447
Carpasius set up a bath for himself at this location, and while he and nineteen others laughed at the Christian faith, they suddenly fell down and died.

2310
04:45:43,175 --> 04:45:51,206
In Nicomedia, we celebrate the feast day of Saints Nazarius, Julian, and the virgin Agape, along with Eutychianus, Philadelphia, and Leonidas.

2311
04:45:51,206 --> 04:45:56,522
In the city of Vienne in Gaul, we remember the birth of Saint Severus, a priest and confessor.

2312
04:45:56,522 --> 04:46:06,588
According to his story, he was of Indian origin, fervently dedicated to the faith of Christ, and undertook a challenging journey to preach the Gospel, eventually reaching Vienne.

2313
04:46:06,588 --> 04:46:11,508
There, through his words and miracles, he converted many pagans to the Christian faith.

2314
04:46:11,508 --> 04:46:19,313
When he passed away peacefully, he was buried in the basilica of Saint Stephen, renowned for his signs and deeply honored by the faithful.

2315
04:46:19,313 --> 04:46:21,971
August ninth marks the Vigil of Saint Lawrence.

2316
04:46:21,971 --> 04:46:26,268
On the same day in Rome, we celebrate the feast of Saint Romanus the martyr.

2317
04:46:26,268 --> 04:46:35,147
Inspired by the confession of Saint Lawrence, he asked to be baptized by him; and immediately, by the order of Decius, he was beaten with clubs and beheaded.

2318
04:46:35,147 --> 04:46:41,594
In the city of Verona, Firmus and Rusticus suffered during the reign of Emperor Maximian and his advisor Anulinus.

2319
04:46:41,594 --> 04:46:44,705
In the East, we remember the suffering of many martyrs.

2320
04:46:44,705 --> 04:46:57,203
In Cologne, Faustinus, Marcellinus, Secundianus, and Verianus, according to the Martyrology of Saint Jerome, were baptized by blessed Sixtus because of the continuation of times and are said to have been killed by Decius.

2321
04:46:57,203 --> 04:47:04,611
August tenth—In Rome, on the Via Tiburtina, we commemorate the birth of Saint Lawrence, archdeacon and martyr under Emperor Decius.

2322
04:47:04,611 --> 04:47:11,058
Blessed Sixtus left all the Church's properties and treasures to him as he went to receive the crown of martyrdom.

2323
04:47:11,058 --> 04:47:15,978
Lawrence generously distributed these to the weak, the poor, widows, and those in need.

2324
04:47:15,978 --> 04:47:27,345
Upon hearing this, Emperor Decius ordered him to be brought before him and handed him over to Valerian, the city prefect, who entrusted him to a certain Hippolytus, who imprisoned him with many others.

2325
04:47:27,345 --> 04:47:35,545
There, blessed Lawrence healed the widow Cyriaca, restored sight to Crescention, and made Lucillus, a blind man, see in the name of Jesus Christ.

2326
04:47:35,545 --> 04:47:40,522
Many other blind people, hearing of this, came to blessed Lawrence and were given sight.

2327
04:47:40,522 --> 04:47:45,046
Seeing this, Hippolytus believed, was instructed in the faith, and was baptized.

2328
04:47:46,007 --> 04:47:58,030
After completing three days during which, with the permission of Hippolytus, now a Christian, the blessed Lawrence distributed all the Church's resources to the poor, he presented himself at the Sallustian palace.

2329
04:47:58,030 --> 04:48:01,812
Decius, angry, ordered him to be stripped and beaten with scourges.

2330
04:48:01,812 --> 04:48:07,457
Later, the blessed Lawrence, bound in chains, was taken to the palace of Tiberius to be heard there.

2331
04:48:07,457 --> 04:48:10,731
Full of rage, Decius ordered him to be beaten while naked.

2332
04:48:10,731 --> 04:48:17,165
As he was being beaten, he cried out to Caesar, Look, wretch, even now recognize that I do not feel your torments.

2333
04:48:17,165 --> 04:48:22,584
Then Decius ordered the rods to be increased and red-hot iron plates to be applied to his sides.

2334
04:48:22,584 --> 04:49:43,245
The blessed Lawrence said, "Lord Jesus Christ, God from God, have mercy on me, your servant, because I did not deny you when accused; when questioned, I confessed you as the Lord Jesus Christ."
And while he was being beaten for a long time with leaden whips, he said, "Lord Jesus Christ, who for our salvation deigned to take the form of a servant to free us from the service of demons, receive my spirit."
And a voice was heard: "Many struggles still await you."
Then, stretched out on a rack and severely beaten with scourges, smiling and giving thanks, he said, "Blessed are you, Lord God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has granted us mercy, which we do not deserve: but you, Lord, in your kindness, grant us grace, so that all those standing around may know that you comfort your servants."
Then one of the soldiers, named Romanus, believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and said to the blessed Lawrence, "I see before you a most beautiful man, standing with a linen cloth, wiping your wounds. I implore you by Christ, who sent his angel to you, do not abandon me."
The blessed martyr was then lifted from the rack and released, returned to Hippolytus, only in the palace. Romanus came with a pitcher, threw himself at the feet of the blessed Lawrence to be baptized; and soon after being baptized, having proclaimed himself a Christian with a public voice, he was taken outside the walls of the Salaria Gate and beheaded.

2335
04:49:43,583 --> 04:49:47,461
Decius Caesar went to the baths near the Palace of Sallust at night.

2336
04:49:47,461 --> 04:49:55,786
When Saint Lawrence was brought before him, they displayed all sorts of torture devices: lead whips, clubs, metal plates, claws, beds, and sticks.

2337
04:49:55,786 --> 04:51:39,965
Decius said to the blessed martyr, "Now abandon your deceitful magic arts and tell us about your noble heritage."
Lawrence replied, "As for my heritage, I am Spanish, educated and raised Roman, and a Christian from birth, instructed in every holy and divine law."
Decius commanded, "Sacrifice to the gods, because if you do not, this night will be spent on you with tortures."
Lawrence replied, "My night has no darkness, but shines entirely in the light."
As stones were being thrown at his face, he laughed and felt strengthened, saying, "I thank you, Lord, because you are the Lord of all things."
A bed with three ribs was brought, and the blessed Lawrence, stripped of his clothes, was stretched out on an iron grid.
While being scorched with iron forks from above, he said to Decius, "I have offered myself as a sacrifice to God for a sweet fragrance, because the sacrifice to God is a broken spirit."
The executioners urgently applied hot coals, placing them under the grid and pressing down on him with iron forks.
Saint Lawrence said, "Learn, wretched one, the power of my Lord Jesus Christ, my God, for your coals bring me refreshment, but for you, they bring eternal torment."
"The Lord knows that I did not deny when accused, and when questioned, I confessed Christ. Roasted, I give thanks."
With a beautiful face, he said, "I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for deeming me worthy to be strengthened by you."
Lifting his eyes to Decius, he said, "Look, wretched one, you have roasted one side; turn me over and eat."
Giving thanks and glorifying God, he said, "I thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for allowing me to enter your gates," and he released his spirit.
At the first light of dawn, as it was still twilight, Hippolytus took his body, wrapped it with linens and spices, and sent word of this to Justin the priest.

2338
04:51:40,079 --> 04:51:50,687
Then, the blessed Justin and Hippolytus, filled with sorrow, took the body of the blessed martyr Lawrence and went to the Via Tiburtina, to the estate of a widow named Cyriaca, in the Verano field.

2339
04:51:50,687 --> 04:51:56,717
This was where the blessed martyr had stayed at night and to whom he had given a cloth to wipe the saints' feet.

2340
04:51:56,717 --> 04:51:59,517
There, in the evening, they buried him on August 10.

2341
04:51:59,517 --> 04:52:03,717
They fasted while keeping vigil for three days with a multitude of Christians.

2342
04:52:03,717 --> 04:52:08,401
The blessed Justin, a priest, offered a sacrifice of praise, and everyone participated.

2343
04:52:08,401 --> 04:52:16,585
On the same day, Claudius, Severus, Crescentius, and Romanus suffered, just as the blessed Lawrence did, three days after the martyrdom of Saint Sixtus.

2344
04:52:16,585 --> 04:52:20,193
In Rome, on that day, one hundred and forty-five soldiers perished.

2345
04:52:20,193 --> 04:52:27,892
On August 11, in Rome, between the two laurels, was the birth of Saint Tiburtius, son of Chromatius, the city prefect, who was highly educated.

2346
04:52:27,892 --> 04:52:41,138
He was taught in the faith by the blessed Sebastian and Saint Tranquillinus, and the glorious priest Polycarp, who renewed him in the sacred font of baptism and baptized his household of mixed gender, numbering one thousand four hundred with him.

2347
04:52:41,138 --> 04:52:49,699
Due to the severity of the persecution, Tiburtius, along with his father and a large number of Christians, went to Campania following the advice of Pope Caius.

2348
04:52:49,699 --> 04:52:53,360
Burning with the love of martyrdom, he remained in the city of Rome.

2349
04:52:53,360 --> 04:53:04,290
While he was there, engaged with the blessed Pope Caius in fasting and prayers, he encountered a man who had fallen from a height and was so injured that those concerned were only considering his burial.

2350
04:53:04,290 --> 04:53:12,851
Tiburtius approached him and began to slowly recite the Lord's Prayer and the Creed over his wounds, and the man was healed, as if nothing had happened to him.

2351
04:53:12,851 --> 04:53:18,020
Then Tiburtius took his relatives aside from the crowd and revealed to them the power of Christ.

2352
04:53:18,020 --> 04:53:26,366
Seeing their hearts firmly set in the fear of the Lord, he brought them to Pope Caius, who baptized the healed young man and his thankful parents together.

2353
04:53:27,119 --> 04:53:34,936
Meanwhile, as the storm of persecution grew more severe, a man named Torquatus, pretending to be faithful, joined the true servants of Christ.

2354
04:53:34,936 --> 04:53:39,560
He cunningly planned for the pagans to capture Saint Tiburtius while he was praying.

2355
04:53:39,560 --> 04:53:46,441
After being captured and brought before Fabian, the prefect of the city, Tiburtius steadfastly confessed his faith in Christ.

2356
04:53:46,441 --> 04:55:13,634
Fabian ordered burning coals to be placed in front of him and said, "Choose one of two things: either offer incense to the gods on these coals or walk over them with bare feet." However, Tiburtius made the sign of the cross and confidently walked over the coals with bare feet, saying, "Abandon unbelief and learn that the God we confess is the only one who rules over all creation. For in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, it feels as though I am walking over rose petals, because creation itself obeys the Creator's command."
Fabian replied, "Who doesn't know that Christ taught you magic?" Then the blessed Tiburtius shouted, "Be silent, wretched one, and do not force your vile words upon my ears by using the sweet and holy name with a rabid mouth." Angered, Fabian pronounced a death sentence, ordering him to be killed by the sword.
The glorious martyr Tiburtius was led away on the Via Lavicana, three miles from the city, struck with a single sword blow, and passed away. He was buried in that same place by a Christian relative on August 11th.
On the same day in Rome, Saint Susanna, a virgin and martyr, suffered under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian, with Macedonius as the judge. She was the daughter of the esteemed priest and martyr Gabinius, brother of Pope and martyr Caius, and was born of a noble lineage. Her father had raised her with great care and taught her divine literature.
Hearing about the girl's exceptional beauty and wisdom, Diocletian sent a cousin of his, named Claudius, to ask Gabinius for her hand in marriage to his son, Augustus Maximinus.

2357
04:55:13,799 --> 04:55:25,125
Despite objections from his daughter, father, and especially his uncle, even Claudius, guided by the blessed Gaius, was baptized along with his wife, Euprepia, and their children, Alexander and Cutia.

2358
04:55:25,125 --> 04:55:30,278
His faith grew so strong that he sold all his possessions and gave them to poor Christians.

2359
04:55:30,278 --> 04:55:35,204
Upon hearing this, Diocletian sent his brother, Maximus, to deal with the girl Susanna.

2360
04:55:35,204 --> 04:55:41,320
Maximus, also guided by the blessed Gaius and Gabinus and baptized in Christ, began to sell his possessions.

2361
04:55:41,320 --> 04:55:46,756
Through a friend named Thrason, a very devoted Christian, he ministered in villages and prisons.

2362
04:55:46,756 --> 04:55:56,382
When Diocletian learned of this, he sent Julius to punish Claudius, Maximus, Euprepia—also known as Praepedigna, a name derived from Greek and Latin—Alexander, and Cutia.

2363
04:55:56,382 --> 04:56:00,629
He ordered his son Maximinus to mistreat Susanna in his house as he wished.

2364
04:56:00,629 --> 04:56:06,065
Upon entering the house where the holy virgin was praying, Maximinus saw a great light over her.

2365
04:56:06,065 --> 04:56:08,161
Terrified, he ran back to the palace.

2366
04:56:08,161 --> 04:56:12,464
Hearing this, Diocletian sent Macedius to confine her in her father's house.

2367
04:56:12,464 --> 04:56:15,409
He began to beat her with clubs after stripping her.

2368
04:56:15,409 --> 04:56:22,600
The blessed virgin, steadfast in her confession of Christ, was struck with a sword and surrendered her pure spirit to the Lord.

2369
04:56:22,600 --> 04:56:26,564
Her body was secretly collected by Serena Augusta, a covert Christian.

2370
04:56:26,564 --> 04:56:32,680
She wrapped it in spices and linens with her own hands and placed it next to Saint Alexander on August 11th.

2371
04:56:32,680 --> 04:56:40,551
She wiped the blood with a sea veil and placed it in a silver box in her palace, where she devoted herself to secret prayers day and night.

2372
04:56:40,551 --> 04:56:43,778
The martyrdom of many saints in Nicopolis on August 12th.

2373
04:56:43,778 --> 04:56:50,573
In the city of Catania in Sicily, the feast day of Saint Euplius the Deacon, under the emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

2374
04:56:51,479 --> 04:56:59,825
When he declared himself a Christian outside the curtain of the secret chamber, he was brought into the auditorium by the order of Consul Calvisianus.

2375
04:56:59,825 --> 04:58:48,712
As he steadfastly confessed his faith there, Calvisius, filled with anger, ordered him to be tortured more severely and finally pronounced the sentence, saying: "We order Euplus to be executed by just judgment."
Blessed Euplus, giving thanks to God, knelt down, prayed, and prepared his neck to be beheaded on August 11.
His body, embalmed with spices, was buried in a revered place in the city of Catania on August 12.
On the same day, the martyrdom of Hilary, the mother of the blessed Afra, occurred.
While she was keeping vigil at her tomb, she, along with Digna, Emenia, and Euprepia—holy maidens of Afra—was delivered to the fire for the faith of Christ by persecutors.
This is part of the history of Saint Julian and his companions.
In Syria, in the village of Magarito, the feast day of Saints Macarius and Julian is celebrated, where many monks gather in devotion.
On August 13, in Rome, we commemorate the birthday of Saint Hippolytus, who, during the time of Emperor Decius, was tied by his feet to the necks of wild horses and dragged through rough terrain until he gave up his spirit.
Also remembered is Concordia, his nurse, who was martyred before him by being beaten with lead-weighted scourges.
And nine others from his household, who were beheaded together.
We also remember Dorosilla and Saint Cassian.
When Cassian refused to worship idols, he was asked by the persecutor about his profession, and he replied that he taught children writing.
Immediately, stripped of his clothes and with his hands tied behind his back, he was placed in the middle, and the children, whom he had angered by teaching, were given the opportunity to kill him.
As much as they hated learning, they took delight in taking revenge; some hit him with tablets and boxes, while others wounded him with styluses.
The weaker their hands were, the longer the punishment of martyrdom was prolonged, delaying his death.
This account was written by the poet Prudentius.

2376
04:58:48,767 --> 04:58:52,931
The burial of Queen Radegund at Poitiers marks a significant event.

2377
04:58:52,931 --> 04:58:59,830
Once residing in the palace, she devoted herself to pleasing God through fasting, prayers, and charitable acts.

2378
04:58:59,830 --> 04:59:07,847
Later, she was consecrated as a nun by Saint Medard, the bishop of Soissons, dedicating her life as a living sacrifice to Christ.

2379
04:59:07,847 --> 04:59:15,429
She endured numerous hardships for His love, even having her holy arms bound with bronze rings, a custom of non-believers.

2380
04:59:15,429 --> 04:59:23,881
However, the rewarder of the faithful deemed her worthy of compensation in this life, granting her everything she requested in His name.

2381
04:59:23,881 --> 04:59:27,423
August fifteenth—The Eve of the Assumption of Saint Mary.

2382
04:59:27,423 --> 04:59:32,022
In Rome, we remember the burial of Saint Eusebius, a bishop and confessor.

2383
04:59:32,022 --> 04:59:40,909
Before Emperor Constantius, an Arian, he steadfastly defended the Catholic faith, lamenting that Pope Liberius had agreed with Arian treachery.

2384
04:59:40,909 --> 04:59:49,920
By Constantius's order, he was confined in a small room in his house, measuring just four feet wide, where he persevered in prayer for many days.

2385
04:59:49,920 --> 04:59:54,519
After seven months, still confined, he passed away on August twenty-third.

2386
04:59:54,519 --> 05:00:05,022
His body was gathered by priests Gregory and Orosius and buried in a crypt next to the blessed Bishop and Martyr Sixtus, on the Appian Way, in the Cemetery of Callistus.

2387
05:00:05,022 --> 05:00:08,129
They inscribed his title as: Eusebius, man of God.

2388
05:00:08,129 --> 05:00:17,016
When Constantius learned that Gregory and Orosius had buried the blessed Eusebius in the same crypt, he ordered Gregory to be imprisoned alive.

2389
05:00:17,016 --> 05:00:26,463
However, Orosius, the priest, managed to rescue him while he was still half-alive, and later, he buried him next to Saint Eusebius after he passed away.

2390
05:00:26,463 --> 05:00:33,920
A severe persecution ensued against the Catholic Church by the Arians, during the time Liberius held the apostolic seat.

2391
05:00:33,920 --> 05:00:36,965
In Syria, the birth of Saint Fortunatus is noted.

2392
05:00:36,965 --> 05:00:38,271
In Africa, Demetrius.

2393
05:00:38,271 --> 05:00:44,982
Elsewhere, Eutychius, Paul, Eraclius, Possessor, Parmius, Disseus, Hermas, Prospolinus, Prosalamus, Hermias.

2394
05:00:44,982 --> 05:00:47,095
Also, Heraclius with three others.

2395
05:00:47,095 --> 05:00:52,005
In Aquileia, the birth of Saints Felix, Fortunata, and Vincentia is remembered.

2396
05:00:52,005 --> 05:00:54,926
Also elsewhere, Eusebius, founder of the Title.

2397
05:00:54,926 --> 05:00:55,982
August sixteenth.

2398
05:00:57,287 --> 05:00:59,941
The Assumption of the Blessed Mary, Mother of God.

2399
05:00:59,941 --> 05:01:15,223
Although this event is often referred to as the passing, deposition, or sleep of other saints, or even their birth, it's worth mentioning for the benefit of our viewers what the venerable Father Gregory of Tours, a bishop, thought about this particular assumption in his Book of Miracles.

2400
05:01:15,223 --> 05:01:27,056
After the glorious ascension of the Lord, which inspired the faithful to focus on heavenly matters by defeating evil, the holy apostles of our Lord and Savior, along with the Blessed Mary, His mother, gathered in one house.

2401
05:01:27,056 --> 05:01:30,505
They shared everything, and no one claimed anything as their own.

2402
05:01:30,505 --> 05:01:34,750
Instead, they held everything in love, as the sacred apostolic account narrates.

2403
05:01:34,750 --> 05:01:38,783
Following this, they dispersed to various regions to preach the Word of God.

2404
05:01:38,783 --> 05:01:46,795
Finally, when Blessed Mary had completed her earthly life and was called from this world, all the apostles gathered from different regions at her home.

2405
05:01:46,795 --> 05:01:51,040
Upon learning that she was to be taken from the world, they kept vigil with her.

2406
05:01:51,040 --> 05:01:57,195
And behold, the Lord Jesus came with His angels, took her soul, entrusted it to the archangel Michael, and departed.

2407
05:01:57,195 --> 05:02:03,245
At dawn, the apostles lifted her body, placed it in a tomb, and watched over it, awaiting the arrival of the Lord.

2408
05:02:03,245 --> 05:02:09,559
And behold, the Lord stood by them again, and He ordered the holy body, taken up in a cloud, to be carried to paradise.

2409
05:02:09,559 --> 05:02:14,865
There, reunited with her soul, she rejoices with His chosen ones, enjoying eternal good without end.

2410
05:02:14,865 --> 05:02:16,245
Up to this point, Gregory.

2411
05:02:16,245 --> 05:02:34,605
If anyone wonders how Gregory, situated in the West, learned of events that occurred in the East, they should recognize from his other writings that people from all over the world would gather at Saint Martin’s, much like they would with philosophers, and that holy places in Judea were often visited by those from the western parts of the world.

2412
05:02:34,605 --> 05:02:38,107
This continued to be customary up until the times of the Norsemen.

2413
05:02:38,107 --> 05:02:47,924
But lest the same Catholic and venerable Father seem to have thought against the Apostle, where he says: Christ has risen from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.

2414
05:02:48,719 --> 05:02:53,187
Since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.

2415
05:02:53,187 --> 05:03:02,018
Just as everyone dies in Adam, so in Christ, everyone will be made alive, but each in their own order: Christ is the first, then those who belong to Christ at his coming.

2416
05:03:02,018 --> 05:03:03,525
First Corinthians chapter 15.

2417
05:03:03,525 --> 05:03:16,719
It's important to understand that the special assumption of the body of the venerable mother of God, Mary, or those who are said to have risen with the Lord and are believed to have ascended to heaven, supports apostolic authority rather than opposes it.

2418
05:03:16,719 --> 05:03:27,732
It is fitting that the body in which God chose to become incarnate should be taken up to heaven quickly, and that those who are witnesses of our true resurrection and ascension should precede us, without a doubt.

2419
05:03:27,732 --> 05:03:34,901
Since very learned scholars seem to disagree among themselves about these matters, it is not my place to define them in such a brief work.

2420
05:03:34,901 --> 05:03:47,317
However, we certainly believe and confess with the universal Church that if that most revered body in which God was made incarnate is still hidden somewhere on earth, its revelation is surely reserved for the destruction of the Antichrist.

2421
05:03:47,317 --> 05:03:53,031
On the same day in Nicomedia, the birth of the saints Straton, Philip, and Eutychianus, with their companions.

2422
05:03:53,031 --> 05:03:54,849
In Rome, Saint Tarsicius, a martyr.

2423
05:03:54,849 --> 05:04:01,187
When the pagans found him carrying the sacraments of Christ's body, they began to question what he was doing and carrying.

2424
05:04:01,187 --> 05:04:07,628
But he, judging it unworthy to betray the pearls to the swine, was beaten with clubs and stones until he gave up his spirit.

2425
05:04:07,628 --> 05:04:14,122
When his body was turned over, the sacrilegious attackers could find nothing of Christ's sacraments in his hands or clothing.

2426
05:04:14,122 --> 05:04:19,057
The Christians collected his body and buried it in the cemetery of Callistus on the Appian Way.

2427
05:04:19,057 --> 05:04:20,200
Seventeenth of August.

2428
05:04:20,200 --> 05:04:25,083
In Nicaea of Bithynia, the birth of Saint Ursatius, a confessor under the persecutor Licinius.

2429
05:04:25,083 --> 05:04:35,888
He then left the army and led a solitary life in a certain tower of the aforementioned city, becoming so famous for his virtues that he is said to have expelled demons and killed a huge dragon through prayer.

2430
05:04:35,888 --> 05:04:39,368
This is written in the fifth book of the Tripartite Church History.

2431
05:04:40,199 --> 05:04:44,172
In Rome, we have Saint Serena, the former wife of Emperor Diocletian.

2432
05:04:44,172 --> 05:04:47,684
In Alexandria, Saints Orion, Aemilius, and Agnatus were born.

2433
05:04:47,684 --> 05:04:50,217
Thyrsus and his companions hail from Persia.

2434
05:04:50,217 --> 05:04:52,520
This all occurred on August seventeenth.

2435
05:04:52,520 --> 05:04:56,608
In Caesarea of Cappadocia, Saint Mamas, also known as Mammas, was born.

2436
05:04:56,608 --> 05:05:08,065
During the reign of the tyrant Aurelian, amidst severe persecution of Christians, he, just a ten-year-old child, abandoned everything to live in the mountains with his sheep, surviving on their milk.

2437
05:05:08,065 --> 05:05:12,441
While there, a divine vision revealed to him how he would suffer for Christ.

2438
05:05:12,441 --> 05:05:18,774
Wild beasts would approach him, yet he would calmly read the Gospel each day, and they were gentle around him.

2439
05:05:18,774 --> 05:05:23,149
With their milk, he provided food for himself and other impoverished people.

2440
05:05:23,149 --> 05:05:37,313
When the governor, Alexander, heard he was living among wild animals, he suspected magic and summoned him, subjecting him to numerous tortures, like stretching him on the rack and casting him into a fiery furnace, but the flames did not harm him.

2441
05:05:37,313 --> 05:05:42,609
Later, he ordered him to be stoned until his body was almost completely covered with stones.

2442
05:05:42,609 --> 05:05:45,027
Thinking he was dead, the persecutor left.

2443
05:05:45,027 --> 05:05:54,642
However, the Lord preserved his martyr unharmed and eventually called him to the heavenly kingdom, where he peacefully surrendered his spirit and entered eternal rest.

2444
05:05:54,642 --> 05:06:05,063
In Africa, we remember the holy martyrs: Liberatus the abbot, Boniface the deacon, Servius and Rusticus the subdeacons, Rogatus and Septiminus, who were monks, and Maximus, the boy.

2445
05:06:05,063 --> 05:06:14,793
During the Vandal persecution, under the orders of the cruel and impious King Henry, they were taken from their monastery near the city of Capsa and brought to Carthage.

2446
05:06:14,793 --> 05:06:24,120
There, for professing the Catholic faith and defending the one baptism, they were first imprisoned, burdened with heavy iron weights, and confined to dark places.

2447
05:06:24,983 --> 05:06:29,211
Day and night, they strengthened the Christian people in their steadfast faith.

2448
05:06:29,211 --> 05:06:32,903
Enraged, the tyrant ordered a ship to be filled with bundles of wood.

2449
05:06:32,903 --> 05:06:37,398
He had them all tied up to be burned in the middle of the sea by setting it on fire.

2450
05:06:37,398 --> 05:06:48,797
When the fire was kindled in the wood, according to the wicked king's will and his cruel ministers, their hands and feet stretched out and lifted, it was immediately extinguished by divine command, visible to all.

2451
05:06:48,797 --> 05:06:53,078
Every time the fire was rekindled, the flames were extinguished again and again.

2452
05:06:53,078 --> 05:06:58,590
In his fury and shame, the tyrant ordered them to be killed with oars, crushing their skulls like dogs.

2453
05:06:58,590 --> 05:07:02,389
They completed their beautiful course of struggle, crowned by the Lord.

2454
05:07:02,389 --> 05:07:07,901
Their bodies were thrown into the sea, but at the same hour, they were returned unharmed to the shores.

2455
05:07:07,901 --> 05:07:16,623
They were reverently taken by the Christian people, led by the clergy with solemn hymns, and continuously buried in the monastery of the basilica called Celerinae.

2456
05:07:16,623 --> 05:07:25,132
Blessed Victor, the African bishop, writes in the history of the Vandal persecution, which he endured along with others, with a faithful and illustrious style.

2457
05:07:25,132 --> 05:07:34,711
In Alexandria of Orion, on August 19th—In the city of Praeneste, 33 miles from Rome, the feast of Saint Agapitus the martyr was held under Emperor Aurelian and Governor Antiochus.

2458
05:07:34,711 --> 05:07:40,597
At fifteen years old and fervent for martyrdom for the love of Christ, he was arrested by the emperor's order.

2459
05:07:40,597 --> 05:07:46,269
He was beaten for a long time with raw sinews, then handed over to the governor to be forced to sacrifice.

2460
05:07:46,269 --> 05:07:50,711
He was locked in the harshest and darkest prison and denied all food for four days.

2461
05:07:50,711 --> 05:07:56,490
Then, when brought from prison before the governor, he was ordered to have burning coals placed on his head.

2462
05:07:57,239 --> 05:08:02,459
As the martyr gave thanks to God, he was beaten with whips and hung upside down over harsh smoke.

2463
05:08:02,459 --> 05:08:40,770
He told the governor, "Your wisdom and vanity work in smoke," and was whipped again by four men taking turns.
Then, the servants of the devil poured boiling water over his stomach.
Meanwhile, the judge fell from his seat and, after being helped by his assistants, was laid on a bed.
Sensing the power of God in the martyr, he soon lost his sad life.
News of the blessed Agapitus reached the emperor, who ordered that the holy man be thrown to the lions.
However, the tamed beasts bowed down and licked the martyr's feet.
Seeing this, the wicked servants removed the holy martyr from the crowd and took him to the city of Praeneste, where there are two columns, and there they struck him with a sword on that day.

2464
05:08:40,823 --> 05:08:44,475
His head looms like a mountain before me, causing me to tremble.

2465
05:08:44,475 --> 05:08:54,459
So, he was handed over to others, and filled with joy, he washed his hands with water, knelt, humbly lowered his neck to the ground, and offered a prayer, embracing martyrdom.

2466
05:08:54,459 --> 05:09:00,849
In Capua, we commemorate the birth of Saint Rufus, a martyr, who was taught and baptized by Blessed Apollinaris.

2467
05:09:00,849 --> 05:09:08,665
In Tomis, we honor the holy martyrs Marcellinus the tribune, his wife Mannea, their son John, Serapion the cleric, and Peter the soldier.

2468
05:09:08,665 --> 05:09:13,515
In Gaul, in the city of Arles, we remember Saint Caesarius, the bishop and confessor.

2469
05:09:13,515 --> 05:09:17,166
In Autun, we celebrate Saint Syagrius, the bishop and confessor.

2470
05:09:17,166 --> 05:09:20,590
On August 28, we remember the most blessed Hermes, a martyr.

2471
05:09:20,590 --> 05:09:26,751
While he was a prefect, he was baptized by Alexander the pope and martyr, along with his sons and household.

2472
05:09:26,751 --> 05:09:32,799
Then, imprisoned by Emperor Aurelian, he converted Tribune Quirinus and his entire household to the faith.

2473
05:09:32,799 --> 05:09:36,679
Upon hearing this, Aurelian ordered the beheading of Blessed Hermes.

2474
05:09:36,679 --> 05:09:43,525
On the same day, in Africa, we commemorate the passing of Saint Augustine the bishop, a man remarkable in all knowledge.

2475
05:09:43,525 --> 05:09:53,167
Having converted from the heresy of the Manichaeans to the grace of Christ through the teaching of Bishop Ambrose, he became a most worthy bishop of the Church of Hippo.

2476
05:09:53,167 --> 05:10:03,608
His venerable body, previously moved from his city to Sardinia because of the barbarians, was recently brought back to Pavia and honorably interred by Liutprand, King of the Lombards.

2477
05:10:03,608 --> 05:10:10,226
On the same day, in Emmonia, a city in the province of Carnia, we recall the suffering of Saint Pelagius the martyr.

2478
05:10:10,226 --> 05:10:20,153
During the time of Emperor Numerian, under the judge Velasius, he was first burdened with an iron weight on his neck and hands for the faith of Christ and thrown into prison.

2479
05:10:20,153 --> 05:10:33,390
Upon being brought out, he was beaten with rods, then clubbed, later suspended on a rack, torn with claws, had boiling oil poured into his belly, dragged over fragments of pottery with his hands and feet bound, and finally beheaded.

2480
05:10:33,390 --> 05:10:42,119
On the same day, in the town of Brillat, we mark the birth of Saint Julian, who was killed by having his throat cut by persecutors for confessing Christ.

2481
05:10:43,031 --> 05:10:51,833
In Constantinople, we remember Saint Alexander, bishop and confessor, whose prayer caused Arius to burst open, spilling his intestines onto the ground.

2482
05:10:51,833 --> 05:10:55,446
On the same day, in Saintes, we honor Saint Vibiana, a bishop.

2483
05:10:55,446 --> 05:11:02,615
August 29th—In Rome, we commemorate Sabina, a martyr who suffered under Emperor Hadrian, with Elpidius as the city prefect.

2484
05:11:02,615 --> 05:11:06,987
All her possessions were designated for either the church or public titles.

2485
05:11:06,987 --> 05:11:17,711
She was laid to rest in the tomb where she had placed the blessed martyr Seraphia, her teacher in faith, near the arch of Faustina, close to the Vinditian area in the town of Vindinum.

2486
05:11:17,711 --> 05:11:24,822
On the same day, the beheading of Saint John the Baptist is remembered, initially buried in Samaria and now in Alexandria.

2487
05:11:24,822 --> 05:11:29,660
Additionally, his head was moved from Jerusalem to the city of Edessa in Phoenicia.

2488
05:11:29,660 --> 05:11:34,498
August 30th—In Rome, on the Ostian Way, we remember the martyrs Felix and Adauctus.

2489
05:11:34,498 --> 05:11:41,667
Felix was forced to sacrifice to various gods, but when he blew over the statues of Serapis, Mercury, and Diana, they fell.

2490
05:11:41,667 --> 05:11:47,495
For this act, he was hung on the rack and, while still alive, taken down and ordered to be beheaded.

2491
05:11:47,495 --> 05:12:38,729
As he was being led away, a Christian met him and, inspired by divine intervention, cried out: "And I worship the same Lord Jesus Christ whom this holy priest confesses."
He was immediately arrested and beheaded alongside the blessed Felix.
Later, Christians referred to him as Adauctus because his name was unknown, as he was added to the martyr Felix for the crown; thus, the crown of martyrdom was increased by his confession of faith.
August 31st—In Trier, we honor Saint Paulinus, bishop and confessor.
During the Arian persecution, he was exiled by Emperor Constantius for his Catholic faith and endured until death, receiving the crown of blessed passion in Africa.
On the same day in Athens, blessed Aristides, renowned for faith and wisdom, presented books on the Christian religion to Emperor Hadrian, eloquently arguing in his presence that Jesus Christ was truly God.

2492
05:12:39,311 --> 05:12:45,719
September has thirty days, but the moon has twenty-nine.

2493
05:12:45,719 --> 05:12:47,555
September first—Joshua and Gideon.

2494
05:12:47,555 --> 05:12:51,821
Today, we remember the birth of the most holy virgin Verena, of Theban descent.

2495
05:12:51,821 --> 05:12:57,167
Her parents entrusted her to a bishop named Chaeremon for her education, and he was later martyred.

2496
05:12:57,167 --> 05:13:06,293
She traveled to Lower Egypt with other believers and joined the blessed legion, including Maurice and his companions, who served as soldiers for Diocletian and Maximian.

2497
05:13:06,293 --> 05:13:15,689
Desiring to serve Christ as a virgin in Italy, she went to Milan and visited places where holy martyrs were kept, performing acts of piety and offering herself for martyrdom.

2498
05:13:15,689 --> 05:13:18,119
She was detained by a holy man named Maximus.

2499
05:13:18,119 --> 05:13:27,137
Upon hearing that the holy Theban legion, including Victor, whom she dearly loved, had been martyred, she crossed the Alpine mountains to Agaunum to witness the event.

2500
05:13:27,137 --> 05:13:35,885
There, she lived near the River Aar, close to the fortress of Solothurn, practicing remarkable discipline through fasting, vigils, and prayers both day and night.

2501
05:13:35,885 --> 05:13:40,259
She enclosed herself in a very narrow cave for some time to discipline her flesh.

2502
05:13:40,259 --> 05:13:46,253
Nearby lived an old Christian woman who sold whatever the holy virgin made, providing sustenance for the saint.

2503
05:13:46,253 --> 05:13:49,115
Pagan worship was still prevalent among the Alamanni.

2504
05:13:49,115 --> 05:13:56,135
However, through many signs performed by the Lord through His servant, the Alamanni began to be moved towards the faith of Christ.

2505
05:13:56,135 --> 05:14:03,425
The virgin's fame grew due to her miraculous deeds, and she became the mother of virgins, revered by all for her discernment and piety.

2506
05:14:03,425 --> 05:14:10,985
The devil, envious of her praiseworthy life, incited a tyrant under Roman power to afflict the virgin of God, placing her in public custody.

2507
05:14:10,985 --> 05:14:15,899
In prison, a young man of exceptional brightness appeared to her, and she asked who he was.

2508
05:14:16,655 --> 05:14:25,119
When he mentioned his name was Maurice, he was immediately surrounded by a group of courtiers and taken away from the view of the maiden who was praying.

2509
05:14:25,119 --> 05:14:28,272
That same night, the tyrant was struck by a severe fever.

2510
05:14:28,272 --> 05:14:37,233
However, after calling the maiden to him, he was quickly healed through her prayer and was then sent back with the praise of everyone to the place of the maidens.

2511
05:14:37,233 --> 05:14:40,773
One day, when the bread ran out, there were complaints about it.

2512
05:14:40,773 --> 05:14:47,190
She reminded her sisters to trust in God's divine generosity and prostrated herself in prayer for their urgent need.

2513
05:14:47,190 --> 05:14:55,487
And behold, unexpectedly, forty sacks full of the purest flour were found at the door of the cell, which sustained the congregation for several years.

2514
05:14:55,487 --> 05:15:00,963
As her life was nearing its end, weakened in body yet steadfast in her purpose, she lay on her bed.

2515
05:15:00,963 --> 05:15:07,491
As she awaited the end of her life, the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, appeared, leading countless choirs of virgins.

2516
05:15:07,491 --> 05:15:10,920
Verena, with full devotion, asked why she deserved this honor.

2517
05:15:10,920 --> 05:16:11,934
The Mother of God replied: "I have come," she said, "so that you may be rewarded by Him whom you have faithfully served."
After these words, the blessed soul departed from her body.
The blessed virgin was buried in a place called Zurzach.
In Capua, we remember the birth of Priscus the martyr, one of the early disciples of Christ.
On the same day in Sens, we commemorate Lupus, the bishop, renowned for his holiness and miracles.
Also, in Caesarea of Cappadocia, we remember Longinus, a soldier and martyr, who is said to have pierced the side of the Lord with a lance.
After being baptized by the apostles, he was seized by the governor Octavius, and despite having his tongue cut out and teeth knocked out, he was beheaded for Christ.
Alongside him, Aphrodisius, the notary, received the crown, who even after his tongue was cut out, spoke of Christ fluently.
September 2nd marks the birth of Saint Justus, the bishop of Lyon, who secretly left his episcopate and traveled to Egypt, accompanied by a lector named Viator.
There, he spent several years with monks, ending his life in holy conversation.

2518
05:16:12,431 --> 05:16:21,094
His body, along with the bones of Saint Viator, his servant, was transported by the devout citizens of Lyon to the basilica of the Seven Maccabean Brothers.

2519
05:16:21,094 --> 05:16:24,704
On the same day, in the aforementioned city, was Bishop Elpidius.

2520
05:16:24,704 --> 05:16:26,814
At Apamea, the blessed martyr Anthony.

2521
05:16:26,814 --> 05:16:32,700
On September 3rd, in Rome, Seraphia, a virgin, suffered under Emperor Hadrian, with Berillus as the judge.

2522
05:16:32,700 --> 05:16:38,420
She, originally from Antioch and staying with Saint Sabina, was seized and brought before the governor.

2523
05:16:38,420 --> 05:16:46,972
When she bravely reproached him with words of faith, the enraged governor ordered her to be handed over to two young men, intending to violate her purity.

2524
05:16:46,972 --> 05:16:51,136
As they attempted to touch her, they suddenly fell to the ground, lifeless.

2525
05:16:51,136 --> 05:16:56,023
When the virgin was brought back, the young men were also presented before the governor.

2526
05:16:56,023 --> 05:16:59,632
Approaching them with a prayer, the virgin restored them to life.

2527
05:16:59,632 --> 05:17:07,851
After this, by the governor's order, she was beaten with clubs, and a splinter from them struck the tyrant's eye, instantly blinding him in one eye.

2528
05:17:07,851 --> 05:17:10,628
He then sentenced her to be executed by the sword.

2529
05:17:10,628 --> 05:17:13,071
She was buried next to her companion Sabina.

2530
05:17:13,071 --> 05:17:15,958
On September 4th, Moses the prophet is commemorated.

2531
05:17:15,958 --> 05:17:21,012
And at Ancyra in Galatia, the holy martyrs Rufinus, Silvanus, and Vitalicus are remembered.

2532
05:17:21,012 --> 05:17:24,566
At Chalon, we celebrate the birth of Saint Marcellus the martyr.

2533
05:17:24,566 --> 05:17:29,064
During the time of Antoninus, he was one of the fifty martyrs imprisoned in Lyon.

2534
05:17:29,064 --> 05:17:36,449
After the prison was miraculously opened, he left and converted the man who hosted him, along with his entire household, to the Lord.

2535
05:17:36,449 --> 05:17:46,889
Later, when he came to Chalon, he was tortured by the governor Priscus with many torments, then buried up to his waist in the earth; thus, on the third day, he surrendered his soul to God.

2536
05:17:46,889 --> 05:17:51,276
On September 5th, Victorinus the martyr is commemorated in the suburbs of Rome.

2537
05:17:51,276 --> 05:18:03,048
He and his brother Severinus grew in virtue through mutual service, living in poverty and solitude for a long time, and after giving their possessions to the poor, they entered the solitude of the desert for God.

2538
05:18:04,103 --> 05:20:24,143
While he was diligently practicing all these virtues, a demon, disguised as a woman, appeared at the man's door, lamenting:
"Oh, woe is me," she cried, "lost in the woods, wandering in the darkness, about to be devoured by beasts! Save me, whoever you are, resident of this place, because if I am to live, it will be yours, and if I am to die, it will be yours."
As she cried out these and even more pitiable things, Victorinus opened the door. Shortly after, among other movements of the body, the image extended a foot, touched the man of God, inflicted a harmful heat, wounded him, and knocked him down.
The demon, now victorious over Victorinus, exclaimed:
"What are you doing, most perfect man? Why are you joining another, having left your brother?"
After many boasts and mocking insults, the deceiving demon vanished from sight.
Victorinus, having fallen, became like one lifeless. Finally, coming back to himself, he returned to his brother Severinus, at first remaining silent out of shame, then revealing the cause, and even imposed a punishment on himself.
He split a tree, inserted his hands through the cracks, and bolted it with wedges, sealing the scar of the tree. He did not consent to be released from this punishment even by the bishop, to whom the matter was revealed by his brother, but he endured it for three whole years.
Only on Sunday, compelled by his brother, did he take a little bread and water, while his brother also tortured himself with similar fasting for him. Finally, barely persuaded by the bishop to abandon the punishment, he lived a life of all holiness and was later chosen as the bishop of the city of Amiternum.
As time went on, under the rule of Nerva, he was examined with tortures by the judge Aurelian for a long time, and at a place called Cotialis, he was ordered to be hung upside down in stinking and sulfurous waters for three hours. As this was done for three days, he was crowned with martyrdom and departed to the Lord.
Also, in Rome, Saint Herculanus. In Capua, Quinctius, Acontius, and Donatus, Eutyches and Maro.
September sixth—The birth of Saint Magnus, confessor, disciple, and companion of the blessed Gallus, a wonderful and most holy man. Also, Zechariah the prophet, and the natal day of Onesiphorus, a disciple of the apostles.

2539
05:20:24,143 --> 05:20:31,410
In Africa, the birthdays of the holy confessors and bishops Donatian, Praesidius, Mansuetus, Germanus, and Fusculus are celebrated.

2540
05:20:31,410 --> 05:20:38,566
During the Vandalic persecution, they were brutally beaten with clubs and sentenced to exile by order of the Arian king Hunneric.

2541
05:20:38,566 --> 05:20:41,174
One bishop, named Laetus, was consumed by fire.

2542
05:20:41,174 --> 05:20:48,330
At that time, the same tyrant closed all the churches in Africa on one day and gave all the bishops’ property to his own bishops.

2543
05:20:48,330 --> 05:20:55,042
On September 7th, in Nicomedia, the birth of Saint John is celebrated, noted for his noble and honorable worldly dignity.

2544
05:20:55,042 --> 05:21:02,253
During the reign of Maximian and Diocletian, driven by his faith, he tore apart their book of impious laws in front of the people.

2545
05:21:02,253 --> 05:21:07,578
When the tyrants discovered this, they ordered him to be tortured in every cruel way imaginable.

2546
05:21:07,578 --> 05:21:14,845
Yet, even as the executioners raged against him, they could not bring sadness to this holy martyr, despite their harsh punishments.

2547
05:21:14,845 --> 05:21:18,285
September 8th marks the birth of the holy Mother of God, Mary.

2548
05:21:18,285 --> 05:21:22,778
On the same day in Nicomedia, Saint Adrian and twenty-three others were martyred.

2549
05:21:22,778 --> 05:21:27,216
While their story is widely read, a brief account seems necessary to aid memory.

2550
05:21:27,216 --> 05:21:31,265
The blessed martyr Adrian held a position of duty during Maximian's time.

2551
05:21:31,265 --> 05:21:37,034
Seeing the severe tortures endured by the saints, he asked what reward they expected for such suffering.

2552
05:21:37,034 --> 05:21:47,685
When the twenty-three martyrs explained they endured martyrdom for the unfailing joy of the heavenly kingdom, he immediately joined them and was noted among the confessors and athletes of God.

2553
05:21:47,685 --> 05:21:55,451
When Maximian heard Adrian’s name was listed among the saints, he ordered him to be bound in iron and taken to prison with the other saints.

2554
05:21:55,451 --> 05:21:57,948
Adrian was twenty-nine years old at the time.

2555
05:21:57,948 --> 05:22:09,264
Upon hearing this, his wife, Natalia, a devout Christian, joyfully ran to the prison and exhorted him not to withdraw from the company of the martyrs for any earthly honor or fear of impending punishment.

2556
05:22:10,151 --> 05:22:16,286
Adrian, who was brutally beaten on the orders of an enraged ruler, had his ribs opened, exposing his insides.

2557
05:22:16,286 --> 05:22:19,382
Afterwards, he was thrown back into prison with others.

2558
05:22:19,382 --> 05:22:25,010
When their flesh was nearly gone, they were ordered to have their legs broken with a large iron bar.

2559
05:22:25,010 --> 05:22:29,962
After breaking everyone's legs and cutting their feet, Adrian's hands were also cut off.

2560
05:22:29,962 --> 05:22:35,196
Sent to Christ in this way, Natalia sailed to Byzantium, where the saints' bodies were taken.

2561
05:22:35,196 --> 05:22:39,023
A few days later, she also passed away in the Lord on September 8th.

2562
05:22:39,023 --> 05:22:44,933
The suffering of the holy martyrs Dorotheus and Gorgonius occurred in Nicomedia under Emperor Diocletian.

2563
05:22:44,933 --> 05:22:48,872
They were masters of palace duties and overseers of the royal chamber.

2564
05:22:48,872 --> 05:24:10,085
As followers of the Christian faith, when they saw someone being horribly tortured one day, they said, "Why, Emperor, are you persecuting him, since we also worship the same?" The Emperor summoned them, ordered them to be hung, torn with whips, drenched in salt and vinegar, then placed on a grill for torture, and finally strangled by hanging.
In Sabine, 30 miles from the City, is the feast day of the holy martyrs Hyacinth, Alexander, and Tiburtius. On the same day, Pope Sergius, who served as pope in Rome for 13 years, is remembered. He found a remarkably large piece of the cross of Christ in the sanctuary of Saint Peter. He decreed that during the breaking of the Lord's body, the Agnus Dei should be sung; and that on the days of the Annunciation of the Lord, the Dormition, the Nativity of Saint Mary, and Saint Simeon, which the Greeks call the Hypapante, litanies should go out from Saint Adrian's, and the people should gather at Saint Mary’s.
On September 10th, in Africa, the feast day of the holy bishops Nemesian, Felix, and Lucius is celebrated. Also remembered are Felix, Litteus, Polyanus, Victor, Jader, and Dativus. Under Decius and Valerian, they were severely beaten with clubs for their faith in Christ, chained, and sent to work in the mines, where they completed their martyrdom. On the same day in Chalcedon, Saints Sosthenes and Victor, who fought for Christ's name with blessed Euphemia, were thrown into prison.

2565
05:24:10,535 --> 05:24:12,676
They were brought out and tied to a post.

2566
05:24:12,676 --> 05:24:15,442
A bear and the fiercest lion were then set upon them.

2567
05:24:15,442 --> 05:24:20,036
Yet, when the beasts did not harm them, Proconsul Priscus decided they should be burned.

2568
05:24:20,036 --> 05:24:24,212
Meanwhile, they focused on prayer, exchanged the kiss of peace, and passed away.

2569
05:24:24,212 --> 05:24:28,232
September 11 marks the birth of the holy martyrs Felix and his sister Regula.

2570
05:24:28,232 --> 05:24:33,974
Their feast is celebrated with great honor among us, and the account of their suffering is well-known to many.

2571
05:24:33,974 --> 05:24:37,837
I don't think it's necessary to add more to what has already been written.

2572
05:24:37,837 --> 05:24:46,659
Suffice it to say, these martyrs, part of the company of Maurice and his companions, traveled through the vast desert called Darona and arrived in the region of Germany.

2573
05:24:46,659 --> 05:24:51,879
There, by the river Lindimacus, they dedicated themselves to vigils and prayers with great devotion.

2574
05:24:51,879 --> 05:25:00,597
While engaged in these activities, messengers sent by the wicked Maximian arrived, instructing them to force the saints to sacrifice to idols or face various tortures.

2575
05:25:00,597 --> 05:25:08,166
The blessed martyrs boldly resisted the sacrilegious demands, confessing to be companions of the saints Maurice, Exuperius, Candidus, and Victor.

2576
05:25:08,166 --> 05:25:11,925
They were tied to burning iron wheels and suffered unspeakable tortures.

2577
05:25:11,925 --> 05:25:18,137
The most blessed Regula was placed on boiling pitch, and the executioner was ordered to give her boiling lead to drink.

2578
05:25:18,137 --> 05:25:23,565
When they could not be torn away from Christ by any harsh punishments, they were ordered to be beheaded.

2579
05:25:23,565 --> 05:25:30,352
After this, the beheaded martyrs carried their severed heads in their hands for 50 cubits from the place where they were beheaded.

2580
05:25:30,352 --> 05:25:38,286
On the same day, on the Salarian Way, in the cemetery of Basilla, are the martyrs Protus and Hyacinthus, who were eunuchs of the blessed virgin Eugenia.

2581
05:25:38,286 --> 05:25:44,707
They lived for some time in a monastery of God's servants in Egypt, and then returned to Rome with the most blessed virgin.

2582
05:25:44,707 --> 05:25:50,136
Under Emperor Gallienus, they were severely beaten for their faith in Christ and then beheaded together.

2583
05:25:51,023 --> 05:25:56,302
How blessed Eugenia, disguising herself as a man for the sake of God, led a truly holy life.

2584
05:25:56,302 --> 05:26:00,950
When detained by Nicetas, she reduced the statue of Diana to dust through prayer.

2585
05:26:00,950 --> 05:26:07,434
Even with a heavy stone tied to her shoulders, she completed her trial of passion by being thrown into the Tiber.

2586
05:26:07,434 --> 05:26:10,877
This story is thoroughly explained in the Book of Her Deeds.

2587
05:26:10,877 --> 05:26:17,533
On September 12th, in the city of Ticinum, also known as Pavia, we remember the holy confessors Syrus and Juventius.

2588
05:26:17,533 --> 05:26:26,886
Sent by the blessed Hermagoras, bishop of Aquileia and disciple of the blessed Mark the Evangelist, they rested in peace after fervent preaching and many miracles.

2589
05:26:26,886 --> 05:26:31,132
On September 13th in Alexandria, Egypt, we honor Bishop and Martyr Philip.

2590
05:26:31,132 --> 05:26:35,148
Initially a prefect, he was called by divine grace to become a bishop.

2591
05:26:35,148 --> 05:26:40,944
Under Volusianus and Gallienus, he was martyred by Prefect Perennis, achieving the palm of martyrdom.

2592
05:26:40,944 --> 05:26:51,903
On the same day, Saint Anianus, a priest and abbot of the monastery of Saint Romaric, led a life marked by miracles and virtues, following a path of remarkable abstinence and hermitic living.

2593
05:26:51,903 --> 05:27:01,945
On September 14th, in Rome, at the cemetery of Callixtus, we commemorate the birthday of Saint Cornelius, bishop, who was exiled to Centumcellae during the Decian persecution.

2594
05:27:01,945 --> 05:27:08,429
Later, when brought before Decius and unable to be swayed from the Catholic faith, he was ordered to be beheaded.

2595
05:27:08,429 --> 05:27:15,314
As he was being led away, he was asked to visit the wife of the soldier Cerealis, who had been paralyzed for five years.

2596
05:27:15,314 --> 05:27:18,872
At the prayer of Saint Cornelius, she stood up and was healed.

2597
05:27:18,872 --> 05:27:27,192
Witnessing this, many were baptized, and along with blessed Cornelius, twenty-one others were martyred, including Cerealis and his wife Salustia.

2598
05:27:27,192 --> 05:27:35,856
On the same day in Africa, we remember the blessed Cyprian, bishop and martyr, who, under Valerian and Gallienus, was exiled by the proconsul Aspasius.

2599
05:27:35,856 --> 05:27:45,209
Later recalled from exile, he was executed by the sword by Maximus, the proconsul who succeeded Aspasius, due to his unwavering faithfulness, and went to the Lord.

2600
05:27:45,209 --> 05:27:48,824
With him suffered Crescentianus, Auctor, Rosula, and Generalis.

2601
05:27:49,799 --> 05:28:00,205
The bones, along with the sacred head of Saint Pantaleon and the limbs of Martyr Speratus, were brought back by the envoys of Emperor Charlemagne from Aaron, the king of the Persians.

2602
05:28:00,205 --> 05:28:06,289
These relics of the blessed martyrs, granted by the emperor, were placed in his city by the bishop of Lyon.

2603
05:28:06,289 --> 05:28:16,694
On the same day, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross:
This cross, discovered by Helena, was divided so that one part remained in Jerusalem and the other part was taken to Constantinople.

2604
05:28:16,694 --> 05:28:23,233
After many years, the Persian people, led by their king Khosrow, invaded many Roman provinces, including Jerusalem.

2605
05:28:23,233 --> 05:28:27,724
From there, they seized many valuable ornaments and took away the Lord's cross.

2606
05:28:27,724 --> 05:28:35,457
Khosrow placed it in a silver tower and prepared a golden seat for himself in that tower, where he sat as if he were a colleague of God.

2607
05:28:35,457 --> 05:28:43,816
Consequently, the Roman Emperor Heraclius waged war against the Persians, killed Khosrow, and brought back the venerable wood with great reverence.

2608
05:28:43,816 --> 05:28:51,093
On that same day, many blind, paralyzed, leprous, and possessed people were healed, and even the dead were brought back to life.

2609
05:28:51,093 --> 05:29:03,773
On September 15—the feast day of Saint Nicomedes the Martyr, whom Count Flaccus ordered to be beaten with lead weights until he died because he buried the body of Saint Felicula the Martyr and refused to sacrifice to idols.

2610
05:29:03,773 --> 05:29:08,435
His body was thrown into the Tiber, collected by his deacon, and honorably buried.

2611
05:29:08,435 --> 05:29:13,610
On the same day, in the territory of Cavaillon, the feast day of Saint Valerian the Martyr.

2612
05:29:13,610 --> 05:29:17,817
On September 16—in the city of Chalcedon, the feast day of Saint Euphemia.

2613
05:29:17,817 --> 05:29:33,624
Under Emperor Diocletian, she was handed over with forty-nine others to the proconsul Priscus, and after imprisonment and tortures involving wheels, beatings, fires, the weight of cornerstones, axes, and fiery pans, she was brought to the theater and thrown to lions and beasts.

2614
05:29:33,624 --> 05:29:40,845
Then, as the blessed virgin prayed, one of the beasts approached and bit her holy body, and thus the holy soul of God departed.

2615
05:29:40,845 --> 05:29:43,915
On the same day, in Rome, Saints Lucia and Geminianus.

2616
05:29:44,711 --> 05:29:57,144
The blessed Lucia, who served God as a virtuous virgin for 36 years, was accused by her son Euprepius and forced to sacrifice to idols during Emperor Diocletian's reign, under the judges Apofrasio and Megasio.

2617
05:29:57,144 --> 05:30:04,164
She refused, and after enduring imprisonment and severe beatings, she was thrown into a pot of boiling pitch and lead.

2618
05:30:04,164 --> 05:30:09,696
Emerging unharmed, she was dragged through the city streets, weighed down with iron and lead.

2619
05:30:09,696 --> 05:30:17,192
When she passed by the house of a powerful man named Geminianus, a heavenly miracle—a dove resting over her head—inspired him.

2620
05:30:17,192 --> 05:30:20,761
He sought baptism and was killed by the sword alongside her.

2621
05:30:20,761 --> 05:30:26,472
Fifteen days before the Kalends of October, in Britain, it is the feast of Socrates and Stephen.

2622
05:30:26,472 --> 05:30:30,339
At Noviodunum, it's the feast of Valerian, Macrinus, and Gordian.

2623
05:30:30,339 --> 05:30:41,285
In Rome, we commemorate the birth of Saint Justin the priest, ordained by the blessed Sixtus, to whom the blessed Lawrence entrusted himself through his prayers while washing his feet.

2624
05:30:41,285 --> 05:30:56,751
This same Justin was responsible for burying the bodies of saints Hippolytus, Concordia, Irenaeus, Abundius, and Cyrilla, the daughter of Emperor Decius, and during the persecution by Decius, Gallus, and Volusianus, he was renowned for his confession of faith.

2625
05:30:56,751 --> 05:31:00,678
Also in Rome, we remember the martyrs Narcissus and Crescentionis.

2626
05:31:00,678 --> 05:31:05,377
In the diocese of Tongeren, we celebrate the birth of Saint Lambert the bishop.

2627
05:31:05,377 --> 05:31:13,527
While rebuking the royal house with religious zeal, he was killed within the church's house, and his tomb is known for frequent miracles.

2628
05:31:13,527 --> 05:31:24,532
Fourteen days before the Kalends of October, we honor the birth of Saint Methodius of Olympus in Lycia, who later became the bishop of Tyre and was martyred under Diocletian at Ebacide.

2629
05:31:24,532 --> 05:31:27,685
In Vienne, we celebrate the feast of Saint Ferreolus.

2630
05:31:27,685 --> 05:31:38,214
As a tribune, he was cruelly beaten for his faith in Christ, bound with chains, and imprisoned; but by God's will, he was freed from his bonds, pursued to Brivate, and beheaded.

2631
05:31:38,214 --> 05:31:52,075
Thirteen days before the Kalends of October, in the city of Naples in Campania, we celebrate the birth of Saint Januarius, the bishop of Benevento, along with Sosius the deacon of Miseno, the deacon Festus, and the reader Desiderius.

2632
05:31:52,968 --> 05:32:01,081
As they were being led to their deaths, they saw Proculus, a deacon from the city of Puteoli, along with two laymen, Eutyches and Acutius.

2633
05:32:01,081 --> 05:32:04,962
These men asked why the righteous were being ordered to be killed.

2634
05:32:04,962 --> 05:32:10,313
Realizing they were Christians, the judge ordered them to be beheaded alongside the others.

2635
05:32:10,313 --> 05:32:21,601
On the same day in Palestrina, it was the feast day of Saints Mark, Paul, and Nilus, bishops who, during the persecution by Diocletian, were consumed by fire along with many clergy for Christ.

2636
05:32:21,601 --> 05:32:27,422
In Niceria, the feast of Saint Felix and Constantia, martyrs who suffered under Nero, was observed.

2637
05:32:27,422 --> 05:32:31,656
In the region of the city of Lyon, Saint Sigon, a priest, is remembered.

2638
05:32:31,656 --> 05:32:38,476
September 20th—In Cyzicus, the feast of Saint Fausta, a virgin, and Evilasius under Emperor Maximian, is celebrated.

2639
05:32:38,476 --> 05:32:47,413
Evilasius, the palace's chief officer, ordered her head to be shaved, then had her suspended and tortured, even attempting to cut her in half like wood.

2640
05:32:47,413 --> 05:32:53,822
When the executioners failed to harm her with saws, Evilasius, astonished by this, came to believe in Christ.

2641
05:32:53,822 --> 05:33:04,582
When the emperor learned of this, he ordered Evilasius to be subjected to even harsher torture, while Fausta was brought out of prison naked, with nails driven into her head and body.

2642
05:33:04,582 --> 05:33:08,580
Afterward, a frying pan was heated, yet as she sang, it cooled down.

2643
05:33:08,580 --> 05:33:13,284
During these events, called by a heavenly voice, they surrendered their spirits.

2644
05:33:13,284 --> 05:33:19,281
September 21st—The feast of Saint Matthias, apostle and evangelist, whose passion story is well known.

2645
05:33:19,281 --> 05:33:27,924
September 22nd—In Spain, in the city of Sidon, at a place called Agaunum, the feast of the holy martyrs Maurice and his companions is commemorated.

2646
05:33:27,924 --> 05:33:37,861
They set out from the city of Thebes in the East under Emperor Maximian, with their legion of six thousand six hundred men, and were slaughtered for the faith of Christ.

2647
05:33:37,861 --> 05:33:48,856
They had come at Maximian's request for help, but when they refused to participate in sacrilege, to influence others to comply, he ordered every tenth man to be executed in front of them.

2648
05:33:48,856 --> 05:33:58,675
This decimation was carried out twice, yet the remaining men steadfastly stood by their decision, all willingly offering their necks to be slaughtered in the same way.

2649
05:33:59,616 --> 05:34:01,530
Maximian faced fitting punishment.

2650
05:34:01,530 --> 05:34:08,680
Caught plotting against his son-in-law, Constantius, he was strangled, ending his wicked life with a death he rightly deserved.

2651
05:34:08,680 --> 05:34:13,409
September 23rd — Sosius the deacon, about whom you can learn more on September 19th.

2652
05:34:13,409 --> 05:34:19,996
On this day, the virgin Thecla, resting at Seleucia, was guided by the blessed apostle Paul from the city of Iconium.

2653
05:34:19,996 --> 05:34:25,289
Her mother, seeing her embrace Christianity and reject marriage, accused her before the judge.

2654
05:34:25,289 --> 05:34:32,664
The holy Thecla was brought in and thrown onto a pyre, but after making the sign of the cross, a rainstorm extinguished the flames.

2655
05:34:32,664 --> 05:34:38,351
Later, she was stripped and repeatedly exposed to lions and bears, yet was protected by divine power.

2656
05:34:38,351 --> 05:34:44,375
She was then submerged in a pit full of water and serpents, from which divine grace delivered her unharmed.

2657
05:34:44,375 --> 05:34:54,396
Subsequently, she was tied to two fierce bulls, which were prodded with red-hot iron to tear her apart, but the ropes broke, and the bulls scattered, leaving the martyr unharmed.

2658
05:34:54,396 --> 05:35:03,010
Then the virgin was released, strengthening Tryphaena, a devout woman who witnessed her martyrdom, along with her whole household in the faith of Christ.

2659
05:35:03,010 --> 05:35:05,882
Thecla went to Seleucia, where she rested in peace.

2660
05:35:05,882 --> 05:35:08,922
September 24th — Conception of Saint John the Baptist.

2661
05:35:08,922 --> 05:35:23,729
At Autun, Saint Andochius the priest, Thyrsus the deacon, and Felix, who were sent by Bishop Polycarp to teach in Gaul, were flogged by Emperor Aurelian, thrown into fire, hung by their hands, and finally struck on the neck with beams, completing their martyrdom.

2662
05:35:23,729 --> 05:35:29,866
September 25th — Birth of the blessed Cleophas, to whom the Lord appeared on the road after His resurrection.

2663
05:35:29,866 --> 05:35:34,145
September 26th — The holy martyrs Cyprian the bishop and Justina the virgin.

2664
05:35:34,145 --> 05:35:46,531
A philosopher named Agladius in Antioch, upon seeing the blessed Justina, was inflamed with passion for her and promised the magician Cyprian two talents of gold if he could make the virgin Justina fall in love with him.

2665
05:35:47,376 --> 05:35:53,045
Cyprian the magician, after summoning demons, tried to lead the holy woman of God astray through them.

2666
05:35:53,045 --> 05:36:04,661
But when the demons couldn't accomplish this and admitted they were repelled by the sign of the Crucified, Cyprian, losing faith in the devil's power, asked Bishop Anthimus to teach him the Catholic mysteries.

2667
05:36:04,661 --> 05:36:11,831
Soon after, he was ordained as a deacon, and as he grew in virtues and performed miracles, he was elevated to the rank of bishop.

2668
05:36:11,831 --> 05:36:16,389
Bishop Cyprian and the virgin of Christ, Justina, were later arrested and chained.

2669
05:36:16,389 --> 05:36:23,114
The bishop was hung and tortured with hooks, while the holy woman was cruelly beaten with raw thongs after being slapped.

2670
05:36:23,114 --> 05:36:28,394
They were then roasted in a pan with pitch, fat, and wax, and ultimately beheaded with a sword.

2671
05:36:28,394 --> 05:36:33,841
A man named Theognotus was also punished alongside them under Emperor Diocletian, by Judge Eutelm.

2672
05:36:33,841 --> 05:36:41,956
On September twenty-seventh, in Aegea, we remember the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian during the persecution of Diocletian, under Governor Lysias.

2673
05:36:41,956 --> 05:36:44,957
Originally from Arabia, they were skilled in medicine.

2674
05:36:44,957 --> 05:36:48,292
Their brothers were named Antimius, Leontius, and Euprepius.

2675
05:36:48,292 --> 05:36:52,461
Rejecting idol worship, they were tied by their feet and severely tortured.

2676
05:36:52,461 --> 05:36:56,240
Chained, they were thrown into the sea but saved by an angel of God.

2677
05:36:56,240 --> 05:37:03,076
Later, they were thrown into a burning fire, which extinguished as they prayed, and they were suspended and tortured again.

2678
05:37:03,076 --> 05:37:07,745
Enduring with patience, they were lifted onto a cross, stoned, and shot with arrows.

2679
05:37:07,745 --> 05:37:12,025
However, they were unharmed, and many of those who attacked them were struck.

2680
05:37:12,025 --> 05:37:15,415
Finally, the governor ordered them to be killed by the sword.

2681
05:37:15,415 --> 05:37:22,085
On September twenty-eighth, in Spain, in the city of Cordoba, Faustus, Januarius, and Martial were tortured on the rack.

2682
05:37:22,085 --> 05:37:30,311
After having their eyebrows shaved, ears and noses cut off, and upper teeth knocked out, they were disfigured and completed their martyrdom by fire.

2683
05:37:30,311 --> 05:37:37,592
On September twenty-ninth, on Mount Gargano, we commemorate the blessed Archangel Michael, where a church is dedicated in his name.

2684
05:37:37,592 --> 05:37:42,983
A wealthy man named Garganus, after whom the mountain is named, had an immense number of animals.

2685
05:37:44,040 --> 05:37:46,873
One day, the bull didn't return home from the pasture.

2686
05:37:46,873 --> 05:37:53,013
Its owner searched every path until he finally found it at the top of a mountain, standing at the entrance of a cave.

2687
05:37:53,013 --> 05:37:57,105
When he shot an arrow at it, the arrow bounced back with force and struck him.

2688
05:37:57,105 --> 05:38:04,557
Upon hearing about this, the bishop declared a three-day fast for the citizens, advising them to seek the reason for the man's death from God.

2689
05:38:04,557 --> 05:38:09,227
After the fast, Saint Michael appeared to the bishop, explaining that it was by his will.

2690
05:38:09,227 --> 05:39:31,873
He said, "I have decided to dwell in this place and claim it as my own."
He stated that there was no need for a church to be dedicated there by humans, as it was already built and consecrated by him.
He only instructed them to enter and visit the place with devout prayers.
Through heavenly miracles shown by the holy archangel, the citizens were granted victory over their enemies, and the location and numerous miracles are documented in many books.
On September thirtieth—in the town of Solothurn in Gaul, we remember the martyrdom of the holy martyrs Victor and Ursus from the Theban Legion.
By the order of Maximian, they endured dreadful punishments by Hirtacus, were thrown into the fire, and finally killed by the sword.
On the same day in Bethlehem of Judea, we commemorate the burial of Saint Jerome the priest.
He was born in the town of Stridon, which was once on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia, to his father Eusebius.
He received the robe of Christ as a child in Rome, where he was educated in Greek and Latin literature from an early age.
He also imitated the lifestyle and deeds of the most esteemed monks.
He was ordained a priest of the Roman Church and was considered by many to be worthy of the highest priesthood.
However, after being driven out of Rome by the envy of his rivals, he went to Gregory of Nazianzus, the bishop of Constantinople, to learn.
From there, he traveled to Syria, spending four years in harsh solitude in deserted places.
Then, he settled himself wisely in the town of Bethlehem, choosing to remain in the stable of the Lord.

2691
05:39:32,136 --> 05:39:43,298
The dedication and perseverance he showed through vigilance and fasting, as he worked tirelessly to make the Hebrew libraries accessible to Latin audiences, is known to the one he dedicated his efforts to.

2692
05:39:43,298 --> 05:39:53,590
Ultimately, after living a life pleasing to God, he peacefully passed away at the age of ninety-eight in the town of Bethlehem, on September 30, during the twelfth year of Emperor Honorius.

2693
05:39:53,590 --> 05:39:56,531
He completed his works over a span of fifty-six years.

2694
05:39:56,640 --> 05:40:04,104
October. The month of October has 31 days, but only 30 lunar days.

2695
05:40:04,104 --> 05:40:08,143
October 1st—In Auxerre, it's the feast day of Saint Germanus, a bishop.

2696
05:40:08,143 --> 05:40:12,580
He was sent to Britain by the Gallic bishops to challenge the Pelagian heresy.

2697
05:40:12,580 --> 05:40:17,131
While traveling across the sea, a great storm arose, threatening those on board.

2698
05:40:17,131 --> 05:40:20,715
However, by invoking the name of the Lord, he calmed the storm.

2699
05:40:20,715 --> 05:40:32,321
Once in Britain, he quashed the heresy and performed miracles like restoring sight to a girl blind for ten years, extinguishing a nearby fire, and overcoming his own infirmity through divine intervention.

2700
05:40:32,321 --> 05:40:40,172
During a conflict between the Saxons and Picts against the Britons, Germanus led by prayer rather than force, causing the enemies to flee.

2701
05:40:40,172 --> 05:40:48,079
After many notable deeds, he traveled to Ravenna to advocate for peace for the Armorican people and was received with honor by Valentinian.

2702
05:40:48,079 --> 05:40:52,005
Shortly after, he passed away, and his body was returned to his city.

2703
05:40:52,005 --> 05:40:56,556
In the city of Tomis, we remember the saints Priscus, Crescentius, and Evagrius.

2704
05:40:56,556 --> 05:41:01,961
In Reims, Saint Remigius, a bishop and confessor known for his exceptional virtue and holiness.

2705
05:41:01,961 --> 05:41:07,877
He converted the Frankish people from idolatry to Christianity, starting with the baptism of their king.

2706
05:41:07,877 --> 05:41:11,291
Among his many deeds, he once resurrected a girl from death.

2707
05:41:11,291 --> 05:41:13,964
He served as a bishop for nearly seventy years.

2708
05:41:13,964 --> 05:41:20,791
October 2nd—Pope Eusebius, who was bishop for seven years, was buried along the Appian Way in the cemetery of Callistus.

2709
05:41:20,791 --> 05:41:23,579
During his time, the Lord's cross was discovered.

2710
05:41:23,579 --> 05:41:27,333
He reconciled heretics in the city through the laying on of hands.

2711
05:41:27,333 --> 05:41:31,088
In Nicomedia, we honor the birth of Saint Eleutherius, the martyr.

2712
05:41:31,088 --> 05:41:40,816
During Diocletian's reign, a fire broke out in the palace, and the emperor, suspecting Christians, ordered their capture, leading to some being executed and others burned.

2713
05:41:41,784 --> 05:41:46,829
The first among them, and the one who encouraged everyone to martyrdom, was Leudegarius.

2714
05:41:46,829 --> 05:41:52,219
Some were cast into flames, others were killed by the sword, and many were drowned in the sea.

2715
05:41:52,219 --> 05:42:00,361
However, the blessed Eleutherius, after enduring long and terrible torture, was finally thrown into flames and achieved the palm of martyrdom.

2716
05:42:00,361 --> 05:42:06,783
In Atratis, at the villa Syrricinio, the passion of Saint Leodegarius, bishop of Autun, took place on October 3.

After a glorious confession of faith and enduring severe tortures, he was crowned with martyrdom.

Among the ancient Saxons, we remember the feast of Saints Edil and Evald, priests who came to Germany with Bishop Willibrord.

2720
05:42:30,407 --> 05:42:35,223
They went to the Saxons, and while preaching the word of God, were killed by pagans.

2721
05:42:35,223 --> 05:42:39,409
A light appeared at night over their bodies, signifying their worthiness.

2722

In the emperor's palace, Sergius held the position of chief officer and Bacchus was the second officer.

2739
05:44:08,855 --> 05:44:17,951
When they were accused before the emperor and found to have rejected idol worship for the true God, they stood firm in their faith despite threats or flattery.

2740
05:44:17,951 --> 05:44:26,418
By the emperor's command, they were stripped of their cloaks, dressed in women's robes, and dragged through the city with chains around their necks.

2741

2783
05:48:30,181 --> 05:48:41,472
During his imprisonment, his priest Calepodius, already martyred, visited and consoled him; there, he also healed a soldier named Privatus from sores, bringing him into the Catholic faith.

2784
05:48:41,472 --> 05:48:52,521

2793
05:49:29,935 --> 05:49:34,078
In Africa, we remember two hundred seventy who were crowned together.

2794
05:49:35,400 --> 05:49:40,281
Also, of the holy martyrs Martian, Satyr, with their two brothers, and Maxima the virgin.

2795
05:49:40,281 --> 05:49:45,985
Under King Geiseric the Arian, they were first beaten with knotted clubs until their bones were exposed.

2796
05:49:45,985 --> 05:49:51,196
Then, they were tightly bound, but by divine power, they were freed and immediately made whole.

2797
05:49:51,196 --> 05:49:55,583
Maxima, a servant of Christ, was released and became the mother of many virgins.

2798
05:49:55,583 --> 05:50:04,578
The others, by the order of the most impious tyrant, were tied by their feet to the backs of running chariots and torn apart among thorny places, dying in the Lord.

2799
05:50:04,578 --> 05:50:14,945
On the same day among the Alemanni, also known as the Suebi, near the Rhaetian Alps, the passing or birth into eternal life of the most blessed Gallus the confessor is celebrated festively.

2800
05:50:14,945 --> 05:50:24,488
He came from the island of Hibernia, located between Britain and Spain, driven by divine love to travel with his teacher and abbot Columbanus through Gaul and into Alemannia.

2801
05:50:24,488 --> 05:50:32,990
Arriving in the wilderness between the Rhaetian Alps and the shore of Lake Constance, he was detained by illness while his father Columbanus went to Italy.

2802
05:50:32,990 --> 05:50:42,643
This illness, healed by the divine hand, was overcome, and regaining health, he desired to lead a solitary life, embracing the solitude of the wilderness, devoted to God alone.

2803
05:50:42,643 --> 05:50:52,515
King Sigebert, upon hearing that he was staying on public lands, ordered a document of confirmation to be made so that the holy man could hold the place he lived in with authority.

2804
05:50:52,515 --> 05:51:00,468
Giving him weights of gold and silver, he instructed Duke Cunzon to provide him with the means to build a cell if he wished to dwell in solitude.

2805
05:51:00,468 --> 05:51:06,611
Thus, the athlete of God, about to build a spiritual edifice, devoted himself to frugality, prayers, and vigils.

2806
05:51:06,611 --> 05:51:13,741
He called the people back from the error of idolatry, destroyed their idols, and confirmed his preaching with the effect of signs.

2807
05:51:14,400 --> 05:51:20,949
He has a vast number of followers because the story of his life and virtues is widely available and read everywhere.

2808
05:51:20,949 --> 05:51:23,885
Even today, it's expanded by miracles from the past.

2809
05:51:23,885 --> 05:51:31,508
We'll skip over some details for now and just mention this: divine mercy made the blessed Gallus an apostle to the people of Alemannia.

2810
05:51:31,508 --> 05:51:43,139
He found the nation steeped in paganism, infused it with the truth of faith, and guided it from the darkness of ignorance to the light of righteousness, which is Christ, like a wise traveler on God's paths.

2811
05:51:43,139 --> 05:51:52,512
He transformed a place, once inaccessible and inhabited only by wild beasts, serpents, and demons, into a dwelling place for divinity after driving out these enemies.

2812
05:51:52,512 --> 05:52:06,515
It's important to observe and respect that the tabernacle of God, which the holy man established with divine demonstration and much effort, and which is set apart by royal authority as God's inheritance, should not be attacked by human presumption.

2813
05:52:06,515 --> 05:52:11,766
Let greed not take over what was cleansed from the rage of demons and the savagery of beasts.

2814
05:52:11,766 --> 05:52:18,711
Finally, no human audacity should disturb the resting place of Gallus's remains, where they were brought by untamed horses.

2815
05:52:18,711 --> 05:52:23,285
October 17—Martha, sister of Lazarus, and Aristion, one of the seventy disciples.

2816
05:52:23,285 --> 05:52:31,698
Also, the feast of Heron, who succeeded Saint Ignatius in leading the Church of Antioch, a role revealed to Ignatius himself as he faced his passion.

2817
05:52:31,698 --> 05:52:37,231
Heron became an imitator of his master in both life and martyrdom, as he was a deacon of Ignatius.

2818
05:52:37,231 --> 05:52:42,370
In Gaul, the city of Orange, Bishop Florentius, renowned for many virtues, rested in peace.

2822
05:53:01,228 --> 05:53:05,633
This place is named after the blessed Gallus as the Monastery of Saint Gallus.

2823
05:53:06,480 --> 05:53:17,435
Where the Lord showcases His power, miracles unfold: the blind gain sight, the deaf hear, the disabled walk, the mute rejoice in speech, the lame find guidance, and those possessed are freed.

2824
05:53:17,435 --> 05:53:24,317
The bedridden and crippled receive healing, toothaches are cured by the wood's power, and other ailments are alleviated.

2825
05:53:24,317 --> 05:53:27,759
October eighteenth—Saint Luke, the historian and evangelist.

2826
05:53:27,759 --> 05:53:34,584
His life, profession, and death are detailed in Paul's Letter, the Acts of the Apostles, and the preface of his Gospel.

2827
05:53:34,584 --> 05:53:44,277
In Rome, Tryphonia, wife of Emperor Decius, after the deaths of Callixtus and Lawrence, received baptism with Decius' daughter Cyrilla and passed away the following day.

2830
05:53:54,602 --> 05:54:03,893
Pelagia, once a prostitute under pagan customs, converted to Christianity and was baptized through the grace of God and the teachings of Saint Nonnus, the bishop.

2831
05:54:03,893 --> 05:54:14,848
She gave all her possessions to the poor, left Antioch for the Mount of Olives, built a small cell where the Lord ascended to heaven, and lived a monastic life in male attire until her death.

2832
05:54:14,848 --> 05:54:18,175
On the same day, the blessed martyrs Tholomeus and Lucius.

2833
05:54:18,175 --> 05:54:25,918
Tholomeus, imprisoned and tortured for his faith by a centurion, was presented to Judge Urbicius, who questioned him about his beliefs.

2834
05:54:25,918 --> 05:54:48,689
Tholomeus declared: "He who denies what is, judges what he denies to be blameworthy."
Urbicius immediately ordered him to be taken away.
Witnessing this, a Christian named Lucius asked the judge: "Why is this man, accused of no crime but only professing Christianity, sentenced to death?"
Urbicius responded: "Are you also a Christian?"
Upon Lucius's confession, he too was ordered to be executed.

2835
05:54:49,320 --> 05:54:52,941
Additionally, a third person was punished for the same reason.

2836
05:54:52,941 --> 05:54:56,971
These martyrs suffered under Antoninus and were buried in Alexandria.

2837
05:54:56,971 --> 05:55:00,475
In the city of Agen in Gaul, there was the martyr Caprasius.

2838
05:55:00,475 --> 05:55:02,753
He hid in a cave to escape persecution.

2839
05:55:02,753 --> 05:55:10,404
However, upon hearing that the blessed virgin Faith was fighting for Christ, he found courage and received the reward of martyrdom.

2840
05:55:10,404 --> 05:55:17,471
On October 20 in Nicomedia, the holy martyrs Dasius, Zotikos, and Gaius, along with twelve thousand others, were honored.

2841
05:55:17,471 --> 05:55:27,809

2842
05:55:27,809 --> 05:55:32,657
On the same day, our father Hilarion, whose virtuous life was documented by Jerome.

2843
05:55:32,657 --> 05:56:48,876
As he lived a life of constant labor, when he sensed his end was near and all his living senses were fading, he opened his eyes and said:
"Go forth, go forth, soul, why do you fear? Why do you hesitate? For nearly seventy years you have served Christ, and do you fear death?"
With these words, he breathed his last.

During the persecution by Julian the Apostate, he endured cruel torture with the rack and torches.
However, the soldiers who tormented him were terrified by an angelic vision, fell on their faces, and believed in Christ.
The tyrant ordered them to be drowned in the sea.

2844
05:56:49,344 --> 05:58:52,704
Blessed Theodoritus said to them, "Go ahead, brothers. I will follow you to the Lord after defeating the enemy." He was then killed by the sword and achieved martyrdom. He also predicted the death of Julian in Persia through a prophetic spirit.

They were killed by the sword during the time of Diocletian. Also, there's Venantianus the abbot, who is known for realizing that the solemn celebrations of the masses were being completed in heaven. Once, during the Lord's Prayer at mass, he heard someone from the tomb responding to the priest: "But deliver us from evil."
October 24 - In Nicomedia, it's the feast day of Severus and Dorotheus. In Caesarea, Cappadocia, it's the day of Longinus, more about him later.
October 25 - In Rome, we remember the suffering of Chrysanthus and Daria, who maintained perpetual chastity under the guise of marriage. Chrysanthus converted Daria from paganism, and under Emperor Numerian, after enduring many tortures, they were thrown into a deep pit with their wife and children, and they gave up their souls to God.
In Gaul, in the city of Soissons, Crispinus and Crispinianus were tortured under Maximian and Diocletian. They were stretched on racks, beaten with clubs, and had stakes driven into their nails. In the winter, with millstones around their necks, they were submerged in a river, covered with molten lead, boiling oil, pitch, and fat, yet they were delivered from all these by divine intervention. When their torturer Retivapus saw that no torture could harm them, he furiously threw himself into the fire. Maximian, upon hearing of his soldier's demise, ordered them to be killed by the sword.
On the same day, in the city of Perigueux, we honor Saint Frontonus. He was ordained a bishop by the blessed apostle Peter and was sent with Gregory the priest to preach the Gospel.

2845

He converted a great nation in the city to the faith and profession of Christ.

2846
05:58:57,152 --> 05:59:06,220
He also brought his companion Gregory back to life, who had died on the journey, by placing on him the staff of the apostle Peter, and Gregory rested in peace.

2852
05:59:35,249 --> 05:59:44,432
Vedastus was serving as a priest in the town of Toul, but after King Clovis became victorious over the Alamanni, he remembered the vow he made during the battle.

2853
05:59:44,432 --> 05:59:51,047
He took the blessed Vedastus from Toul and hastened to the city of Reims to Saint Remigius for the grace of baptism.
