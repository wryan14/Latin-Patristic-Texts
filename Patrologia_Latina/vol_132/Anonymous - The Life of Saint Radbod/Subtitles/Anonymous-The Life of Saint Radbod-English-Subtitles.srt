1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,968
The life of Saint Radbod as documented by an anonymous contemporary author.

2
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:06,299
PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:13,223
Radbod, also known as Radbodo, was the fourteenth bishop of Utrecht following Egilbold, and he stood out for his remarkable piety.

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:19,934
An anonymous writer, who lived during Radbod's time, documented his life based on accounts from those who knew him personally.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:30,906
This writer's version, found in a manuscript obtained by Surius, would have been more useful to us if it had retained its original style, which barely deviates without errors and loss of rightful authority.

6
00:00:30,906 --> 00:01:58,202
The words of the anonymous writer appear in section five: "We will recount a few things received from those who participated in the events."
The same sentiment is echoed towards the end of section ten.
Lower Utrecht, once known as Wiltaburg, was established as a bishopric by Willebrord, who, along with monks and preachers of the word of God, led the Frisians to Christ.
Various documents from that era show that the monks, first instituted in the cathedral church by Willebrord and later by the martyr Boniface, remained there at least until the Carolingian era.
Whenever the monks transitioned into canons, the more religious bishops of Utrecht tended to assume this role only after adopting monastic garb and professing the rule, as seen in the example of Bishop Radbod.
Educated at the court of King Charles, Radbod went to Guntarius in Cologne; after leaving there, he was soon called to be bishop by the people of Utrecht.
Without delay, as the author of his Life writes in section four, he changed his attire and became a true regular monk; he abstained not only from eating meat but from all indulgence in food.
This seems to be implied by the same writer in section seven, referring to the practice of Willebrord and his predecessor Boniface, and it is consistent with the custom accepted among the bishops of the Church of Canterbury, as noted by the writers of English history in several places.
Before we discuss the achievements of Bishop Radbod, we should consider some details about his studies at the court of King Charles and his companions Stephen and Mancion, as well as Mannon or Nannon, the head of the palace school.

7
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:02,534
Most writers agree that this King Charles of Germany is Emperor Charles the Fat.

8
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:08,506
However, this can be disproved because the author of the included Life attributes a son named Louis to King Charles.

9
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:13,551
Louis was actually the son and heir of Charles the Bald, not Charles the Fat, who had no children.

10
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:27,812
We've already shown how diligently Charles the Bald worked to revive the study of literature, which had greatly declined due to internal wars and the incursions of the Danes, both in the preface of the previous century and in the praises of Paschasius Radbertus and Abbot John.

11
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:42,073
Now, let's listen to our author from numbers one and two:
First, Radbod went to the court of King Charles of the Franks, then to his son Louis's court, not because he sought courtly honors but because the liberal arts were being excellently cultivated within the king’s palace.

12
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:48,560
The school was led by Manno, or Nanno according to others, a philosopher whom the eager-to-learn holy boy diligently followed.

13
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,494
His classmates included Stephen and Mancio, among others.

14
00:02:51,494 --> 00:03:01,327
I won't focus on modern Belgian or German writers who imagine Nanno as an advocate of Charles the Fat, a Frisian by birth, and the supposed author of several works they claim were circulated.

15
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:15,536
The more accurate reading by Surius convinces us that his name was Mannoni, and I believe he is the same Manno who led the monastery of Saint Augendus in the Jura region and, in the year eight hundred seventy, claimed a certain church for his monastery at the Synod of Vienna.

16
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:49,000
The Petavian manuscript, which contains the poems of Florus, published in the first volume of the Analects, bears this title, as do other manuscripts we've seen in the Boherian library: "Book Offered to the Tomb of Saint Augendus in Memory of the Vow of Mannonis."
Therefore, it is very likely that Manno retired from the palace schools to the monastery of Saint Augendus before the year eight hundred seventy, where he dedicated a rich collection of books to God.
We'll discuss Stephen, Radbod’s classmate, later, who became the bishop of Tongeren.
Surius incorrectly stated that Mancio was the bishop of Chalon, whereas he should have said Châlons.

17
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,434
He is Mancio, mentioned several times by Frodoard in Book 4 of Historiae.

18
00:03:53,434 --> 00:04:00,070
His letter to Archbishop Fulk of Reims about a priest intending to marry was recently published in the volume of Analecta.

19
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:06,761
Radbod made significant progress in the palace schools, and as William of Heda notes, he excelled in both poetry and prose.

20
00:04:06,761 --> 00:05:42,004
This is evidenced by the list of his works recorded by Trithemius as follows:
He wrote several notable works, including: "Praises of Saint Martin," Book 1; "Praises of Saint Boniface, Bishop," Book 1; "On Saint Amalberga," Book 1; "Homilies and Sermons," Book 1; "Flowers on Saint Willibrord," as well as a complete office on the translation of Saint Martin, and various songs in honor of the saints.
What Trithemius calls the "Praises of Saints Martin and Boniface," our anonymous source describes as hymns and encomia with these words: "He wove hymns and encomia about them, which would be recited during their festivities." And lest anyone think we speak anything untrue, there exists a complete office of the blessed Martin, composed by him.
The book on the virgin Amalberga mentioned by Trithemius was once included in the Bigotian manuscript under this title: "Small Book of Lord Radbod, Bishop of the Church of Utrecht, on the Life and Merits of the Virgin Amalberga." This small book is nothing more than the homily praised by Trithemius, which, from the same Bigotian manuscript, we published earlier where we discussed the virgin Amalberga.
In Part 1 of the third century, we presented a sermon given on the feast day of Saint Willibrord, which I am unsure if it is the same one Trithemius attributes to our Radbod. Besides those works Trithemius assigns to Radbod, William of Heda described several of his poems, which, for the time, demonstrate the author's elegant style.
The same William also mentioned Radbod's brief Chronicle, from which we learn the year he began his bishopric and other events of his time. Finally, Surius in volume 6 references an Eclogue on Saint Lebuin, which he also attributes to Radbod. These are his writings.

21
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:47,069
In the year just before nine hundred ended, Radbod was appointed to lead the Utrecht see.

22
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:54,009
He swapped his clerical attire for monastic robes and soon diligently cared for his flock, both through his words and example.

23
00:05:54,009 --> 00:06:05,795
He also provided for their temporal needs, securing from King Arnulf and his son King Zwentibold the lands of Deventer and its surrounding estates, to which he relocated after Utrecht was destroyed by the Norsemen.

24
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:15,378
Additionally, in the year nine fourteen, he received a privilege from King Conrad, as noted by Heda, which granted protection and security to his church's estates and rights.

25
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:23,309
Eventually, after frequently traveling to protect his flock amidst pagan threats, he died at Homersum or Othemarshem and was buried at Deventer.

26
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:34,434
His death is noted by everyone on November twenty-ninth, though authors differ on the year, with some citing nine sixteen or nine seventeen, others the following year, and some suggesting nine nineteen.

27
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:37,849
The year nine eighteen seems to us to have been Radbod's last.

28
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:47,046
Our anonymous source highly praises Radbod's sanctity, but I find no one who attributed the title of saint to him before Adam of Bremen in History, chapter twenty-one.

29
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:52,884
Regino, in his Chronicle, calls Radbod a venerable bishop; John of Beke describes him as a truly holy man.

30
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:59,879
The same is written about him by Willem of Heda, Trithemius, Wion, Miraeus, Molanus, Cratepolius, and many more recent writers.

31
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:08,030
It's better to heed our source, while noting in passing that those who imagine our Radbod as the archchancellor of the kingdom are largely mistaken.

32
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:15,906
This role was given to Radbod, the Archbishop of Trier, not the one from Utrecht, as can be easily gathered from various documents of that era.

33
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:17,713
BEGINNING OF THE LIFE.

34
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:21,647
The meaning of the name Radbod; maternal lineage; studies in literature.

35
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,286
He attended the palace school.

36
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:31,263
Blessed Radbod, born into a noble Frankish family, had very Christian parents, and he himself was a great ornament to the world due to his merits.

37
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:34,596
From his very cradle, he was already inclined towards heaven.

38
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:39,896
His name holds a significant mystery, as it can be translated into Latin as messenger of counsel.

39
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:49,074
He was sent by Christ as an ambassador of the best counsel to the Frisians, from whom he inherited his maternal lineage, and to whom he certainly gave excellent advice.

40
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:54,538
Radbod, Duke of the Frisians, whom some call king, was his mother's ancestor; she gave him his name.

41
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,854
As soon as he was seen to be capable of learning, he was introduced to letters.

42
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:05,847
He spent the early years of his life with Gunther, the Archbishop of Cologne, his uncle, diligently applying himself to studies.

43
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:21,856
When adverse events happened to that bishop, the boy of remarkable talent, encouraged by his family and supported by many others—for the grace of God with which he was endowed made him dear to everyone—first went to the court of Charles, King of the Franks, and then to that of Louis, his son.

44
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:28,412
Not because he sought courtly honors, but because within the king's palace the liberal arts were excellently cultivated.

45
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:34,859
Manno, the philosopher, was in charge of that school, and the holy boy, eager for learning, diligently adhered to him.

46
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,952
Radbod's companions.

47
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:41,197
He had fellow students, Stephen and Mancio, who were indeed older in age, but not in enthusiasm.

48
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:50,703
Thus, a certain pious rivalry arose among them, and each tried to excel the other, not out of ambition for honor, but out of humility, with diligence in reading and learning.

49
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:58,298
Their virtue progressed to the point that not long after, each was made a bishop: Stephen of the Church of Tongeren, and Mancio of Châlons.

50
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:08,023
But Radbod, the venerable youth, like a diligent bee gathering the flowers of knowledge, accumulated a great deal of learning until he was considered by all to be highly learned.

51
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:19,909
In the meantime, he used his strength of mind to suppress youthful impulses, controlled bodily desires through moderation, and turned away from worldly things out of love for heavenly pursuits.

52
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,677
He yearned for spiritual joys and firmly decided to let go of all temporary matters.

53
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:31,377
Although he was young in years, he was mature and wise in his actions, rejecting temptations and aiming to please God.

54
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:39,098
Day and night, he dedicated himself to spiritual enrichment, pursuing with affection and desire what he would later achieve in practice.

55
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:40,120
Radbod's homeland.

56
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,198
Follows Abbot Hugh.

57
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:42,958
The king recognized his virtue.

58
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,919
The more he tried to remain unnoticed, the more his fame spread among the people, despite his reluctance.

59
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:57,208
He became dear to the king for his integrity, respected by the kingdom's nobles, and admired by the people, appearing pleasing and lovable to God.

60
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:03,567
After Charles, under whom he spent his youth, passed away, he wished to visit his homeland, known as Lomaganium.

61
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:13,615
Additionally, he joined Hugh, a highly esteemed abbot, and excelled in learning above others, continuously climbing the ladder of virtues, shining brightly like a heavenly lamp.

62
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:14,751
He becomes a bishop.

63
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:16,113
Takes on monastic habit.

64
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:16,965
His abstinence.

65
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,214
Turns water into wine.

66
00:10:18,214 --> 00:10:22,188
Meanwhile, Egilbert, the bishop of the Church of Utrecht, passed away.

67
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:31,839
The appointment of a suitable successor was discussed, and with notable agreement among the clergy and the people, and with God's will, Radbod was deemed the most worthy.

68
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,892
This view was shared by Arnulf, who was governing the kingdom, as well as by the princes.

69
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:45,124
Thus, through the zeal and will of the clergy, king, princes, and people, the holy man, initially unaware and later resistant, was made a bishop.

70
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:49,325
Troubled in spirit by this, he hesitated for a long time about what to do.

71
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:54,832
Finally, while trying to avoid the honor, he was, albeit unwillingly, drawn to the seat of honor.

72
00:10:55,967 --> 00:11:03,231
After receiving the blessing, the soldier of the eternal king prepares for battle with spiritual weapons and courageously equips himself.

73
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:07,261
He transforms his appearance and adds even greater virtues to his character.

74
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:12,722
By following Christ's teachings, he embraces the very narrow path and becomes a perfectly regular monk.

75
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:16,699
He abstains not only from eating meat but also from all indulgence in food.

76
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:26,720
He nourishes his spirit with fasts lasting two or three days and sustains his weakened body, barely clinging to his bones, with only the bare necessities of life, which are of little value.

77
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,227
Despite this, he maintains a cheerful appearance, as if he were dining on fine foods.

78
00:11:31,227 --> 00:11:36,953
He wished, as much as possible, to keep his fasting hidden from everyone, with only a few being aware of it.

79
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:50,262
When a certain layman, familiar with the bishop and often visiting him, wanted to test this by sitting at his table and speaking with him in the usual manner, he finally asked to be allowed to drink from the cup that was customarily placed before him.

80
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:54,451
It was made of onyx and appropriately adorned with gold, but filled with water.

81
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:59,594
Then, what God, who works wonders in his saints, did through his servant could not remain hidden.

82
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:05,267
The bishop would not allow the man to drink from the cup, as he did not want others to know what was in it.

83
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:12,849
However, when the opportunity arose, the man secretly took the cup, and although the bishop noticed it, he could not prevent him from drinking.

84
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,387
He sighed to God and groaned.

85
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:19,053
And behold, with the ancient miracle renewed, the water was changed into excellent wine.

86
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:26,953
Realizing this, the investigator fell at the feet of the most holy bishop, asked for forgiveness, and promised not to attempt anything like it again.

87
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:41,852
Although the most holy bishop wished to conceal it, it was not right to hide the work of God, in accordance with the words of the angel Raphael to Tobias: "It is good to keep the secret of a king hidden, but honorable to reveal and confess the works of God."
His love for the poor.

88
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:48,639
His everyday life, as long as he lived in the body, was so pleasing to God and so desired and pleasant to people.

89
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:57,441
Although his virtues continued to grow, we can't fully explain them, but we'll share a few insights from those close to him, so you can more easily trust our account.

90
00:12:57,441 --> 00:13:01,153
Whatever he had from this world, he carefully distributed to the poor.

91
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:05,660
He excelled in all good works, and in his kindness towards the poor, he had no equal.

92
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:15,417
Every day, except for a few feast days, he personally washed the feet of the poor, provided them with food, clothed the naked, visited the sick, and cared for the disabled and orphans.

93
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:26,764
He dedicated himself tirelessly to acts of humanity and mercy with incredible vigilance and care, both day and night, never tiring of these labors, considering all he gave for the comfort of the needy as pure gain.

94
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:30,582
He had no interest in adornments or worldly pomp, nor did he crave gold.

95
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:33,605
He believed it was wrong to find pleasure in such things.

96
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:41,028
Thus, having turned away from the world and all it could offer, he burned with love for heavenly things while living on earth in body alone.

97
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,255
He honored Saints Willibrord and Boniface.

98
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:49,565
When the Danes devastated the Church of Utrecht, he often stayed in Deventer, yet his spirit always resided in Utrecht.

99
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:58,049
Even though he frequently returned when peace was restored, both he and others regretted that circumstances and time didn't allow him to stay there permanently.

100
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:08,972
He set many holy Fathers as examples to follow, especially those who first laid the Church's foundations on the firm rock of Christ, like Willibrord and Boniface, who were outstanding in merit and holiness.

101
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:19,206
He chose them as guides for the arduous journey they pioneered and adopted them as models to imitate, even engraving them on the doorposts of his heart and always contemplating them with focus.

102
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:34,937
Those who uplift the family of the highest King through their holiness, exemplary lives, and advocacy of their merits—whether by confessing their faith in peace or through the shedding of their blood—both triumph over the enemy and enjoy the fellowship of the heavenly army.

103
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:49,211
Following in their footsteps, he spread the seeds of faith to his entrusted flock, offered himself as a living sacrifice to God every day, longed wholeheartedly for the heavenly homeland, died to the world, lived for Christ, and was entirely devoted to heaven.

104
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:55,908
He was a light of Christ set on a lampstand, shining for all who were in the house of God, yet remained humble before God.

105
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:58,818
He predicts the future through his series of virtues.

106
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,508
He composed hymns and the office of Saint Martin.

107
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,088
The spirit of prophecy was not absent from him.

108
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:08,645
Many of his predictions came to pass quickly, while others happened not long after.

109
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:15,726
He constantly meditated on the law of the Lord in his mind and was not content with that alone; he also carried it out in action.

110
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:35,544
He became a conqueror of the soul, a teacher of love, a cultivator of chastity, a supporter of the poor, a consoler of the grieving, an unwavering hope of solace for the clergy, an indefatigable relief for the people, a tower of strength against the enemy for all his people, so firm in righteousness that neither prosperity nor adversity could lead him astray.

111
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:40,211
Christ was never absent from his lips; whatever he did, Christ was fixed in his mind.

112
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:48,610
He was never tired of studying, reading, or prayer; he was never satisfied with acts of mercy and charitable works, always devoted to fasting and vigils.

113
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,033
His lips always dripped sweetness, sowed peace and remedies of salvation, and his words always resounded with Christ.

114
00:15:55,033 --> 00:16:06,122
As we mentioned, he eagerly followed the examples of the Fathers before him; he absorbed their memory with incredible eagerness through reading, listening, conversing, or composing something about them.

115
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:10,185
He crafted hymns and praises about them to be recited on their feast days.

116
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:15,455
And, to dispel any doubts, the complete office of blessed Martin, composed by him, still exists.

117
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:22,770
He had chosen him as his special patron above all others, with absolute confidence that he would be supported by his patronage.

118
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:30,502
He was never broken by challenging circumstances, nor was he caught in the traps of the roaring enemy, always fortified by God's steadfast protection.

119
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:34,059
He feared neither anyone's hostile weapons nor any harsh misfortunes.

120
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,111
He cursed the Danes who were troubling Frisia, and as a result, they were afflicted with a plague.

121
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:49,575
At one point, he traveled to Frisia to visit the flock entrusted to him, intending to root out any lingering errors with spiritual guidance and to nurture the believers' minds with the doctrine of faith.

122
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,719
However, the Danes confronted him and obstructed his efforts.

123
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:59,369
Yet, undeterred by the threat of death, he offered them encouraging words to renounce their errors and embrace the path of truth.

124
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:04,523
But when they stubbornly persisted in wickedness and even threatened him with death, he cursed them.

125
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:12,256
Then divine vengeance swiftly followed, as they were struck down by a dreadful plague, almost as if hit by lightning, and nearly all of them perished.

126
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:21,431
They were never left unpunished whenever they troubled him at Maastricht, as God's judgment swiftly followed, evidenced by the very few who were fortunate enough to escape alive.

127
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:26,225
He predicted that Baldric would be his successor and even foretold the time of his own death.

128
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:31,998
During that period, Baldric, an excellent young man and the son of Count Ricfrid, often visited the blessed man.

129
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:56,741
So, when Baldric was present, he once called Nitger the priest and Richard the knight to him and said, with a prophetic spirit,
"This young man you see will succeed me in the bishopric, and through him, God will restore this seat, greatly enhance the affairs of the Church, and repair what has been destroyed and ruined."
He made this prediction frequently about that young man.
And the truth of his words was confirmed by the events themselves, with the whole world as a witness.

130
00:17:57,359 --> 00:19:16,476
Once, during a Mass when the Epistle was being read, a blessed man summoned Eliolf and Rotguit, the priests of the monastery of Embrici, and said:
"I will not live much longer. So, make sure to honor this young man, Balderic. In three years and six months, I will leave this life, and without a doubt, he will take my place."
Hearing this, they stood amazed, greatly admiring his prophecy.
Not long after, the same young man brought two clerics from his domain, Benno and Saxon, to the man of God at the time when sacred orders are usually conferred, asking that they receive holy orders from him.
The holy man, always with a cheerful face, smiled and said:
"Do not ask me in vain, my son. What you want me to do is your duty to perform, for they will be ordained not by my hands but by yours, and that will be in two years and six months."
But young Balderic, distressed, shed tears, fearing everything, even things that seemed safe, and not believing what the holy man was saying.
Seeing that the blessed bishop was troubled, he began to gently console him.
"Do not fear, Balderic," he said, "nor let your noble spirit be broken by faint-heartedness. The church's affairs, which now seem poor and needy, will be enriched by you with countless gifts from God, and the situation will change unexpectedly."
"You will restore the bishop's buildings, which have been ruined for many years by the ravages of the Danes, to their former dignity at Traiectum [Utrecht].

131
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:44,399
"
The holy man predicted these and other similar events, which happened just as he said, as everyone can now see, making it seem pointless to prove faith in words for things everyone can verify with their own eyes.
The bishop should be free from secular duties.
When invited by the king to perform some service, he would usually respond courteously:
"It is right to obey higher powers, but who doubts that it is not fitting for bishops to be involved in secular affairs, in whose camps the soldiers of Christ serve?"

132
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:51,861
They should be spiritually equipped with the Church's arms to pray to the Lord for the king's and the people's safety, peace, and stability.

133
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:56,444
They should seek the gain of souls with continuous prayers, not pursue earthly things.

134
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:01,188
Soldiers of the royal army, girded with belts and showered with benefits, should do this.

135
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:09,608
Having examined the law of perfect freedom, he could not be swayed from his opinion by flattery or threats, preferring to please God alone rather than humans.

136
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,207
He prepares himself for death.

137
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:18,509
Knowing his death long in advance, no one can doubt that he prepared himself with a burning lamp for the Lord returning from the wedding.

138
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:29,168
He was vigilant so he could immediately answer the one knocking, and he distributed his Lord's measure of wheat to his family with even more care, knowing he would soon have to give an account to Him.

139
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:33,165
He did not fear death, as for him, to die was gain, and to live was Christ.

140
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:38,281
He encouraged his people in the pursuit of peace, harmony, and love, as he was accustomed to do.

141
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:46,382
He, poor in spirit, rich in merits, detached from earthly things, familiar with heavenly ones, strove to achieve this as much as human weakness allowed.

142
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:52,938
Through fasting, the joys of psalms, vigils, and almsgiving, he diligently fortified his death with great spiritual effort.

143
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:56,615
He is comforted by a vision of the Blessed Virgin and her companions.

144
00:20:56,615 --> 00:21:01,252
This sublime vision, which he shared with some of his people, should not be overlooked.

145
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:14,202
When he was once seriously ill, so much so that he abandoned all hope of life, the most blessed Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary appeared to him, accompanied by the holy virgins Thecla and Agnes, filling the entire dwelling with great light.

146
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:19,265
He was greatly terrified by such a vision and could speak nothing out of fear, almost fainting.

147
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:32,536
Then the Gate of Salvation, the Lady of the world, administered the medicine of consolation to him, dispelling not only all fear but also his illness, saying, "Do not fear, Radbod, for you are surely seeing her to whom you frequently offer prayers."

148
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:38,865
So, I won't hesitate to offer you comfort with my presence, as you always keep me in your prayers to God.

149
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:46,185
Rest assured, there's nothing threatening about this illness; you will recover, even though your time in the flesh won't be long afterward.

150
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:51,873
Have confidence in yourself: don't stop being vigilant and working hard, but keep going as you have started.

151
00:21:51,873 --> 00:22:00,141
With these words, the radiance suddenly vanished, but a very pleasant fragrance lingered for a long time, and all traces of the illness were completely gone.

152
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:12,991
When he quietly shared this with some of his people, not wanting anyone to know while he was alive, he also described the form, appearance, and attire of the most holy mother of God to them, adding that no one could fully appreciate her beauty.

153
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:18,363
However, the holy virgins Thecla and Agnes could be recognized both by their faces and their clothing.

154
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:22,787
On February 14th, he was struck with a fever and devoted himself to constant prayer.

155
00:22:22,787 --> 00:22:24,999
He passed away and was buried in Deventer.

156
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:30,528
Furthermore, after three years and six months, he was again struck with a fever in the village of Trente.

157
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:36,585
He quickly instructed his people to leave with him from there, to avoid being forced to stay as the fever worsened.

158
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:39,639
In winter, it's not easy for anyone to leave that village.

159
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:42,167
He knew that the time of his departure was near.

160
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:51,172
Although everyone was distressed by his illness, they respected his wishes and began the journey to Ootmarsum, where he had chosen a burial place for himself, if possible.

161
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:56,070
There was a small oratory there, where he often stayed because it was in a pleasant location.

162
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:05,760
Thus, with his affairs in order as he wished, not weary from serving God, not broken by illness, but with a cheerful face, fearing nothing of death, he was invited to Christ's banquet.

163
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,657
Although his body was dying, his spirit was being enlivened more and more.

164
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:16,293
His lips did not rest during his final hours, and he sang psalms in such a way that he brought forth tears from those present.

165
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:30,298
Seeming quite joyful, as long as he could still speak and had some breath left, he kept repeating the antiphon from the Psalms, Behold the joyful, which is the first in the responsories composed by the blessed Martin, chief among confessors.

166
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:36,251
There was no doubt that, surrounded by the most blessed angelic spirits, he had no fear of the dark monsters.

167
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:44,443
We also believe that Martin, the outstanding bishop and his special patron, whom he seemed to greet so often with a melodious voice, was not far away.

168
00:23:44,443 --> 00:23:49,631
Finally, as November was drawing to a close, he too passed away, happily departing to the Lord.

169
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:57,332
The holy body was soon placed on a bier, and the clergy and all the people led it reverently and honorably with hymns and psalms to Deventer.

170
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:10,494
As they approached the town, all its inhabitants came out to meet them with heavy hearts, and so, with the mingled voices of mourners and singers, the sacred body was brought into the church on the side that faces north and was buried there.

171
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:18,304
His spirit rejoiced and delighted in the joy of his Lord, whom he had served in this life; to whom be honor, power, and glory forever and ever.

172
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:18,577
Amen.
