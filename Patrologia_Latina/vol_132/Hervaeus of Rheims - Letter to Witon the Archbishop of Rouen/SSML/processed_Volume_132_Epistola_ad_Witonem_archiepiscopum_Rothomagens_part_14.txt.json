      "original_latin": "XI. De sancto Laurentio. Inter alia scriptum habetur in passione B. Laurentii\n archilevitae, et martyris Christi. Erat homo\nin carcerali custodia multo jam tempore gentilis,\nqui plorando amissis oculis caecus factus fuerat,\ndixit ad eum B. Laurentius: Si credis in Filium\nDei Dominum Jesum Christum, baptizare, et illuminabit\nte. Et continuo post ipsius confessionem baptizato,\naperti sunt oculi ejus, et coepit clamare\ndicens: Benedictus Dominus Deus aeternus, qui me\nilluminavit per B. Laurentium, quia semper fui\ncaecus et modo video. Post haec et beatum Hippolytum\nmore solito catechizavit, et, accepta aqua, benedixit\net baptizavit illum. Deinde simili modo\nmilitem baptizavit Romanum, qui et baptizatus,\nmox martyrio coronatus est.",
