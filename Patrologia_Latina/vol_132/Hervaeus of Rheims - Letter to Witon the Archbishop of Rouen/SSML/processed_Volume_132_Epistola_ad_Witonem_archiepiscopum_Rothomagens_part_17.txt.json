      "original_latin": "XIV. Leo papa. De his quibus dubium est utrum baptismum perceperint,\nnecesse est ut renascantur, ex decretis\npapae Leonis (epist. ad Rustic.). Si nulla exstant\ninter propinquos aut seculares indicia, nulla inter\nclericos aut vicinos, quibus hi, de quibus quaeritur,\nbaptizati fuisse doceantur, agendum est ut renascantur,\nne manifeste pereant, in quibus quod non\nostenditur gestum, ratio non sinit, ut videatur iteratum. Qui autem possunt meminisse quod ad ecclesiam\nveniebant cum parentibus suis, possunt recordare,\nan quod ab eorum parentibus dabatur,\nacceperint. Sed si hoc etiam ab eorum memoria alienum\nest, conferendum eis videtur, quod collatum\nesse nescitur: quia non temeritas intervenit praesumptionis,\n ubi est diligentia pietatis.",
