De his Christianis,\nqui inter eos a quibus fuerant captivati, immolatitiis\ncibis asseruntur esse polluti: consultationi charitatis\ntuae hoc etiam respondendum esse credimus, ut poenitentiae\nsatisfactione purgentur, quae non tam temporis\nlongitudine, quam cordis compunctione pensanda\nest. Et, sive hoc terror extorserit, sive fames\nsuaserit, non dubitetur abolendum: cum hujusmodi\ncibus pro metu, aut indigentia, non pro religionis\nveneratione sit sumptus.",
