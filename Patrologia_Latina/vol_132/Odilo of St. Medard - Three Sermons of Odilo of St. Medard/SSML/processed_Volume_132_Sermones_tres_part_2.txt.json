Although he has a house not made by human hands, but eternal in the heavens, he always had a more exalted temporary abode on earth.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Just as he protects his people from the attack of invisible enemies, he often defends them from the assault of visible ones through the help of his intercession. He embraces those in the heavenly tabernacle with him, providing pastoral care to them in this present age.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        He indeed guides the family of God amidst the shipwrecks of the stormy ocean, ensuring that our ship is not seized by the storm of tempests or carried off by a cruel pirate into eternal plunder. This family was entrusted to him long ago for governance, as he says to his disciples, and thus to all the faithful: \n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        <s>\n            Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom the Lord has set over his household, to give them their measure of wheat at the proper time? \n            <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n            <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"m√¶Œ∏.juÀê\">Matthew</phoneme> 24:45.\n        </s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Hence the Apostle says: \n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        <s>\n            Each one according to the measure of faith God has assigned. \n            <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n            <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"Ààro ä.m…ônz\">Romans</phoneme> 12:3.\n        </s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, what Christ calls the measure of wheat, Paul refers to as the measure of faith, so it is understood that spiritual wheat is nothing other than the venerable sacrament of Christian faith.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, brothers, where our treasure is, there also let our heart strive to be, so that we may yearn for the love of our heavenly destiny, to which we trust our blessed patron has already arrived.
