Three Sermons of the Monk Odilo

2
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:05,831
Sermon Oneon Saint Medard

3
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:14,050
It's worthwhile, dear brothers, to remember how the place of Blessed Medard flourished over time with the excellence of worship and the progress of religion.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,395
Also, how fiercely his wrath sometimes erupted against the enemies of his servants.

5
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:27,137
King Chlothar of the Franks, who was devoted to the service and reverence of saints, did his best to fulfill the promise he made to the most holy man before his death.

6
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:36,455
After moving his body, with great diligence, he gathered the necessary funds to complete what was offered either by royal luxury or by the generous contributions of the faithful.

7
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:40,905
He began to construct a noble temple with the remarkable skill of expert stonemasons.

8
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:47,396
Having laid the foundation with such craftsmanship, driven by keen intelligence, he would have completed it in a short time.

9
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:49,961
Unfortunately, the common fate of death took him.

10
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:54,882
He went to Tours to visit Saint Martin for prayer, pleasing him with devout prayers and gifts.

11
00:00:54,882 --> 00:01:01,216
He also visited nearby monasteries with heartfelt devotion, distributing gifts as seemed best, guided by the Holy Spirit.

12
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:08,231
After returning to Gaul, he went hunting in the forest of Cotia, where he was struck by a severe fever and began to lose his strength.

13
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:13,937
Then, brought back to the villa of Compendium, he passed away, having subjugated foreign nations to his rule.

14
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:24,720
His body was brought by his servants in a funeral procession to the city of Soissons and was buried with appropriate reverence before the saint of God in the same basilica he had begun but had not finished.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,672
He truly deserved such a burial, having anchored his mind so firmly in that place that even death could not separate him from what he held with singular affection in life.

16
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:41,943
However, upon his mournful death, all of Gaul was filled with deep sorrow, and that excellent work was left unfinished due to the change in the royal scepter.

17
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:51,430
Just as bad offspring imitate their evil parents and inherit their wrongdoings, good children from virtuous parents grow in all virtues, bringing praise to their family.

18
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,006
Sigebert, the son of Clotaire, succeeded his father on the throne with the unanimous support of the Franks.

19
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:02,008
He was a dedicated supporter of divine religion and a steadfast follower of the Christian faith.

20
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:09,200
With a passionate zeal, he shared his father's love for God and completed the works of piety that had been halted by his father's passing.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,974
The monastery, notable for its remarkable design both inside and out, was properly adorned with the order and faith of the clergy.

22
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:21,706
Externally, he expanded it with grants from his estates, elevated it joyfully, and advanced it with diligence.

23
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:31,711
Then, in a desire to murder his brother, while plotting to besiege Chilperic in the city of Tournai with traps, he brought an end to both the rule and the life of his wife Fredegund's schemes.

24
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:38,955
The sword he intended for his brother turned back on him, and he died from the very place where he had blindly plotted against his own kin.

25
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:49,272
Indeed, two young warriors from Thérouanne, pretending to elevate him as king, suddenly struck him with spears through his sides, and as they fell with him, they forced his unwilling soul to depart.

26
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:59,851
His body, wrapped in precious garments, was brought to Lambres with great mourning from his people and was later buried with great honor next to his father in the basilica he had beautifully constructed.

27
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:08,345
This noble royal building, remarkable for its nobility and renowned for its intricate construction, stood firm until Louis the Great assumed the paternal monarchy.

28
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:16,682
When he took the throne, the inner courtyard of the same hall was demolished to its foundation, leaving not a single stone upon another in the entire structure.

29
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:25,933
Long ago, the illustrious Caesar brought the relics of the blessed martyr Sebastian to this place, which meant divine power was readily available to heal the sick.

30
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:39,348
Because of the growing crowds and the increasing number of people drawn by countless miracles attributed to the martyr, the prince decided to demolish the old building, as it couldn't accommodate the throngs coming from all around for such a spectacle.

31
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:44,672
With the immense offerings, he began constructing a much larger temple, capable of holding everyone.

32
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:49,623
It embodied the grace of virtues and displayed dignity and glory, surpassing all in elegance.

33
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:54,254
This building, however, had been burned by the Marcomanni, losing much of its splendor.

34
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:58,300
It was a disgrace to future generations, leaving only a vast heap of stones.

35
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,239
This remains today, measured in three intervals, showcasing its vast size.

36
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,913
Its dome is prominent, and it is remarkable in both length and width.

37
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:13,898
Over time, as the place became renowned, Warimbertus seized control after the death of the venerable Ansbert, who had been in charge of the monastery.

38
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:23,746
Following the death of Drausius, the bishop of Soissons, Warimbertus secured the bishopric from the king with money and the help of friends, without losing his former position as prior.

39
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:30,454
He was a frequent visitor at court and highly influential among the king’s household, thus effectively achieving his ambition.

40
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:40,622
Leading both flocks, he cunningly kept a sly fox in his corrupt heart, ruling them more strictly with a sense of justice, over whom he had previously presided deceitfully in sheep’s clothing.

41
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:51,178
He was supposed to protect them from worldly obstacles, but instead, he constantly tempted them with worldly desires, leading to endless complaints that he should have addressed with justice.

42
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:58,695
He took what they needed for sustenance and redirected it for his own needs, destroying the goods that a true priest should protect with virtue.

43
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:07,831
Those who were slandered couldn't endure the damage and insults with patience, unsure how to resist someone whose heavy yoke they had accepted in their unfortunate subjection.

44
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:16,966
The royal estate of Matwallis, known as Good Valley, not from Latin or British, but from its fertility and richness, stretches over the land and brings in substantial revenue.

45
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:20,620
As it spreads across the vast land, it supports many who cultivate it.

46
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:28,816
This estate was granted perpetually by King Sigibert of the Franks, a notable and righteous king of the past, to Saint Medard along with many other benefits.

47
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:35,811
Because it borders the Cenomani territory and is far from Soissons, it was difficult for officials to bring expenses to the monastery.

48
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:41,710
Thus, its annual revenues were sold each year, and the proceeds were distributed among the monks in various ways.

49
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,749
Items like salt, honey, and other easily transportable utilities were purchased there, and many barrels were loaded onto carts and taken to the monastery.

50
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:55,961
Warimbertus, noticing this, took advantage, arrogantly leading the loaded carts to his property, delighting his people.

51
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:03,269
Those deprived of what was granted by divine favor were shamed and often sighed deeply from the bottom of their hearts due to harsh insults.

52
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:13,377
Once, while the executioner was preoccupied with external matters, his brothers took advantage of his absence and boldly redirected the incoming supplies into their own storerooms.

53
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:20,939
When he found out, he was very displeased and immediately became angry, threatening to punish such audacious behavior with a fitting sentence.

54
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:28,289
Concerned, the brothers turned unanimously to prayer, engaging in a three-day fast, constantly seeking divine help with prayers and tears.

55
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:41,283
During this time, no voices were heard in the choir; only at the appointed hours did the lips of those singing move, as everything was conducted in silence and mourning, in line with the devotion excellently established by the Christian Church.

56
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:49,271
This situation, however, became a seed of envy, hatred, and discord in the eyes of the tyrant, who found more grief where he should have found relief.

57
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,123
Why dwell on it?

58
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:55,981
Eventually, he returned to his position, seemingly to exact revenge on those who violated his twisted customs.

59
00:06:55,981 --> 00:07:00,880
Rising at dawn with a strong hand, he approached the place with an agitated spirit and mind.

60
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,366
When his men knocked on the royal door, no one responded from inside, as the doors were tightly closed.

61
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:10,360
Everyone, led by the bold bishop, feared the threatened common destruction.

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,005
Coming closer, he knocked repeatedly, forcefully striking the gates and shaking the bronze doors in anger.

63
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:20,052
One of the caretakers, less cautiously, approached him with the temple keys.

64
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,620
With the doors unlocked, the furious man entered, filled with rage.

65
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:35,762
He immediately raised his right hand high and struck the head of the person opening the door so hard with a staff that the man was completely stained with blood, his face bruised and mouth disfigured, which was a great disgrace.

66
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:40,715
In his sorrow, he sincerely cursed him, which divine mercy soon revealed with clear judgment.

67
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:45,881
He did not escape unpunished for the excessively cruel treatment inflicted on the servant of God.

68
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:56,265
As he arrogantly went to pray, he had barely bent his knee before the Holy of Holies when suddenly, by divine intervention, his innards burst through his bowels and spilled onto the floor.

69
00:07:56,265 --> 00:08:05,136
Just as he was devoid of piety, he undoubtedly remained empty of stomach, and his end showed that the life of the priest was far inferior to the worthiness of the priesthood.

70
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:11,305
His body was thrown outside the temple's threshold, and the rest of his filth was also removed by the faithful's service.

71
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:15,792
He had a burial place in the cemetery he deserved, where his depleted body was interred.

72
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:27,059
Therefore, shepherds of souls should fear that a worse punishment may envelop them someday, and they should learn to lead their subjects with discernment, lest the subjects lack the effect of salvation without discretion.

73
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:37,919
Since it is exceedingly useful for a person in life to avoid excess, it is clear that they should manage discipline with this caution, so that fear restrains wickedness, and love promotes justice through exercise.

74
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:48,014
In this way, the success of the subjects will advance, and the progress of the leaders will truly be enhanced, and everything will be in everyone, so that Almighty God may be equally honored by all.

75
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:57,650
Church leaders should also remember not to become accustomed to allowing the sins of the people and not to seize their substance, for which they should, if necessary, offer their very soul.

76
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:06,216
Earthly resources must also be distributed for the sheep of Christ, lest their own be taken away, by which bodies are nourished in the service of divine apprenticeship.

77
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:19,625
Therefore, he who does not give earthly substance for what has been entrusted will never give his soul for the same, as one progresses from the smallest first to the greatest last, and no one grasps the greatest last unless they first practice the smallest first.

78
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:28,955
The priests of God must always be informed by word and deed, so that even if there is one who brings forth good things, there is, consequently, no lack of those who strive to imitate.

79
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:35,991
But he who plunders what belongs to others certainly loses the duty of a shepherd and, thus condemned, strays from the true path of truth.

80
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:42,872
So, let those who are subject not be crushed by their subjection, nor let those in higher positions become overly elevated.

81
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:48,988
The former should humbly obey like children, while the latter, acting as fathers, should give commands with moderation.

82
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:57,056
If any leader handles matters differently, they are undoubtedly like Guarimbertus, who considered the emotions of subordinates without the affection of love.

83
00:09:57,056 --> 00:10:05,381
A brief speech by the writer has highlighted the main deeds of blessed Medard, striving to gather a unified collection with moderate brevity from various sources.

84
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:13,707
His illustrious life was once confined to a narrow scope, with the signs of his virtues and the translation of his body almost obscured, written on humble sheets.

85
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:24,036
Since Fortunatus’s authority was concise and negligently regarded, displeasing to readers, its power helped the writer's works to come together and cohere harmoniously through the command of obedience.

86
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:36,421
It seemed right to fulfill the duty of service at least through language, so that the praises of the blessed man, compactly joined and arranged with dignity, might be clarified and explained in a slightly more extended and clearer statement.

87
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:42,485
He did not wish to detract from the man who long ago published the life of the same Father in meter and strict speech.

88
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:47,264
But what was briefly mentioned, this writer deemed it worthwhile to expand upon with the pen.

89
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:58,673
What the accomplished orator skipped in the narration, this new narrator endeavored to pass on to posterity for their knowledge, not distorted by his own comments, but truly inserted in the ancient records of the old ones.

90
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:06,444
It seems reasonable, then, brothers, to agree that we should strive to honor the merits of such a great patron with worthy praises.

91
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:13,753
Although he has a house not made by human hands, but eternal in the heavens, he always had a more exalted temporary abode on earth.

92
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:22,735
Just as he protects his people from the attack of invisible enemies, he often defends them from the assault of visible ones through the help of his intercession.

93
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:28,705
He embraces those in the heavenly tabernacle with him, providing pastoral care to them in this present age.

94
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:39,528
He indeed guides the family of God amidst the shipwrecks of the stormy ocean, ensuring that our ship is not seized by the storm of tempests or carried off by a cruel pirate into eternal plunder.

95
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:53,922
This family was entrusted to him long ago for governance, as he says to his disciples, and thus to all the faithful:
Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom the Lord has set over his household, to give them their measure of wheat at the proper time?

96
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:54,703
Matthew 24:45.

97
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:59,390
Hence the Apostle says:
Each one according to the measure of faith God has assigned.

98
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,059
Romans 12:3.

99
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:11,050
Therefore, what Christ calls the measure of wheat, Paul refers to as the measure of faith, so it is understood that spiritual wheat is nothing other than the venerable sacrament of Christian faith.

100
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:22,152
Therefore, brothers, where our treasure is, there also let our heart strive to be, so that we may yearn for the love of our heavenly destiny, to which we trust our blessed patron has already arrived.

101
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:31,748
Thus, being joined with the eternal citizens, may he implore divine mercy for our sins, making Him favorable to us, whose eternal glory he enjoys through continuous vision.

102
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:40,563
To accomplish these things, may the Only Begotten Son of God extend the hand of his mercy, whose kingdom and dominion stand firm and endure, forever and ever.

103
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:40,842
Amen.

104
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:46,823
Sermon Two On Saints Medard and Gildard

105
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:51,903
The glory of the holy confessors, dear brothers, deserves to be celebrated with worthy praises.

106
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:57,409
Those who have always confessed Christ and given true testimony should be elevated to a title of honor.

107
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:02,542
Even when they spoke little about Him, they declared the greatest truths with unwavering spirit.

108
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:06,819
In one sense, they earned the title of angels, and in another, truly archangels.

109
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,417
As the Apostle says: The temple of God, which is holy, is you, First Corinthians 3:17.

110
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:15,373
They became a temple of God, undoubtedly the altar and rule of priesthood.

111
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:25,531
On that table of the eternal King, offering sacrifices of appeasement and atonement through vows of holy confession, they often presented a pleasing sacrifice of human reconciliation to God.

112
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:35,636
Because of this, they received the power and authority to bind and loose through the gift of virtue, so that what they decided by their judgment was rare in heaven through divine authority.

113
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:44,244
For such merits, they are rightly elevated to the title of praise, granted by the King of Justice Himself the privilege of intimate love for confessing His name.

114
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:53,653
They truly love the Lord, whose minds are not overcome by wicked pleasures through consent, and they grow in love for Him, not yielding to the hidden temptations that threaten.

115
00:13:53,653 --> 00:14:04,720
Indeed, they are passionately inflamed and are deservedly counted among the cherubim and seraphim in heaven, where they receive the reward of their calling, anchoring their minds in continuous contemplation.

116
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:13,060
The peak of this perfection, which the blessed confessors sought to reach, was to desire nothing in this world but to long earnestly only for their Creator.

117
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:24,822
Renouncing earthly desires, they completely crucified themselves to carnal lusts, so they might offer their bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God through reasonable service, as noted in Philippians 4:18.

118
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:34,392
And because they did not wish to conform to this age but steadfastly sought to be renewed in the spirit of their minds, walking according to the inner man, as described in Romans.

119
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:39,218
Inspired by the successes of the saints, they went from strength to strength.

120
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:47,372
They constantly longed for Him to whom they were devoted, as if they had taken wings like doves, allowing them to soar to heavenly places and find rest.

121
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:55,741
They truly loved the Lord and followed His commands and precepts, ensuring that nothing could separate them from His love, even when faced with temptations.

122
00:14:55,741 --> 00:16:10,471
As Truth says: "Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning," Luke 12:35. How many burdens they took upon themselves, overcoming the excesses of their bodies! Without using iron, they endured a prolonged martyrdom in their bodies, achieving through suffering what the shedding of blood could not provide.
Initially, food was scarce and drink even rarer, with moderation imposed on both. As if, in the end, they made sure that Venus remained untouched. Their faces grew pale from excessive fasting, and their unkempt appearance resembled the condition of Ethiopian skin. Their spirit remained steadfast in vigils, ensuring their minds, dedicated to God, were always present in prayer. They kept their waists girded, restraining physical indulgence through self-discipline, and held burning lamps in their hands, offering examples of light through good works.
Since neither great chastity without good works nor good works without chastity is sufficient, they practiced both with discretion, ensuring the desire for praise did not detract from their true intentions. Thus, with their waists girded and lamps burning, they maintained the purity of chastity in their bodies, and the light of truth shone brightly in their actions.
Among these revered individuals, the blessed Medard and Gildard stand out, emulating both the cunning of serpentine prudence and the innocent simplicity of doves.

123
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:14,587
One of them condemned vices, while the other upheld the pure laws of virtues.

124
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:17,823
They carefully avoided the corruption of wickedness and malice.

125
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:25,630
Through this, they admonished those who strayed, but tempered their reproach with the wisdom of a father's prayer that was ever-present in their hearts.

126
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,918
While their judgment was strict, their hearts showed gentleness.

127
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:33,746
What one erased with precision, the other healed with the grace of compassion by softening it.

128
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:39,396
Thus, from fair judgment, they became the thrones of their creator, through whom the holy Church was governed.

129
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:42,478
Even the chosen ones were often judged for their weaknesses.

130
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:46,690
Thus, what the strength of one sharpened, the other's moderation warmly supported.

131
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:53,265
The simplicity of the dove enhanced the cunning of the serpent, and the serpent's cunning was balanced by the dove's simplicity.

132
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:57,220
Guided by goodwill, they supported anyone in distress during difficult times.

133
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,381
To those struck by calamity, they offered consolation with well-known compassion.

134
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:04,874
What they considered for themselves, they surely shared with others.

135
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:09,959
They did not judge anyone prematurely, becoming all things to all people for the sake of salvation.

136
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,195
They mourned others' losses as if they were their own troubles.

137
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:16,791
Through God's favor, they cultivated many virtues from others' losses.

138
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:23,879
They refused to impose on others what they did not wish for themselves, nor did they deny others what they provided for their own benefit.

139
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:28,297
In God, they loved both friends and enemies, thriving in the love of God and neighbor.

140
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:32,406
This is where the fullness of the prophets and the entire sum of the law reside.

141
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:35,642
Through this offering, nothing is more richly presented to God.

142
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:39,649
With this sacrifice, the soul dedicates itself well on the altar of the heart.

143
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:44,991
So, from the devotion of goodwill, they always sought to please the highest one who searches the hearts.

144
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:50,641
Though they thought humbly of themselves, they sometimes performed strong and exalted deeds beyond themselves.

145
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,146
However, the prophetic message speaks of such people:
“Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves to their windows?

146
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:58,989
”
(Isaiah 60:8).

147
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:07,523
Blessed indeed are these confessors, always pure in speech and action, who proclaimed the sacred word with eloquence, shone through trials, and displayed virtues.

148
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:16,583
Because their elevated and holy lives and preaching set them apart from earthly corruption, they were like clouds flying, matching the divine qualities of heavenly virtues.

149
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:27,329
When malevolent spirits fled from possessed bodies, expelled through the power of prayer and authority given to them, they truly deserved to be aligned with heavenly powers and frequently expelled demons.

150
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:34,704
Those who improved through good deeds and led among chosen brothers were fit for eternal leadership and a place among the ranks of dominion.

151
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:37,864
They were neither found in bitterness nor bound by iniquity.

152
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:42,869
While they lived joyfully, they were dead to Christ through renouncing the flesh and the world.

153
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:53,509
As they transcended earthly thoughts, their hearts always looked ahead, and what was under their control externally served them, so that the transient things they saw never conflicted with their hearts.

154
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:01,411
Therefore, they were like clouds flying, and like doves to their windows, considering fleeting things with a pure eye, moved by no desire for robbery.

155
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:08,996
Moreover, they shone with equal holiness from a shared origin; just as they were formed equally, the best path of life unified them in goodness.

156
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:18,531
Nevertheless, within the womb of the world, they are noted to have been distributed by fate into unequal lives, though allegory might be suggested, each differed in merit and grace.

157
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:27,644
For one was simple, dwelling in tents, while the other engaged in worldly military service, and thus one was chosen, while the other became completely apostate and rejected.

158
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:35,676
The blessed Medard and Gildard were brought into the world through a single birth, and their holiness and magnificence were celebrated equally.

159
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,116
Born at the same moment, they shared a common confession of faith.

160
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:42,972
Virtue made them companions, just as nature made them twins in an instant.

161
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,256
With such qualities, they mirrored their parents in good deeds.

162
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:51,676
The world viewed them as equals, and the Church, their spiritual mother, nurtured them in acts of piety.

163
00:19:51,676 --> 00:20:01,421
What stands out about them, and remains memorable through the ages, is that they achieved the glory of their consecration together and shared one episcopal throne in leading the faithful.

164
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:10,229
Just as they were born together physically, they received their spiritual consecration together, equally blessed and excelling in all forms of justice without disparity.

165
00:20:10,229 --> 00:20:17,473
Both were sanctified under the same conditions, equally consecrated, and anointed with divine oil, ready to welcome souls for holy baptism.

166
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:20,287
They both became true leaders of God at the same time.

167
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:27,844
Both were made distinguished bishops on the same day, shining as true lights of the world, brighter than the sun and more splendid than the moon.

168
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:32,170
One was appointed as the bishop of Noyon, and the other as the archbishop of Rouen.

169
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,903
Thus, one served as suffragan, while the other, testifying to a higher office, obtained the metropolitan seat.

170
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:44,261
Through their guidance, the heavenly kingdom is revealed, and by their word, the celestial gate is opened to the faithful.

171
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:51,297
Through them, the kingdom of heaven endures a kind of holy struggle, and the determined seize it daily through the remedies of penance.

172
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:52,026
Matthew 11:12.

173
00:20:52,026 --> 00:21:03,023
Having been promoted together to the office of the bishopric, they also jointly took on the role of sacred governance, so that those united by one faith might also be connected by one day in the same leadership.

174
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:07,974
Furthermore, to enhance their glory, something your love might want to hear carefully occurred.

175
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:13,590
Blessed confessors have left this world and are now crowned with glory and honor in heaven.

176
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:22,418
Having completed their journey, they have been freed from the world's corruption and the confines of the flesh, and they now enjoy the eternal reward for their efforts.

177
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:23,890
What a touching sight it is!

178
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,727
How wonderful is the judgment of piety in their lives!

179
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:32,823
They were born together, embraced faith together, were baptized together, and undertook the divine service together.

180
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:40,916
They were blessed with apostolic grace and adorned with episcopal mitres, sent to lead their homeland, and became a model and example for their followers.

181
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,120
Together, they fulfilled their pastoral duties and worked for the Lord's reward.

182
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,113
They were faithful with what was entrusted to them, and they doubled the talents they received.

183
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:53,633
They faced death together and entered the eternal kingdom together.

184
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:57,102
They were celebrated victors and were welcomed into eternal glory.

185
00:21:57,102 --> 00:22:04,459
Together, they moved from earthly concerns to celestial ones, leaving behind all that is corruptible, and embraced the joys of eternal life.

186
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:11,553
Their combined merits established a day of great celebration, always honored by angelic beings and remembered by Christians everywhere.

187
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:18,175
We should continually recall and reflect on their elevated spirit, which, in finding perfect goodness, embraced it completely.

188
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:25,532
For what is more perfect than that which lacks nothing, neither diminishing nor growing, neither born with a beginning nor confined by time?

189
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:30,104
God always exists, embodying his essence as a supreme, ineffable, and boundless spirit.

190
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:38,137
To have this fully and perfectly means to live perfectly and eternally, as it is the life of all: the living bread and eternal food of angels.

191
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:48,312
When the blessed confessors achieved this with a celebrated triumph of perfection, they brought great joy to the heavenly inhabitants and offered solemn happiness to all who celebrated their feasts.

192
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:55,352
We must also remember to keep it always in our minds that divine mercy raises the poor from the earth and lifts the needy from the ashes.

193
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:58,024
Psalm One hundred and twelve, verses seven to eight.

194
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:01,364
They became poor in spirit to be enriched with endless treasures.

195
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:05,373
This poverty was not due to a lack of wealth but was praised for its humility.

196
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:10,871
Thus, the pearls that lay in the dirt have now been taken and placed in the adornment of the heavenly king.

197
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:15,959
They now shine among the heavenly citizens and sparkle among the fiery stones of the eternal crown.

198
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:20,378
On earth, they were once perishable, but in heaven, they are co-heirs with the angels.

199
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:25,311
Having taken the trophy from the flesh, they enjoy the intimate vision of their Creator forever.

200
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:34,818
By shedding their bodies, they have gained the immortal reward of the heavenly kingdom; having laid down their earthly burden, they are clothed in the white robe of eternal immortality.

201
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:38,261
As their flesh dissolves into dust, their soul finds heavenly rest.

202
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:42,938
In those eternal pastures, they are sustained by the glory of eternity with all the saints.

203
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:47,974
Thus, those once submerged in the depths are rescued from the pit of misery and the mire of filth.

204
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:52,907
The Lord raises the poor from the earth, and divine mercy saves the blessed needy from the dirt.

205
00:23:52,907 --> 00:24:02,106
Regarding what we proposed, if we awaken our hopes and minds, let us see where they have set their steps, so that we may deserve to imitate their footsteps with the steps of love.

206
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,750
Should I speak or remain silent?

207
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:15,878
Supported by the strength of wisdom and fortified by the defense of justice, with prudent caution, they pursued everything that should be followed, and with a just examination, they overcame the cunning arguments of the deceitful enemy.

208
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:23,714
In their well-ordered lives, they embraced moderation with all their strength, staying strong in both tough times and good times.

209
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,603
They bravely faced every challenge.

210
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:30,298
By following the path of humility, they journeyed through life with a steadfast spirit.

211
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:35,749
They set great examples of patience, standing firm with unwavering perseverance on the path of truth.

212
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:44,870
Strengthened by gentleness, they carried the light yoke of Christ gently and maintained the modesty in their actions that they held in their hearts as a familiar friend.

213
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:53,452
So, dear brothers, we must arm ourselves with such weapons of faith, through which these blessed confessors, friends of God, and most renowned, became victors.

214
00:24:53,452 --> 00:25:03,760
With a humble vow, let us honor these men, worthy of all praise and honor, so that through their venerable intercession, we may experience the joys of paradise in those heavenly celebrations.

215
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,802
Let us then observe where their hearts were set, so that we may be worthy to follow in their footsteps, with the grace of the most merciful Redeemer.

216
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,072
Amen.

217
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:16,487
Sermon Three
On Saint Medard

218
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:22,083
We can't overlook the life of the most blessed Saint Medard, whose virtuous deeds are renowned worldwide.

219
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:29,489
While we can't cover all his actions in detail, the main reason people gather every year to celebrate his day is to commemorate his burial.

220
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:35,724
This day also inspires devotion in everyone's hearts, driven by faith, as we highlight the greatness of God's saints.

221
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:40,520
Even if few can truly imitate his works, may his intercession help everyone become better.

222
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,582
So, let's begin with his origins, to ensure that no one is discouraged by obstacles of despair.

223
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:49,738
Loving the Lord with a pure heart isn't hindered by differences among nations.

224
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:56,612
Instead, the unity of faith shows that divine grace, available to all who seek it, should not be mistakenly considered exclusive.

225
00:25:56,612 --> 00:26:01,994
Medard’s father, named Nectardus, came from a strong Frankish lineage and was not lacking in freedom.

226
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,925
His mother, named Protagia, was Roman and was freeborn.

227
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:11,479
Her fruitful birth, dedicated to Christ’s service, was more beneficial than if she had remained a virgin and never married.

228
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,517
Their residence and origin were in the region of Vermand.

229
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:21,124
When he was young and attending school in the city, he sent a cloak his mother had made for him to be mended by a craftsman.

230
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:24,375
On his way, he gave that cloak to a blind man he encountered.

231
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:32,368
Similarly, while tending his parents' flock, he would give his food to any poor person he saw, enduring hunger himself and fasting throughout the day.

232
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:36,417
There's also a notable mystery about his life that shouldn't go unmentioned.

233
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:44,304
While still a small and innocent child in school, he told a boy named Eleutherus, a childhood friend, that he would accompany him in public service.

234
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:49,739
He predicted that when he reached thirty years of age, Eleutherus would become the high priest of God.

235
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:54,211
In the city of Tournai, he was appointed as the pastor of the Church.

236
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:58,775
Just as Saint Medardus had foretold, he exhibited a divine spirit, much like a prophet.

237
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:04,913
As he frequently visited the temples, spreading the teachings of faith, he balanced his youthful years with patience.

238
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:13,569
By his own will, he avoided and despised the temptations of the world, embracing the duty of a priest both in heart and appearance, excelling in the love of virtues.

239
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:19,182
He quickly became well-known to the bishop of the city, standing out for his conduct and sincerity of mind.

240
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,487
He never let joy lift him too high, nor did sorrow disturb him.

241
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:28,625
He was always tolerant in adversity and gentle in prosperity, putting everyone above himself with diligent obedience.

242
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:35,234
He generously helped the needy with compassion, and by overcoming all vices, he ascended the path of a holy life step by step.

243
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:38,382
He shunned everything harmful and chose everything precious.

244
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:39,536
What more can be said?

245
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:43,261
He seemed to be a guest in the world and already a possessor in heaven.

246
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:47,562
As the honors of priesthood grew over time, he followed the customs of the Church.

247
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:50,185
He was chosen and proven for the office of priest.

248
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:56,061
Thus, he began to demonstrate his holy virtues so openly that he was considered, by merit, a disciple of Christ.

249
00:27:56,061 --> 00:28:04,559
It happened during the autumn harvest, when the grape juice ripened and the abundance of the vintage was evident, that the boldness of a thief revealed his grace.

250
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:13,110
On a certain night, when the soothing silence usually falls upon human bodies, a thief, driven by the desire to seize the fruit, went to his vineyard and broke in.

251
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,356
Then, as he seized the loot with a cutting sword, he found himself caught within the open enclosure.

252
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:23,655
The more violently he tried to escape, the less he could evade, ultimately captured by his own crime.

253
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:27,694
He did not deserve to taste, nor did he find a way back in his drunken state.

254
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:32,363
He could neither lose what he presumed, nor was it right for him to take what he coveted.

255
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,744
When the vineyard owner, aware of the situation, arrived at dawn, he found the thief already caught with his stolen goods.

256
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:42,361
Each held the other captive, their roles reversed.

257
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:51,101
As a result, the divine justice punished the crime so thoroughly that, while picking the grapes with his own hands, the owner offered even more as a generous offering.

258
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:54,922
This act reprimanded the wrongdoing and gave the thief a chance to leave.

259
00:28:54,922 --> 00:29:00,574
The one who had stolen honey in the night deserved similar punishment or restraint for his continued deceit.

260
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:06,592
The bold thief managed to deceive the watchman with a crafty raid but couldn't escape with the flock he had stolen.

261
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:19,467
The beehives, indignant, left the camp and pursued the thief everywhere, not with a gentle blessing but with the sting of their fury, until the thief's shame led him to return what he had stolen to the saint and seek forgiveness, lying prostrate.

262
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:25,799
It was just that the priest in his piety did not condemn the guilty man, as the stolen goods themselves were his torment.

263
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:32,446
A similar mysterious event occurred when a traveler, passing by the house, sought to steal a young bull through cunning deceit.

264
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:38,046
He removed the bell from its neck, silencing it through a deceitful strategy, and left unnoticed by anyone.

265
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:48,094
However, when he thought he had escaped the danger or profited from the theft, the stolen goods, locked away without obstruction, began to ring, yearning to return under the Lord's protection.

266
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:55,002
Even though they were hidden carefully or secured with iron locks, the ringing exposed the crime, loudly doubling the thief's guilt.

267
00:29:55,002 --> 00:30:02,225
The thief, recalling past dangers with a troubled mind, fearfully returned what he had taken to the owner, not out of piety but necessity.

268
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:08,871
Once the natural order was restored, the lifeless object ceased to reveal itself with sound, only being discovered when struck.

269
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:16,233
Thus, the holy Medardus, a champion of Christ, is shamed for someone else's offense, even though he is not guilty.

270
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:23,149
So, he offers a reward to the guilty for their fault, ensuring he doesn't return disheartened by unfulfilled ambition.
