Short Chronicle of Radbod

In the year nine hundred after the incarnation of the Lord, a miraculous sign appeared in the sky.
Stars were seen everywhere, flowing down from above towards the horizon around the pole's axis, almost all converging with one another.
This omen was followed by severe disasters: extreme weather conditions, frequent windstorms, and rivers overflowing their banksâ€”like a terrible flood.
Even more disastrously, there were fierce storms of people rising against God.
In this same year, before the Epacts were changed, Fulk, the metropolitan bishop of Reims, and King Zwentibold were killed.
Not many days before, I, the sinner Radbod, was deemed worthy to be enrolled among the servants of the Church of Saint Traiectum.
Oh, if only I may be worthy to gain eternal life with them!
