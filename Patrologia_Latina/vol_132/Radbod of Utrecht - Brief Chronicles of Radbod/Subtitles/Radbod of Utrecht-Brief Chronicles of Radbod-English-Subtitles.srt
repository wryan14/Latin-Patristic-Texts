Short Chronicle of Radbod

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,458
In the year nine hundred after the incarnation of the Lord, a miraculous sign appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:18,583
Stars were seen everywhere, flowing down from above towards the horizon around the pole's axis, almost all converging with one another.

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:27,610
This omen was followed by severe disasters: extreme weather conditions, frequent windstorms, and rivers overflowing their banksâ€”like a terrible flood.

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,305
Even more disastrously, there were fierce storms of people rising against God.

6
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:39,708
In this same year, before the Epacts were changed, Fulk, the metropolitan bishop of Reims, and King Zwentibold were killed.

7
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:47,471
Not many days before, I, the sinner Radbod, was deemed worthy to be enrolled among the servants of the Church of Saint Traiectum.

8
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:51,022
Oh, if only I may be worthy to gain eternal life with them!
