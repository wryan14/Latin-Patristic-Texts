Known for his modesty and gentle heart, he was chosen to be ordained as their bishop. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Switbert was sent to Britain where, upon their request, the very reverend Bishop Wilfrid, then exiled in the region of the Mercians, ordained him. At that time, there was no bishop in Kent because Theodore had passed away, and his successor, Berhtwald, had not yet returned from overseas where he went to be ordained. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        After receiving his bishopric, Switbert returned from Britain and soon withdrew to the people of the Boructuarii, guiding many of them to the truth through his preaching. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, not long after, the Boructuarii were conquered by the ancient Saxons, scattering those who had embraced the word. The bishop, along with some others, sought refuge with Pippin, who, at the request of his wife Blithrude, provided him a place on an island in the Rhine, known in their language as \"in littore.\" \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        There, Switbert established a monastery, which his successors still hold, and led a deeply devout life until his passing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        We believe no one would doubt that Bede mentioned these things about this holy man, unless perhaps someone, being preoccupied, either did not read the book where these details are recorded or overlooked them while reading. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        We should not doubt at all that Switbert was fully engaged in the Christian faith, deserving his role as a shepherd of Christ's flock among the esteemed figures of the Church of God, which shone brightly in those days among the English and the Gauls. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        If he had not been well-trained in pastoral duties, so many of Christâ€™s flock would not have been entrusted to his care.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Non enim\neo tempore habebat episcopum Cantia, defuncto\nquidem Theodoro, sed necdum Berthwaldo successore\n ejus, qui trans mare ordinandus ierat, ad\nsedem episcopatus sui reverso.
