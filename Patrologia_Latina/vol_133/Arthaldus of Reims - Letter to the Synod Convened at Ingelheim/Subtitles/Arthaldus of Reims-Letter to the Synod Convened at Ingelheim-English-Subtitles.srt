Historical notice on Arthaldus. From
Gallia Christiana.

2
00:00:03,287 --> 00:00:12,852
Without delay, Flodoardus tells us, after the death of Seulfus, Count Heribert went to Reims and called upon Bishop Abbo of Soissons and Bishop Bovo of Chalons.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:21,162
Together with them, he discussed electing a leader for the Church of Reims, ensuring both the clergy and the laity aligned with his wishes.

4
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:29,651
Following his advice, to prevent the bishopric from being divided among outsiders, they elected his son, Hugo, who was not yet five years old.

5
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:34,672
After accomplishing this, they quickly went to the king to obtain his authorization.

6
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:43,699
King Rudolph, upon hearing about this election, entrusted the governance and arrangement of the Reims bishopric to Heribert, to be administered fairly.

7
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:52,965
Heribert also arranged for church envoys, along with Bishop Abbo, to be sent to Rome, carrying the decree of this election and seeking the pope's approval.

8
00:00:52,965 --> 00:01:05,698
Pope John, with the intervention of Bishop Abbo, agreed to their request and delegated the Reims bishopric to Bishop Abbo, deciding that the duties of the episcopal ministry should be managed and completed by him.

9
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:19,806
Thus, Count Heribert, having gained control of the Reims bishopric, unjustly deprived both me and others, both clergy and laity, of the benefits of church possessions, which we seemed to have been granted as a favor by previous bishops.

10
00:01:19,806 --> 00:01:23,094
He distributed these as he wished, to those he favored.

11
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:34,154
Meanwhile, in the year nine hundred and twenty-seven, by Count Heribert's order, a synod of six bishops from the Reims diocese was convened at Trosly, despite King Rudolph's objections.

12
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:45,639
Around the same time, Odolric, the bishop of Aachen, who had left his position due to persecution by the Saracens, was welcomed into the Church of Reims by Count Heribert.

13
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:53,088
He was allowed to perform only the duties of a bishop, substituting for Hugh, the count's son, who was still a child.

14
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:58,436
The abbey of Saint Timothy was granted to the bishop with just one cleric's stipend.

15
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:07,095
In the year 931, or perhaps 932, as noted in the Chronicle of Reims, a conflict arose between Counts Hugh and Heribert and King Rudolph.

16
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:19,065
After three weeks, Rudolph captured the city of Reims with the help of 18 bishops from France and Burgundy and appointed a monk named Artald from the monastery of Saint Remigius as bishop.

17
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:25,368
However, in 940, Heribert regained control of Reims and forced Artald to resign from the bishopric.

18
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:39,820
The following year, Heribert convened a synod at Soissons, where his son Hugh was consecrated as archbishop in the basilica of Saint Remigius with the agreement of the clergy and people, by the bishops of the province of Reims.

19
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:50,135
Hugh had already been initiated into other orders: the minor ones by Abbo of Soissons, the diaconate by Guido of Auxerre, and the priesthood by Guido of Soissons.

20
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:56,947
In 943, envoys of the Church of Reims returned from Rome, bringing the pallium sent to him by Pope Stephen.

21
00:02:56,947 --> 00:03:00,831
In 943, he held the office of the chief chancellor of France.

22
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:05,033
By 945, he relinquished the rights and title of Abbot of Remigius.

23
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:12,864
In 946, Reims was besieged by three kings: Louis the Fourth of France, Otto of Germany, and Conrad of Transjurane Burgundy.

24
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:21,969
Hugh, realizing he couldn't match such a large army, consulted with his relatives Arnulf of Flanders and Guido about what to do in this crisis.

25
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:27,317
It had been agreed that his eyes would be gouged out if the city was taken by force.

26
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:32,792
To protect himself, he left the city with his followers on the third day of the siege.

27
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:42,724
The kings then entered the city and, alongside the bishops, had Artald reinstated as bishop through Robert, the Archbishop of Trier, and Frederick of Mainz.

28
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,852
The following year, King Louis laid siege to the castle of Mouzon, which Hugh, after being expelled from Reims, had kept for himself.

29
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:58,981
However, not achieving his goals, and with the Lotharingians withdrawing after several weeks, he went back to Reims.

30
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:05,925
Shortly after, around the Easter festival, some suggested to Prince Hugh that Durocortorum could be easily taken.

31
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:11,640
He gathered an army, as if to capture it immediately, and attacked the city with Bishop Hugh.

32
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,014
But with the king's and Artald's soldiers bravely resisting, he withdrew, thwarted, on the eighth day after his arrival.

33
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:25,036
Meanwhile, Kings Louis and Otto negotiated to resolve the dispute over the archbishopric of Reims.

34
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:33,455
A meeting was called on the River Char, and bishops from both sides attended, but since it wasn't a synod, the issue couldn't be settled.

35
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:42,365
Therefore, in mid-November, a synod was announced, and with the archbishopric temporarily assigned to Artald, Hugh was allowed to stay at Mouzon.

36
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:52,197
However, seeking revenge for his defeat, he joined with Theobald of Montaigu, his brother-in-law, and devastated villages near Durocortorum during harvest time.

37
00:04:52,197 --> 00:05:10,817
The synod was held in Verdun, presided over by Robert, Bishop of Trier, along with Artald of Reims, Odalric of Aachen, Adalbero of Metz, Goslin of Toul, Hildebald of Transrhenania, Israel the Breton, and also attended by Bruno the abbot, King Otto's brother, as well as Agenold and Odilon, other abbots.

38
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:17,392
Hugh was officially summoned, but since he refused to attend, the bishopric of Reims was awarded to Artald.

39
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:28,146
Yet, because the matter was complex and didn't seem easily resolved by the provincial bishops, it was decided to convene a full council the following year in the church of St.

40
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:32,079
Peter near Mouzon, drawing from the dioceses of Trier and Reims.

41
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:41,297
When Bishop Hugh arrived and spoke with Robert, Archbishop of Trier, who presided over the council by special legation, he refused to enter the synod.

42
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:47,394
Pope Agapetus sent letters to the bishops through his cleric, who had brought them from Rome.

43
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:54,173
The letters didn't carry any canonical authority but simply instructed that the bishopric be returned to Hugh of Reims.

44
00:05:54,173 --> 00:06:05,566
After reading them, the bishops responded that it wasn't appropriate to disregard the mandate of the apostolic legation, which had been accepted by Archbishop Robert in front of the kings and bishops.

45
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:10,352
This was because the letters were presented by an enemy and rival of Bishop Arthaud.

46
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:30,974
Thus, after reading Chapter 19 of the Council of Carthage, on the Accused and the Accuser, it was decided that while Arthaud retained the parish of Reims, Hugh, who had already been called to two synods and had refused to come, should refrain from communion and governance of the Reims bishopric until he presented himself to a universal synod to clear his name.

47
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:41,798
The decision was immediately written down and sent to Hugh, who the next day, January 14, sent the same document back to Bishop Robert, adding that he would never comply with their judgment.

48
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,729
As for Arthaud, it is said that he was the brother of a certain Dodo.

49
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:52,166
After becoming the Archbishop of Reims from a monk of Reims, he received the pallium a year after his ordination.

50
00:06:52,166 --> 00:07:01,680
This was sent to him by the legates of the Church of Reims from Pope John, son of Maria, also known as Marozia, or from Alberic, the patrician and brother of the pope.

51
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:07,390
In 933, he presided over a council at Chateau-Thierry with Bishop Teutilon of Tours.

52
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,958
That same year, he consecrated Hibdegarius of Beauvais and Fulbert of Cambrai as bishops.

53
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:18,588
In 935, he held a council at Saint-Macre and ordained Monk Wifred as Bishop of Therouanne.

54
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:22,655
In 936, he anointed King Louis from Overseas in the city of Laon.

55
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:29,724
In 939, he excommunicated Herbert, who was occupying certain towns and villages belonging to the Church of Reims.

56
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:37,168
In 940, Louis from Overseas granted him and his church the perpetual right to possess the coinage of the city of Reims.

57
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:44,988
In that same year, after being forced out of his position, he received the abbey of Saint Basle and the monastery of Avallon.

58
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:55,748
In 948, following the Council of Mouzon, Pope Agapetus, having received his letters of restitution, sent his vicar, Bishop Marinus, to King Otto to convene a general synod.

59
00:07:55,748 --> 00:08:02,316
The synod was gathered that year, on the seventh day before the Ides of June, at the palace of Ingelheim.

60
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,257
There, Artald's letters were read before the kings and bishops.

61
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:16,329
After the reading and translation of these letters for the kings into the Germanic language, a man named Sigebald entered, bringing letters from the cleric Hugh.

62
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:26,902
He had brought these from Rome and had already presented them at another synod in Mouzon, claiming they were given to him in Rome by Marinus, who was present as a vicar.

63
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:34,096
Lord Marinus, presenting the letters that Sigebald had brought from Rome, ordered them to be read before the synod.

64
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:53,426
During the reading, it was found, as the letters themselves reported, that Bishop Wido of Soissons, Hildegarius of Beauvais, Rodulph of Laon, and all other bishops of the Reims diocese had sent the same letters to the apostolic see for the restoration of Hugh to the seat of Reims and the expulsion of Artald.

65
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,169
After these readings, Bishop Arthald, Rodolph, who was mentioned in the letters, and Fulbert, Bishop of Cambrai, rejected the letters.

66
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,672
They claimed they had never seen or heard of them before and had not agreed to their content.

67
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:20,630
When the same cleric couldn't contest this, despite interrupting with accusations, Lord Marinus suggested to the whole synod that they provide advice and a fair judgment on such an accuser and the accuser of the bishop.

68
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:33,353
Once the accuser was publicly exposed for making false claims, and chapters regarding such accusers were read, they unanimously decided he should be stripped of his honor and exiled according to the chapter's terms.

69
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:38,856
Thus, deprived of his diaconate ministry, he was rejected from the synod's presence and left.

70
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:54,063
However, for Bishop Arthald, who had attended all synods without evading judgment, they decided, praised, and confirmed that the bishopric of Reims should be fully retained and managed according to the laws of the canons and the decrees of the Holy Fathers.

71
00:09:54,063 --> 00:10:13,235
On the second day of the session, after readings of divine authority and a speech by Marinus's vicar, Lord Robert, Archbishop of Trier, suggested that since the bishopric of Reims had been restored and reinstated to Bishop Arthald according to the sacred law, synodal judgment should be conducted on the invader of the seat.

72
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:18,679
Marinus's vicar then instructed the synod to issue a canonical sentence on this presumption.

73
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,170
Therefore, the chapters of the holy law were brought forth.

74
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:44,419
After they were read, in accordance with the laws of the sacred canons and the decrees of the Holy Fathers-Sixtus, Alexander, Innocent, Zosimus, Boniface, Celestine, Leo, Symmachus, and other holy teachers of the Church of God-they excommunicated and expelled Hugo, the usurper of the Church of Reims, from the Church of God until he sought repentance and worthy satisfaction.

75
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:55,533
In that same year, Arthaldus attended the council in Trier and became the godfather to Louis, the son of Louis from Across the Sea, which means he baptized him.

76
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,244
This marks the end of Flodoard's history.

77
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:04,262
Around the year 950, the same bishop moved the body of Saint Bertha, the abbess, to Avenay.

78
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:13,322
Documents from this year, as well as from 938, 950, and 953, confirm that Arthaldus was the chief chancellor of the kingdom at that time.

79
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:19,670
In 952, he returned an abbey named Cosla, located in the Vosges, to the monks of Saint Remigius.

80
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:34,153
In the same year, he replaced the secular clergy with monks at Saint Basolus and reportedly gave the abbey of Saint Timothy to the same monks of Saint Remigius, which had previously belonged to the archbishops of Reims.

81
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:38,584
However, this concession is more accurately attributed to Adalbero.

82
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:43,676
For more details, see the Bollandists, August edition, volume four, page 576.

83
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:49,363
In 953, he convened a synod of five bishops at Saint Theoderic in the region of Reims.

84
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:56,836
Then in 954, on November 12th, he consecrated Lothair, the king of the Franks, in the basilica of Saint Remigius.

85
00:11:56,836 --> 00:12:04,772
By 958, he had recaptured the fortress of Coudray, which had been seized from his church by Theobald, Count of Chartres.

86
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:13,038
Finally, in 961, on September 30th, he succumbed to illness and passed away, and he was buried at the feet of Saint Remigius.

87
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:29,637
Afterwards, with the efforts of Count Hugh and some of Herbert's other children and certain bishops to have the vacant see of Reims returned to Hugh, Queen Gerberga and her brother Bruno objected, even though King Lothair supported Hugh's restoration.

88
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:50,336
The issue was discussed at a synod in Macon in the diocese of Meaux in 962, but no decision was made on Hugh's case without consulting the supreme pontiff, especially since Roric of Laon and Gibuinus of Chalons, having been excommunicated by several bishops, could not be reinstated into ecclesiastical communion.

89
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:56,222
After receiving a response from Rome, Hugh was rejected, and another bishop was ordained.

90
00:12:56,222 --> 00:13:02,968
For more information on Arthaldus' writings, see the Literary History of France, volume six, page 297.

91
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,672
Letter to the Synod Assembled at Ingelheim by Arthaud, Archbishop of Reims

92
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:20,059
To the vicar of the holy Roman and apostolic see, Lord Marino, and to the entire holy synod gathered at Ingelheim, I, Arthaldus, by the grace of divine mercy, Archbishop of Rheims, send greetings.

93
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:32,196
Lord Pope Agapitus has sent letters to us and the other bishops of our diocese, instructing us to attend this council of your holiness, fully prepared, so that we can clarify the troubles our see is experiencing to your holiness.

94
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:37,866
Therefore, I have decided to explain to you how the dispute between me and Hugo began and is still ongoing.

95
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:45,180
After Archbishop Heriveus passed away, we elected Seulf, who was then the archdeacon of our city, to the office of bishop of the same see.

96
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:53,077
Once ordained as bishop, he, with zeal against the relatives of his predecessor, found himself unable to remove them from their positions on his own.

97
00:13:53,077 --> 00:14:01,662
He then sought the friendship of Count Heribert, advised by certain laymen, namely his counselors, and secured it by making an oath through these same counselors.

98
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:08,287
This was under the condition that after his death, the church's soldiers would not elect a bishop without Heribert's counsel.

99
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:15,707
In return, the count was to separate the brother and nephews of Bishop Heriveus from any involvement in the affairs of the Rheims bishopric.

100
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:22,013
After these actions, Bishop Heriveus's relatives were accused by Bishop Seulf's counselors of disloyalty to their lord.

101
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:26,783
Count Heribert was summoned with many of his men and was ordered to bring them to account.

102
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:40,510
Because they refused to engage in single combat against their accusers, they were deprived of the possessions they held from the bishopric, captured, and taken by Count Heribert to King Robert, by whom they were also held in custody until King Robert's death.

103
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,903
In the third year of his tenure, Bishop Seulf, as many claim, was poisoned by Heribert's associates and died.

104
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:56,047
Soon after, Count Heribert went to the city of Reims and gathered the church's soldiers and some clergy members to discuss electing a new leader, as had been agreed upon.

105
00:14:56,047 --> 00:15:01,857
Together, they traveled to King Ralph in Burgundy to request authority for Heribert to manage the bishopric.

106
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:14,390
The condition was that he would respect and uphold the rights of both the clergy and the laity and govern justly, without wrongdoing, until he could present a suitable clergyman to the king for ordination into the episcopal ministry.

107
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:21,760
Upon returning to the city, the count distributed the bishopric's properties among his supporters as he saw fit, taking them from others.

108
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,924
Without any legal process, he stripped some of their possessions or expelled them from the city.

109
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:31,388
He then invited Ulrich, the Bishop of Aix, to the city to perform episcopal duties.

110
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:39,081
For over six years, he controlled the bishopric, managing it according to his own desires, and he and his wife lived in the bishop's residence.

111
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:49,140
However, in the seventh year, due to disputes with King Ralph and Count Hugh, King Ralph, along with Hugh, his brother Boso, and many others, both bishops and counts, laid siege to Reims.

112
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:55,595
The bishops were upset with him, complaining that the city had been without a pastor for too long, violating divine law.

113
00:15:55,595 --> 00:16:04,255
Moved by their grievances, the king encouraged the clergy and the people to elect a pastor, allowing them to do so for the honor of God and their loyalty to him.

114
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:13,400
Thus, with the agreement of all the clergy and laity outside the siege, and even many inside, a humble person of our choosing was elected, more as a burden than an honor.

115
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:25,303
Finally, when both the soldiers and citizens opened the city gates to King Rudolf, and the eighteen bishops gave me their episcopal blessing, my humility was acknowledged by the entire clergy and other citizens.

116
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:27,769
I was enthroned by the bishops of our diocese.

117
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:35,595
As God allowed, I served for nearly nine years, ordaining eight bishops throughout the diocese and many clerics in the episcopal office as needed.

118
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:51,410
In the ninth year after I had blessed King Louis, with support from Hugh, the kingdom's princes, and Queen Gerberga, and anointed them with holy chrism, Count Hugh, angry that I refused to join in the king's betrayal, besieged the city of Reims with Count Herbert and William, the Norman leader.

119
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,449
Not long after, on the sixth day of the siege, I was abandoned by nearly all the lay soldiers.

120
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,344
Left alone, I was compelled to go to Hugh and Herbert.

121
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:07,224
Under their pressure and intimidation, I was forced to resign from my episcopal duties, and they sent me to live in the monastery of Saint Basolus.

122
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:13,764
Meanwhile, they introduced Hugh, Herbert's son, who had been ordained a deacon at Auxerre, into the city and took control.

123
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:25,129
However, King Louis, returning from Burgundy, found me at Saint Basolus and took me along with my relatives, whose possessions Count Herbert had seized, to Laon, which Herbert and Hugh were besieging at the time.

124
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:28,935
After lifting the siege, he entered the town and arranged for our stay.

125
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:34,671
In the meantime, some clerics from our area, as well as certain laypeople, were harshly treated by Herbert.

126
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:41,586
Some clerics were imprisoned, and their possessions were seized and plundered, with looting spreading widely throughout the city.

127
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:49,252
Meanwhile, the bishops of our diocese were summoned by Hugh and Herbert, who were eager to inquire about the ordination of Herbert's son, Hugh.

128
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:58,676
The people of Soissons gathered and sent Bishop Hildegarius of Laon to me, along with other envoys, requesting that I join them to discuss the corruption of this ordination.

129
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:04,005
I replied that it wasn't appropriate for me to go to them, as my adversaries and enemies were among them.

130
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:09,689
I suggested that if they wished to speak with me, they should come to a location where I could meet them safely.

131
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,887
When they arrived at the designated place, I went to meet them.

132
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:20,297
Upon arrival, I bowed before them, pleading that for the love and honor of God, they strive to give advice that was suitable for both them and me.

133
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:29,280
They began urging me about the ordination of the aforementioned Hugh and tried in every way to persuade me to agree, promising to secure certain matters of the bishopric for me.

134
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:41,207
After delaying my response for a long time and seeing their persistence, I stood up and openly forbade them in front of everyone, excommunicating them by the authority of God the Father Almighty, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

135
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:50,698
I declared that none of them should proceed with this ordination, nor should anyone lay hands on episcopal honor while I was alive; nor should anyone presume to receive the same blessing.

136
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:53,642
If it were to happen, I would appeal to the Apostolic See.

137
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:58,768
With them raging as a result, I softened my response so I could leave their midst and return to Laon.

138
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:06,787
I suggested they send someone with me to report what advice I might find on this matter with my lady queen and her loyal followers, since the king was absent.

139
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:10,137
To this, they sent Bishop Derold, thinking I would change my mind.

140
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:18,004
When he arrived and questioned me in front of the lady queen and her followers, I rose again and proclaimed the same excommunication against those bishops.

141
00:19:18,004 --> 00:19:25,668
I made sure to renew the appeal to the Apostolic See, excommunicating Derold himself, so that he would not keep it secret but declare it openly to all.

142
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:34,515
After these events unfolded, they dismissed our excommunication, traveled to Reims, and while some took part in the ordination, others chose to withdraw.

143
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:37,941
As I stayed with the king, I shared in the hardships he endured.

144
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:42,864
When Hugo and Heribert attacked him in battle, I was by his side and narrowly escaped death.

145
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:50,784
By God's help and protection, I managed to slip away and wandered as a fugitive through remote areas and forests, not daring to settle in one place.

146
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:59,347
However, Counts Hugo and Heribert convinced some of our friends, under their influence, to search for me and bring me to them, promising rewards and enrichment.

147
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:03,575
My friends found me wandering in various places and brought me to these counts.

148
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:11,228
Once they had me in their power, they demanded I hand over the pallium given to me by the Roman See and completely renounce my priestly duties.

149
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:15,509
I declared that I would never do such a thing, not even for the sake of my life.

150
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:19,309
Under their pressure, I was ultimately forced to renounce my bishopric.

151
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:23,215
So, I was taken back to Saint Basolus, as if without a position, to live.

152
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:31,136
I stayed there for a few days in the monastery, until I received word from messengers of Count Heribert's household that he was plotting against me.

153
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:34,293
Terrified by these messages, I left and hid in the forests.

154
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:40,876
In the quiet hours and along a remote path, I returned to Laon, where the king received me and allowed me to stay with him.

155
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:49,920
I remained there with him and his loyal followers, waiting and praying for God's mercy, until He inspired Lord King Otto to come to the aid of our king and us in France.

156
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:57,248
After our lady queen left Laon to seek the king's absolution, I traveled with my elder to King Otto, and we also went to Reims.

157
00:20:57,248 --> 00:21:02,680
At that time, the city was surrounded by armies, and the bishops present decided I should be reinstated.

158
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,858
Consequently, King Otto ordered Hugh to leave and abandon the city he had taken.

159
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:15,476
After some hesitation and realizing he couldn't resist or rely on his friends for support, Hugh decided to leave, asking for safe passage for himself and his people.

160
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:21,429
He was allowed to leave safely with everyone who chose to follow him, taking whatever he wanted without objection.

161
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:26,652
Thus, when I entered the city with the kings, I was ordered to be restored to my position and honor.

162
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:37,306
Welcomed by the lord archbishops, Robert of Trier and Frederick of Mainz, along with others, and congratulated by both the church clergy and other citizens, I was reinstated to the episcopal seat by them.

163
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:44,200
Meanwhile, Hugh left Reims and occupied the castle of Mouzon with his people, fortifying it against the loyalists of our elder king.

164
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,990
A meeting was held between my elder king and Lord Otto on the River Char, attended by both Hugh and me, along with his supporters.

165
00:21:50,990 --> 00:22:02,375
There, the bishops heard the dispute, and Hugh presented letters to the Roman seat, supposedly written in my name, asking for my resignation from my episcopal duties, which I have always denied dictating or confirming.

166
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:08,486
Since a synod had not been convened at that time, our dispute couldn't be resolved, as Hugh's supporters pointed out.

167
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:14,022
A synod was announced to be held in Verdun around mid-November, with the bishops on both sides consenting.

168
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:19,245
In the meantime, it was decided that I would govern the seat of Reims while Hugh remained in Mouzon.

169
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:31,257
Not long after, during the grape harvest, our rival Hugh, along with Theobald-an enemy of the king and our kingdom-and several other wrongdoers, came to the villages near the city that belonged to the Bishop of Reims.

170
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:36,031
They gathered almost all the wine from these areas and transported it to different regions.

171
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,707
During this time, many wrongs were committed there.

172
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:43,272
People from our church were taken captive and subjected to various tortures for ransom.

173
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:52,716
A synod was announced and held in Verdun, presided over by Robert, the bishop of Trier, by command of the lord Pope in Rome, with Lord Bruno and several bishops and abbots present.

174
00:22:52,716 --> 00:22:59,957
Hugh, as mentioned, was summoned to this synod, and although two bishops, Adalbero and Gozlin, were sent to bring him, he refused to come.

175
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:03,577
The entire synod decided that I should govern the bishopric of Reims.

176
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:14,385
Another synod was scheduled for the Ides of January, and it was indeed convened as announced in the Church of Saint Peter, overlooking the castle of Mouzon, by Lord Robert, along with others gathered there.

177
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:23,252
We acknowledge that through your efforts, a monastery of monks in honor of Mary, the Mother of God, was established in the castle of Mouzon, which is on the Meuse River.

178
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:29,758
It was adorned with religious observance and endowed with your properties, as well as the lands and churches of your church.

179
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:35,267
We received this under the decree of Blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, and ours, at your request.

180
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:53,158
Furthermore, the small estate named Tin, established by the distinguished man Stephen and his wife Freduide, and dedicated to Saint Remigius, which you granted to the monastery in Mouzon because it could not stand alone due to lack of resources, was transferred, with compensations made to Blessed Remigius, with the consent of the brothers.

181
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:57,126
We want the entire Church to know that we are in full agreement.

182
00:23:57,126 --> 00:24:21,337
We confirm with this decree that whatever is given or will be given by you, or by anyone else, whether it's cultivated or uncultivated land, vineyards, meadows, churches, male and female slaves, waters, or watercourses, and everything related to the aforementioned monastery, is under the authority of Saint Peter, the chief of the apostles, and ours:
This is to ensure that the place remains peaceful and inviolable, free from the resentment of detractors.

183
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:49,044
If anyone, which we do not expect, recklessly dares to go against what has been piously and firmly arranged by our authority through this privilege, or tries to break and transgress in any way what we have established for the praise of God and the stability of the already mentioned monastery, let them know they are bound by the authority of Saint Peter, whose duties we fulfill, even though we are unworthy, and they shall be burned with eternal fire along with the devil and Judas, the betrayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.

184
00:24:49,044 --> 00:25:03,030
However, whoever, with pious intent, remains an observer in all things, keeping the command of our apostolic constitution with a focus on the worship of God, will receive the grace of blessing and forgiveness of their sins and become a participant in eternal life.

185
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,533
This was written by the hand of Stephen, a notary of the Holy Roman Church, in April.

186
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:15,692
It was given by the hand of Bishop Andrew, on the twenty-third of April, in the seventh year of the pontificate of our most holy lord and thirteenth pope.

187
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:23,586
In the eleventh year of the reign of Lord Otto the Great as Emperor, and the fifth of the younger, in the month of April, in the fifteenth indiction.
