00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,942
Introduction.

2
00:00:00,942 --> 00:00:11,231
Historical Praise of Saint Odon by the author Mabillon, as found in "Acts of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict," Century 5, page 124.

3
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:24,008
Chapter One - The Authors of His Life, His Parents, and Homeland
Although two authors, John and Nalgodus, both Cluniac monks, wrote about the deeds of Saint Odo, they left out many significant details that should be recorded.

4
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:38,828
To avoid neglecting the examination of a man who was greatly esteemed within the Benedictine community, it's important to present a historical account before the works of these two writers, addressing the matters they left untouched or insufficiently explained.

5
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:40,815
Let's start with these two authors.

6
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:48,310
The first, John, mentioned his own fortune sporadically across three books about Odo, which a summary manuscript condenses into two.

7
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,285
He was Italian by birth, Roman by homeland, and a canon by profession.

8
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:59,667
When Odo traveled to Rome in 939, John brought him to Pavia, where he was made a monk, as noted in Book One, numbers two and four.

9
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:10,626
John later took him as a companion on a pilgrimage and appointed him as prior, as noted multiple times in Book Two, specifically numbers four, seven, and ten, whether at Cluny or in Rome at St.

10
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,023
Paul's.

11
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,657
This could be clarified by comparing numbers ten and twenty-one.

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:21,074
Finally, John states that he was sent to Naples due to the needs of his monastery, as noted in number twenty-one.

13
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:26,298
John counts two years in Book Three, number five, as the entire time he was Odo's companion.

14
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:39,301
During this period, whatever he observed about what Odo said or did, he later wrote down, omitting other details he learned about Odo from his master Arnulf, Bishop Hubert of Tivoli, the monk Landric, and his superior Hildebrand.

15
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:46,853
He trusted only his own observations and Odo's account, which might have been lessened had he been more trusting of others' accounts.

16
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:49,806
We will try to fill in these gaps as best as we can.

17
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:55,143
Additionally, John dedicates his work to the monks of Salerno, whether of the monastery of St.

18
00:01:55,143 --> 00:02:03,036
Peter of Salerno near Fistula, which Ughellus proves was founded by Bishop Peter before 958, in volume seven of "Italia Sacra," column 503.

19
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:08,701
Sometimes, John veers off on tangents and doesn't keep the timeline of events in order.

20
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:16,170
To address these issues, the monk Nalgodus set out to condense and organize John's work, as he also did with the life of Saint Maiolus.

21
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:25,355
Peter of Rivo refers to Nalgodus as a disciple of Odo in the Cluniac Chronicle, noting that he clearly described the life and miracles of Saint Odo after his passing.

22
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:31,994
Godefridus Henschenius interprets this as a reference to the life of Saint Maiolus, believing Nalgodus was his disciple.

23
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:41,400
However, Nalgodus lived nearly 200 years after Odo and slightly less after Maiolus, as he clearly mentions during the time of Pope Urban the Second or shortly thereafter.

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:51,967
We've decided to include the writings of this author in three smaller booklets by John, because of some details about Odo's death and burial, and other circumstances not found in John's work.

25
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:58,054
Many other authors have praised Odo, and Chesnius provides a list of them in the notes to the Cluniac Library.

26
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:03,088
Among these, Peter of Equilinus extensively discusses Saint Odo in Book Ten, Chapter Eight.

27
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:14,597
Before I begin discussing Odo of Cluny, it's important to mention that there were two other notable abbots with the same name during that period, one from Masciac and the other from Saint Maxentius in Poitou.

28
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:21,125
Regarding the Masciac monastery in Bituriges, we should recall what we mentioned earlier in the eulogy of Abbot Berno.

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:31,029
After Berno, Odo of Cluny appointed an abbot with the same name, who is noted to have become abbot in 935 in the Masciac Chronicle found in Volume Two of the New Library by Labbe.

30
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:39,605
It also records the death of this second Odo: In the year 967, on June 6th, this well-remembered abbot Odo passed away, and Monk Arduicus on September 5th.

31
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:45,968
The following day is marked in the Thuano-Colbertine Calendar of Saints with these words: June 7th, Odo of Masciac.

32
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:55,918
Another Odo was an abbot at Saint Maxentius in the year 963 and was succeeded by Abbot Ramnulfus in 968, as noted by the Malleacensian chronicler in the same Labbeus.

33
00:03:55,918 --> 00:04:02,240
With this context, let's turn to Odo, or Oddo, the Abbot of Cluny, and explore his origins and family background.

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,737
His father was Abbo, a man of military rank, as confirmed by John the monk and others, though they do not mention Odo's mother's name.

35
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:12,870
John's account of Abbo appears at the start of Book One.

36
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:48,507
According to Nalgodus, both parents were convinced by their son's guidance to embrace monastic life, drawing from John, who, after describing the miracle of crumbs turning into pearls, adds this in Book One, number 35:
"From that time, he began to be troubled within himself because of his parents' salvation, so that he might be able to free them from the bonds of this world."
Not long after, he received permission to visit his father, bring him to the monastery, and make him a monk; he also had his mother take the holy veil.
If her life had been documented (which I wish it had), it would appear more like history than a mere note.

37
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:56,955
Thus, Odo was born to such parents in the year 879, given that in 939 he was sixty years old, according to John at the beginning of Book One, number 4.

38
00:04:56,955 --> 00:05:06,969
It's inferred that his birthplace was the city of Tours, due to his father's devotion to Saint Martin, to whom he dedicated himself from a young age, as noted by John in number 9.

39
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:16,536
This assumption is supported by the same author's mention in Book Two, number 16, of young Odo's nephew being captured by the Normans when they ravaged the lands of Tours.

40
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,494
Therefore, his nephew was in Tours.

41
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:25,823
However, in the old Cluny charter book, there is an account of Odo, where the author claims he originated from the region of Maine.

42
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:33,040
This account was written during the time of Abbot Odilo by someone responsible for organizing the records of the previous abbots.

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,413
Here's a summary of the praise:
According to the truthful accounts from those before us, he was born into a noble family from the region of Maine.

44
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:49,227
He was well-educated in the liberal arts, served as a caretaker of the basilica of Saint Martin of Tours, and was eloquent, among other qualities.

45
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:59,342
Inspired by the virtues that the reputation of Cluny-or rather Baume-had spread far and wide like precious spices, he left his countryside with a willing heart for what he had long desired.

46
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:04,907
While his fellow citizens mourned, Christ rejoiced in glory, and he humbly submitted to the divine yoke.

47
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:16,842
After diligently completing the trial of his conversion, urged by the prayer of his father-whose teachings he had both willingly and, more truthfully, unwillingly followed-he took on the leadership of the entire fraternity.

48
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:21,551
With sharp insight, he subdued proud minds, and with caution, worked to instill virtues.

49
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:24,495
Italy knows, Burgundy attests, and France also reports.

50
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:27,973
He was undoubtedly recognized as possessing the gift of prophecy.

51
00:06:27,973 --> 00:07:13,035
When faced with his final days and asked by the brothers who should lead them, he reportedly answered, inspired by a great insight: "In our uncertain judgment, O sons, Christ the Lord's ample wisdom will not fail, providing a holy shepherd for His house and granting you, His praying servants, a worthy father."
This is clearer than the sun to those who consider it wisely, as the life and conversion of Lord Heymard provide ample proof.
A brief speech on the praiseworthy nobility of such a man should suffice, showing how greatly we ought to adhere to the teachings of one who, by merit, is undoubtedly included among the ranks of angels. This much was included by the old author, who wrote this praise during the time of Abbot Odilo, that is, one hundred years after the death of Odo, in the records stored under Odo in the Cluny archives.

52
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:17,330
Chapter Two: Odo's Childhood and Adolescence, Canonical Life, Studies.

53
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:30,087
Odo was partly raised by Fulk, the second of that name, Count of Anjou, whom he refers to as his foster brother in a letter, and partly in the household of William, Duke of Aquitaine, as John records at the start of the first book.

54
00:07:30,087 --> 00:09:02,817
This William, known as "the Pious," ruled Aquitaine and Gascony by his own right at that time.
We've mentioned that he laid the foundations of the Cluny monastery in Berno's tribute.
In fact, Odo's father, Abbo, held great influence with William, as John notes in section five.
After Odo was weaned, Abbo entrusted him to a priest living in a more remote area, to be raised and educated in literature, as noted in section seven.
Around this time, while involved in military activities at William's court, Odo felt called to a holier service by Christ the Lord on Christmas Day during his sixteenth year, after suffering from a headache for two years at his father's house.
Later, fulfilling his father's vow, Odo dedicated himself to Saint Martin at the age of nineteen, around the year eight hundred ninety-nine AD, becoming a cleric and canon in the presence of many citizens and nobles.
Among them was Count Fulk, who had raised him, and who soon provided him with a cell next to Saint Martin's church, along with daily sustenance from the same canonry.
Fulk, known as "Good," is praised in the deeds of the Counts of Anjou in the tenth volume of the Spicilegium, pages four hundred two and four hundred thirty-four, where it states on page four hundred thirty-five: His good manners, both at home and in the military, were cultivated; he had a good sense of justice, great harmony, and very little greed.
About Odo: He nurtured Saint Odo, gave him a cell next to the church of Saint Martin, and provided daily sustenance from the same chamber; later, with the consul's support, Odo was appointed master of the school and precentor of the same church.
John then from number...

55
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:10,729
The text outlines Odo's studies and virtues, detailing his journey to Paris where he learned the liberal arts from Remigius, a monk from Auxerre.

56
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:14,065
This included Augustine's dialectic sent to his son Adeodatus.

57
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:18,478
Upon returning to Tours, Odo condensed Gregory the Great's moral teachings on Job.

58
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:24,289
This work was published in Paris in 1617, thanks to Dom Martin Marrer, a monk at Saint Martin of the Fields.

59
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:29,885
John notes that Odo undertook this work at the request of his fellow canons, despite initial reluctance.

60
00:09:29,885 --> 00:10:39,402
Although Odo doesn't mention this in his dual preface, written in both prose and verse, possibly out of modesty, he implies that he took on the task almost independently with these words:
"While I devoted myself to sacred reading within my humble capacity, a book by Blessed Gregory about the history of the most holy Job caught my attention one day."
"This remarkable teacher, inspired by divine insight and nourished by heavenly wisdom, spread his eloquent discourse over the history of this man, so extensively that he created thirty-five books, eventually condensing them into six volumes."
"As I read through the first part, filled with intense love and a certain sweetness, my mind was captivated, desiring to absorb the entire book if possible."
"This extraordinary teacher, enriched by divine inspiration, sought to clearly express the interpretations of the Fathers that came to him during his explanations."
"He condensed numerous volumes into the history, as those familiar with the Holy Scripture know, extracted by the holy man named Paterius and compiled into his own clear volumes."
"Two years ago, I compiled all the interpretations of the Fathers in the Book of Kings, especially those of the most holy Pope Gregory, into a booklet that I believe is worthy of consideration."

61
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:49,944
Recognizing my own frailty and physical weakness, and for the benefit of those like me, I stood against myself-not inflated with pride or arrogance, nor relying on empty flattery-God knows this.

62
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:58,046
Motivated by the passion for reading the mentioned history, which I memorized with all my effort to retain its understanding, I compiled this small book.

63
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,535
Thus far, Odo in the preface of his compendium.

64
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:11,178
In section twenty-one, John addresses Count Fulk, claiming he suffered a deadly illness after taking two golden vessels from the Church of Saint Martin's treasury, and was healed through Odo's prayers.

65
00:11:11,178 --> 00:12:13,132
Some recent scholars disagree, pointing to Fulk's piety, which earned him the nickname "the Good."
Yet, even the sun casts shadows, and the author of the book on the deeds of the counts of Anjou, who recounts many illustrious things about Fulk, included this event; which I believe was to reinforce John's own authority.
Returning to the canonical life of Odo, it's helpful to briefly explain the discipline among the Martinian community at that time.
After renouncing monastic life, a certain regular form of discipline flourished there.
The number of monks decreased from three hundred to one hundred and fifty canons; continuous psalmody was limited to specific hours, as explained more fully in the eulogy of Alcuin, section forty-six.
Nonetheless, the cloister maintained its reverence, women were forbidden entry, and many measures were in place to maintain propriety.
The situation worsened after the second burning of that basilica, about which Odo-now a monk-gave a sermon at the request of the canons.
After the previous burning, he said, with great effort they rebuilt the monastery walls, wanting to protect the holy house from being harmed by enemies again.

66
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:18,923
You have not paid enough attention to how greatly this holy place has been revered since ancient times.

67
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:23,256
You've immediately abandoned its sacredness, allowing it to become a common inn.

68
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:27,481
Guards do not stop women from fetching water and wandering wherever they want.

69
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:32,085
We have seen that no one was allowed to enter the monastery gates, not even a little.

70
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:39,343
This is addressed in the letter of Pope Leo the Seventh to Duke Hugh and the abbot, published in the second volume of the Spicilegium.

71
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:51,206
It decrees that throughout the entire extent of the old wall up to the road running alongside the northern side of the basilica, no woman is permitted to reside, nor even to enter, except for the sole purpose of prayer.

72
00:12:51,206 --> 00:13:03,556
Odo adds: It is also quite displeasing that some nurtured in the same place disgrace themselves with certain lay or excessively ostentatious garments, when their behavior has been such that we have heard it praised even in Rome.

73
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:11,572
Indeed, Odo had reminded the canons to conduct themselves better both through words and example, as mentioned by John in book one, number seventeen.

74
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:15,939
Chapter Three: The Beginning of Monastic Life, Companions, Priesthood.

75
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:24,426
While Odo spent his time in retreat at the Basilica of Saint Martin, reading and reflecting on the Fathers, he discovered the rule of Saint Benedict.

76
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:28,357
Following its guidance, he lived for three years without possessions.

77
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:32,059
Although he wasn't yet a monk, he embraced the monks' light yoke.

78
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,135
As John testifies, he invited Count Fulco to join him.

79
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:42,996
But when Fulco said it wasn't the right time, he introduced Odo to a soldier named Adhegrinus, skilled in arms, and brought them together.

80
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,870
Both, content with a very small hut, longed daily for monastic vows.

81
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,629
However, they couldn't find a place where such discipline thrived.

82
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,471
Adhegrinus was sent to Rome to explore, but during his journey, he detoured to Balma.

83
00:13:55,471 --> 00:14:03,674
Impressed by the abbot's kindness and the monks' devotion, he brought Odo with him, who moved to this monastery with a hundred volumes of books.

84
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:07,376
He was about 30 years old when the year of Christ was nearly 909.

85
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:08,630
This is noted by John.

86
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:20,478
Regarding Balma, as mentioned in Berno's praise, after completing his probation, Odo took on the care and education of the boys or novices, which John refers to as a school, as was often done by the ancients.

87
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:27,997
Adhegrinus, Odo's companion, confined himself to one small cell, and with Abbot Berno's permission, he stayed there for three years.

88
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:31,358
Later, he sought solitude and was confined in a small cave.

89
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:42,636
There, after much suffering, he was deemed worthy of divine consolation and was freed from demonic temptations with the help of Saint Martin, even being comforted by his conversation, as John notes.

90
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:51,238
John continues to write about him, stating that more than thirty years have passed, if he is not mistaken, since Adhegrinus has lived in that solitude.

91
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:59,042
He usually descends to the monastery of Saint Peter, known as Cluny, which is nearly two miles away, only on Sundays or major feast days.

92
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:05,934
He takes a small amount of flour, from which he makes bread, and a few grains of beans, then quickly returns to solitude.

93
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,796
He never drinks wine, and his food is never seasoned with fat or oil.

94
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:16,913
He endures both cold and heat at all times: warmth between his shoulders and chill between his hands and arms.

95
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:21,807
It's quite remarkable about Adhegrinus, whom Chesnius notes was listed among the saints.

96
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,977
I'm not denying his merit; I'm looking for the authority.

97
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:32,373
For I find no mention of Adhegrinus in the Martyrologies or Breviaries, nor any memory of his feast or relics among our Cluniacenses.

98
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:37,544
I'm not sure if the same Droco, a very pious monk of Fleury, was his companion in the desert.

99
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:46,497
He, proven in monastic life, took on a unique struggle in the desert at a place called Balma, as Aimoinus testifies in the previous volume, page three sixty-one.

100
00:15:46,497 --> 00:16:02,401
The Malleacense chronicle mentions Teuthelon as a companion of Adhegrinus:
At the same time, while Turpio was still alive, Odo and Teuthelon, canons of the illustrious Saint Martin, left all their possessions to follow Christ, the poor one, and took on the holy habit and life at Cluny.

101
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:11,910
By God's will, Odo became the most holy abbot, as we will discuss later:
Teuthelon, under his abbot's command, was unwillingly consecrated as the archbishop of Tours, etc.

102
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:19,529
However, from the above, it's clear that this is false about Teuthelon or Teotolon, and this will become more apparent from what follows.

103
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:27,759
After some time, Berno considered Odo worthy of the priesthood and promoted him; with the bishop summoned, he made him a priest without his consent.

104
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,874
John explains this in number thirty-seven, though the bishop is not named.

105
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:35,655
Nalgodus suggests the Archbishop of Besancon, but this is incorrect.

106
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:50,225
It's clear from John's passage that Odo, at the request of his ordaining bishop and the command of the abbot, wrote three booklets about priests from the prophecy of Jeremiah, that is, three books of conferences, which were dedicated to Bishop Turpio of Limoges.

107
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:55,285
Therefore, this bishop conferred the priesthood on Odo shortly before his abbatial dignity.

108
00:16:56,064 --> 00:17:00,192
Chapter Four: The Dignity of the Abbot and the State of the Monastic Order.

109
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:03,054
During that period, Father Berno became gravely ill.

110
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:07,072
He soon called upon the neighboring bishops and renounced all his duties.

111
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:11,420
Meanwhile, he asked the brothers to choose someone they wanted as their leader.

112
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,640
At that moment, the brothers expressed that John, our father, was almost forcibly convinced to take the position.

113
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,199
With everyone insisting that he should be ordained, he was brought before his abbot against his will.

114
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,033
Eventually, pressured by the bishops' insistence, he was ordained as abbot shortly before Berno's passing.

115
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:34,593
This event, which occurred at the start of the year 927, is recorded in the Chronicle of Malleacense.

116
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:42,904
However, the reasons we've presented suggest otherwise, supported by the Lemovicense Martyrology noted by Chesnius in the notes to the Cluniac Library.

117
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,537
Odo was entrusted with three monasteries: Cluny, Masciac, and Dol.

118
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:55,233
To Wido, a relative of Berno, four were entrusted: Gigny, Baume, Aethic, and the cell of Saint Lauten, as explained in detail in the tribute to Berno himself.

119
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,261
Odo the abbot achieved many great and remarkable feats.

120
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:09,104
The perfection of the Cluny monastery and its dedication, privileges, rituals, and strict discipline set the standard for other monasteries either built or joined, forming the Cluniac congregation.

121
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:18,736
His journeys to Rome for the good of the Church, fostering harmony among rulers, charity towards the poor, and other extraordinary deeds made Odo's fame celebrated everywhere.

122
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:22,204
These matters are discussed by John in Book Three and Nalgodus.

123
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:32,717
From these accounts, it is sufficient to highlight a few key aspects: the rites and dignity of the Cluny monastery, the reform or establishment of other monasteries, and the journeys to Rome.

124
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:39,487
I will first address these here, but before that, we must discuss the state of the monastic order in Gaul during that time.

125
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:53,115
Following the great leaders, Charles the Great and Louis the Pious, who earnestly discussed enhancing the order of Saint Benedict, Benedict of Aniane managed to unite most monasteries in Gaul under a single religious community.

126
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:57,046
It seemed promising that this discipline would endure for a long time.

127
00:18:57,046 --> 00:19:06,424
However, after Benedict, the founder and protector of this order, passed away, the chaos of civil and foreign wars devastated the entire kingdom and this noble effort.

128
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:13,781
Amid intense conflicts among Louis the Pious's sons, and even with Louis himself, the Normans suddenly invaded Gaul from the north.

129
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:18,779
They severely weakened the state, already suffering from internal wars, over sixty years.

130
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:29,224
During this period, villages turned into wilderness, cities were attacked and burned, churches were plundered, monasteries were destroyed, and monks were either killed or forced to flee.

131
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:39,726
Gathering the relics of saints and their belongings, they hurried away from the path of war to safer places, if any could be found, or were barely able to live a miserable life wandering.

132
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:48,991
In some areas, where they could catch their breath for a while, they repaired huts as best they could, focusing more on survival and safety than following the rules.

133
00:19:48,991 --> 00:20:00,111
In certain places where the monastic population dwindled, a few clerics gathered and took possession of the former holdings of the monks, and even when peace returned, they kept them for themselves.

134
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:12,914
As a result, by the beginning of the tenth century, when Odo began contemplating monastic life, few monasteries remained, and sincere religion was lacking in those few, as noted in Book One, number 22 of John and in our preface.

135
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:22,742
Amid all this turmoil, particularly under Abbot Odo, Cluny rose above all other monasteries with a reputation for religious devotion, which Odo established there after Bernon.

136
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:31,993
In that place, there was a strong spirit of competition in virtues, a dedication to sacred matters, precise observance of rules, and charity toward the poor.

137
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:41,954
So much so that 17,000 poor people received alms at Cluny at the beginning of Lent one year, including 250 hams, as recorded by Ulric in Book 3 of the Customs of Cluny, Chapter 11.

138
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:47,655
This house also supported the apostolic see more than once, serving as a common treasury of the church.

139
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,537
Peter the Venerable is the author.

140
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:54,573
Many of the rites were taken from Abbot Euticius, with additions by Berno, Odo, and others.

141
00:20:54,573 --> 00:21:01,878
Euticius seems to be none other than Benedict of Aniane, who gathered the institutions of the old monks and proposed them as models.

142
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:07,579
Some of these rites are mentioned by John in Book 1, Number 23, especially Number 30 and the following.

143
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:16,434
Some related to the divine office, some to regular discipline and monastic virtues, while others concerned the education of the young and instruction of others.

144
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:27,115
All of these are accurately described by the holy monk Ulric, following Bernard, a monk from the same place, in three books, which were published by our Acherius in Volume 4 of the Spicilegium.

145
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:35,528
The first book deals with psalmody, solemn Masses, and various important celebrations; the second with regular discipline; the third with the officials.

146
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:43,110
It was customary to celebrate two solemn Masses daily: private sacred rites were performed only outside the divine office and major Mass.

147
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:54,843
Each person offered their own sacrifices from one of the two choirs daily; however, they communicated with three free days only on five Sundays: the others took blessed hosts like eulogies before the common meal.

148
00:21:54,843 --> 00:22:00,765
In solemn Masses for the deceased and during the Rogation Days triduum, both choirs would make an offering.

149
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:07,074
In major sacred rites, the deacon always communicated from the priest's host; the subdeacon only from other hosts.

150
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:18,641
Communion was provided to everyone in the triduum before Easter: whoever wanted to celebrate privately on Holy Saturday before the major Mass did not use a candle, as the new fire had not yet been consecrated.

151
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:25,725
In these matters, nothing is more noteworthy than what's detailed about making the hosts in Book Three, Chapter Thirteen.

152
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:29,845
The monks selected the wheat grain by grain and washed it carefully themselves.

153
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:40,014
It was then placed in a special bag and taken to the mill by a trusted servant, who washed the millstones, covered them with curtains, and dressed in white, covering his face except for his eyes.

154
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:44,446
The flour was sifted with the same meticulous care, using a thoroughly cleaned sieve.

155
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:52,685
Then, the chief custodian of the church, if a priest or deacon, completed the rest of the tasks with help from two others of the same order and a lay brother.

156
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,449
If not a priest or deacon, he appointed a substitute.

157
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:59,099
These four, after their morning prayers, washed their faces and hands.

158
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:06,296
Three of them dressed in white garments: one sprinkled the flour with pure water, while the other two baked the hosts in an engraved iron.

159
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:10,728
This demonstrates the devotion and reverence the Cluniac monks had for the Eucharist.

160
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,961
In their regular duties, the discipline was equally stringent.

161
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:21,940
Silence was maintained throughout the day, and at night it was so sacred that breaking it before Prime was considered unthinkable, even preferring death.

162
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:29,866
Communication was done through signs, which Guigo, the fifth prior of the Carthusian Order, did not fully approve of, despite his dedication to silence.

163
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:37,532
He believed that only the tongue should be used, not involving other limbs in the act of speaking, as stated in Chapter Thirty-One of the Statutes.

164
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:45,197
From the Ides of November, the older members meditated in the church after nocturns, while the younger ones practiced singing in the Chapter House.

165
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:49,108
Manual work was accompanied by psalms, and confessing faults was customary.

166
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:53,228
After Compline, guests were not admitted, nor were the brothers allowed to eat.

167
00:23:53,228 --> 00:24:00,945
Udalricus tells of a notable instance where the cellarer, busy receiving wine all day, wasn't granted permission by the abbot to eat after Compline.

168
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:03,344
The same strictness applied to divine offices.

169
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:09,237
If someone was about to leave or ride a horse and the office bell rang, they were required to attend immediately.

170
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:14,316
The rule about fasting generally followed the instructions of Saint Benedict.

171
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:20,015
From September 13th, there was typically just one meal per day, except on feast days with twelve readings.

172
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:23,510
During the octaves of Christmas and Epiphany, they had two meals.

173
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:30,715
On feast days with twelve readings, after lunch and a reading in the cloister, they would have a drink in the dining hall after Nones.

174
00:24:30,715 --> 00:24:38,350
On regular days, after Vespers, there was a reading, followed by a drink in the dining hall, another reading, and then a spiritual discussion.

175
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,437
Leftover bread and wine were given by the almoner to poor travelers on foot.

176
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,609
Additionally, eighteen poor people were fed daily at Cluny.

177
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:54,803
Wine was used so sparingly that eight cartloads sufficed for more than thirty brothers annually at the Charity monastery, as noted by Udalricus in Book Three, Chapter One.

178
00:24:54,803 --> 00:25:05,073
According to Saint Odo's rules, the fast of the four seasons in September was observed in the week when the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross fell on a Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday.

179
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:07,600
Thus, the cross was venerated by those fasting.

180
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:17,547
Whether Odo allowed the use of medicine for the brothers is uncertain, according to Book Two, Number Fourteen of John, and also from Book Six, Letter Thirty-Nine of Peter the Venerable.

181
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:23,838
The Carthusians, as Guigo mentions in Chapter Thirty-Nine, rarely used medicine, except for cautery and bloodletting.

182
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:25,989
Bloodletting occurred five times a year.

183
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:34,000
Over time, the Cluniacs designated a specific day each month for bloodletting; this process is detailed by Udalricus in Book Two, Chapter Twenty-One.

184
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,506
I'll skip the minor details.

185
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:48,249
More importantly, Udalricus wrote about the education of boys:
"Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any king's son being raised with greater care in a palace than any smallest boy in Cluny."
These words are from Book Three, Chapter Eight.

186
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:57,976
The management of this discipline was overseen by an abbot through a senior prior, deans, a cloister prior, inspectors, teachers of boys, a precentor, and a librarian.

187
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:02,730
The librarian was in charge of the books, especially those for the choir, in the library.

188
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:13,146
A chamberlain managed the clothing; a treasurer took care of the church's treasures; and the roles of cellarer, stable master, almoner, and infirmary master were also part of the management team.

189
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:22,387
The privilege of freedom granted to Cluny at the request of its founder William, and later affirmed by the abbots and Roman popes, is central to the discipline of the place.

190
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:29,384
Pope Callistus the Second, in his letters to Abbot Pontius, stated that this privilege was given to Cluny from its very foundation.

191
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:43,433
He listed the popes who confirmed it: John the Eleventh, John the Twelfth, Agapitus the Second, Leo the Ninth, Gregory the Sixth and Seventh, Alexander the Second, Stephen the Tenth, Victor the Third, Urban the Second, Paschal the Second, and Gelasius the Second.

192
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:51,178
Peter the Venerable addressed those who claimed that the Cluniacs lacked their own bishop by saying they regarded the Roman pope as their bishop.

193
00:26:51,178 --> 00:27:30,706
"We boast," he said, "to have this one and only greatest bishop." This was established by the unbreakable authority of the Holy See itself, not by the decree of just one, but many, which are preserved in our mother church.
This arrangement was not made to take the Cluniac church from another bishop who previously had it, but at the request of the founders who built it on their own land. They kept it as their own and decided it should belong only to the Roman pope forever, confirming this with many privileges. This is not unique to Cluniacs; it has been granted to many others. Long before Cluny was established, many other monasteries received this privilege from the same apostolic see. Thus wrote Abbot Peter in Book One, Letter 28.

194
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:41,991
Most of these types of privileges can be found in the Cluny Bullary, with seven granted to Abbot Odo: one by John the Tenth, two by John the Eleventh, one by Leo the Sixth, and three by Leo the Seventh.

195
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:48,528
The privilege attributed to John the Tenth, but mistakenly credited to the Eleventh, is mentioned in the praise of Berno.

196
00:27:48,528 --> 00:29:13,283
In the first document of John the Eleventh, among other things, the right to mint coins granted by Rudolph, King of the Franks, to Cluny is confirmed, and it states:
"And because, as it is well known, almost all monasteries are straying from their purpose, we grant that if any monk from any monastery wishes to join your community solely to improve his life, and his abbot fails to provide the regular support to relinquish possessions, you may receive him until the behavior of his monastery is corrected."
This was written in the month of March, in the fourth indiction, that is, the year 931.
We will revisit the privilege of Cluny's liberty in the Life of Saint Odilo, Abbot.
However, I must mention what Gregory the Seventh decreed about Cluny at the Roman Synod, expressed in these words:
"Let our priests, or rather this holy synod, know that although there are many monasteries founded usefully and religiously in honor of Almighty God and the Blessed Virgin;
among them, Cluny stands out, known for its special allegiance to Saint Peter and this church.
Therefore, it has rightfully earned the honor and protection of this holy and apostolic see from the very beginning...
And with divine mercy favoring, it has reached such a level of dignity and devotion under religious and holy abbots that it surpasses other monasteries, even those much older, as far as I know, in the service of God and spiritual fervor, and none in that region, as far as I know, can match it.
No abbot has ever been there who was not holy."
A truly remarkable praise from the pontiff.

197
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:26,683
From this point on, the Cluny monastery became renowned worldwide for its religious devotion, discipline, strictness, the number of monks, and all aspects of monastic order, as Peter the Venerable notes in book one of De Miraculis, chapter nine.

198
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:33,518
It became a unique refuge for sinners, through which many souls were saved from hell, finding a place in the heavenly kingdom.

199
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:38,672
There, countless people, shedding the burdens of the world, embraced the gentle yoke of Christ.

200
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:45,670
People from all walks of life, professions, and ranks exchanged worldly pride and luxury for the humble and simple life of monks.

201
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:54,133
Even venerable church leaders, seeking respite from ecclesiastical duties, chose to live more peacefully and quietly, preferring to follow rather than lead.

202
00:29:54,133 --> 00:30:04,386
From here, as spiritual virtues spread, the world was filled with their fragrance, rekindling the fervor of monastic life, which had nearly waned, through the example and zeal of these men.

203
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:15,236
France, Germany, and even Britain bear witness to this revival: Spain, Italy, and all of Europe acknowledge it, filled with monasteries either newly established by them or restored from ancient decay.

204
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:24,242
But why mention only a few parts of the world when this fame has spread from the far West to the East and hasn't remained hidden in any corner of the Christian world?

205
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:31,457
Up to this point, Peter the Venerable speaks, and the truth of his words would be easy to prove if we weren't called to another task.

206
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:45,399
However, to ensure we don't entirely abandon this topic, which greatly praises the Cluniac order and its founder Odo, we must discuss the monasteries established or restored by him and also give due attention to the other abbots of Cluny in their own right.

207
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:50,548
Chapter 5 - Monasteries Reformed by Odo, Establishment of the Cluniac Congregation.

208
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:59,981
It's important to mention what John writes about Odo in Book 2, number 23:
During that time, the name of our father began to shine far and wide like a very bright star.

209
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:04,361
He became known to kings, was very close to bishops, and dear to the nobility.

210
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:13,232
The monasteries built in their territories entrusted themselves to our father's authority so that he could correct and organize them according to our customs.

211
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:19,745
It would be difficult to list all these monasteries in detail, but it's enough to highlight the most prominent ones.

212
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:31,256
In France, we find the Aureilacense and Tutelense near Limoges, the Sarlatense in the region of Perigord, the Dolense and Masciacense in the region of Bourges, the Floriacense in the region of Orleans, St.

213
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,547
Peter's in Senones, St.

214
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:39,341
Julian's in Tours, the Romanense Abbey in the region of Vienne, and the Carilocense in the region of Macon, among others.

215
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:45,742
In Italy, we read about Saint Augustine's in Pavia, Saint Paul's in Rome, Adventine, Subpentonian, and Salernitan.

216
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:48,213
Some observations about these are necessary.

217
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:56,355
Gerald, the most pious count of Aurillac, after dedicating himself entirely to divine worship, decided to consecrate his own to the Lord as well.

218
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:08,707
He traveled to Rome and solemnly bequeathed his notable estate in Aurillac to the blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, with a testament that included appendices to provide for the monks he intended to gather there.

219
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:17,354
He also dedicated a tribute to be given annually to the urn of blessed Peter, namely ten solidi, as noted by Odo in Book 2 of his Life, chapters 4 and 17.

220
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:18,477
Odo adds in chapter.

221
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:18,533
.

222
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:18,590
.

223
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,914
Gerald was eager to find suitable monks to live in the monastery.

224
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:31,874
When he couldn't find any, he sent some noble boys to the monastery of Vabre, where the passion for regular observance was growing, to be trained under its rules.

225
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:38,953
However, when they came back, without proper teachers, they quickly fell into youthful complacency and neglected the discipline.

226
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:45,036
Out of necessity, someone was appointed to guide them, but his more relaxed habits caused Gerald great sorrow.

227
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:53,774
I'm not certain if this was Adalgerus, who the Aureliacense chronicle suggests was the first abbot of Aureliac, as noted in the second volume of the Analecta.

228
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:57,646
This abbot was succeeded by Joannes, who was from Gerald's own family.

229
00:32:57,646 --> 00:33:06,771
Oddo, the respected third abbot of Aureliac and Cluny, wrote the life of the blessed Gerald at the request of Turpion, bishop of Limoges, and Aimone, abbot of Tulle.

230
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,320
He had Arnulf as a co-abbot.

231
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:21,206
Odo was called from the Aureliac monastery, according to Aimoinus in book one of the miracles of Saint Benedict, chapter four, to restore discipline in the Floriac monastery, at the request of Count Eliziard, who later became a monk.

232
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:33,483
During the reign of Louis the Transmarine, Bernard, Count of Perigord, handed over the monastery of Saint Saviour of Sarlat, which eventually became an episcopal see, to Lord Oddo, abbot of Cluny, and his co-abbot Adacius.

233
00:33:33,483 --> 00:33:39,733
Letters regarding this matter are found in the fourth volume of Gallia Christiana, though with some inaccuracies.

234
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:52,453
Both Odo, the abbot of Cluny, and Adacius, his deputy, managed the monastery of Tulle, now an episcopal see, after the aforementioned Aimone, who was brought from the monastery of Saint Savinus in Poitiers to Tulle by Count Ebalo.

235
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:56,767
There is a diploma of this matter granted by King Rodulf in the addition of V.

236
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:56,877
C.

237
00:33:56,877 --> 00:34:01,081
Stephanus Baluzius of Tulle to book eight of Concordia, chapter twenty-five.

238
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:11,726
Back then, it was customary that because one abbot at Cluny wasn't enough for several monasteries, proabbots or coabbots were appointed in his place, who were later simply called priors.

239
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:18,023
This is evident from Clarius in the chronicle of Saint Peter of Vives in Sens, where Saint Odo succeeded Abbot Samson.

240
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:25,335
Saint Odo summoned Archbishop William and, with the monks of Saint Peter's consent, appointed Arigaud as the abbot of the same monastery.

241
00:34:25,335 --> 00:34:30,085
Arigaud was a devout man who feared God and was a monk of Saint Benedict above the Loire.

242
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:38,090
I believe Odo did the same in the monastery of Saint Julian in Tours, which was built during Bishop Gregory's time but later destroyed by the Normans.

243
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:45,775
When Archbishop Theotolo restored it with help from his sister Gersende, he dedicated the church in honor of the Mother of God and Saint Julian.

244
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:52,233
Wanting to appoint an abbot for the gathered brothers, he called upon Abbot Odo, who was then residing at Saint Benedict.

245
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:58,690
The martyrology of Saint Julian reports that this occurred in the year 943, during the eighth year of King Louis's reign.

246
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:07,549
However, that time refers to the donation made by Theotolo and Gersende, not to Odo's appointment at Saint Julian, as he is known to have died the previous year, 942.

247
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:12,032
He was buried in Saint Julian's Church alongside Theotolo, as we will discuss later.

248
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:27,776
I read a fragment of the chronicle from that place, written five hundred years ago, which was divided into two booklets:
The first detailed the initial establishment of the abbey, its destruction, and its pious restoration;
The second covered the state of the abbey from the restoration onwards.

249
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:36,955
From the tattered pages of the first booklet, we learn that many saintly bodies were originally buried in Saint Julian's Church, deeply buried during the time of the Danes.

250
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:42,933
Some of these remained, including those of Saint Bleviliguatus, Bishop of Vannes, Abbot Lauri, and Monk Anthony.

251
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:50,618
The author notes that Bishop Morvannus, the seventh Bishop of Vannes after Bleviliguatus, recounted some miracles to him, which he commemorates.

252
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:58,352
Bishop Blinlivet, not Saint Albert of Mount Relaxed, appointed him as the 33rd bishop of Venetia, while Morvannum became the 49th.

253
00:35:58,352 --> 00:36:03,552
The fragment's author notes that Laurus, who was born in Britain, left his homeland and parents.

254
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:08,318
However, he found Judicael, the best leader of the Britons, who helped him in every way.

255
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:15,196
With Judicael's assistance, the monastery thrived in holiness and greatly benefited many people through both words and actions.

256
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:20,125
Laurus' noble life was highly religious in the eyes of the people and precious to the Lord.

257
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:24,187
The glory of his miracles continues to bring high praises for his holiness.

258
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:32,799
Through his holiness, both during his life and after his death, weaknesses are restored and illnesses are healed, especially at the place where he passed away.

259
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,211
There, his ashes continue to live through the signs that occur.

260
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:40,273
Perhaps it is the monastery of Saint John of Gael, which Judicael restored.

261
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:45,635
Since the book of his life educates us about his life, it is enough to highlight the essence of it.

262
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:51,213
We believe this book has been lost, and as far as I know, nothing about Saint Laurus is read by Albert.

263
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:55,059
Finally, the chronographer writes that Anthony lived among the Turones.

264
00:36:55,059 --> 00:37:43,750
"It is said," he mentions, "that Saint Anthony lived there, although it is unclear whether he was originally from there or came from elsewhere. He was captivated by the sweetness of a solitary life and chose it over worldly life."
He lived in a beautiful and quiet place, surrounded by a forest. There, a chapel was sculpted in stone, which now contains two altars. In this place, the servant of God devotedly served God. No woman approaches the spring in the chapel.
This priory is visited and is located three leagues from Caesarodunum of the Turones towards the Cenomanni. Saint Anthony is celebrated on May 4th in the Gallican Martyrology.
Some more recent accounts suggest he was one of the companions of Saint Maurus the abbot. An instrument from John, the Archbishop of the Turones, created in 1407, mentions the abbot of Saint Julian, discussing the relics of Saint Anthony and Saint Laurus.

265
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,021
We are allowed to remain unaware of what the ancients did not know.

266
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:51,373
Now, let's delve into the monastery of Saint Julian once more.

267
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:58,616
Among the monasteries that Odo brought under his administration is Romanense, located in the Waldensian county of the Lausanne region.

268
00:37:58,616 --> 00:38:02,455
King Rudolph the First of Burgundy granted this to his sister, Aleydis.

269
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:11,050
The letters, dated June 10 in the first year of the pious King Rudolph, from the Incarnation of the Lord 888, in the 11th indiction, were issued at Vabrevilla.

270
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:20,888
We have the complete original of these letters, which were published in the notes to the Cluniac library, though there was an error in the century number, reading 900 instead of 800.

271
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:27,861
Later, Aleydis, also known as Adeleys, the countess herself, transferred that Roman-named abbey to Odo with an excellent diploma.

272
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:33,105
It's useful to refer to this for historical clarity:
To all who truly consider, it is clear, etc.

273
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:58,890
Therefore, let it be known to all living in the unity of faith and awaiting the mercy of Christ that Adeleydis, by the gift of God the countess, the resources of my right, which came to me by the decree of Lord King Rudolph, my sweetest and most beloved brother, this is the monastery called Romanense, which is located in the Waldensian region, with all the abbey and all the things and adjacent properties pertaining to that abbey long ago ordained by the holy Fathers there.

274
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:28,081
This aforementioned Romanense monastery was once constructed in honor of the chief apostles, namely Peter and Paul, under monastic profession: but now deprived entirely of their habitation, for the love of our Lord Jesus Christ and of those same apostles, from my right and domination, I, the aforementioned Adeleydis, transfer it entirely into the ownership and care of the monks, that is, of the venerable and most reverend Abbot Odo, and all the brothers and the company of monks living under his administration in the Cluniac monastery.

275
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:37,811
On the sole condition that these monks, as much as they are able, strive to reform that monastery to its former state through the intercession of the apostles, with Christ's favor.

276
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:43,317
The abbot mentioned earlier, along with the monks, will hold the monastery as long as he lives.

277
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:50,060
Although it's assigned to the apostolic seat, just like Cluny, they will always operate as one congregation under a single abbot.

278
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:56,018
So much so that when he steps down, neither they nor anyone else can appoint a new abbot without mutual agreement.

279
00:39:56,018 --> 00:40:09,504
Nor should they, God forbid, assume the right to appoint anyone other than the one chosen by the community, as it would be unjust for those who grew up like sons to the Roman monastery to separate from the Cluny community, who, like fathers, renew the place.

280
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:14,051
Indeed, when appointing an abbot, the rule of Saint Benedict should always be followed.

281
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:20,899
If even a small group from either congregation wants to choose a wiser leader, the others should agree in accordance with the rule.

282
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:29,000
Regarding the transfer of brothers or resources for greater benefit, it will be at the abbot's discretion to move them from one place to another as needed.

283
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,847
To maintain a strong bond among them, they shall uphold the same practices for divine service, alms, or any good work collectively.

284
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:41,963
What is done at Cluny for the remembrance of William or others, living or deceased, should benefit us and our people.

285
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:47,817
And what has been done at the Roman monastery for us, according to the Lord's will, they shall share in equally.

286
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:52,573
I am making this donation primarily out of love for God and the holy apostles.

287
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:57,791
Also, for the soul of my brother and dear lord, King Rodulf, the original giver of these items.

288
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:02,022
Additionally, for the memory of my lord, Prince Richard, and for Queen Willa.

289
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:05,922
This includes myself, my son King Rodulf, and my grandson, King Rodulf.

290
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,658
I also include my other sons, Hugo and Boson, and my grandson Louis.

291
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:13,009
This extends to our other relatives and those in our service.

292
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:18,557
For my father and mother, Lord Hugo the distinguished abbot, and our other relatives from both sides.

293
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:23,337
Finally, for those who will provide assistance or protection to the monks living there.

294
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:28,226
This is for the welfare of the entire religion and for all Catholics, living or deceased.

295
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:34,764
The monks residing there should maintain the way of life now being transferred to guide those who will come from Cluny.

296
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:44,542
This means they should not reduce this way of life in terms of food and clothing, abstinence, psalm singing, silence, hospitality, mutual love and subjection, and good obedience.

297
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:54,431
It's also stated in this testament that from this day forward, the monks gathered there should not fall under the control of us, our parents, royal power, or any earthly authority.

298
00:41:54,431 --> 00:42:06,132
No secular princes, no count, no bishop, and not even the pontiff of Rome should, by the Lord and in the Lord, with all his saints and the day of the fearful judgment, invade the property of these servants of God.

299
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:12,120
Nor should they disperse, diminish, offer it as a grant, or appoint any prelate over them against their will.

300
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,998
And to more effectively deter all reckless and dishonest individuals, I further emphasize this prohibition.

301
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:26,143
I implore you, holy apostles and glorious leaders of the earth, Peter and Paul, as well as you, the highest priest of the apostolic seat.

302
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:37,070
Through the canonical and apostolic authority you've received from God, please separate those who rob, invade, or take away these offerings from the fellowship of the holy Church of God and eternal life.

303
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,946
I gladly and willingly give these to the aforementioned servants of God.

304
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:52,197
Be the protectors and defenders of the mentioned place in Rome, of the servants of God residing there, and of all these resources, for the sake of the alms, mercy, and compassion of our most merciful Redeemer.

305
00:42:52,197 --> 00:43:12,761
If, by any chance, God forbid, and which I trust in God's mercy and the apostles' protection won't happen, anyone from near or distant relations, or from any position or authority, tries with any deceit to go against this testament, which I've established for the love of Almighty God and the reverence of the apostles Peter and Paul, let them first incur the wrath of Almighty God.

306
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:18,360
May the Lord remove their father from the land of the living and erase their name from the book of life.

307
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:33,541
Let their fate be with those who said to God, "Lord, leave us," and with Dathan and Abiram, whom the earth swallowed with an open mouth and hell consumed alive.
Let them face eternal damnation, becoming a companion of Judas, the betrayer of the Lord, and be held in eternal torment.

308
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:47,063
Although it may not seem apparent now that he will escape human judgment without punishment, he will endure the torments of future damnation in his own body, sharing a fate similar to Heliodorus and Antiochus.

309
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:56,094
One barely survived after being severely whipped, while the other died miserably, struck by divine will, with rotting limbs and swarming worms.

310
00:43:56,094 --> 00:44:02,093
Let him join the ranks of other sacrilegious people who dared to desecrate the Lord's treasury.

311
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:11,819
Unless he repents, he will have the chief guardian of all churches, along with Saint Paul, as an adversary, denying him access to the delightful paradise.

312
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,987
He could have had them as compassionate intercessors if he wished.

313
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:26,281
According to the worldly law, let him pay one hundred pounds of gold to those he has wronged, compelled by judicial authority, and let his efforts come to nothing.

314
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:34,049
But may the firmness of this will, supported by all authority, remain unviolated and unshaken, with a stipulation attached.

315
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:39,985
Signed by Adelaide, the royal countess mother and abbess who authorized and ordered this will.

326
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:03,794
Dated 14th June.

327
00:45:03,794 --> 00:45:13,835
I, Hildebrand, a priest, wrote and signed on behalf of the chancellor in the fifth year of the reign of the most glorious King Rudolf, in the second indiction.

328
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:16,298
Done publicly in the village of Boiaco.

329
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:17,625
Thus far, the decree.

330
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:39,602
From the Roman monastery, the book of priories in the Cluniac library contains this:
The priory of the Roman monastery, Romansmonstier, in the diocese of Lausanne, where there should be, including the prior, twenty-two monks, although there were more in ancient times, as recorded, and there should be celebrated there three masses with chant, etc.

331
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:45,536
Let's return to the region of Macon, where the abbey called Charlieu is located.

332
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:58,147
On December 26, in the year 932, Pope John XI granted this abbey to Odo from the Cluniac monastery, at the request of Hugh, the King or Duke of Burgundy, during the eleventh year of his pontificate, in the fifth indiction.

333
00:45:58,147 --> 00:46:04,169
Louis the Transmarine also confirmed this with letters that can be found in the Cluny library, column 276.

334
00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:09,224
King Boso had previously restored this abbey to the monks at the request of Count Sirald.

335
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:22,006
This is evident from a charter published by Guichenon in the history of Savoy, page 375, where the monastery of Charlieu is noted to be dedicated in honor of Saint Stephen, situated in the county of Macon on the Surnan River.

336
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:31,265
The diploma was issued on December 3, in the twelfth indiction, during the first year of Boso's reign at the Charlieu monastery, which corresponds to the year 879.

337
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:33,935
For more about Charlieu, refer to Aymard below.

338
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:40,525
Finally, besides other monasteries whose records we lack, Gallican monasteries were given to the Cluniacs under Odo.

339
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:52,397
Some Italian monasteries also came under Cluniac control at that time, namely Suppentonia, Adventino, and Saint Paul in Rome, as noted by John, and the one in Salerno, whose monks dedicated Odo's life to John.

340
00:46:52,397 --> 00:47:04,952
It's very likely that Saint Peter in Ticino was among them, since Odo, upon returning from Rome, left John-who was then a canon and later a monk-to be educated there, as he mentions about himself in book one, number four.

341
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:15,177
This is the monastery of Saint Peter in Coelo-aureo, later called Saint Augustine after the transfer of his body to that place, which we mentioned in part one of the third century.

342
00:47:15,177 --> 00:47:20,005
Authors have varied accounts about the origins of the church of Saint Paul near Rome.

343
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,982
Some attribute its founding to Pope Sylvester and Emperor Constantine.

344
00:47:23,982 --> 00:47:36,309
Leo Allatius supports this view in book one on the agreement of both churches, chapter six, number 26, where he states that the basilica of Saint Paul on the Ostian Way, originally facing east, was built by Sylvester.

345
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:43,580
However, Emperor Valentinian, under the direction of Pope Siricius, transformed it into the structure we see today, facing east.

346
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:55,289
Interestingly, Peter Damian credits Constantine as the founder of the Vatican Basilica of Saint Peter, and attributes the Ostian Basilica of Saint Paul to Theodosius the Elder and his son Honorius.

347
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,500
You can find this in the fourth work, fourth response of the royal defender.

348
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:07,090
Much later, Emperor Theodosius initiated the construction of the Basilica of Saint Paul; after his passing, his son Honorius finished it.

349
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:12,741
I found the same information in a very old manuscript from the Church of Noyon, written 800 years ago.

350
00:48:12,741 --> 00:48:26,536
It contains the Etymologies of Isidore, where it states: In the Basilica of Saint Paul the Apostle in Rome, where his sacred body is buried, Theodosius began, and Honorius completed the hall, dedicated to the Doctor of the World, Paul's sacred body.

351
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:32,574
This is also supported by Prudentius, a contemporary author, in his hymn 12 about the blessed Peter and Paul.

352
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:38,336
In another section, the title of Paul preserves the Ostian Way, where the earth is bordered on the left.

353
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:44,762
The place is of regal splendor: a good prince consecrated these towers and skillfully enhanced the surrounding area.

354
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:50,025
He installed gilded panels on the beams, so that all the light inside would glow like the dawn.

355
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:54,790
He also placed Parian columns under the gilded ceilings, arranged in a fourfold order.

356
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,502
Then he adorned the vaulted arches with magnificently varied glass.

357
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,939
Thus, the meadows gleam with spring flowers.

358
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:06,646
This is about the origin of the basilica: when it was granted to the monks needs further investigation.

359
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:14,291
John suggests it happened before Odo, in book one, number 27, where he mentions that five years before writing his life, Odo went to Rome.

360
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:23,211
He rebuilt the monastery within the church of the most blessed Apostle Paul (as it once was) at the urging of the lord pope and all the orders of the sacred see.

361
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:30,856
Thus, there had once been a seat of monks there, which Odo restored around the year 937 during his time in Rome, as we will explain later.

362
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:37,282
The same John mentions the monastery of Saint Paul and the monks in various parts, and also refers to Abbot Baldwin.

363
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:43,266
He also reports that Saint Odo, when in Rome, often stayed there, especially in book two, numbers 21 and 22.

364
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:47,726
There's no doubt about it, as John himself stayed there with Odo.

365
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:56,009
Yet, in a respected book about the life of Saint John, Abbot of Gorze, it mentions that Andrew, a monk, was sent to Rome at the request of Pope Agapetus.

366
00:49:56,009 --> 00:50:07,052
Agapetus had earnestly asked Lord Einold, the abbot of Gorze, to send some religious men to the monastery of Saint Paul, which he was trying to convert into a monastic order with the help of King Alberic.

367
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:12,791
Andrew went with another brother, who had come to Gorze from the monastery of Luxeuil a few years earlier.

368
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:18,150
After establishing monastic practices there, he was soon received by the Lord and was buried there.

369
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:23,401
Pope Agapetus began his papacy in the fourth year after Odo's death, in nine hundred forty-six A.

370
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:23,509
D.

371
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:32,983
So, how could it be that the monastery of Saint Paul, which had been imbued with monastic practices under Odo, was transferred again to the monastic order under Pope Agapetus?

372
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:39,533
This should be understood as a restoration of regular discipline, which is surprising to see had deteriorated so quickly.

373
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:44,514
It certainly declined during the reign of Otto the Second, or at least that was the pretext.

374
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:52,255
Otto, who intended to establish canons at Saint Paul's instead of disobedient monks, is mentioned by Rodulfus Glaber in Book One, Chapter Four.

375
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:59,780
Whatever the case, the monastery of Saint Paul in Ostia, although not entirely subject to Cluny, still often received superiors from there.

376
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:09,849
Peter Damian provides evidence of this in his thirty-third work, where he discusses Saint Maiolus, who appointed a prior at Saint Paul's, as we will mention in the acts of Saint Maiolus.

377
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:24,790
Finally, this is explicitly confirmed by Hugh of Cluny in a letter to Abbot Pontius with these words:
This monastery, namely Saint Paul's, was entrusted to your predecessor, Saint Odo, in subsequent years, where for some time the spirit of the Cluniac order shone through him.

378
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:39,152
With the city disrupted by rebellious unrest-a situation it often faces in unfortunate circumstances-the monks, burdened by these troubles, decided to leave, taking with them the sacred relics of the apostolic ashes, particularly those of Saint Paul.

379
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:41,181
They quickly made their way to Cluny.

380
00:51:41,181 --> 00:53:12,562
The abbot of the monastery of Saint Paul was Adam, whom Pope Victor the Third mentions in Book 2 of "The Miracles of Saint Benedict," chapter 25. John Baptist Marus raises a question about which congregation the monastery of Saint Paul was subject to at that time: Cluniac or Casinensian. This doubt arises because, according to Leo of Ostia in Book 1 of the "Chronicle of Monte Cassino," chapter 58, the abbey of Saint Paul was entrusted to Abbot Baldwin by Pope Marinus. Thus, Desiderius, or Pope Victor, who was also the abbot of Monte Cassino, refers to the monastery of Saint Paul as "our" monastery. However, he might have spoken in this manner considering the common order, as there was neither a Casinensian congregation nor a Cluniac congregation in the form it later took under Saint Hugh.
Odo prescribed a uniform way of living for all these and many other monasteries, similar to what was observed at Cluny, and he acted like a general abbot over them. This system, first instituted by Saint Pachomius in the East, was attempted in the West by Benedict of Aniane and was finally perfected by Odo. Because of this, some considered him the founder of the order of Saint Benedict in France, as he united many monasteries, which were previously partly destroyed and completely separated from each other, into one body.
From the time of Peter the Venerable, Odo has been called the supreme restorer of the monastic order in France, the principal reformer of the rule, and the first father of the Cluniac order. He endeavored to revive the fervor of the monastic purpose, which was nearly extinct and almost forgotten everywhere, as noted in Book 6, Letter 17.

381
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:19,123
Similarly, before him, Frodoard in his chronicle refers to Odo as a restorer of many monasteries and of the holy rule.

382
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:32,136
Glaber Rodulf states:
He was such a strong supporter of this institution that the most significant monasteries from the Beneventan province, as well as those in Italy and Gaul up to the Ocean Sea, were delighted to be under his authority.

383
00:53:32,136 --> 00:53:42,634
His fame and religious reputation were so renowned that not only noble laypeople and clerics, but even bishops, gave up their positions to join him; as noted by John in book three, number ten.

384
00:53:42,744 --> 00:53:53,829
Chapter Six - The Growth of the Cluny Abbey Under Odo
Odo not only greatly enhanced the religious practices of the Cluny institution but also significantly increased its wealth, which often follows closely.

385
00:53:53,829 --> 00:54:03,731
Firstly, King Rudolph of the Franks, at the request of his wife Imma, the sister of Hugh, granted lands to Cluny located in the Macon region, including three in Salornay, among others.

386
00:54:03,731 --> 00:54:13,955
This was given at the village of Boisseau on July first, in the tenth year of his reign, the third indiction, year four hundred and forty-four, which is the year nine hundred and thirty-one.

387
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:31,982
In the following year, Bishop Berno of Macon, encouraged by Archimbold, the prior of the Cluny monastery, and Hildebrand, while sitting in a council near the church of Saint Vincent in Macon to settle divine commands in the manner of the preceding Fathers, granted the tithes of the land of Salornay, which King Rudolph had given them.

388
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:42,960
In the same year, the tenth year of King Rudolph, Bishop Berno consecrated a chapel in the village of Salornay, which the small Cluny community, supported by Odo, their gentle father and abbot, had built.

389
00:54:42,960 --> 00:55:00,342
Two years later, Count Leotald of Macon and his wife Ermengarde gave to Abbot Odo whatever they owned in the village of Darbonnay in the Lyon region, by the river Saone, so that God might spare the souls of their parents Alberic and Escolana, Manasses and Irmingarde, as well as their friend Gerard, from the pains of hell.

390
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:04,378
After Leotald and Ermengarde, Count Gaufred and others signed the document.

391
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:15,732
This document is recorded with some errors in the library of Sebusiana on page one hundred and sixty-eight, and you can find more about Leotald on pages two hundred and thirty-six and two hundred and ninety-six.

392
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:24,342
In nine hundred and thirty-six, a piece of land in the village of Rufey, near Cluny in the Macon region, was given to Odo in May, when King Rudolph passed away.

393
00:55:24,342 --> 00:55:28,217
This was done in Cluny and confirmed publicly at the castle of Lournand.

394
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:39,517
In the second year of King Louis's reign, Abbot Odo and the monks of Cluny purchased a field below the castle of Lournand, commonly called Lourdon, which was later demolished by the order of Cardinal Richelieu.

395
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:51,360
In the same year that King Rodulf passed away, Count Gaufredus and his wife Ava donated Escozolas in the Aeduens region for the sake of their souls and for the soul of their lord William and his son Boson.

396
00:55:51,360 --> 00:56:02,719
They also gave Keitaelos in the Matiscens region, in the vicariate of Bufarias, for the salvation of their souls and that of Gauzbert, the brother of Gaufredus, during the fifth year of Louis from Overseas.

397
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:12,479
In the second year of Louis's reign, Bishop Maimboldus of the Matiscens reported that his predecessor Bernon had granted the Cluniacensians full control over all their churches.

398
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:20,750
However, after these churches were destroyed by pagan invasions and the wickedness of corrupt people, he reduced the synodal tribute they used to pay.

399
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:33,929
The canons signed, and among them, Abbot Ado, a leading figure, donated several items to the Cluniacensian monastery, including the churches of Saint Desiderius and Saint Julian in Siviac and Davagiac, in the twelfth year of Louis's reign.

400
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:45,564
Also, in the second year, Bishop Rotmund of the Aeduens donated the chapel of Saint Leodegar of Blanciac in the county of Matiscens, which his most holy predecessor Walo had granted to a certain priest for life.

401
00:56:45,564 --> 00:56:48,928
Witnesses to this were Hildebodus and Girbaldus, both abbots.

402
00:56:48,928 --> 00:56:54,607
In the third year of the same king, during the eleventh indiction, which corresponds to the year 938 A.

403
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:54,717
D.

404
00:56:54,717 --> 00:57:03,761
, a holding in the village of Madaliac in the Lugdunens region, in the Ternatens field, was given to the Cluniacensian monastery, under the leadership of Abbot Odo.

405
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:11,756
Additionally, a man named Airich gave Abbot Odo a field with a forest in the Lugdunens region, in the Tarnatens field, at the edge of Denadaliac.

406
00:57:11,756 --> 00:57:17,822
This place was undoubtedly Ternatum, where the Tarnatens monastery was situated, often confused with Agaunens.

407
00:57:17,822 --> 00:57:27,858
But this Ternatum was located by the Rhone, at the border of the Lugdunens and Viennens regions, commonly known as Ternay, where there is now a priory of the Order of Saint Benedict.

408
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:37,673
Also, in the third year of his reign, Louis from Overseas confirmed by charter the Cluniacensian properties in Quercet at Dociac, which is preserved in the Cluniacensian library.

409
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:47,603
These are some smaller donations I made, like when Hugo, the count, gave a maidservant from the villa Romanis in the Lugdunensis region to the Cluny monastery and Abbot Odo.

410
00:57:47,603 --> 00:57:50,513
This happened in the sixth year of King Louis's reign.

411
00:57:50,513 --> 00:57:53,423
After that year, donations were given to Abbot Aimard.

412
00:57:53,423 --> 00:57:56,710
All charters under Odo are numbered one hundred eighty-eight.

413
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:07,920
Moreover, from all these charters, and others that we will mention with Aimard, it's evident that Macon, along with its assigned region, was under the authority of the king of the Franks, not the Burgundians.

414
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:12,253
Chapter 6 - Odo's multiple journeys to Rome for the sake of the Church.

415
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:20,313
Odo's passionate dedication to divine matters didn't confine him within monasteries; instead, he ventured out to benefit the entire Church.

416
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:27,851
The Roman popes repeatedly summoned him to Italy to use his wisdom and authority in assisting the Church through its difficulties.

417
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:36,259
The reason for his first trip to Rome was this: After Emperor Berengar's death, Hugh, the son of Theobald, Count of Arles, took control of Italy.

418
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:48,726
Marozia, the infamous widow of Guido, Count of Tuscany, who, along with her son Alberic, had seized Pope John and taken control of Rome, invited Hugh through messengers to marry her and take up the rule of the city.

419
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:52,959
Hugh accepted the offer, and after marrying her, he took control of Rome.

420
00:58:52,959 --> 00:59:01,715
Meanwhile, during a feast, when Alberic, at his mother's urging, awkwardly offered water to wash Hugh's hands, Hugh hit him in the face to correct him.

421
00:59:01,715 --> 00:59:06,818
Offended by this, Alberic incited the Romans to revolt and forced Hugh to flee the city.

422
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:16,386
After Hugh fled, Alberic governed the city with his mother Marozia under consular power, restoring the old order of Rome along with the name and role of the consuls.

423
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:30,129
These events occurred around the year 929, during the pontificates of John the Tenth, Leo the Sixth, and Stephen the Seventh, followed by John the Eleventh in 931, who was Marozia's son from her affair with Sergius and Alberic's brother.

424
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:35,464
The holy Roman Church of God had to endure such challenges from Marozia and her son Alberic.

425
00:59:35,464 --> 00:59:49,380
In 933, messengers from the Church of Rheims returned from Rome reporting that Pope John, son of Maria, also known as Marozia, was detained by his brother Alberic, who also kept their mother Marozia confined and held Rome against King Hugh.

426
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,164
Shortly after, King Hugh of Italy besieged Rome.

427
00:59:52,164 --> 01:00:01,790
In the year 936, after Pope John, Alberic's brother, died, a servant of God named Leo was appointed pope in Rome, specifically Leo the Seventh, as Frodoard soon adds.

428
01:00:02,544 --> 01:00:05,030
King Hugh of Italy attempted to capture Rome.

429
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:14,424
However, after his army suffered from hunger and lost many horses, he eventually made peace with Alberic by offering his daughter in marriage, and he abandoned the siege.

430
01:00:14,424 --> 01:00:18,458
Now, let's determine the year Odo was first summoned to Rome by the pope.

431
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:30,228
Baronius suggests this happened in 936, the same year King Hugh gave his daughter, whom Liutprand, a deacon from Ticino and a writer of that era, calls Alda, in marriage to Alberic, thus ending his attack on Rome.

432
01:00:30,228 --> 01:00:41,943
Baronius is indeed correct:
while preparing for his journey to Rome, Odo visited Adhegrin and learned through a revelation of Saint Martin about the anointing of Louis the Transmarine, which also occurred in 936.

433
01:00:41,943 --> 01:00:44,319
Odo undertook this journey for two reasons.

434
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:58,576
First, to reconcile King Hugh with Prince Alberic, as Odo was highly favored by the king, which is evident from the three privileges Hugh obtained from the Roman popes for Odo's benefit-specifically from John the Eleventh, Leo the Sixth, and Leo the Seventh.

435
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:13,440
Second, to rebuild the monastery within the church of Saint Paul the Apostle, as it had been before, at the urging of the lord pope and all the orders of the Holy See, as mentioned in John, Book One, number 27, where it discusses the anointing of Louis the Transmarine.

436
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:19,850
Then, Odo corrected and annotated the life of Saint Martin in Rome at Saint Paul's, as noted in Book Two, number 22.

437
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:57,702
It's fitting to refer here to what John writes in Book Two, number 9:
"In the past, when King Hugh besieged the city of Rome due to enmity with the aforementioned Prince Alberic, he began to go back and forth, spreading messages of peace and harmony between them, so that he might calm the anger of the mentioned king and protect the city from such a siege."
Meanwhile, one day, as he was near the monastery of Saint Andrew the Apostle, located on the slope of Scaurus, a certain peasant wanted to kill him over a small flask of water.
Alberic wanted to punish the peasant with death, but Odo stopped him.
This shows the great reverence not only King Hugh but also Alberic had for Odo.

438
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:09,029
Another sign of Alberic's goodwill towards Odo was that he entrusted him with restoring the monastery of Saint Elias at Suppentonia, as noted by John in Book Three, Number Seven, Thirty-Eight.

439
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:13,767
Odo's second journey to Rome didn't occur in the year 938 but in the following year.

440
01:02:13,767 --> 01:03:49,879
John clearly states at the beginning of Book One with these words:
"In the year of the Lord's Incarnation 939, and in the sixtieth year of his life, in the thirtieth year of his monastic life, coming to Rome, he found me entangled in worldly ties, and mercifully caught me in his net, and led me to the monastery of Saint Peter in Ticino."
For a short time, detained there by Hugh, the aforementioned Lord Hildebrand entrusted me to be educated in the regular disciplines. Therefore, John was not Odo's companion on the first journey.
John adds:
"Not long after, coming to Rome, he graciously chose me as his companion, and when he returned, he brought back the one he had taken as a canon from his parents as a monk."
From this, we understand that John was a native of Rome and a canon there. This return to Rome happened while Pope Leo was still alive, thus in the year 939, or at least at the beginning of the next year, perhaps before Odo returned to France.
John confirms this timeline in Book Two, Number Seven:
"At the same time, we were sent to Italy by Pope Leo to serve as ambassadors of peace between Hugh, the king of the Lombards, and Alberic, the prince of the city of Rome."
This relates to what John mentions in Book One, Number Twenty-Two:
"Three years ago, while we were at Saint Paul's in Rome, etc."
John wrote this shortly after Odo's death, which occurred at the end of the year 942 and what he refers to in Book One, Number Sixteen.
Perhaps at that time, he made a pilgrimage to Mount Gargano, which is mentioned in Book Two, Number Fifteen.
Finally, in the year 942, Odo was called to Rome for the third time by Pope Stephen the Ninth to reconcile King Hugh with the same Alberic.

441
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:57,912
Frodoardus for this year:
Lord Odo, the abbot, was striving to make peace between King Hugh of Italy and Alberic, the Roman patrician.

442
01:03:57,912 --> 01:04:01,635
In his efforts for the church, the holy man aged and grew weak.

443
01:04:01,635 --> 01:04:07,900
In Rome, after falling ill, he received a reprieve from God so he could return to Tours at Saint Martin's.

444
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:20,903
As we will soon learn from John, if Odo did not return to France in the year 939, then Gerard, the bishop of Reggio, who accompanied him on the second journey, as mentioned in the book of Life, book two, number six, did.

445
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:51,579
Otherwise, it was during the third journey, as evidenced by these words that show John was with them:
"At that time, when we crossed the Cottian Alps with Gerard, bishop of the Church of Reggio, and came to Rome, etc."
However, those who place Odo's fourth journey to Rome before the last one might not be far from the truth. Indeed, the three journeys we just mentioned were undertaken for the church's sake. John notes another journey for the purpose of prayer in book number eighteen. But enough about these matters.

446
01:04:51,816 --> 01:04:55,608
Chapter Seven - Odo's Illness, Death, Burial, Relics, and Veneration.

447
01:04:55,608 --> 01:05:03,852
As the holy man sensed his end was near, he often reflected on his past mistakes, particularly those made against his abbot during his layman's years.

448
01:05:03,852 --> 01:06:37,234
He once spoke to John in Book Three, Section Six:
"Dearest son, listen to what I say to you.
I thank God because, for all the sins I have committed since my youth, I have already faced retribution in this life, except for those against my abbot.
I have always awaited that day and time, praying to God that they would not be reserved for me in the future."
This was just before his final pilgrimage to Rome in the year nine forty-two.
Before this journey, he seemed to have appointed Aimard as abbot in his place, as we will explore later in Aimard's eulogy.
During this period, struck by a severe and unrelenting fever, he longed for heavenly life but greatly desired to visit Saint Martin's tomb one last time, to end his days where he began his pious life.
Through the merits of his esteemed patron, whom he deeply revered, he was granted this wish from heaven.
He recovered, returned, and attended the celebration on November tenth as he wished.
However, on the fourth day within the octave, the fever returned and worsened until, finally, the blessed man, strengthened by divine nourishment and the viaticum, passed into heaven with Martin as his guide on November eighteenth.
John elaborates on this at the end of Book Three.
Nalgodus adds some unique details, noting that Odo gathered the brothers, organized the monasteries under his care, and entrusted Cluny to God.
He kept only his chapel, the sacred furnishings for the Mass, and returned everything else to Cluny.
These might be speculations of the author.
What is more certain is that he adds Odo was buried in Tours in the church of Saint Julian, which he himself had restored, funded by Archbishop Theotolon, as previously mentioned.

449
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:40,995
This style of speaking is common among authors and those like them.

450
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:45,627
But we should also pay attention to the Necrologist of the Monastery of Saint Julian.

451
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:59,360
After the most reverend man, Odo, had built many monasteries, corrected many things, and taught many to scorn the foolishness of the world, he wrote useful works for the Church and elegantly composed hymns and antiphons in praise of the blessed Martin.

452
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:13,203
Already an old man, weary with the burden of age, as if aware of his approaching end, he wished, once he laid down the burden of his body, to return to his own monastery at Tours to be buried near the body of his special patron, Lord Martin, if possible.

453
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:21,214
Meanwhile, as the feast of the blessed Martin approached, the venerable father proceeded to the morning ceremonies with his monks long before dawn.

454
01:07:21,214 --> 01:07:31,514
On the eighth day of his illness, sensing his final hour was near, with all the brothers standing around, he made sure he was fortified with the provision of the body and blood of the Lord.

455
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:40,615
Then he ordered himself to be carried to the Church of Saint Albin, which was nearby, and with pious lights and hands raised to heaven, he returned his soul to Christ.

456
01:07:40,615 --> 01:07:46,119
To this day, the oratory of Saint Albin remains within the cloisters of the aforementioned monastery.

457
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:55,220
He passed away on November 18th and was buried by the often-mentioned Bishop Theotolon in the crypt of Saint Julian, under the altar of that martyr, on the right side.

458
01:07:55,220 --> 01:08:09,062
These details come from the Martyrology of the place, renewed to the old form in the year 1469, in the month of July, during the time of Pope Paul the Second, King Louis the Eleventh, and Archbishop Elias, who are the figures of the reformed Martyrology.

459
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:14,403
Nalgodus marks the year of Odo's death as 945, which he counts as the 18th year of his ordination.

460
01:08:14,403 --> 01:08:18,327
However, the authority of Frodoard, a contemporary writer, is preferred.

461
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:37,074
He asserts that Odo died two years earlier with these words, found in the chronicle at the end of the year 942:
"Lord Odo, the venerable abbot, restorer of many monasteries and repairer of the holy rule, died at Tours and was buried at Saint Julian."
Nothing clearer can be presented both to determine the year of death and the place of burial.

462
01:08:37,728 --> 01:10:40,655
As noted, this year aligns with John's calculation, who states in Book 3, number 5, that he did not live with Odo for a full two years: "Unfortunate me," he laments, "that I did not deserve to serve him for even two complete years."
He actually joined him at the start of the year 940, as mentioned in the previous chapter.
This same year is also noted by Abbot Hugh of Flavigny in his chronicle: "In this year, Lord Odo the venerable, who restored many monasteries, after working tirelessly to mediate peace between Hugh, King of Italy, and Alberic, the Roman patrician, passed away at Tours."
However, this needs correction: he was buried at Saint Martin, which is also referenced on the edge of Frodoard's chronicle in the previously mentioned text.
It becomes clear from the same chronicle in the year 945 that this is an error, as Archbishop Teotilo of Tours is reported to have died and been buried in the monastery of Saint Julian, which the same holy man had dedicated near Lord Odo's tomb.
From that time onward, the temple is said to be illuminated by divine miracles.
Therefore, Hugh of Flavigny should be corrected, just as Peter of Equilinum, who asserts that Odo was buried at Cluny.
The anonymous writer cited by Chesnius in volume 3, page 341, is entirely accurate: "In the same year, specifically the reign of King Louis the Seventh, Lord Odo, a religious and wise abbot of many monasteries, learned and eloquent, rested in peace and was buried at Tours at Saint Julian."
The burial place is accurately recorded by the Chronicle of Malleacense, although it incorrectly lists the year of death as 938.
The Dolense Chronicle, noted by Labbe in volume 1 of the New Library, page 315, adds: "In the year 942, Saint Odo, the second abbot of Dol, died."
Thus, in the year 942, Odo passed away at the age of sixty-four, in the fifteenth year of his leadership at Cluny.
His remains were preserved in the Church of Saint Julian at least until the 15th century.

463
01:10:40,655 --> 01:10:49,988
The first evidence of this matter can be found in the letters of the society established between Cluny and the monastery of Saint Julian in October of the year 1117.

464
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:55,135
At that time, Lord Pontius, the abbot of Cluny, visited Tours at Saint Martin's for prayer.

465
01:10:55,135 --> 01:11:03,449
He turned to us-so say the monks of Saint Julian in the letters-out of love for our patron, the blessed Odo, and his own, with the utmost devotion.

466
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:09,388
On the eve of Saint Denis, he celebrated a mass for the most blessed Odo with both our monks and his own.

467
01:11:09,388 --> 01:11:15,440
Then, taking with him his prior, Bernard Crassus, and other brothers, he came to our Chapter, and so forth.

468
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:24,320
Long after that, in the year 1407, John, the Archbishop of Tours, invited by Robert, the abbot of Saint Julian, transferred the sacred relics into new cases.

469
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:33,313
This was done in the presence of Mary, Queen of France, her daughter Magdalene, John, Duke of Bourbon, James, Count of Marche, and other distinguished persons.

470
01:11:33,313 --> 01:11:48,867
Among these relics, in the fourth case, the body of Saint Odo the abbot was contained, as solemn letters concerning this matter testify, stating as follows:
John, by divine mercy, Archbishop of Tours, to all who will inspect these present letters, eternal health in the Lord.

471
01:11:48,867 --> 01:11:57,860
Whatever praise or honor we bestow on the saints of God, we offer the same, as the prophet bears witness, with the Lord commanding to praise him in his saints.

472
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:29,250
Therefore, with the passing of brother William, of good memory, once the abbot of the monastery of Saint Julian of Tours, of the Benedictine order, it was considered that although the church of the said monastery was adorned with the bodies, relics, and presence of many saints, by whose and other glorious saints' intercessions and prayers who rest in this our city, not only the monastery itself but the entire city flourished with successful outcomes, the bodies and relics were nevertheless less reverently stored, and due honor was not shown to them.

473
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:40,102
Driven by deep devotion, the abbot arranged during his lifetime to have five wooden boxes crafted, adorned with silver and gold on the inside, with the hope of placing relics and bodies in them.

474
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:44,900
However, as fate would have it, he passed away before he could complete this task himself.

475
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:52,950
His wishes were carried forward by the dedicated and devout brothers, including Robert, the current abbot, and the whole congregation of the monastery.

476
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:57,641
They earnestly asked us to place the prepared relics and bodies in the designated areas.

477
01:12:57,641 --> 01:13:37,625
We hereby announce that we, fully embracing the pious wishes of the late Brother William, the former abbot, and the esteemed current abbot and congregation, in honor of the glory and magnificence of Almighty God, on the date of this document, in the presence of the most Christian Lady Mary, the illustrious Queen of the Franks, and her renowned daughter Lady Madeleine, as well as the noble princes Lord John, Duke of Bourbon, and James, Count of March, along with many other barons, knights, and noble persons, and the venerable and wise men listed below, transferred and reinterred with our own hands the bodies and relics from the old sarcophagi into the new boxes, which we had previously consecrated and blessed according to the Church's rites.

478
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:56,817
We followed this order: in the first box near the dormitory of the monastery, the body of Saint Paul, Bishop of Leon; in the second box, the body of Saint Anthony, Abbot of the Monastery of Saint Julian of Tours; in the third and largest box, parts of the bodies of Saint Pantaleon and Saint Columba, along with many other relics whose names are unknown to us.

479
01:13:56,817 --> 01:14:02,681
In the fourth box, the body of Saint Odo, the first Abbot of Cluny, and then of the Monastery of Saint Julian.

480
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:05,986
In the fifth and final box, the body of Saint Laurence, Abbot.

481
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:14,655
After completing these translations, we secured the chests with silver and gold locks on the outside, and we fortified them with our blessing, trusting in divine mercy.

482
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:22,013
We have instructed the aforementioned religious followers and their successors to celebrate this day of translation festively every year from now on.

483
01:14:22,013 --> 01:14:25,864
We urge them to observe it with the appropriate and necessary divine services.

484
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:32,827
As proof and testimony of all the aforementioned, we have arranged for two copies of our letters to be made and signed by the notaries below.

485
01:14:32,827 --> 01:14:36,135
We have ordered them to be secured with the attachment of our seal.

486
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:44,777
One of these we have enclosed in the larger chest mentioned above, and the other we have granted to the aforementioned abbot and convent to be placed in the church's treasury.

487
01:14:45,024 --> 01:14:59,580
This was given at the aforementioned monastery on January 22, 1407, with the venerable fathers and brothers Guido of the Major Monastery near Tours, Robert of Saint Julian, and Peter of Cormery from our diocese, who were abbots of the order.

488
01:14:59,580 --> 01:16:01,853
Also present were the wise men Lords John Campidenarius, Doctor of Decrees, General Preceptor of Saint Anthony of Thuin in Germany, and orator for the Duke of Austria, William Le Picart, treasurer, John Preselli, archdeacon of Transliger, John Nuloti, archdeacon of Tours, Nicholas Perturelli, official, Victor Hugneti, William Joubert, canon of our church in Tours, along with James of Cormery, prior of the cloister and infirmary, John, almoner of the provost, Philip, chamberlain of the provost, John Charretier, sacristan, William Du Vieu, innkeeper, John Guibert, cantor, Guido Auger, sub-cantor, William Boutet of Bovo, and Michael Belloneau of Guerchia, James Auderon of Castro Regialdi, Peter Audebert of Saint Anthony, John Selion of Bueil, Robert Helonis of Ambillo, priors, William of Linaye, John Fafeu, Peter Joulain, deacon, Peter Sourdeau, John Lenfant, Aimerico de Mondanier, John of Fonte, John Budet, Andrew of France, and John of Turre, religious of the monastery of Saint Julian, with many others in attendance.

489
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:04,087
Thus signed by Thouar and the Master.

490
01:16:04,087 --> 01:16:13,147
Since then, there has been no mention of Saint Odo's relics in the records of the monastery of Saint Julian, even though his tibia bone is kept there.

491
01:16:13,147 --> 01:16:19,489
It's possible they were taken to the island of Jordan near Toulouse, where the canons claim to have them.

492
01:16:19,489 --> 01:16:31,569
This might have happened during the heretic uprisings when sacred relics in Tours were scattered by a profane fire, sparing neither the relics of Saint Martin, which had always been honored worldwide.

493
01:16:31,872 --> 01:16:40,175
It's noteworthy that the body of Saint Lauri, the abbot mentioned earlier, is documented, even though he isn't included in the Gallican Martyrology.

494
01:16:40,175 --> 01:16:48,760
His feast was recently celebrated at Saint Julian on October 1, but it has now been moved to the following day due to the double feast of Saint Remigius.

495
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:54,932
Our community at Fleury claims the body of Saint Paul, the Bishop of Leon, based on the authority of Aimoinus.

496
01:16:54,932 --> 01:17:02,899
He asserts that Bishop Mabbo transferred it to the monastery of Fleury, as stated in Book 2 of the Miracles of Saint Benedict, chapter 11, 45.

497
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:10,361
Let's return to Saint Odo, whose veneration was embraced by the Cluniacenses from the time of his death, specifically on November 19.

498
01:17:10,361 --> 01:17:14,850
This was due to the octave of Saint Martin coinciding with the day of his death.

499
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:20,629
For this reason, he is mentioned on that day in the Brivatense manuscript and some other martyrologies.

500
01:17:20,629 --> 01:17:31,009
In Ulric's Book 1 of the Customs of the Cluniacenses, chapter 11, where various annual celebrations are listed, the deposition of Saint Odo is among those celebrated in white vestments.

501
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:41,108
His honorable memory is found in the Roman, Benedictine, and Gallican Martyrologies, where he is mentioned three times: on November 20 and 19, and in the Supplement on November 18.

502
01:17:41,108 --> 01:17:47,392
At the island of Jordan near Toulouse, the veneration of the sacred body of Saint Odo, Abbot of Cluny, is noted.

503
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:53,676
His body was transferred from the church of Saint Julian of Tours, where he was first buried after passing away.

504
01:17:53,676 --> 01:18:04,000
Finally, Bernard, in his apology to Abbot William, and before him, Gregory the Seventh in the Roman council, recognized Odo as a saint, as did all the Cluniacensian abbots before them.

505
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:15,222
A sermon about Saint Odo is found among the additions to the Cluniacensian library, to be read on his feast day, which is essentially a sermon by Saint Maximus on Blessed Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli.

506
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:19,598
Lastly, Peter the Equilinian attests that Saint Odo lives on through miracles.

507
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:24,518
CHAPTER EIGHT - Odo's Writings and Wise Sayings about the Morals of His Age.

508
01:18:24,518 --> 01:18:28,653
Let's now focus on the works of Odo himself, setting aside those of others.

509
01:18:28,653 --> 01:18:33,615
Some of his writings were done as a canon, others as a monk, and still others as an abbot.

510
01:18:33,615 --> 01:20:35,018
As a canon, he summarized the "Morals" of Gregory the Great, as we mentioned earlier in Chapter Two, and composed hymns about Saint Martin and antiphons, drawing from John in Book One, number ten.
As a monk, he wrote three small books inspired by the prophecies of Jeremiah concerning the priesthood, which he dedicated to Turpion, Bishop of Limoges, as noted by John in Book One, number thirty-seven.
These books are sometimes referred to by the name of his duties, and the published versions are called "Collations."
Finally, as an abbot, he authored other works, specifically four books about the life of Saint Gerald, Count of Aurillac, dedicated to Aimoin, abbot of the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges, according to the local chronicle.
The Chronicle of Aurillac refers to him as Aimoin, Abbot of Tulle.
Perhaps he oversaw both places.
Abbot Odo also wrote a brief work about the return of the body of Saint Martin from Burgundy, at the request of Fulk the Good, Count of Anjou. He also penned a short text on why Martin is considered equal to the apostles, and various sermons, the fourth and last of which in the published collection addresses the burning of the Basilica of Saint Martin.
An anonymous chronicler praises his sermon about Saint Benedict, delivered during his translation to Fleury, as mentioned by Chesnius in Volume Three, page three hundred forty-one.
All these works are housed in the Cluniac library, along with hymns about the Holy Sacrament and Mary Magdalene.
In addition to the published works, he revised the life of Saint Martin in Rome at Saint Paul's, providing explanations with glosses, as John confirms in Book Two, number twenty-two.
The same author in Book Three, number eleven, mentions a book about the arrival of Saint Benedict in the region of Orleans, a book we lament has been lost.
A booklet about the life of Gregory of Tours, as published by Surius, is attributed to Abbot Odo in some manuscript copies.
This life is titled in the code of Saint Sergius of Anjou as follows: "Prologue to the Life of Saint Gregory. Of all the saints, etc."
And after the prologue, it begins: "Here begins the life of Saint Gregory, Bishop of Tours, written by Odo."

511
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:41,830
Gregory, from the Celtic region of Gaul, played a significant role in the city of Tours and the monastery of Saint Julian.

512
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:45,699
This is why I dedicate this book to Odo, who served as the abbot there.

513
01:20:45,699 --> 01:22:31,451
In a parchment manuscript from the Discalced Carmelites in Paris, originally belonging to the Abbey of Saint Julian of Tours, there's a lengthy metrical work titled "The Work of Lord Odo the Abbot Begins." It starts with these verses:
"Beloved brother, a holy love fills you, I rejoice; the thirst for justice is the honor of the heart, it is dignity. Your heart grieves to be flowing, and yet you wonder why from yours. Therefore, you wish for a poem, perhaps so this binds it, lest it flows."
The work consists of four books. The first covers the work of God, the second discusses the creation of man, the third deals with his fall and the corruption of human nature, and the fourth focuses on the Fathers of the Old Testament up to Christ the Restorer. The manuscript ends with "The Work of Lord Odo the Abbot Concludes." Many believe it was written by Saint Odo due to its origin from Saint Julian's monastery, where Odo was abbot, and its writing style, which suggests Odo's era. Furthermore, his conferences in the Silvanian Codex are titled "Works of Saint Odo," which fittingly discuss grace.
Baronius, or at least the compiler of the index of the annals in volume 10, credits Odo with the book about the life of Saint Maurus the Abbot, which is known to be authored by Odo, the Abbot of Fossatensis. Some chronicles are incorrectly attributed to him, which were actually authored by Thomas of Loches. Thomas titled short chronicles in Odo's name, as noted by the writer of the History of the Counts of Anjou, found in volume 10 of the Spicilegium, page 400.
Furthermore, Sigebert and others note that Odo was skilled in composing church music. In the book about writers, chapter 124, it's mentioned: "Odo the musician, a monk from the chief cantor of Tours and the first abbot of Cluny, had a talent for writing and delivering homilies, and especially for composing songs of the saints. The song about Saint Martin seems to be his."

514
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,910
In his writings, Odo, especially in his discussions, highlights certain observations worth noting.

515
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,240
He laments the decline of Christian morals in various places.

516
01:22:40,240 --> 01:24:12,610
In Book Two, Chapter Seventeen, he says:
"We express what we can, at least to show that we are troubled by the wickedness of the depraved.
Is it not rightly a cause for sorrow that Christianity, which ought to grow stronger as it progresses, is instead so far from its rightful state that its religion seems to have entirely failed?
For we all hasten and rush toward evil."
And in Book One, Chapter Forty-One:
"We must surely know that in our times almost everything has lost its order,
and many call the wasteful spending of their resources charity:
when things distributed lavishly for empty glory should rather be called feasting or waste, than charity."
Then in Book Two, Chapter Thirty-Seven:
"We should mourn the present time of life, in which everything is so confused that you see not even a trace of truth anywhere,
but observe everything filled with wickedness and indulgence, and nothing is preserved justly and rightly.
You see the humble, weak, and poorer people being oppressed, afflicted, and unjustly harmed by the proud, powerful, and wealthy:
while anyone honest and peaceful is disturbed by many injuries; on the contrary, each worst person is loaded with power, becomes terrifying, and grows in wickedness with arrogant success:
neither the fear of judges nor the reverence for sacred authority can prevail against them or restrain their destruction in any way.
But what do we say about judges?
For even those who were established to restrain these things inflict heavier and more destructive storms on the unfortunate.
This inequitable and unjust inequality is committed and practiced not only in cities but also in the countryside;
and not only on land but also at sea."

517
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:19,295
Among all the evils, the worst is that the habit of sinning has become so strong that almost no one can judge what is sinful.

518
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:26,606
Just like Aaron didn't resist the Israelites when they asked for gods, today, it seems everyone is either wicked or gives in to wickedness.

519
01:24:26,606 --> 01:24:31,182
Read also what follows at the end of this chapter and Book Three, Chapter Twenty-Eight.

520
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:36,653
He criticizes three main vices of his time: violence, which pertains to the aggressive; pride, and lust.

521
01:24:36,653 --> 01:24:40,072
These vices are discussed in depth in the first and second books.

522
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:49,277
He adds a fourth in Book Two, Chapter Twenty-Eight: It is truly sorrowful that people seem to turn away from Christ due to these three vices or others too shameful to mention.

523
01:24:49,277 --> 01:24:54,694
But it is far more distressing that they recklessly take part in the sacred mystery of the Lord's body.

524
01:24:54,694 --> 01:25:05,214
This is the greatest blessing among all the gifts given to humans; it is what God, with the greatest love, has granted to mortals, for the salvation of the world is entirely contained in this mystery.

525
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:10,422
And certainly, when it is treated unworthily, divine majesty is most grievously offended every day.

526
01:25:10,422 --> 01:25:59,550
Therefore, we should mourn and lament over this, so that if we cannot correct it, we at least demonstrate our grief by speaking out, lest the voice of Christ reproach us, saying: "I looked for someone to grieve with me, but there was none."
This mystery was not celebrated as frequently at the beginning of the Church as it is now; however, the less frequent it was, the more devoutly it was conducted.
This is what the very pious man says, who recounts two notable events, the first being about the relics of Saint Walburga, renowned for miracles:
When her relics were placed on the altar, the miracles ceased.
As the pilgrims were amazed, the virgin appeared to one of the sick and said, "You are not healed because my relics are on the Lord's altar, where only the majesty of the divine mystery should be celebrated."
When he reported this to the custodians, they removed the relics, and miracles immediately began to happen again.

527
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:08,115
Odo adds that, due to the reverence for this mystery, even the saints do not wish their relics to be brought closer; so what should be thought about impurities?

528
01:26:08,115 --> 01:26:11,301
Another event involves a thief who was killed during his crime.

529
01:26:11,301 --> 01:26:15,548
When his body was taken to the church, the priest started to celebrate mass for him.

530
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:23,842
As he reached the words of the Lord's consecration, a terrifying noise filled the church, and the altar split all the way to its foundation, which is still evident.

531
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:29,809
The priest, struck with great fear along with everyone else, fled and stopped offering the sacrifice for the apostate.

532
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:35,220
This was said against those, commented the holy man, who promise to pray for the wicked for their own gain.

533
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:48,672
Odo seems to have noted this to challenge those who, perhaps misled by a misunderstood testimony of Augustine, claimed that the sacrifice of the mass benefits the condemned, either to free them from punishments completely or to make their condemnation more bearable.

534
01:26:48,672 --> 01:27:05,511
This opinion is recorded by Adrevald in the book on the miracles of Saint Benedict, chapter twenty-one, where he says the people of Fleury prayed to the Lord for the souls of robbers slain in battle: so that if they did not deserve release from eternal torments, they might at least be punished with lesser pains by the strict Judge.

535
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:39,798
In the very old Gellonensian codex, there is a mass for a soul in doubt, which includes this prayer: Almighty and merciful God, who has the power to kill and to bring to life again, to lead down to the underworld and to bring back, and who calls things that are not as though they were, whose power is full in heaven and on earth, in the sea and in the underworld: we humbly and tremblingly beseech you for the soul of your servant, whom you have taken from this present world without the opportunity for repentance, that if perhaps due to the severity of his crimes he does not deserve to rise to glory, through these sacred offerings the torments may at least become bearable.

536
01:27:39,798 --> 01:27:49,608
These and other things are from the tenth volume of the Fragments of our Claudius Stephanius, in the Appendices concerning Saint Pachomius, found in the third volume of May with the Bollandists.

537
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:58,416
There are 336 references indicating that prayers for the condemned are forbidden, though it's believed that this punishment might somehow aid their relief.

538
01:27:58,416 --> 01:28:06,392
When the body of a deceased monk was being carried out in the absence of Pachomius, he encountered the procession and stopped the singing of psalms.

539
01:28:06,392 --> 01:28:31,882
To the parents of the deceased, he said:
"If you wish to honor the dead with psalms, more severe and numerous torments will befall him. Therefore, I ask you, if you want to ease the deceased's sufferings, bury him without psalms. For God, being good and merciful, might offer him some rest for this dishonor done to him and bring him back to the life given from above."
Papebrochius left out these last words (even though they are found in Greek) to avoid offending anyone.

540
01:28:31,882 --> 01:28:37,864
A similar belief led to the story of Trajan, which can be seen in Hepidan's acts of Saint Wiborada the recluse.

541
01:28:37,864 --> 01:28:46,540
Even if we exclude this final part, it remains that some people believed, or were mistaken, that the eternal punishments of the damned could somehow be lessened.

542
01:28:46,540 --> 01:29:04,593
Regardless of what one thinks of that opinion, which is rejected by today's common theological consensus, it is certain that the audacity of those who indiscriminately perform holy Mass sacrifices for anyone who died even in the act of a grave crime was rightly condemned by the Second Council of Valentia in Canon 12 against duelists.

543
01:29:04,593 --> 01:29:23,508
Augustine also established this in "The City of God," Book 21, Chapter 24. The same reasoning applies to why we do not pray for people suffering eternal punishment, just as we do not pray now or then for evil angels. Similarly, although we pray for living people, even those who are evil, we do not pray for faithless and impious deceased individuals.

544
01:29:23,832 --> 01:29:29,336
However, in explaining their opinion, they extend God's mercies even to the torments of the wicked.

545
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:38,177
They suggest that the wicked endure punishments that are milder and lighter than they deserve, not by human judgment, but through the reasoning of God's mercy.

546
01:29:38,177 --> 01:29:47,963
The same holy doctor, in Enchiridion, Chapter 110, does not believe that sacrifices benefit those condemned to eternal punishment, but rather those facing temporary punishment.

547
01:29:47,963 --> 01:29:54,413
There is a way of living that is not so good as to need no remedy, nor so bad as to not benefit from it after death.

548
01:29:54,413 --> 01:29:56,137
Let's return to the main point.

549
01:29:56,137 --> 01:30:05,590
Odo also offers suitable advice to the monks and provides fitting criticism, especially against those who own property, eat meat, or violate the religious habit and rule.

550
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:10,316
He calls them apostates, citing Gregory's testimony from the ninth homily on Ezekiel.

551
01:30:10,316 --> 01:30:21,548
Just as an apostate is one who abandons faith in God, so too is someone who returns to wicked deeds after professing religion considered an apostate by Almighty God, even if they seem to hold the faith.

552
01:30:21,548 --> 01:30:37,117
Odo adds, is it not apostasy to disregard the traditions of the Fathers in clothing or diet, when God has forbidden transgressing the boundaries set by the Fathers, desiring extravagant feasts with the children of Israel despite the food guidelines prescribed by blessed Benedict?

553
01:30:37,117 --> 01:30:40,953
Is it not apostasy to scorn humble clothing and seek ornate garments?

554
01:30:40,953 --> 01:30:49,516
And is it not apostasy to worship the belly, when Paul, with tears, declares that gluttons are enemies of the holy cross, considering the belly their god?

555
01:30:49,516 --> 01:30:59,414
I say these charges of apostasy apply to us, as those among us in this age who are wanton and unruly have dared to change the religious habit that has been upheld for many years.

556
01:30:59,414 --> 01:31:01,193
This is from Book 3, Chapter 17.

557
01:31:01,193 --> 01:31:04,029
See Book 2, Chapter 7, and also Book 3, Chapter 22.

558
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:11,272
Furthermore, he criticizes the proprietors who use their own funds to create extravagant equipment for performing the mysteries.

559
01:31:11,272 --> 01:31:16,265
They acquire these against the tradition and sanction of the holy Fathers, using dishonest wealth.

560
01:31:16,265 --> 01:31:23,703
It's as if they believe they're leaving it for the Church's adornment, confidently holding onto it, as mentioned in book two, chapter thirty-four.

561
01:31:23,703 --> 01:31:38,579
In addressing the objections of the proprietors in chapter thirty-six, he states, If, due to the negligence of the superiors alone, and not more because of their own greed, they had their own possessions, they would not presume to have other foods or clothes than those regularly established.

562
01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:54,372
These words clearly demonstrate the holy man's dedication to the Christian and monastic cause:
I wish these rebukes did not apply to our time as well, where, speaking of some monks, there is so little religion invested in the regular practices that the holy Fathers established and observed with such devotion.

563
01:31:54,576 --> 01:31:57,060
CHAPTER IX. ---Some Notable Disciples of Odo.

564
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:04,568
To fully understand Odo's legacy, it's important to learn about his disciples, as their reputations significantly impact their master's.

565
01:32:04,568 --> 01:32:12,795
The challenge is that old records about them are scarce; and although John does mention some of Odo's disciples, he mostly only recorded their names.

566
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:24,444
Among those worth noting are Arnulf and Landric, from whom John reports having received much information about Odo in his preface:
he refers to one as his teacher and master, and the other as his fellow brother.

567
01:32:24,444 --> 01:32:33,333
Following them is Lord Hildebrannus or Hildebrand, described as a truthful man, and the prior of the Cluny monastery, who instructed Odo in monastic disciplines.

568
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:40,841
He is praised in several documents created by Abbot Odo and is signed as chancellor in the preamble of the diploma of Countess Adelaide.

569
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:48,129
He served as the prior of Cluny in the seventeenth year of Louis of Overseas, according to the hundredth charter under Abbot Aimard.

570
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:54,588
Another prior of Cluny with the same name existed in the eleventh century, who later became Pope Gregory the Seventh.

571
01:32:54,588 --> 01:33:14,408
In addition, John in the second book names Peter the priest, Baldwin the abbot of Monte Cassino and Saint Paul's, his brother Firmus, Lord Gothefred, and two venerable men from the same congregation, one named Archembald, well-known to John himself, and the other, unknown, called Adalasius, men of great repute, who have now become the fathers of many monks.

572
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:30,419
Archembald, the prior of the Cluny monastery, is praised in the charter of Berno, bishop of Macon, dated the tenth year of King Rudolf;
he seems to be the one who succeeded Odo in leading the Floriac monastery, as Aimon writes in Book One of the Miracles of Saint Benedict, number thirteen.

573
01:33:30,419 --> 01:33:37,376
Wlfald, his successor, is mentioned by John in the third book, to be praised elsewhere by us in the acts of Saint Abbo, abbot.

574
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:45,215
Aligern can also be counted among them, rising from prior of Saint Paul to abbot of Monte Cassino, mentioned here in the year nine eighty-six.

575
01:33:45,768 --> 01:33:56,189
Adalasius, soon mentioned by John, is undoubtedly Adacius, who was entrusted with leading the monasteries of Sarlat and Tulle under the co-abbotship of Odo, as we noted earlier in chapter five.

576
01:33:56,189 --> 01:34:08,879
I believe that Bernard, the count, with the agreement of his blessed wife and the support of his sons William, Gausbert, Arnold, and Bernard, granted the monastery of Saint Suris, known as Geridia, along with all its abbey, to Adacius.

577
01:34:08,879 --> 01:34:18,707
This was intended for the monks wishing to live there regularly under his authority, allowing them to hold and possess both the monastery and the entire abbey without any opposition.

578
01:34:18,707 --> 01:34:30,371
After Abbot Adacius's death, they were to select an abbot for themselves according to the rule of Saint Benedict, ensuring the monks would be subject to the king for the safety of the place, but without any payments.

579
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:39,281
Everyone involved was solemnly urged to carry out this act by all that is sacred and by the merit of the blessed Suris, whose body rests in the aforementioned place.

580
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:47,435
This charter, however, lacks chronological notes in the register of the monastery of the rule among the Nine Peoples, as extracted by our Stephanotius.

581
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:53,159
Among all these disciples of Odo, John also includes Adolf, Theodard, and Eliziard, a monk from the count.

582
01:34:53,159 --> 01:35:00,989
Perhaps from the disciples of Berno was Aribert, about whom Odo himself shares details in book two of the life of Saint Gerald, chapter nineteen.

583
01:35:00,989 --> 01:35:07,685
On one occasion, when he was traveling to Rome, he took with him a monk named Aribert, a man known for his great abstinence.

584
01:35:07,685 --> 01:35:12,059
There came a time when there was no meal for the abstinent man to eat with bread.

585
01:35:12,059 --> 01:35:15,893
The elder diligently asked if the servants had prepared his usual food.

586
01:35:15,893 --> 01:35:28,637
When they replied that there was nothing besides bread, he was troubled, saying: "Oh, what has happened to us today! We all have a full meal, and this servant of God will be in deprivation."
However, it was a day exempt from abstinence.

587
01:35:29,231 --> 01:35:33,720
It was time to wash hands, and Samuel, eager to help, ran to get some water.

588
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:40,867
By chance, he spotted a small fish lying on the shore, still flapping, which had leapt out of the water while he watched.

589
01:35:40,867 --> 01:35:42,403
Gerald gave thanks to God.

590
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:51,440
As they sat at the table, the abstinent man ate part of the prepared fish, while Gerald ate the rest, sharing pieces as a blessing with everyone present.

591
01:35:51,440 --> 01:36:04,611
By the way, it's interesting to note that the term "pulmentarium" also refers to a dish made from fish.
That's enough about Aribert and the praise of Odo; now let's first hear about his life from John, and then from Nalgod.
