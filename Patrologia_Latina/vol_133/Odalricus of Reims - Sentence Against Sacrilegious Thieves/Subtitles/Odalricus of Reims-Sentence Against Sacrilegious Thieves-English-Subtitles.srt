Historical Notice on Odalric. (From Gallia Christiana Volume Nine Page Fifty-Six)

2
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:11,694
Odalric, also known as Udelric or Ulric, was the son of Count Hugh and Eva from Lorraine.

3
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:18,551
His parents were descendants of the holy Arnulf of Metz, known for their noble lineage, character, and piety.

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:35,849
After overseeing the provostship of the Church of Reims, according to Colvenerius, he was elected with the support of King Lothair in 962 and was consecrated the same year by bishops Guy of Soissons, Roricon of Laon, Gibuin of Chalons, Hadulf of Noyon, and Wigfrid of Verdun.

5
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:41,762
He received the pallium, as was the tradition of his predecessors, from Pope John the Twelfth.

6
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:52,645
Not long after, due to his noble heritage and the privilege of his rank, he became the chief chancellor of the realm under King Lothair, serving in this role in 963 and 968.

7
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:59,879
Flodoard noted in his Chronicle in 965 how diligent and wise Odalric was in defending the properties of his Church.

8
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:13,592
When a dispute arose over the episcopal see of Reims, severe conflicts erupted between the King of France and Herbert's family, leading to widespread devastation across the province from plundering, fires, and looting.

9
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:21,959
Some nobles, who appeared to protect the church-owned villages in the king's name, gradually claimed them as if they were hereditary.

10
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,293
Among them was Count Theobald, whom Odalric summoned.

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:34,665
When Theobald refused, he was excommunicated in 964 for wrongfully taking and stubbornly holding Codiciac Castle and other estates of Saint Remigius.

12
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:39,949
Coming to a better state of mind, Theobald returned what he had wrongfully acquired.

13
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:48,693
As a result, the bishop not only absolved him but also granted the mentioned castle to his son Odo, who had placed his trust in the bishop.

14
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:53,977
Inspired by this example, Count Herbert willingly returned the village of Sparnacum.

15
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:59,324
However, Ragenold was obstinate and was excommunicated for unjustly holding villages.

16
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:06,055
He even aggressively invaded certain places of the same episcopal see, plundering and setting them on fire.

17
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:11,699
In the year 965, Odalric attended a council of bishops held in Cologne.

18
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,401
At this council, the foundation of the church of Saint Martin in Liege was confirmed.

19
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:25,922
The generous bishop is praised for donating the village of Vindenissa, located in the county of Rethel, to his church in Reims.

20
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:30,417
Additionally, he reclaimed the valley of Rodigionis for his church.

21
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:39,004
This valley had been previously gifted by Hugh, the son of Count Roger, but was later seized by his descendants in the year 967.

22
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:53,496
However, it should be mentioned that, due to the murder of a relative of his, disgracefully killed in the borough of Saint Remigius, he burned down the entire borough and everything near the castle of Saint Remigius.

23
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:57,521
He devastated it and afterward allowed no one to live there.

24
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:09,194
According to an addendum to Flodoard, he died after seven years of governance, in the year 969, and was the first archbishop of Reims to be buried in the metropolitan church.

25
00:03:09,194 --> 00:04:08,703
The Reims Necrology briefly mentions him with these words: "Odalric or Odalric, archbishop, died on November 6, who gave us Vindemissa; for whose soul, 24 coins with as many loaves of bread and wine are given to the poor; six poor clerics are fed in the refectory."
Under his leadership, on March 28, 966, the renowned Flodoard, born in Epernay on the Marne, first a priest and canon of Reims, then a parish priest of Cormicy, and, as some say, a monk and abbot of an uncertain monastery in the diocese of Reims, died in his seventy-third year.
For more about him, consult the abbots of Saint Basolus, the bishops of Noyon in Fulcherius, the Acts of the Saints of the Order of Saint Benedict, volume 7, page 325 and following, the Annals of the same order, volume 3, pages 397, 511, and 512, and the Literary History of France, volume 6, page 313; to which nothing new needs to be added.

26
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:19,608
Sentence Against Sacrilegious Thieves by Odalric, Archbishop of Reims (Acts of the Province of Reims, Volume One, Page Six Hundred Twenty-One)

27
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:27,648
Odalric, the Archbishop of Reims, along with Rodulf, the archdeacon, and all the clergy of the Church of Reims, address all the children of the Church.

28
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:34,784
Some wicked and vile people have entered the temple of God with criminal intent, where they should be praying and seeking God's mercy.

29
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:39,257
Instead, driven by a diabolical impulse, they fearlessly pursue theft and sacrilege.

30
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:49,534
Among them, some individuals, whose identities remain unknown, entered the basilica of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and did not hesitate to steal the cloth from the altar of the holy cross.

31
00:04:49,534 --> 00:04:55,445
Additionally, other items were recently taken, like the linens from the bed of Frederick, the church custodian.

32
00:04:55,445 --> 00:05:02,421
From the chapel of Saint Peter within the cloister, a priestly garment was stolen this year, and a missal book was taken last year.

33
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:12,006
We excommunicate and anathematize the perpetrators and sacrilegious thieves of all these things by the power and authority of Almighty God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

34
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:25,478
By the power of the holy cross, the virginity of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and the authority of Saint Peter, the prince of the apostles, and all the saints, they are excommunicated and separated from participation in the body and blood of Christ.

35
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:34,637
They are barred from entering the church and any fellowship with Christians until they come to repentance and make amends, or return what they have stolen from this church.
