      "original_latin": "Virgilio deditus terretur. 12. His praeterea diebus nauta noster peritissimus,\nqui nos suo ductu docuit transmeare gurgites istius\nmundi, immensum Prisciani transiit transnatando\npelagus. Nam Virgilii cum voluisset legere carmina,\nostensum fuit ei per visum vas quoddam, deforis\nquidem pulcherrimum, intus vero plenum serpentibus,\na quibus se subito circumvallari conspicit, nec\ntamen morderi, et evigilans serpentes doctrinam\npoetarum, vas in quo latitabant, librum Virgilii;\nviam vero per quam incedebat valde sitiens, Christum\nintellexit.",
