Libet interea patris nostri Odonis paulisper\nseorsum ponere vitam, ut in exponendo ejusdem\nloci consuetudines parum mihi aliquid liceat immorari,\nquatenus sequens lectio possit esse lucidior. Mos enim ejusdem loci fuerat, ut magister scholae\nsolus cum solo puero nec quoquam iret saltem, nec\nad naturae digestionem, sed nec solus puer secretius\nilli loqui praesumeret: sed et propter bonum testimonium\nalium e pueris, aut unum ex fratribus in\ncomitatu, vel locutione semper assumeret. Si autem\nnox foret, et casu accidente secessum puer peteret,\nsine lucernae lumine et alio fratre extra dormitorium\npedem non auderet protendere. Tempore vero refectionis\nnunquam deerat lectio utrisque mensis:\n micas vero quae ex sectione panum fiebant, unusquisque\nante se diligenter recolligens, priusquam\nlectio finiretur, cum gratiarum actione sumebant. Finita itaque lectione, nec eas, nec cibum alium\nsumere ultra aliquis audebat. Has autem micas\nsacratiores aliis cibis esse fatebantur. Tale namque\nferebant miraculum ex eis claruisse in eisdem\nannis. 31. Frater quidam in eodem monasterio fuit\nvalde idoneus, et omnibus charus. Qui ad mortem\nusque perveniens, circumstantibus fratribus qui ejus\nvenerant orando commendare Domino spiritum, subito\nemissa voce clamavit dicens: Adjuvate, obsecro,\ndomini, propter Deum; modo, inquit, sum raptus ad\njudicium, ibique protuli accusator humani generis\ndiabolus contra me ad testimonium de micis panum\n plenum sacculum, quas comedere secundum consuetudinem\nnolui, et de mensa ceciderunt. Atque post\npusillum iterum terribiliter clamare coepit et dicere:\nEcce de quo dixi vobis adest diabolus, deferens praedictum\nsacculum. Nam cum territi fratres mirarentur,\nadjecit rursum: Illo in loco adest, an non videtis\neum? Deinde signo crucis totum se munivit, et\ninter verba orationis spiritum reddidit.
