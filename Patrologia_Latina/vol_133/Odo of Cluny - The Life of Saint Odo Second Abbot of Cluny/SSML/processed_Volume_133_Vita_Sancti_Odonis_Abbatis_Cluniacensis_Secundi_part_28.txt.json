      "original_latin": "Odo abbas electus invite. 38. Per illud videlicet tempus exitiali languore\ncoepit decumbere pater Bernus. Mox vicinos episcopos\naccersivit, et ab omni ordine se deposuit:\ninsuper et flebili voce se reum indignumque tali\n ministerio proclamabat praefuisse. Rogabat inter\nhaec verba fratres, ut sibi quem vellent, patrem\neligerent. Tunc manibus fratrum pater noster captus,\net quasi violenter constrictus, ac proclamantibus\nomnibus ut ordinaretur, coram abbate suo vi\nest ductus. Et cum nec sic vellet cedere, et locum\npastoris subire; superatus est tandem episcoporum\nexcommunicatione. Ordinatus itaque ille, intra\nmodicum tempus pater Bernus migravit ad Dominum.",
