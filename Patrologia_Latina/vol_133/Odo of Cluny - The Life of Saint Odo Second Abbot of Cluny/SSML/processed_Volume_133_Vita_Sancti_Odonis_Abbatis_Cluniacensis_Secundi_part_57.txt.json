      "original_latin": "Esca carnium et proprietas vix rescissa. Episcoporum\nconcursus ad Odonem. 9. His praeterea diebus coepit eis suadere, ut ab\nesu carnium recederent, parceque viverent, nihilque\nproprium possiderent: id ipsum quod occulte habebant\napostolorum more coram omnibus renuntiarent. Sed quia res monasterii nequaquam in commune\npossederant, sed pro posse et libitu suo eas inter se\ndiviserant, cum viderent sibi ultra jam non licere\n quod licuerat, maluerunt potius suis fautoribus,\nimo profligatoribus injuste possessas inique condonare,\nquam jure regulariterque abrenuntiare. Nam\nsolo prodictu id ipsum quod abrenuntiaverant moliebantur\nmandendo consumere cum caeteris quae\npater noster secum tulerat, ut consumpta omnia\nsaltem invitis eis carnem concederet. Qua de re indesinenter\nexpetebant pisces. Econtra pius pater\ncuncta illis impendebat competenter, ut ab uno eos\ncohiberet. Sicque factum est, ut ille largiendo, ipsique\nmandendo pene omnia consumerentur. Instabat\nnimirum pater noster fide intrepidus, spe securus,\ncharitate munitus, sciens se secundum illud evangelicum\nnequaquam deseri promissum. Nolite solliciti\nesse quid manducetis, aut quid bibatis, aut quo operiamini\n(Luc XII 22). Interea dum haec agerentur,\ncuidam fratri sanctus Benedictus adest in visione,\neique inter caetera imperat patri nostro dicere, ut\npro pecuniae defectu minime trepidaret; sed nec pro\n adipiscendis rebus sollicitus esset, ait, et post haec\nadjecit: Crastina die mittam et centum solidos, et\nsequenti hebdomada ei tanta accommodabo diversarum\nrerum solatia, ut multis temporibus sufficere\nqueant usibus fratrum; quod et factum est. 10. Praeterea coepere quamplurimi ex circumfluis\nregionibus ad vestigia beati viri concurrere, ejusque\nmagisterio placitae obedientiae viam arripere, quo\npostmodum mererentur polorum scandere sedes.",
