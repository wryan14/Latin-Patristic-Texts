      "original_latin": "Anno 19 aetatis clericus. 11. Igitur vir beatissimus Odo nono decimo aetatis\nsuae anno confugiens apud beatum Martinum, clericatus\nsuscepit officium. Quaenam ibi confluxerit\nturba magnatorum, et quanto cum apparatu ne sequenti\npaupertati, qua postmodum contentus fuit,\ninjuriam facere videar, malo silere, quam promere. Inter hos vero adfuit comes Fulco, qui eum nutrierat:\ncui mox cellam juxta beati Martini tribuit\necclesiam, et quotidianum victum ex eadem canonica\nacquisivit, eique concessit. Sed paupertatis amator\nvir beatissimus, contempta mundi gloria, soli Deo\nplacere curabat. Diebus itaque continuatis lectioni\n insudabat, et noctibus orationi vacabat, sciens esse\nscriptum: Qui ignorat, ignorabitur (I Cor XIV).",
