00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,944
The Life of Saint Odo
by Osbern, Monk of Canterbury

2
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:08,928
Preliminary Observations.

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:17,719
While the author of this Life might seem ancient due to the manuscript, the Thuano-Colbertinus codex, from which we transcribed this Life, does not name or date him.

4
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,089
I believe the author to be Osbern, a monk of Canterbury under Archbishop Lanfranc.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:26,405
Pits notes that Osbern wrote a book on the Life of Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury.

6
00:00:26,405 --> 00:01:52,832
It's unclear whether William of Malmesbury referred to this booklet when he composed the eulogy of Odo in Book One of the "Deeds of the Bishops of the English."
The reason for doubt is that William does not fully agree with Osbern-if we may call him that for now-on some points, although these are of lesser importance.
Osbern claims that Odo, hesitant to be elected to the See of Canterbury, only agreed after sending legates to Fleury to summon the abbot, because he had begun his monastic life there.
William, however, states that Odo, after crossing the sea, received the monastic habit at Fleury.
Gervase of Canterbury supports Osbern, while Bromton agrees with William.
Osbern also mentions that after Odo's death, he appeared to the church's guardian to rebuke Elfsin, who had been placed in the Canterbury chair through simony.
William attributes this apparition to Elfsin himself.
Moreover, William mentions events like the translation of Saint Wilfrid by Odo, and several other things about which Osbern remains silent.
Both agree that, after the death of Wulfhelm, the bishop of the Cantuarians, when the king and the people's wishes converged on Odo, he resisted more firmly, as he had not yet taken monastic vows and did not want to disrupt the elders' customs out of ambition.
Until that time, according to William, no one had been archbishop without wearing monastic garb, a point which Osbern also notes in different words.
However, Godwin, a dissenter, calls this an error and asserts that it is certain that Nothelm and several other secular priests had presided over the Church of Canterbury before Odo.

7
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:59,506
Godwin can't learn this truth with any more certainty than Odo himself or William, who were closer to those early times.

8
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,406
It's unclear if Nothelm was a monk.

9
00:02:01,406 --> 00:03:28,859
Bede, in the preface to the "History of the English," only refers to Nothelm as a devout priest of the Church of London. However, monks often used this term for priests, and Bede even calls him "our venerable brother Nothelm the priest" in a letter. This suggests he was more likely a monk than a secular priest.
Odo embraced the monastic life and professed it in the year 937, when the monastery of Fleury was being reformed to stricter rules through the efforts of Odo, the abbot of Cluny. Thus, Odo might have adopted the monastic habit, bypassing Canterbury and other English monks, whose observance wasn't as highly regarded at that time.
This same motivation led Oswald and other Englishmen to the monastery at Fleury, from where Abbo was sent to England for both piety and learning. Among Odo's notable acts, not mentioned in the following booklet, is the translation of the body of Saint Wilfrid, Bishop of York, which he arranged to be moved to Canterbury.
This is recorded by William in his account of Odo, and by Eadmer in the book "Life of Saint Wilfrid," found in the first part of the Third Century of Benedict, pages 226 and 227. William adds that Odo arranged for Wilfrid's life to be written in heroic verse, accomplished by a certain Fridegod, whose poem we include in our Patrology, volume 133.
William also notes a synodal letter from Odo to his suffragans during King Edmund's reign, urging them not to be indifferent and negligent in the care of souls. In this letter, Odo showed not only notable literacy, as William observed, but even more so, a deep sense of piety and pastoral concern.

10
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:39,270
This letter was written by him, I believe, after the decrees he issued under the same king, published by Spelman, which outline the responsibilities of the king, clergy, and magistrates.

11
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:51,400
In chapter six, he urges monks to diligently fulfill their vows with humility and obedience, both day and night, staying in the fear of God within the churches to which they have committed themselves through their vows.

12
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,606
They should not be wanderers or gyrovagues, who seek the title of monk but neglect its duties.

13
00:03:56,606 --> 00:04:02,865
Instead, they should emulate the apostles through humility, manual labor, sacred reading, and continuous prayers.

14
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:09,013
Eadmer, in the prologue to the Life of Saint Wilfrid, refers to Odo's booklet about Wilfrid's life and conduct.

15
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:15,438
Undoubtedly, this booklet is none other than Fridegod's poem, which is preceded by Odo's letter in some manuscripts.

16
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:40,474
These words are found within:
"So, I reverently received the most venerable relics of the blessed confessor of Christ, Wilfrid, which had been neglected in an unworthy, foul, and stagnant pit, indeed (which is terrible to say) ignored by the horror of the prelates, when some people, with God's favor, transferred them from the place of his tomb, and I placed them within the bounds of the metropolitan church, which by the grace of God I preside over.

17
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:57,810
Therefore, delighted by the proximity of such a great and God-worthy relationship, I decided to adorn them with a higher casket and, by extracting blooms from his book of life, to embellish them with a new work in verse, that is, through Fridegod: which, however, Eadmer and perhaps some others attributed to Odo.

18
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:14,260
I do not know if what Pitseus has about other writings of Odo is more certain, who additionally attributes to him one book to the monks of Fleury for his nephew Oswald; another on the real presence of the body of Christ in the Eucharist, as well as a book of letters, and another of various poems.

19
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:26,556
"
Furthermore, Eadmer, William of Malmesbury, Matthew of Westminster, and others call Odo a saint, and after them, Cardinal Baronius in volume ten of the Annals, although Odo does not have a place in the Roman Martyrology.

20
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,821
Eum is believed to have passed away on the fourth of July, as noted by Capgrave and other English writers, according to Maiheuvius, not on the seventh of February, which is the day Molanus discusses Saint Odo in his Additions to Usuard.

21
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:43,841
He is especially praised in the following Life of Saint Dunstan by Osbern.

22
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:47,777
The revered confessor of Christ, Odo, was born to noble but pagan parents.

23
00:05:47,777 --> 00:05:51,922
He blossomed like a rose among thorns, or a precious scent from humble vessels.

24
00:05:51,922 --> 00:06:00,262
It's said that he descended from a group of senators who once accompanied the notorious pirate Inguar and were brought by ship into the kingdom of the English.

25
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:08,813
Despite his origins and being raised with utmost care, he eagerly sought out Christian gatherings and listened with great delight to the divine words spoken there.

26
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:13,377
When he returned home, he enthusiastically shared what he had learned with his parents.

27
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:22,557
His father, angered by these early interests in goodness, strictly forbade him from mentioning Christ or changing the family's beliefs with the Christian religion's reverence.

28
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:32,629
However, Odo disregarded his father's command and visited the Church more frequently, absorbing the seeds of the divine Word with a focused mind, and fearlessly shared what he learned at home.

29
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:39,973
Once again, his father, more exasperated than ever, subjected him to severe punishment and stripped him of his inheritance as the firstborn.

30
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:45,481
Rejoicing in the Lord for enduring such rejection for His name, Odo saw this as his enrollment in heaven.

31
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:50,359
He left behind his parents and their wealth, fleeing naked and deprived of all worldly glory.

32
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,722
Athelmum is a student of literature.

33
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:58,026
He sought out a leader named Athelm, who lived during King Eluvred's time and was a devout Christian.

34
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:01,387
Among the English nobility, Athelm was one of the most esteemed.

35
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:06,166
Athelmum requested Athelm's protection and authority to shield him from his parents' anger.

36
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:15,094
Athelm, pleased with the young man's virtuous nature and finding it inappropriate for him to serve pagan rituals under his father's rule, welcomed him with fatherly care.

37
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:18,771
He safeguarded him and provided both essential and additional support.

38
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:29,957
Athelm then placed him under the tutelage of teachers to learn Greek and Latin, languages widely used at the time among the English, having been passed down by the students of Archbishop Theodore's blessed memory.

39
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:36,784
Athelmum became highly proficient in both languages, able to craft poetry, write prose, and express any idea with great eloquence.

40
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,181
He joined the ranks.

41
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:45,490
After this, reborn through the sacrament of baptism and adorned with the clerical tonsure, he was guided by his lord to the role of subdeacon.

42
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:54,085
In that position, he excelled for several years with such holiness and sincerity in his preaching that anyone who knew him believed he was a temple of the Holy Spirit.

43
00:07:54,085 --> 00:08:03,247
Everyone agreed he deserved to advance to higher ministries within the Church, even though his age, according to the regulations of the canons, would usually have been a barrier.

44
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:11,122
His lord persuaded him to embrace the priesthood so he could hear the divine office daily from someone whose life he admired for its chastity and purity.

45
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,438
Initially, he resisted, citing his young age.

46
00:08:13,438 --> 00:08:18,791
Eventually, swayed by reason and the authority of ancient examples, he gave in to his religious calling.

47
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:24,401
He wore the deacon's stole on his shoulder, and soon after, he was also entrusted with the highest mysteries.

48
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:30,423
From that time on, both the duke and almost all the other princes of the royal palace held him in the highest regard.

49
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:36,136
They confided the secrets of their troubled lives to him and willingly sought his counsel for their correction.

50
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,526
He travels to Rome with Athelmus and heals him, then returns to England.

51
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:46,143
Meanwhile, the duke expressed to the king his desire to visit Rome and pray to the holy apostles there.

52
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,979
The king quickly granted him permission and support.

53
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,851
Accompanied by the venerable priest Odo, he set off with a large group.

54
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:58,958
Shortly into the journey, he was struck by a severe illness and began to suffer greatly, barely able to breathe.

55
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,667
For six days, his condition worsened, and their provisions dwindled.

56
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:09,047
On the seventh day, he instructed the group to continue, keeping only Odo with him, whose help he desperately needed.

57
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:18,318
After the others had left, he called Odo to him and, in a sorrowful voice, asked him to pray for his recovery, believing that divine mercy would not refuse Odo's request.

58
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:23,280
Odo, raising his spirit to God, prostrated himself on the ground, shedding tears in prayer.

59
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,516
After rising, he asked for a cup of wine.

60
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:31,242
Making the sign of the cross over it, he handed the wine to the man and advised him to trust in the Lord.

61
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:35,878
The man drank from the cup, and as soon as he returned it, he felt completely healed.

62
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:42,912
Grateful, he bowed at the priest's knees, thanked him, mounted his horse, and quickly caught up with his companions the next day.

63
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:48,475
Seeing him, everyone wept for joy, and recognizing the source of his healing, they marveled even more.

64
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:56,164
They continued to Rome and then joyfully returned home, bringing immense happiness to the king and everyone at the palace upon their arrival.

65
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,843
He became dear to King Athelstan.

66
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:03,079
After some time, both the leader and the aforementioned king passed away.

67
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:08,824
Edward, the son of the same king, succeeded to the kingdom and ruled it very wisely for many years.

68
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:16,717
During his reign, the venerable Odo, known for his priestly duties and holy life, was well-regarded by the king and admired by everyone.

69
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:25,132
He spread kindness and gentleness to all, adapting to the ways of everyone, much like the apostles, so that he might win everyone over to Christ.

70
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:30,993
When King Edward reached the end of his life, Athelstan, his son, took over the reins of the kingdom.

71
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:36,564
As mentioned, the admirable Odo lived a life full of virtues and was held in high regard by all.

72
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:42,020
Just as a city set on a hill or a lamp on a stand cannot be hidden, neither could his virtues.

73
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:49,506
As a result, the fame of his holiness grew daily, and with great praise, it reached the ears of the distinguished King Athelstan.

74
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:58,733
Recognizing him as a true servant of God, the king called him to his side, included him among his friends, and entrusted him with his secrets above all others.

75
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,131
He becomes the bishop of Sherborne.

76
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:07,346
Meanwhile, the bishop's seat, which was in Sherborne at the time but is now in Salisbury, was left without a leader.

77
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:18,168
Recognizing that King Odo's life made him worthy of the bishopric, the king urged him with determination to accept the position and become the spiritual shepherd of God's flock in place of the deceased.

78
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:18,704
Why delay?

79
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:30,545
Ultimately, overwhelmed by the requests from both the church and the king, he agreed to take on the episcopal responsibilities, which he admitted were a heavy burden for him, and became the bishop at the Sherborne Church.

80
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:37,671
At that time, the capable and energetic Wlfelmus was overseeing the Church of Canterbury with dignity, authority, and responsibility.

81
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:46,297
He willingly consented to the election by the king, clergy, and people, and with due honor, consecrated him to the episcopal office to which he had been elected.

82
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:57,655
Consecrated and adorned with priestly insignia, it is hard to describe how gloriously he served as a dwelling for God, or how dedicated he was to the souls entrusted to him, no matter how insightful one might be.

83
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:02,638
Therefore, I do not wish to elaborate on what a pure mind might perceive about these matters.

84
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:09,549
I simply aim to reflect on the works of the merciful God, who chooses to fulfill His will through the simplicity of His servants.

85
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:13,535
In the year 938, the pagans faced the superior power of Athelstan.

86
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:21,550
During this year, in the fourteenth year of Athelstan's reign, the most victorious king, a massive army of pagans gathered against the English kingdom.

87
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:29,034
Their aim was to weaken it by imposing their profane laws, ultimately seeking to destroy the sacred Christian laws that the English followed.

88
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:34,448
This renowned prince, surrounded by a strong band of armed men, confronted them and engaged in battle.

89
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,314
The fight was long and extremely fierce on both sides.

90
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:46,125
Leading his forces, the king relied more on the merits of the holy Odo, whom he brought with him, than on the strength of his troops to secure victory over the enemy.

91
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,098
Amidst the fierce slaughter, a sorrowful event occurred.

92
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:53,715
The king's sword broke near the hilt, leaving him nearly defenseless against the enemy.

93
00:12:53,715 --> 00:13:05,287
Meanwhile, Odo stood at a distance from the battle, praying to Christ with both his voice and heart for the salvation of the Christian army, tirelessly raising his face, hands, and eyes to the heavens for this purpose.

94
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:11,656
At this critical moment, the king was unsure of what to do, as he felt it wrong to disarm any of his men to arm himself.

95
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:19,565
A portion of the enemy force, noticing the king standing unarmed with a broken sword, turned back from their retreat to attack with renewed ferocity.

96
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:27,739
Suddenly, the heavens echoed with the clamor of the multitude calling for God's help, and the venerable Odo quickly approached in response to their cries.

97
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,348
He rushed forward and asked the weary king what he wanted him to do.

98
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:51,677
Upon hearing the king's plight, he said, "What is this? Where are you going? Your sword hangs intact at your side, and you complain it is broken? Return to yourself, reach for the sheath, draw it out, and behold, the right hand of the Lord will be with you. Do not fear, for the sun will not set until your enemies, who have risen against you, are overcome by flight or destruction."

99
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:59,652
To everyone's great astonishment, as they listened with lowered eyes, they saw something new: a sword hanging at the king's side.

100
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:07,105
Empowered by God, the king seized the sword and used it to either disable, chase away, or completely destroy anyone who opposed him.

101
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:11,736
As God's servant had foretold, by sunset, the king had triumphed over his enemies.

102
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:23,594
Who can truly describe the gratitude, praises, and vows offered to God through His faithful servant Odo, the king, the victorious army, and throughout the entire kingdom where news of this great victory spread?

103
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:29,636
The magnificence of this event will educate those who hear of it, as not everyone can easily comprehend it.

104
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:35,621
From that point on, glorious Odo was admired by all and was truly recognized as a distinguished Israelite.

105
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:42,645
Eadmund, when encouraged to become the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to accept the position unless he first became a monk.

106
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:49,333
Eight years after this significant victory, Ethelstan passed away peacefully, and his brother Eadmund ascended to the throne.

107
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:59,979
Following his brother's admirable example, he deeply valued virtuous people and, by making them close companions, listened to them sincerely and willingly on matters appropriate for a Christian king.

108
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:06,293
Among these trusted individuals was the blessed Odo, who gained his friendship and was loved by him with a pure heart.

109
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:10,680
During this time, Wlfelmus, the Archbishop of Canterbury, passed away as all must.

110
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:19,722
To ensure that such an important position would not remain vacant for long, the king approached the venerable Odo, urging him to take on the pastoral care of the Church.

111
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,380
Odo resisted and did not agree.

112
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:30,850
He claimed he was unworthy of such a position; and even if he had some aspiration, he argued that church laws prohibited a bishop from leaving his own church to move to another.

113
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:44,814
In response, the king highlighted Odo's well-known virtues to everyone and mentioned that the blessed leader of the apostles, Peter, had moved from Antioch to Rome, and that many others, according to ancient writings, had changed their positions when necessary.

114
00:15:44,814 --> 00:16:18,574
He also added, "We have a clear and fitting example of this among us, namely the holy men, Mellitus, the bishop of London, and Justus of Rochester, who were transferred to Canterbury in a similar manner to what we are urging you to do."
The holy bishop, overwhelmed by these arguments, presented another reason for his reluctance.
He said, "When the first Fathers of this Church, who brought Christianity to the kingdom of the English, and all who succeeded them until now, as everyone knows, were monks; should I change, break, or abolish such an ancient, holy, God-accepted custom, supported by the authority of so many Fathers?"

115
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:30,068
God forbid; let everyone in Britain and the surrounding islands know that I will never agree to lead the Church of Canterbury in clerical attire, because no one who wasn't a monk has ever led there before.

116
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:39,577
However, since not only you but many others are urging me to become a bishop there, it's not my place to resist completely, as I don't want to offend God who dwells within them.

117
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:43,552
So, I entrust my conscience to God, free from any ambition for this honor.

118
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:54,135
The holy purpose of monastic life, which I have desired since my early years but have not been able to achieve due to various obstacles, I will embrace at least this once, even if only temporarily.

119
00:16:54,135 --> 00:17:02,785
As for the bishopric you're discussing, may He who knows all the secrets of hearts decide and appoint the one He deems suitable for this role through His wisdom.

120
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,339
The monk receives clothing from the monks of Fleury and then becomes an archbishop.

121
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,869
The king was greatly uplifted by this man's opinion, praising his holy purpose, his admirable and exemplary humility, and his steadfast courage.

122
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:25,065
After this, messengers were promptly sent to the abbot of the monastery of Saint Benedict at Fleury to obtain the religious clothing necessary for the bishop's duties, as per the prescribed task.

123
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:31,130
At that time, the reputation of the very religious lifestyle at Fleury was widely known and was thriving everywhere.

124
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:39,757
In contrast, interest in the same religion had started to decline in England due to various events, prompting people to seek the desired religious effect from there.

125
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:40,751
And so it happened.

126
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:48,855
Upon hearing the news, the abbot of that place became very happy, took some of his brothers with him, crossed the sea successfully, and arrived in England.

127
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:56,437
He eagerly approached Bishop Odo, who was striving to please God in all things, and devoutly gave him the clothing of the holy purpose he sought.

128
00:17:56,437 --> 00:18:02,816
Thus, the distinguished Bishop Odo became a monk by habit, having long been adorned with the sacred acts of monastic life.

129
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:10,816
He was invited, or rather compelled, by the king and the kingdom to take up the yoke of the Lord over all England, becoming the Archbishop of Canterbury.

130
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:12,176
He could no longer refuse.

131
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:21,744
Those who wish to know how he carried out the duties of the office he received can refer to the account of his life, which describes what he was like before and during his priesthood.

132
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:23,417
As I believe, they can perceive.

133
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:28,960
He was indeed praiseworthy for his holiness, admirable for his wisdom, and singular for his steadfastness.

134
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,934
Eadred is anointed king.

135
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:34,007
He converts opponents of the Eucharist through a miracle.

136
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:43,443
After King Edmund was tragically killed in his own home, his brother Eadred assumed royal authority and was anointed as king by the renowned Odo, the Archbishop of Canterbury.

137
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:53,095
During this period, Dunstan, a man of exceptional virtue and the most esteemed abbot of the Glastonbury monastery, was highly regarded by the king and respected by all the people.

138
00:18:53,095 --> 00:19:01,830
Blessed Odo, both wise and mature, strong in faith and diligence, and remarkable in authority and modesty, wisely governed the entire kingdom with Christian laws.

139
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:14,124
The king himself, fearing God, cherished all good people with a special sweetness of love and strongly opposed the wicked, ensuring they did not disturb the good with their tyranny, thus embodying the qualities of a good leader.

140
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:29,007
Around this time, certain clerics, misled by a dangerous error, attempted to claim that the bread and wine placed on the altar remained in their original substance after consecration, being merely symbols of the body and blood of Christ, not the true body and blood of Christ.

141
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:46,207
Wanting to eradicate this great heresy, blessed Odo, on a particular day, devoutly attended the solemn celebration of the holy mass in front of all the people, praying with tears to Almighty God for His mercy to be present in his ministry, to reveal the true nature of the divine mysteries and dispel the errors of men.

142
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:53,055
When it came to breaking the life-giving bread, oh the ineffable mercy of God, oh the visible manifestation of eternal majesty!

143
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:59,418
For immediately, in the hands of the bishop, who was holding the fragments of the body of Christ, blood began to drip.

144
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:07,237
The bishop, standing there with tears of joy, signaled to the attending ministers to bring forward those who had recently wavered in their faith.

145
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:19,638
They quickly approached when called and, struck by the sight of such a miraculous event, exclaimed in trembling voices:
"Oh, how fortunate you are among men today, to whom the Son of God has chosen to reveal Himself in the flesh!"

146
00:20:20,232 --> 00:21:04,008
Once again, they asked, "Please, Father, pray to the majesty of the Lord,
so that this blood here might be transformed back to its original form,
and we avoid any divine punishment due to our disbelief."
So the priest prayed, and after his prayer, he looked at the altar.
Where he had left the blood, he now saw the familiar appearance of wine.
After partaking in the heavenly sacraments, everyone who witnessed these amazing events rejoiced.
The bishop then ordered all the poor from the area to gather for a feast prepared for them,
as a testament to such incredible power.
He and his followers celebrated with great thanksgiving,
as all doubts about the Lord's body were erased from the hearts of his people.
They no longer questioned that the bread on the altar was the true body of Christ,
having seen the real blood flow from it.

147
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,564
The restoration of the church was truly remarkable.

148
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:10,223
Another truly divine miracle occurred in the church under his leadership.

149
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:15,687
In fact, he didn't accomplish it on his own; it was done through him by the one who alone possesses divinity.

150
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:19,296
The church's roof, decayed from age, was hanging with many broken parts.

151
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:28,920
He wanted to renew it and elevate the walls to a greater height, so he gathered craftsmen and instructed them to completely remove the loose parts above and raise the walls that lacked height.

152
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:42,805
However, since the clergy and people couldn't be without divine service, and there was no other temple large enough to accommodate the crowd, the bishop prayed to the Lord that until the work was finished, no rain or wind would enter the church to disrupt their divine service.

153
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:49,321
And so it happened that during the three years while the church walls were being raised, the entire structure remained open above.

154
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:59,446
Remarkably, not only within the church but also within the entire city, no rain fell that could hinder the clergy from their duties or stop the people from coming to the church and beginning their work.

155
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:05,862
It was astonishing to see all the orchards in the city drenched with water, yet the city's walls remained untouched by any rain.

156
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:11,510
Edwy, the lustful king, tries to reform himself first through Dunstan and then by his own efforts.

157
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,649
However, when King Edred passed away, Edwy, the son of the late King Edmund, was chosen as king.

158
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:28,372
Being young both in behavior and age, he soon began to rely on the advice of the young men he had chosen as his companions and attendants, ignoring the older men known for their great experience, conduct, and authority.

159
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:39,507
Thus, he was corrected by the strong soldier of Christ, Odo, and restrained himself for a while, fearing that if he didn't listen to him at all, the blessing of royal dignity would be delayed beyond his wish.

160
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:45,556
But once he received that blessing, he immediately became uncontrollable, following all the desires of his heart.

161
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:51,391
He became a lover of pleasures more than God, of luxury more than sobriety, and of lust rather than chastity.

162
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:57,387
Therefore, he acted according to the desires of his heart and was praised by his followers for his wicked deeds.

163
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:05,470
Moreover, on the day he was crowned in the presence of the entire Church, he brought upon himself a serious mark of infamy along with such great glory.

164
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:17,354
After the church service, when he was already seated for lunch with the archbishops, bishops, abbots, and other leaders of the kingdom, he suddenly leapt up, left the company of all, and withdrew to a more private chamber.

165
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:26,937
There, inflamed by passion, he sought the unspeakable company of two women who were lying there: this act cast down the minds of those who trusted him with great shame and sorrow.

166
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:41,497
After holding a council about what needed to be done, the archbishop and the leaders sent the venerable abbot Dunstan, who was mentioned earlier, to pull the king away from his illicit embraces and bring him back to the royal seat among the leaders; which was indeed done.

167
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:50,437
Because of this, the king, disturbed by intense anger, condemned Dunstan to exile, stripped him of all his possessions, and sent him across the sea outside of England.

168
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:58,253
He also committed countless other wrongs, which, although detailed elsewhere more extensively, I thought it sufficient to mention only a few here.

169
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:05,133
Odo, a soldier of Almighty God, couldn't patiently endure these injustices and became a public enemy against them.

170
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:12,958
When he realized he couldn't persuade the king to change his ways through advice, pleas, or rebukes, he decided to use his episcopal authority.

171
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:20,399
He had one of the women, whom the king had dishonored with excessive power and shamelessness, removed by soldiers from the king's court.

172
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:24,995
She was publicly disgraced, branded with a hot iron, and exiled to Ireland for life.

173
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:37,197
However, after some time, when her body had healed into a scar, but her shameless mind still bore its deformity, she left Ireland, returned to England, and arrived at Gloucester, filled with the darkness of a blinded heart.

174
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:46,772
There, she was captured by the servants of God, and to prevent her from wandering around like a prostitute, she was crippled, and after a few days, she died a miserable death.

175
00:24:46,772 --> 00:24:55,144
Indeed, Archbishop Odo was a man of strong virtues, supported by the maturity and steadfastness of old age, and an unyielding opponent of all injustices.

176
00:24:55,144 --> 00:25:02,257
Neither the temptations of any worldly joy, threats from people, nor the suffering of any loss could deter him from righteousness.

177
00:25:02,257 --> 00:25:07,674
Thus, because he neither hoped for anything nor feared, he disarmed the anger of all the powerless.

178
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:09,953
King Eadgar was crowned by Dunstan.

179
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:19,953
In contrast, Eadwig, who could hardly be considered a true king since he lacked the ability to govern himself or others, was expelled from the kingdom for his crimes and met a miserable end.

180
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:23,584
Eadgar, his brother, was established as the king over all of England.

181
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:32,899
He excelled beyond most of his predecessors in character, suppressed the injustices that arose during his brother's reign, overturned them, and did his utmost to eradicate them.

182
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:40,004
Moreover, upon ascending the throne, he recalled the respected abbot Dunstan from exile and elevated him to the bishopric of Worcester.

183
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:48,319
When Dunstan was chosen to be a bishop, he traveled to Canterbury for consecration as per tradition, seeking it from the bishop of that seat, the blessed Odo.

184
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,898
Odo agreed without hesitation.

185
00:25:49,898 --> 00:26:00,002
To dispel any doubt about this holy bishop's prophetic spirit, he promoted the man destined to be the bishop of the Wiccians to the bishopric of Canterbury through the Holy Spirit's influence.

186
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:28,210
When questioned by those present about his actions, he explained, "I know, my sons, I know what God is working within me.
This man will indeed serve as the pastor of Worcester while I live, but once I am gone, all of Britain will celebrate him as its leader; for the Holy Spirit's gift is not constrained by law."
The Church of God, which greatly rejoiced under his leadership as the holy bishop had foretold, is well aware of how true this prophecy proved to be, and it remains strengthened by his most sacred intercession to this day.

187
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:29,034
He died.

188
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:36,427
Having been blessed by the Lord with such gifts of goodness, the distinguished Odo did not boast about his own deeds but always strived to improve.

189
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:42,161
Forgetting what was behind and reaching forward to what was ahead, he pursued the prize of God's heavenly calling.

190
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:52,773
He daily nourished the people entrusted to him with heavenly teaching, like abundant crops receiving rain-like grace, until the king brought his soul into his chamber and filled him with the joy of his pleasure.

191
00:26:52,773 --> 00:27:01,323
Thus, Odo, the brightest star of the city of Canterbury, was taken from this world and, with the angels rejoicing, sought the seat of the heavenly and most glorious city.

192
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:11,130
There, he rejoices with eternal exultation and gazes upon the face of Christ with the sweetness of indescribable delight, now secure in his reward and concerned for the salvation of his children.

193
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:19,882
He died in the presence of all the children of the Church of Christ, to whom he promised while they wept that the Lord would provide a good shepherd for them after his death.

194
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:23,538
Elfsinus the simoniac succeeded him and insulted the deceased.

195
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:28,840
Saint Odo gave instructions to the guardian of the church about Elfsinus, who met a miserable end.

196
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:37,928
After his passing, Elfsinus, the bishop of Winchester, nicknamed Lippe, attained the position of high priest by giving money to the chief nobles in King Edgar's palace.

197
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:44,691
Even before Odo, there was a strong desire to seize the priesthood, but it was hindered by the steadfastness of good bishops.

198
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:51,616
When he was received in Canterbury with a solemn procession on the day of his arrival, he approached the tomb of the man of God.

199
00:27:51,616 --> 00:29:09,953
Standing over it, he insulted the deceased with furious words, saying: "Foolish one, see, you are dead and lie rotting under the earth, and I will triumph over you whenever I want.
While you lived, I could not be the highest bishop of the English, but with your passing, I have become what I long desired. And for that, wretched and decrepit old man, you have no thanks, because if you could have lived longer, you would not have wanted to grant me or anyone else a share in your honor."
Thus he openly said in the presence of those who were there, and striking the tomb of the saint with his staff, he left, inflamed by a threefold fury.
But that same night, while mortals were granted rest, the blessed Odo appeared to the worthy guardian of the Church of the Savior, having a face like milk and a garment of rose color, addressing the man thus: "Are you asleep or awake?"
"I was sleeping," he said, "venerable elder, but now I am awake as you speak."
And he said, "Go to the bishop Elfsinus, elected but not by God, and deliver this message in my name: This is what the servant of Christ, Odo, commands you. I am not dead, but I live with my almighty king, God.
And so that you may know this for certain, be aware that just as you could not achieve the archbishopric of Canterbury because of me while I was still living in the flesh, in the same way, you will soon lose the honor you have seized from me now that I live in the heavenly kingdom."

200
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,684
Listen, then, to what I say.

201
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:15,752
Yesterday, you mocked me with harsh words and struck my grave with your staff.

202
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:25,663
I warn you, you will cross the sea and climb the Alps, but you will never obtain the mantle of the patriarchate of the holy Church of Canterbury, nor will you ever sit in its apostolic seat.

203
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:30,461
The person who witnessed these events, fearing the bishop's anger, hesitated to report them.

204
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:37,763
The following night, the holy man of God appeared to him again, repeating his earlier message, but the man still did not dare to deliver it.

205
00:29:37,763 --> 00:29:51,429
On the third night, the man of God appeared once more, adorned with episcopal dignity, and rebuked the man's hesitation, saying:
If you wish to protect your well-being, I advise you not to conceal from your bishop what you have heard from me for the second time.

206
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:55,184
If you do, you will find that you have brought punishment upon yourself.

207
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:59,044
Very frightened, he woke up, and when morning came, he went to the bishop.

208
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:24,550
Bowing low before him, he said:
Honored Father, the glorious Odo, your predecessor, appeared to me like a beautiful angel of God and commanded me to deliver this message to you:
Because, he told me the day before yesterday, you mocked me with derisive words and struck my grave with your staff, I warn you that you will cross the sea and climb the Alps, but you will never obtain the mantle of the patriarchate of the holy Church of Canterbury, nor will you ever sit in its apostolic seat.

209
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:31,748
After hearing these words, the bishop dismissed the reporter of the vision, considering the message as foolish threats, as he called them.

210
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:36,077
But after some days, everything happened just as the holy man of God had predicted.

211
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:44,214
After crossing the sea to fetch the mantle and traveling successfully for a while, as soon as he ascended the mountains, he was overwhelmed by extreme cold.

212
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:51,516
He ordered the horses accompanying him to be killed and put his feet into their stomachs, thinking this might drive away the excessive cold.

213
00:30:51,516 --> 00:31:01,217
But since the divine wrath that tormented him did not cease, he blasphemed the majesty of the Lord in his impiety, and thus, in the midst of flames, he breathed his last polluted breath.

214
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:09,504
Blessed Odo truly showed that he was living in Christ, despite the unfortunate Elfsinus daring to believe he was completely dead.

215
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,139
When Birthelm was removed, Dunstan succeeded him.

216
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,365
A dove appeared over the tomb of Saint Odo, known as Segode.

217
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:23,325
After Birthelm, the bishop of Dorset, a man of great piety and simplicity, passed away, he was appointed as the bishop for the people of Canterbury.

218
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:33,435
However, when it was found that he did not effectively carry out ecclesiastical disciplines, he was asked to step down from his responsibilities and humbly returned to rest with his flock.

219
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:42,739
To affirm the word of the Lord and the prophecy of His servant, the blessed Odo, Dunstan, already the bishop of the church of London, was chosen by the king and the kingdom.

220
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:48,386
He was appointed as the most worthy successor to the glorious Odo, becoming the patriarch of all Britain.

221
00:31:48,386 --> 00:32:00,540
A sign of the holiness and blessedness of Dunstan and Father Odo was that on Pentecost, when Dunstan was celebrating mass at the altar of the Lord Savior in Canterbury, the Holy Spirit appeared above him in the form of a dove.

222
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:09,521
After the sacrifice was completed, it moved to the southern part of the altar, where the venerable Odo was buried, and rested over his tomb in front of many onlookers.

223
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:15,813
This event was held in great reverence by Dunstan himself, and he never passed Odo's tomb afterward without kneeling.

224
00:32:15,813 --> 00:32:48,187
He also affectionately called him "good" in his native tongue, Odo Segode, meaning Odo the Good. This nickname is still used today by the English, especially by the people of Canterbury.
With this account, we conclude the narrative and praise God, who is the culmination of all good things, in harmonious voice. He glorifies His name in every nation so that whoever fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him. To Him, therefore, be praise and thanksgiving through endless ages of ages, amen.
As a rose from thorns, Odo arose from the pagans, bearing no marks of treachery from any ancestor.

225
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:52,667
Despite the wishes of his ancestors, he embraced the plow of faith.

226
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:56,067
Like a dedicated farmer, he tilled the soil of the heart.

227
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,406
Raised by blood, and even more elevated by moral values.

228
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:02,150
Renowned by birth, and even more by his words.

229
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,714
A man free of crime encountered the wicked.

230
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:07,696
Eager to expand the kingdom of the highest Father.

231
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:12,705
A phalanx of virtues guarded his heart, preventing any vice from taking root in him.
