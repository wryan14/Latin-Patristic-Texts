Historical Notice.

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:05,950
From Mansi, the most extensive Collection of Councils, Volume Eighteen, page 405.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,239
Agapetus succeeded Marino in the year 946 AD, during the time of Constantine the Eighth.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:18,691
After several synods concerning the case of Hugo and Artald, he confirmed Artald's assignment to the Archbishopric of Reims.

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:24,281
He granted the pallium to Bruno, the Archbishop of Cologne and brother of Otto, upon request.

6
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:36,722
After King Otto defeated the Danes in a significant victory and they embraced Christianity, he congratulated the Church of Hamburg and renewed its ancient privileges, as noted in Adam, Book Two, Chapter Two.

7
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:41,470
During this time, after Lothair's death, Berengar invaded the kingdom of Italy.

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:53,610
Emperor Otto, approached by Adelheid, daughter of Rudolf and widow of Lothair, along with Pope Agapetus, expelled Berengar's entire family and accepted Queen Adelheid, Lothair's former wife, as his own.

9
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,315
He defended the kingdom with great integrity.

10
00:00:56,315 --> 00:01:03,107
Agapetus served diligently in the pastoral office for nine years, seven months, and ten days before passing away.

11
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:07,368
Letters and Privileges of Pope Agapetus the Second

12
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:12,371
One: PRIVILEGE OF POPE AGAPETUS THE SECOND FOR THE MONASTERY OF SAINT SAVIOR IN FULDA.

13
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:20,168
(Year Nine Hundred Forty-Six.)
This is the confirmation of the privileges that Pope Marinus the Second granted to the Fulda monastery.

14
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:33,144
AGAPETUS, the bishop and servant of the servants of God, addresses HADAMAR, the devout abbot of the revered monastery of the Lord Savior, and through him, to all his successors as abbots in this esteemed monastery, forever.

15
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:41,057
With the utmost concern for all revered places, as much as is possible through divine assistance,
we endeavor to ensure their stability.

16
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:46,197
Through this effort, we both honor divine mercy and elevate the praise of the Church of Christ.

17
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:50,536
With greater confidence, we dare to seek eternal mercy for the forgiveness of sins.

18
00:01:50,536 --> 00:02:02,349
Your reverence has requested that the venerable monastery of the Lord Savior, established by Saint Boniface the bishop at the site called Boconia by the Fulda River, be granted the protection of the apostolic seat's privilege.

19
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:10,503
This ensures it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any other Church, but remains under the jurisdiction of our holy Church, which we serve by God's will.

20
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:20,957
In support of your pious wishes, we enact your request with our apostolic authority, following the series of privileges previously granted by our predecessor, Marinus, the bishop of this blessed seat.

21
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:30,418
Therefore, we prohibit any priest from any church from having authority in the aforementioned monastery, except for the apostolic seat, unless invited by the abbot of the monastery.

22
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:34,077
No one should presume to celebrate masses there without an invitation.

23
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:42,127
This ensures that, as established, it remains endowed with the firmness of apostolic privilege, enjoying perpetual stability in its places and properties.

24
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:51,901
This includes both those it currently holds and those divine mercy may wish to increase in the future as gifts, offerings, and tithes from the faithful, without contradiction from anyone.

25
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:04,033
From this point forward, as we consider this matter, we have decided that at appropriate times, our church should be informed about how monastic life is guided by regular practice and dedicated to proper ecclesiastical study.

26
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:11,374
We must be vigilant so that, under the guise of this privilege, the principles and actions of righteousness remain aligned with true justice.

27
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:21,110
No king, bishop, count, or any other individual, regardless of status, should impose force or create disputes concerning the affairs and families of the esteemed monastery mentioned here.

28
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:29,283
By our authority, we also prohibit any woman from entering the monastery, and no one is allowed to hold court within its premises or other associated places.

29
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:36,728
Furthermore, no one should compel the servants or tenants to any service, except those whom the abbot has specifically permitted for his needs.

30
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:44,850
The brothers should have the freedom to choose an abbot for themselves as needed, according to the rule of Saint Benedict, without interference from anyone.

31
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,555
To you, beloved son Hadamar, known for your education and eloquence, we grant and command by the authority of Saint Peter to preach the word of God.

32
00:03:52,555 --> 00:04:03,956
Therefore, by apostolic decree, we declare through this document that anyone who dares to violate this privilege, which we affirm by the authority of the chief of the apostles, will be cursed unless they quickly repent.

33
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:08,382
They shall incur the wrath of God and be excluded from the company of all the saints.

34
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:15,774
Nonetheless, the dignity of the aforementioned monastery, granted by us, shall remain perpetually intact, strengthened by apostolic authority.

35
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:21,033
Whoever preserves and observes this privilege of ours shall receive blessing and grace from the Lord.

36
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:27,957
This document is written by the hand of Leo, the clerk of the Holy Roman Church, in the month of October, during the fifth indiction.

37
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,519
Issued on the 25th of October.

38
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,840
In November, under the leadership of Stephen, the head of the apostolic seat.

39
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,221
During the year, by the grace of God, in the pontificate of Lord Agapetus, the second supreme pontiff and universal pope.

40
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,454
In the month of October, in the fifth indiction year.

41
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:50,926
Letter 2 from Pope Agapetus the Second to Atenulf, Prince of Benevento, written in the year 946.

42
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:56,054
The Pope urges that the monastery of Saint Sophia be returned to the monks of Monte Cassino.

43
00:04:56,054 --> 00:05:03,133
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, sends greetings and an apostolic blessing to Atenulf, Prince of Benevento.

44
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:14,616
Our duty requires us to be vigilant, to prepare for the day of judgment, to encourage those doing well to improve, and to correct the negligent, following apostolic instruction: Reprove, rebuke, and exhort.

45
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,845
Second Timothy, chapter four, verse two.

46
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:25,094
The Lord also says through the prophet in another place: If you do not warn the wicked of their wickedness, I will require their blood at your hand.

47
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,268
Ezekiel, chapter three, verse eighteen.

48
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:34,236
We were very pleased to hear from our beloved son, Abbot Baldwin, about your eagerness to promote the exaltation of churches.

49
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:46,665
However, the pastoral care of all churches compels us to be watchful, and as our spiritual son Baldwin, the most reverent Father of monasteries, reported to your dominions, you have not continued in the good work you began.

50
00:05:46,665 --> 00:06:01,604
We are deeply saddened and grieved that the monastery in honor of Saint Sophia, located within the city of Benevento and under the authority of the blessed Father Benedict of the monks established at Monte Cassino from its very foundation, remains so during your time.

51
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:13,922
You have boldly ignored the decrees of kings and the universal apostolic men and have not feared to remove the said monastery of Saint Sophia from the authority of the monastery of Saint Benedict with unheard-of audacity.

52
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:23,565
However, Baldwin, the most reverent abbot, has restored it under canonical authority and the legal precepts of kings and apostles to the jurisdiction of that holy monastery.

53
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:29,139
When our predecessor, Pope Marino, summoned it to himself, you presumed to seize the same monastery.

54
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:36,091
We earnestly urge you, and sincerely ask, to return the entire monastery to the abbot who has requested it.

55
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:41,376
Additionally, please do not cause any issues for the monastery of Saint Sophia of Cassino.

56
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:49,010
If, God forbid, you choose to do otherwise, be aware that, as stated by our previous popes, you will face the penalty of anathema.

57
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,545
AGAPETUS II PRIVILEGE FOR THE ESSEN ABBEY.

58
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:56,784
(Year 946.)
He confirms the privileges of the Essen Abbey at the request of Abbess Hatewig.

59
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:06,858
AGAPETUS, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to HATHEWIGA, religious abbess, and the monastery of Asinda, built by the late Bishop Altfrid, and to her successors forever.

60
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:12,500
The highest apostolic dignity shines with divine foresight when it diligently works to praise God.

61
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:29,770
Therefore, because you requested from us, through the intervention of our lord and glorious King Otto, we command, by our apostolic authority, to newly grant you the same privilege given by our predecessor, the lord Pope Zachary, to the aforementioned monastery called Asinda, built by Bishop Alfrid.

62
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:46,522
This monastery was destroyed by fire, along with the tithe, which, with the permission of the aforesaid lord apostolic and the consent of all the bishops of the clergy, Gunthar, Archbishop of the Church of Cologne, had assigned for the sustenance of the same nuns, and the right of election.

63
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:55,502
This ensures that when the abbess passes away, the nuns will have the freedom to choose from among themselves a worthy and God-pleasing abbess to lead them.

64
00:07:55,847 --> 00:08:08,880
To ensure that the same monastery is honored with the privileges of the apostolic seat and remains under the jurisdiction of our holy Church, which we serve by God's guidance, it should not fall under the jurisdiction of any other Church.

65
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,822
Therefore, supporting your pious desires, we implement what you request.

66
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:29,578
With apostolic authority, invoking divine judgment and under the threat of anathema, we establish that no one, regardless of their rank or status, whether of great or small importance, should ever presume to take away or alienate in any way the goods or possessions, or anything that seems to belong to it.

67
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:34,232
Nor should anyone cause any harm, distress, or loss during times of peace or turmoil.

68
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:38,668
We decree that it should remain firmly under the jurisdiction of our holy Church.

69
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:46,334
However, whoever, with pious intent, observes this apostolic privilege of ours shall receive many blessings from the most merciful Lord God.

70
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:47,241
Letter Four.

71
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:54,210
From Pope Agapetus the Second to Leo and Benedict, regarding their unauthorized involvement in the churches of Trivento and Termoli.

72
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:05,771
(Year Nine Forty-Seven.)
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, addresses Leo, priest and monk, and Benedict, also a priest, who were improperly consecrated as bishops by us and currently hold this office.

73
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:14,587
We previously sent you letters requesting that you come to us to address the accusations and complaints made by John, bishop of the holy seat of Benevento, against us.

74
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:27,152
He appealed to us and presented the privileges granted by our predecessor pontiffs of the Holy Roman Church and apostolic seat, along with a strict anathema, so that no one would dare to diminish the boundaries of the Church of Benevento.

75
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:42,356
He also stated that the churches of Trivento and Termoli have long been subject to the bishop of Benevento, along with all other churches built or to be built within these boundaries and other areas within the cities and fortresses, all under the authority of the Beneventan principality.

76
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:54,181
Since you refused to come and provide an explanation, we understand that you did not enter through the proper channels, but like thieves and robbers, you intruded from elsewhere and improperly took on the episcopal ministry.

77
00:09:54,181 --> 00:10:06,746
It appears a new presumption has arisen where people under the diocese and bishopric of the Benevento province, against the rules of the canons, have chosen you as their bishops through the heresy of simony, involving bribery and payment.

78
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:20,577
Therefore, we excommunicate you by the authority of Blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, so that you may not presume to hold the episcopal seat in the congregations of Trivento and Termoli, nor be allowed to perform any episcopal duties in any other church.

79
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:32,191
We want to acknowledge that, although it was once held by ancient pontiffs, we are fully restoring, renewing, and confirming everything, including parishes and dioceses, to the principality of Benevento.

80
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:38,697
This is for Bishop John of Benevento and his successors to possess forever, with nothing diminished by our successors.

81
00:10:38,697 --> 00:11:01,025
Therefore, we urge and command, under the authority of blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, the clergy, and all the people of Trivento and Termoli, that if anyone, without the consent of the local officials, clergy, or people of those cities, attempts to invite the aforementioned monk Leo or the priest Benedict into those cities to perform the duties of a bishop, they shall remain excommunicated.

82
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:20,817
However, if anyone, which we do not desire, dares to oppose these statutes established by us for the glory of God and the stability of the Church of Benevento, or transgresses in any way, or attempts to diminish its boundaries, let them know they are excommunicated and condemned to eternal punishment with Judas, the betrayer of the Lord, and all the wicked.

83
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:33,277
But whoever, with foresight, observes and upholds this apostolic constitution in all ways, looking to the worship of God, may they receive an abundance of grace from our most merciful Lord and be deemed worthy of eternal life.

84
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:46,068
This was given by the hand of Stephen, the chief of the holy Roman and apostolic see, in the year of the pontificate of Lord Pope Agapetus the Second, in the most holy see of blessed Peter the apostle, first, in the fifth indiction.

85
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:53,927
Five: Epistle of Pope Agapetus the Second to Adalgar, Archbishop of Hamburg (Year Nine Hundred Forty-Eight)

86
00:11:53,927 --> 00:12:03,600
AGAPETUS, bishop and servant of the servants of God, sends greetings to the most reverend and holy ADALGARIUS, Archbishop of the Holy Church of Hamburg, and to your successors forever.

87
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,116
The apostolic office should support those who excel in pious religion with compassionate kindness and fulfill the requests of those who ask with sincere devotion.

88
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:19,317
By doing this, we undoubtedly earn the greatest reward from God, the creator of all, when venerable places are brought to a better state.

89
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:27,413
You have asked us to confirm the entire archbishopric of the Church of Hamburg to you, as decreed by our predecessor, Lord Nicholas of this apostolic see.

90
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:36,349
Inclined by the prayers of Hadamar, the abbot of Fulda, we grant this by apostolic authority, with all places generally and specifically pertaining to your archbishopric.

91
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:45,338
This includes everything your predecessors acquired through their efforts, as well as gifts given out of love for the eternal homeland by the faithful followers of Christ.

92
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:54,064
It also includes those now converted to the faith of Christ through divine protection, such as the bishops of the Danes, Norwegians, Swedes, and all northern regions.

93
00:12:54,064 --> 00:13:01,792
We also decree that the pallium and its use in the aforementioned places, as made by the said pope, be held by you and all your successors forever.

94
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:09,173
From this moment on, we declare that no archbishop, whether from Cologne or elsewhere, shall claim any authority over your diocese.

95
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:18,488
Instead, we urge them and all those devoted to religion to offer you assistance and support in every way, so they may earn full reward from the Lord for this act of kindness.

96
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:29,731
We firmly believe that everything beneficial to the church, which aligns with divine commandments, should be carried out and provided under the authority of Almighty God and the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

97
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:41,187
By our authority, in accordance with the decree of the late Pope Nicholas and the desire of the most reverend King Louis, we declare that the dioceses of Hamburg and Bremen are no longer separate but united as one.

98
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:49,218
We also pronounce anathema and eternal punishment by demonic fate on anyone who opposes, contradicts, or in any way plots against our sincere efforts.

99
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:56,606
This is so we can zealously defend the cause of God, with the love of the apostolic leaders, and protect it from adversaries on all sides.

100
00:13:56,606 --> 00:14:10,258
By apostolic authority, we instruct Bishop Bernhard of Alverstadt, Thidard of the Hisden Church, and other neighboring bishops to assist you in all matters, so you may fulfill your priestly duties and more effectively gain souls for the Lord Jesus Christ.

101
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:23,856
Therefore, by apostolic authority and with the warning of divine judgment, and under the interdict of anathema, we establish that no person, regardless of status or rank, shall violate anything granted by us or our predecessors to your church and to you.

102
00:14:23,856 --> 00:14:33,867
Whoever alters or dares to violate anything, unless they repent, shall be bound by the perpetual bond of anathema by the authority of God, of Saint Peter, and of us, who act in his stead.

103
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:42,988
However, whoever has been its keeper and observer may deserve to receive the grace of blessing and the reward of heaven from our Lord God, the just judge.

104
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:50,833
This was written by Aaron, the regional notary and secretary of the Holy Roman Church, in the month of January, during the sixth indiction.

105
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:59,695
It was given on January 2nd by Andrew, the treasurer of the holy apostolic see, at the most sacred seat of Blessed Peter the Apostle, in the sixth indiction.

106
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:03,923
Six: Letter from Pope Agapetus the Second to Abbess Windilgarde, dated 948.

107
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:10,616
The monastery of Gandersheim in Saxony is placed under the protection of the apostolic see and granted various privileges.

108
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:21,754
Agapetus, bishop and servant of God's servants, addresses Windilgarde, the venerable abbess of Gandersheim monastery, founded by Count Otto of Saxony, as well as the other abbesses of her order, forever.

109
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:32,892
Since it is always necessary to grant things that align with rational desires, it is fitting that the founder's devotion should not be denied the authority of pious preservation when granting privileges.

110
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:52,754
Therefore, because the venerable abbot Hathumar requested, through his intervention and plea, that we confirm your monastery of Gandersheim, located near the river Aterna, by apostolic authority, it is established under the jurisdiction of our holy church, which we serve by the grace of God, and should not be subjected to the jurisdictions of any other church.

111
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:58,351
For this reason, favoring these pious desires, we enact this authority of ours to fulfill the request.

112
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:06,965
Therefore, we prohibit, by our authority, any priest from any church from having any authority in the aforementioned monastery, except for the apostolic see.

113
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:16,512
By the authority of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, we command that no king should dare, without your permission, to give the monastery to any individuals as a benefice.

114
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:32,204
So that, indeed, according to what is subject to the apostolic see with the firmness of privilege, it may remain undisturbed, enriched with places and goods, both those it currently has or possesses and those which divine grace may increase in the future for the right of the monastery.

115
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:38,843
It may enjoy with perpetual firmness the gifts, offerings, and tithes of the faithful without any person's contradiction.

116
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:50,091
However, when the abbess of this monastery departs from this world, it shall not be permitted for anyone to appoint an abbess there, except from the same congregation, if such a one is found worthy of God.

117
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,615
If she is not found there, the king has the authority to appoint an abbess who is deemed worthy to please God.

118
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:07,806
We also decree through this document that anyone, regardless of their rank, who tries to violate this charter of our privilege-which we affirm by the authority of the prince of the apostles-shall be cursed.

119
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:12,097
They will incur God's wrath and be cast out from the company of all the saints.

120
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:19,540
Nonetheless, the dignity of the mentioned monastery, granted by us, shall remain perpetually inviolate, supported by apostolic authority.

121
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,602
This was written by the hand of Stephen, the scribe of the holy Roman church, in the month of January, during the sixth indiction.

122
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,091
Farewell.

123
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:43,714
Given on the third day before the nones of January by the hand of Andrew, by divine grace, the treasurer of the holy apostolic see, in the year, with God's favor, of the pontificate of Agapetus, the supreme pontiff, Junior, the pope, in the most holy seat of the blessed Peter the apostle, the second year.

124
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,099
Seven: The Privilege of Pope Agapetus the Second for the Monastery of Saint Boniface in Fulda.

125
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,713
Year Nine Hundred Forty-Eight.

126
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:54,858
This document confirms the privileges of the newly renovated Fulda Monastery.

127
00:17:54,858 --> 00:18:06,483
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, addresses the venerable abbot Hadamar and, through him, the future abbots of the monastery originally built by Saint Boniface and recently renovated, for all time.

128
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:14,987
Since it is essential to grant what matches reasonable desires, the founder's authority in a pious construction should not be denied when granting privileges.

129
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:39,583
Therefore, since you have requested that the monastery of the Savior, originally built by Saint Boniface and recently rebuilt by you at Boconus near the bank of the river Fulda, be honored with the privileges of the apostolic seat and established under our jurisdiction,
guided by God whom we serve, it shall not be subjected to the jurisdiction of any other Church;
we support these pious desires and, with our authority, bring your request to fulfillment.

130
00:18:39,583 --> 00:19:08,485
Therefore, we forbid any priest or bishop from any Church to have authority or jurisdiction in the aforementioned monastery except for the apostolic seat,
ensuring that no one presumes to celebrate Masses there unless invited by the abbot of the monastery,
so it remains firmly endowed with the privileges ascribed to the apostolic seat,
along with the places and properties it currently holds or will acquire through divine mercy from the gifts, offerings, and tithes of the faithful,
without contradiction, enjoying perpetual firmness.

131
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:22,762
We also declare through this decree of ours that anyone, whether a leader or person of any rank from any Church, who attempts to violate this charter of our privilege-affirmed by the authority of the prince of the apostles-shall be cursed and incur the wrath of God.

132
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,648
They shall be banished from the assembly of all saints.

133
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:32,940
Nevertheless, the dignity of the aforementioned monastery granted by us shall remain perpetually inviolable, upheld by apostolic authority.

134
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:40,075
This was written by the hand of Stephen, notary and scribe of the Holy Roman Church, in the month of January and in the sixth indiction.

135
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,334
Given on January second.

136
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:42,041
Letter 8.

137
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,628
From Pope Agapetus the Second to Archbishop Gerard of Lorch, Year Nine Forty-Eight.

138
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:51,823
This letter resolves the dispute between the churches of Lorch, known as Passau, and Salzburg.

139
00:19:51,823 --> 00:20:01,772
It assigns western Pannonia to Salzburg, while Lorch, being older, receives the honor of blessing and the eastern Pannonia, covering the regions of the Avars, Moravians, and Slavs.

140
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:10,780
It also grants the authority to preach freely throughout all the lands of the Slavs, to ordain bishops there, and to establish everything with apostolic authority.

141
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:19,844
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, to the most beloved and most reverend brother Gerard, archbishop of the holy Lorch Church, greetings in Christ.

142
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:30,235
Your requests to renew or approve the privileges of your Church were presented to us by the venerable abbot Hademar of the Fulda monastery, who came here for prayer with great benevolence.

143
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:39,962
He also reported the very serious disputes and arguments between you and Archbishop Herold over the authority of the pallium received by both in one province, with lamentation.

144
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:45,323
We, in our pastoral care, also grieve with great sorrow of heart and detest such profane discord.

145
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:55,658
Indeed, the holy and universal Church, over which we preside by the authority of God, is supported by its religious and peaceful priests, solidified in sincere love, like so many pillars.

146
00:20:55,658 --> 00:21:09,254
However, when they are discordant and lift their minds against each other with hostile pride, especially such great bishops, it is as if it were shaken from its own position with great danger and loss of its strength, with its supports torn away.

147
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:20,584
Moreover, while this kind of contention is persistently exercised between you outside for the honor of the pallium, it results in the honor of the priesthood being emptied within through fraternal rivalry.

148
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:33,511
Therefore, brother, as it is our duty to ensure that seeds of hostility do not grow among you, causing division in the holy Church of God and scandal without regard for your counsel and benefit, we come as mediators to settle your dispute.

149
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:39,233
We are motivated both by the concern of the governance entrusted to us by the Lord and by love for both of you.

150
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:49,181
We aim to address your complaints about the conflict with fair judgments, satisfying justice, and, with Christ's guidance, bring you back to brotherly harmony once all controversy is set aside.

151
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:55,779
It is known and documented with us which church locations should be granted the dignity of the pallium from this apostolic seat.

152
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:05,779
The city of Lauriacum, regarded since ancient times as a metropolitan and archbishop's seat, over which your holiness is known to preside, is mentioned in authentic privileges sent to us by you.

153
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,872
We also found some very old documents in the archives of St.

154
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:09,954
Peter revealing this.

155
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:19,490
We learned that, at the beginning of the nascent Church and during the most severe persecution of Christians, this seat received the foundations of the Catholic faith from its teachers.

156
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,109
From there, subsequent preachers spread the grace of this faith to the provinces of Upper and Lower Pannonia.

157
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:32,067
Until the time of the Huns, no one other than the archbishop of the holy Lauriacum presided over these two provinces and their bishops.

158
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:40,212
The barbaric savagery of the Huns devastated not only the aforementioned city of Lauriacum but also the surrounding regions, leaving them completely desolate.

159
00:22:40,212 --> 00:22:47,892
Consequently, compelled by necessity, the bishops abandoned that seat, relocating elsewhere, and also deserted the archiepiscopal honor of that seat.

160
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:57,170
In more recent times, not too long ago, after the apostolic vicariate of the Bavarian kingdom was vacant, Arno was appointed as the first archbishop of the holy Church of Salzburg.

161
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,345
This is confirmed by the long-standing historical records of the sacred archives.

162
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:10,254
Now, with Christ favoring mortals, peace and safety have been granted to the holy Church of Lorch from its enemies, and your position should be held there.

163
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:22,585
Therefore, we reinstate you to the same Church of the holy Fathers, namely our predecessors, in memory of the blessed Lord Pope Leo, from whom your excellency received the pallium and privilege, executing the sanctions and statutes.

164
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:32,152
We release, ordain, and elevate the frequently mentioned holy Church of Lorch to metropolitan status by the authority and on behalf of the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles.

165
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:38,318
We confirm and strengthen the privileges handed down to us with our own hand, and we firmly establish them as valid.

166
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:45,865
Again, we give you the pallium with this present decree, according to the previously granted usage, to be held by your successors perpetually.

167
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:55,220
With these matters restored to justice, we have decided to settle your disputes and disagreements arising from the aforementioned cause, and to reconcile you to fraternal love.

168
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:03,352
We encourage you to uphold the honor of the pallium, so that, as ordained by the apostolic authority, you may no longer remain in contention and rivalry.

169
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:08,507
It is indeed recognized that according to canon law, each province appoints its own metropolitan.

170
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:20,642
So, we believe it's beneficial and peaceful to organize and define the parishes for you like this: the two provinces of the Noric region are divided, and Archbishop Herold is given the care and oversight of western Pannonia.

171
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:38,917
However, to you and your successors, due to the well-earned antiquity of the Holy Church of Lauriacum, which rightfully commands the respect of the younger generation, we entrust the responsibility for eastern Pannonia, as well as the regions of the Avars, Marahars, and the Slavs, who are now Christians or are yet to be converted through baptism.

172
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:49,314
We delegate our apostolic authority in these areas to preach, establish bishops where needed at your discretion, and arrange everything with such authority and power as if we were present ourselves.

173
00:24:49,314 --> 00:25:07,536
If the aforementioned Archbishop Herold or any of his successors is not satisfied with the set boundary and persistently tries to reclaim the diocese separated from his authority, and does not adhere to our apostolic traditions and determinations to avoid forbidden disputes, he shall be completely deprived of the gracious dignity granted to him.

174
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:15,465
According to ancient law, Upper Pannonia should be united with Lower Pannonia, and both should always be under the dominion of you and your successors.

175
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:21,504
We give our approval and consent to these most beneficial decrees of ours, bless them, and uphold them as Catholic.

176
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:37,100
But those who resist, attempt to undermine, or completely overturn them, we strike with the strictest anathema of the Holy Trinity, and we condemn them with the apostolic sentence by which Ananias and Sapphira perished, assigning them to eternal punishment with the blasphemers of the Holy Spirit.

177
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,398
LETTER 9. A LETTER FROM POPE AGAPETUS THE SECOND TO ABBOT AYMARD OF CLUNY.

178
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:43,335
The Privilege of the Abbey of Cluny.

179
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:57,972
AGAPETUS, servant of the servants of God, to our beloved son Aymard, the venerable abbot of the monastery of Cluny, established in honor of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, located in the Macon region, and through you to the same monastery and your successors forever.

180
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:05,775
It is the duty of the apostolic office to support with kind compassion the pious requests of those who ask and to grant them with eager devotion.

181
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:09,595
Through this, we especially earn a reward from God, the creator of all.

182
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:25,793
Therefore, since you have requested us to decree by our apostolic authority that the aforementioned monastery remains in the state decreed by Duke William in his testament, subject to the Holy Roman Church, which we serve by God's authority:
moved by your prayers, we grant you the right to govern it.

183
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:36,340
Thus, let that monastery, with all its possessions, whether it has them now or will receive them in the future, be free from the dominion of any king, bishop, count, or any of William's relatives.

184
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:52,914
No one should presume to appoint a leader there against the will of the monks after your death:
but they shall have the free authority, without consulting any prince, to appoint whomever they choose according to the rule of Saint Benedict;
unless, God forbid, they choose someone who consents to their vices.

185
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:55,982
Whoever wishes, let them prohibit this with zeal for God.

186
00:26:55,982 --> 00:27:04,646
Furthermore, we fully restore to you the tithes that once belonged to your chapels and have been taken away by the current authority or permission of any bishop.

187
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:12,771
We allow any chapels that have already been built or are to be built to remain, provided that nothing from the tithes is diminished from your churches.

188
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:20,144
Moreover, what our beloved son Bishop Bruno has granted you regarding the aforementioned chapels, we decree to be valid and firm forever.

189
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:28,098
Furthermore, we decree that a portion of the tithes from the vineyards and fields assigned to you should also benefit your hospital.

190
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:38,249
This includes what you are about to receive, such as what Leobald left to the mentioned monastery and what pertains to Magiona and other matters that should belong to that monastery.

191
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:49,683
We also reaffirm, with our apostolic authority, the abbey of the Carilocensis monastery granted to the same monastery, as well as the abbeys of Saint John and Saint Martin located in the suburb of Matisco.

192
00:27:49,683 --> 00:28:01,006
We decree that they shall permanently remain with the aforementioned place, ensuring that no bishop, count, or any individual may make decisions there without the command of the rector of the said place.

193
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:05,970
Similarly, we decree concerning the lands of Celsanicas, which belonged to Count Hecfred.

194
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:13,165
Our son Stephen, after careful consideration, assigned these lands to the aforementioned place for the benefit of all Christians.

195
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:34,471
Furthermore, we bolster with apostolic authority all villages belonging to the same Cluniac monastery, namely Solustriacum, Caninias, Seneciacum, Arpagiacum, Saint Victor, Scociolas, Kaerdasemscum, Dabormacum, and Piscatoria, known as Osa; Tosciacum, and the church of Saint Desiderius, Ambariacum, and the estate of Saviniacum, which Engelbald and Waldo, upon his conversion, gave.

196
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:48,359
Similarly, Amberia and the church of Saint Abundus, which Artald left to the aforementioned monastery upon his death, and the church of Saint Saturninus, along with all the estate that Gerald, the archbishop, donated to the aforementioned monastery.

197
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:59,347
And because the monastic order seeks utmost immunity, we grant you the reverence owed to holy places everywhere, ensuring no one may seize or invade your towns or any property without your consent.

198
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:07,658
To affirm that the aforementioned monastery belongs to the holy apostolic see for protection and support, ten solidi shall be given every five years.

199
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:28,704
If anyone tries to oppose this highly beneficial constitution of ours by resisting or attempting to corrupt any part of it, and does not follow everything we have decreed in this privilege,
let them be aware they will face eternal consequences under the threat of divine judgment and excommunication unless they repent, and will be separated from the kingdom of God and tormented endlessly with the devil.

200
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:40,980
However, whoever becomes the guardian and observer of this highly beneficial decree of ours, may they be worthy to receive a blessing from Christ the Lord and absolution from the holy apostles, judges of the world, both now and in the future.

201
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:48,234
Documented by the hand of Leo, the king's notary, and the scribe of the holy Roman Church, in the month of March, during the seventh indiction.

202
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,774
This is a letter from Pope Agapetus the Second to Abbot Williarius.

203
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:57,266
(Year Nine Hundred Fifty.)
It confirms Otto the Great's decision regarding the immunity of Saint Maximinus.

204
00:29:57,266 --> 00:30:03,579
Agapetus, servant of the servants of God, to the most reverent Abbot Williarius, sending all expressions of love in Christ.

205
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:14,716
We warmly welcomed the messengers you kindly sent, Asolf and Gunthar, to the thresholds of the holy apostles and our apostolic authority, and we listened attentively to their mission with all the Roman clergy present.

206
00:30:14,716 --> 00:30:27,034
We've learned from their reports that you have been frequently and significantly troubled by Ruotbert, although he is a venerable archbishop, because he unjustly wanted to subject the monastery entrusted to you to the church under his care.

207
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:37,402
Were it not for the fair judgment issued by the royal authority of the most serene Otto, along with the charters of Charlemagne and other ancient kings being read aloud, this issue would have continued.

208
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:57,264
Therefore, with the backing of our apostolic authority, all the Roman clergy decreed that regarding your monastery, the one founded near the walls of Trier in honor of Saint John the Evangelist and dedicated to the holy confessors Maximinus, Agritius, and Nicetius, the decisions written in the charters of King Otto and his predecessors, the kings of the Franks, shall remain unchanged.

209
00:30:57,264 --> 00:31:08,915
This means that now and in the future, it remains under royal authority alone and is never to be subjected to anyone else, except the abbot chosen by the brothers of the monastery through common agreement according to the rule.

210
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:24,261
If the aforementioned archbishop, any of his successors, or any other brother in the monastery unjustly and cruelly disturbs the peace, unless he first repents according to this present writing and then is admonished by apostolic authority, he is to be regarded not as a shepherd, but as a hireling.

211
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:31,246
Therefore, if he continues in such stubbornness, let him ultimately be excommunicated by our apostolic authority.

212
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:37,704
Furthermore, may he never succeed in his desires against the good kings, dukes, and just judges who oppose him.

213
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:40,439
Written by the scribe of the Holy Roman Church.

214
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,115
Given on February 28, in the eighth indiction.

215
00:31:43,115 --> 00:31:43,639
Farewell.

216
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:49,462
Eleven: Agapetus the Second, Privilege for the Monastery of Saints Germanus and Michael of Cuxa.

217
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:54,296
This document, from the year 950, confirms the privileges of the monastery of Cuxa.

218
00:31:54,296 --> 00:32:13,165
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, addresses Gondefred, the devout abbot of the venerable monastery of Saint Germanus and Saint Michael, located in the valley of Confluent at a place called Coxano, also known as Saint-Michel de Cusan, and to your successors, the abbots of the same monastery, for all time.

219
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:20,561
We are deeply concerned and attentive to all of God's Churches to ensure that they suffer no harm or loss due to any necessity.

220
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:42,104
So, because Soniarius, a devoted priest and monk, came to us on your behalf and requested that we affirm the aforementioned monastery to you and your successor abbots in its entirety, along with all its boundaries, limits, surroundings, and belongings forever;
moved by your requests and for the love of Almighty God and Saint Peter, we now confirm the said monastery with its boundaries and limits.

221
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:54,743
It starts on the eastern side, at the top of the ridge running from Bovaria to Jovem of Celerano, then goes from the mountain called Laccarias, and continues through Laccarias up to Mount Canigone, bordering Mount Canigone on the south.

222
00:32:54,743 --> 00:33:03,794
It descends through the ridge above Miliarias, reaches the cross above the estates, then to Chero Clarinto, and continues to the top of the ridge at the Merdario stream.

223
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:09,043
From the west, this ridge of Chero Clarinto meets the Merdario stream and leads to the Tede river.

224
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:18,522
On the north, it borders the public road that leads to Duas Sorores, passing through that road to Litterano, then beneath Saint Felicio, and extends to the estate of Saint Mary.

225
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:36,731
And the village of Tauriniano with the church of Saint Fructuosus, including tithes and first fruits, and the church of Saint Martin of Clerano, and the church of Saint Andrew, which is established in the village of Catellano with its estate, and the village of Torrente with its boundaries and limits, as stated in your authentic writings.

226
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:48,567
And the valley of Taresago and estates, and the cell of Saint Vincent with its estate, as detailed in your writings, and the estate of Tonegale, Manzunculas, Ocenias, Tres-Valles, and Lare with the church of Saint Andrew.

227
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:57,297
The cell of Saint Thomas with its estate, the church of Saint Peter founded in the village of Inforcadis, Laguna with its church, and your estates in these places.

228
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:27,393
In the county of Roussillon, there are several villages and valleys: Miliarii, Camelas, Relano, Saint Felix, the windy valley, Mount Auriolo, Insula, the valley of Locas, Puio Nadalino, the valley of Vincano, Saorla, Arbussolas, Planicolas, Interrivos, the valley of Molegica, Orto Falguerias, Arriano, Folioliis, Verneto, Corneliano, the valley of Foliano, the valley of Savrra, Torre Sindo, Pino, Campelias, Segondaniano, Juloss, Flazano, Angerro, Enne, Porciliarios, Evole, and Altino.

229
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:32,996
In the county of Cerdanya, you'll find the village of Sallagosa, along with Onzes and Annes.

230
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:41,219
In Fenouilledes, there are the villages of Tavernulas and Sauriniano, or Perolas, Vallemagna with its church, and the valley of Stavia.

231
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:49,441
In the county of Bergitan, there are the villages of Gilmari and Canes, and other locations where the monastery's property is situated.

232
00:34:49,441 --> 00:35:01,744
In the counties of Roussillon, the valley of Conflent, Cerdanya, Fenouilledes, and Bergitan, these mentioned places and counties hold as much as the monastery possesses or is recorded in your documents.

233
00:35:01,744 --> 00:35:07,590
With God's help, you will acquire these, along with the boundaries and limits of your monastery.

234
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:20,746
We also grant you the first fruits and tithes from your lands, and the offerings to be gathered for the aforementioned monastery, including all its possessions of the Holy Roman Church, which we serve by God's grace.

235
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:32,135
Through this privilege, we establish your monastery and associated places or churches, starting from this ninth indiction, for you and your successors, the servants of God dwelling there.

236
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:41,393
They will lead a monastic life, governed with the fear of God, and remain securely and peacefully under apostolic protection, subject to no other power.

237
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:49,371
Additionally, by apostolic authority, we command that Christ's faithful should be kindly received in hospitality, according to God.

238
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,061
When you leave this world, ensure that only someone from the same community is chosen as abbot.

239
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:58,741
The abbot should be selected by the community, following God's will.

240
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:06,533
We command with apostolic authority that no one, regardless of status, should ever try to force or intrude upon the monastery or its properties.

241
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:15,895
Therefore, under divine judgment and the threat of anathema, we declare that none of our successors, nor anyone of any rank, should dare to violate this apostolic privilege.

242
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:26,556
While we don't expect it to happen, anyone who acts otherwise should know they are excommunicated, bound by anathema, alienated from God's kingdom, and cast into Tartarus to perish with the wicked.

243
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:32,780
However, those who serve as guardians and observers deserve to receive abundant blessings from Christ our Lord God.

244
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,166
Written by Leo, notary of the region and scribe of the Holy Roman Church, in December, during the specified indiction.

245
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:39,653
Farewell.

246
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:50,009
Agapetus, servant of the servants of God, extends greetings to the most reverend and holy Wisadus, bishop of the holy Church of Urgell, and to your successors forever.

247
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:59,209
It's appropriate for apostolic leaders to assist those strong in pious religion with kind compassion and to fulfill their requests with devoted eagerness.

248
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:08,708
By doing so, we undoubtedly earn the greatest reward from God, the creator of all things, when venerable places, duly organized, are brought to a better state.

249
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:47,720
Therefore, since you have asked us to confirm the aforementioned bishopric of the Church of Urgell, including all its buildings, villages, churches, parishes, houses, vineyards, lands, fields, meadows, pastures, forests, saltpeter deposits, fruit-bearing trees, non-fruit-bearing trees of various kinds, wells, fountains, streams, mills, fisheries, waters and watercourses, castles, mountains, valleys, hills, clearings, and adjacent lands, whether cultivated or uncultivated, as well as the areas pertaining to the same bishopric, namely the region of Cerdanya, Llivia, Berga, Pallars, Ribagorza, Jussa, Cardona, Anabi, and Terbi, and the places of St.

250
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,754
Deodata with their boundaries, and Fencris with their boundaries, and Submonte with their boundaries.

251
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:53,814
.

252
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:53,874
.

253
00:37:53,874 --> 00:38:11,378
We also confirm the third part of the toll of the same bishopric, along with the market rights, and everything that generally and entirely pertains to this bishopric from all its places within the aforementioned bishopric, from the territory of Urgell, Cerdanya, Berga, Pallars, and Ribagorza.

254
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:19,384
We also confirm to you and your successors the first fruits and tithes from the places and properties of the aforementioned bishopric.

255
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:31,093
Furthermore, we establish that no person, whoever they may be, should presume to unjustly impose restrictions or unjust laws upon the clergy of your bishopric in collaboration with any lay person.

256
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:40,086
The aforementioned bishopric, with all its possessions, has been confirmed and solidified by the authority of the Frankish kings through a written decree.

257
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:42,647
We also confirm it by our apostolic authority.

258
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:55,564
From now on and in the future, whatever you and your successors lawfully acquire, starting from this year of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, 991, in the tenth indiction, we confirm and establish through your royal decrees.

259
00:38:55,564 --> 00:39:00,909
This privilege allows you and your successors to hold, possess, and manage with the fear of God.

260
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:08,704
No king, prince, count, marquis, judge, or any person, big or small, should presume to use force or invade the bishopric or its possessions.

261
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:22,178
Therefore, under the divine judgment and the threat of excommunication, we decree that none of our pontifical successors, nor any individual, great or small, should dare to act unjustly against this apostolic privilege or attempt to break it.

262
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:38,937
If anyone, though we do not believe this will happen, attempts to break it in any way, let them know that unless they repent, by the authority of God and Saint Peter the apostle, and ours, as his vicar, they shall be bound by the unbreakable chains of excommunication and alienated from God's kingdom.

263
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:49,795
With the devil and his terrible followers, and Judas the traitor of Our Lord Jesus Christ, they shall be consumed in fire; and let them perish, plunged into the abyss of Tartarus with the wicked.

264
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:59,817
But whoever acts as a guardian and observer will gain the grace of blessing and the reward of heaven from the just judge, Our Lord God, and will deserve to partake in eternal life.

265
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:00,095
Amen.

266
00:40:00,095 --> 00:40:00,596
Farewell.

267
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:10,451
This was written by the hand of Leo, the regional notary and scribe of our holy Roman Church, in the month of December, in the aforementioned year, in the indiction named above.

268
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:22,924
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, to Sunyer, the devoted abbot of the esteemed monastery of the holy Mother of God, Mary, our lady, located in the county of Carcassonne, by the river Orb.

269
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:27,069
And after you, to your successors in the same revered monastery forever.

270
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:35,533
It is appropriate for the apostolic authority to support those who excel in devout faith with kind compassion and to eagerly approve those who ask.

271
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:43,536
By doing this, we undoubtedly gain the greatest reward from God, the creator of all, when venerable places are improved and well-organized.

272
00:40:43,536 --> 00:41:06,163
Therefore, through your representative, Arnulf, the humble abbot of Ripoll, you requested that we confirm the aforementioned monastery, with all its properties, including churches, villages, houses, lands, vineyards, fields, meadows, pastures, woods, groves, threshing floors, and presses, waters, watercourses, mills with their water sources and fisheries, whether cultivated or uncultivated.

273
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:22,456
This also includes, in the county of Carcassonne, the village of Agrifolio, with the church of Saint Cyricus and its boundaries, the village of Verzeliano with the church of Saint Mary and its boundaries, and the village of Cucuniano with the church of Saint Mary and its boundaries.

274
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:26,659
And also half, and as much as in the already mentioned county that place.

275
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:26,717
.

276
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:26,774
.

277
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:27,177
before.

278
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:27,235
.

279
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:27,292
.

280
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:38,439
We confirm the following holdings: in the county of Toulouse and its districts, the church of Saint Mary, Saint Savior, and Saint John in Ercino, including the place of Camboni with all its assets.

281
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:47,710
This includes everything granted by Simplicius, the archdeacon, and his relatives, as recorded in their documents, along with any acquisitions you've made in these areas.

282
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:58,562
In the county of Redense, we affirm all that Simplicius, the archdeacon, granted, covering both parishes and other locations, including the villages of Boxamaurea and Aureliosa with all their rights.

283
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:10,287
In the suburb of Petrapertusiense, we recognize what Roger gave in Cucuniano, Retgas in Ollito with its church, and in Paterno, from the village of Corneliano to the previously mentioned areas, as granted by Holiba.

284
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:31,937
This includes the village of Corneliano with its church, the village of Stagello with its church, and any holdings in the village of Gologias with its church, half of Vernettum with its church, the village of Ripas Altas with its church, and the Villar itself with its church, the village of Coningos with its church, and the villages of Palsas, including fishing rights in the village of Canonae.

285
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:36,464
In the county of Confluent, we confirm all your holdings in the meadows and fields.

286
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:42,408
In the county of Girona, this includes the church of Saint Felix in the village of Lorostaria and its church.

In the county of Besalu, we recognize the church of Saint Stephen and Saint Peregrine, the village of Enuscho, and Mediano with its church and associated properties.

288
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:57,187
Additionally, we confirm holdings in Barcelona, Oriellense, Sardari, Cabastense, Albiense, and Minerbense.

289
00:42:57,187 --> 00:43:08,966
In the county of Narbonne, we acknowledge the village of Erciam with its church, and on the island of Sici, the church of Saint Peter with its belongings, along with all that Remigius, the archdeacon, provided there.

290
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:21,891
In Toulouse, this includes the village of Palma and the villages of Alianto, Fabriciano, and Ferrales, as well as the holdings of Fabarios of Saint Stephen and Saint Genesius, and in the village of Miliano, as much as they possess there.

291
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:28,763
In the county of Ausona, we confirm the church of Saint Martin, along with its tithes and belongings, and in the village of R.

292
00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:28,817
.

293
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:28,872
.

294
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:40,122
In the region and settlement of Asenario, along with Salmas near Narbonne by the lagoon, everything they have there, or anything that fully belongs to the aforementioned monastery, is acknowledged.

295
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:48,016
We affirm your rights to the bridge toll, boat toll, salt toll, and market toll, just as the kings have granted you through their written decrees.

296
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:55,964
We also decree that when the abbot of the monastery passes away, no king, count, or anyone motivated by greed or vanity should appoint a new abbot.

297
00:43:55,964 --> 00:44:02,776
Instead, all the servants of God in that monastery should elect abbots according to God's will and the rule of Saint Benedict.

298
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:07,912
The aforementioned monastery is located in the Carcassonne territory, near the Narbonne region.

299
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:16,022
Additionally, we confirm to you and your successors the rights to the places and properties of that holy monastery, including first fruits and tithes.

300
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:22,185
Furthermore, we reaffirm that no one should wrongfully subject the monks of your monastery to unjust secular laws.

301
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:40,676
Since the aforementioned monastery is confirmed and strengthened by a decree of the King of the Franks, and by our apostolic authority as stated above, and influenced by the prayers of your envoy, Abbot Arnulf, as well as the royal decrees and other privileges, we confirm and establish this for you and your successors to hold in perpetuity.

302
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:53,327
From now on, you are to administer and govern with the fear of God, ensuring that no king, prince, count, margrave, judge, or anyone, great or small, ever presumes to commit any force or invasion upon that monastery or its properties.

303
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:09,425
Therefore, invoking divine judgment and under the threat of anathema, we declare and decree that none of our successors, and as we have stated above, no person, great or small, should dare or presume to act against this, our apostolic privilege, in any way, nor attempt to break it.

304
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:26,480
However, if anyone-which we do not believe will happen-tries to break it in any way, let them know that unless they repent, by the authority of Almighty God and Saint Peter, the chief of the apostles, and our own, who serve as his representative, they will be bound indissolubly with the chains of anathema.

305
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:35,146
They will be alienated from the kingdom of God, along with the devil and his most atrocious displays, and with Judas, the betrayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.

306
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:41,535
They will be eternally consumed by fire and plunged into the abyss and chaos of Tartarus to perish with the wicked.

307
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:49,646
Written by the hand of Stephen, notary and secretary of the holy and apostolic Roman Church, in the month of December, during the tenth indiction.

308
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,146
Farewell.

309
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:54,590
XV. Privilege Granted by Pope Agapetus the Second to Maimbodus, Bishop of Macon.

310
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:02,820
(Year Nine Hundred Forty-Six to Nine Hundred Fifty-Four.)
This confirms the privileges and possessions of the Church of Saint Vincent of Macon for the canons.

311
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:11,519
Agapetus, bishop, servant of the servants of God, extends greetings to the most reverend and holy Maimbodus, bishop of the Church of Macon, and his successors forever.

312
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:28,760
Since the teachings of Peter, the prince of the blessed apostles, advance the state of all holy churches of God, and what has fallen is restored by his support, it is appropriate that the holy Church of Macon, which is suffering a reduction in its diocese and lacking in dignities, should be quickly restored to maintain its honor.

313
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:40,479
Therefore, realizing it is shaken in all things, it is right to extend our helping hand for its restoration, so that, nourished by the source of the blessed apostle Peter and with the help of Christ, it may regain its honors.

314
00:46:40,479 --> 00:47:03,241
Let all devotees and the faithful of the holy churches of God understand that Maimbodus, our beloved bishop and spiritual son, has suggested to our apostolic benevolence that we grant his canons and laypeople residing in the Church of Saint Vincent the Martyr the right not to appoint a bishop from elsewhere unless chosen among themselves by the canons, together with the aforementioned religious laypeople, as the sacred canons decree.

315
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:07,304
We also grant to him and his successors that due honor should always be given.

316
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:18,763
We confirm to the aforementioned canons all the possessions given by the decrees of kings or the generosity of faithful men and women of Christ in that place, so that they may have them without any contradiction forever.

317
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:28,972
This includes the Abbey of Saint Clement the Martyr, located in the suburb of the aforementioned city, with all its integrity, churches, lands, and servants, both male and female, belonging to it.

318
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:42,515
Also included is the Church of Saint Desiderius located in the village of Vergiaco, with the small land of Saint Peter adjacent to it from the episcopate in the aforementioned village, along with the Church of Saint Romanus located in the village of Cathenaco.

319
00:47:42,984 --> 00:48:00,450
However, concerning the tithes from the ninths and tenths, as well as the thefts from the aforementioned district, and a third of the forest near the Arar River, along with the villa of Adolani, these were granted just as our beloved son, the pious King Louis, agreed with Bishop Maimbodus regarding the tithes and land.

320
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:07,765
Marquis Hugo and the very moderate Count Leothald also consented, driven by their passion for the growth of the aforementioned church.

321
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:25,941
Therefore, through this apostolic privilege, we grant perpetual holding of the tithes of Saint Alban the Martyr and Gisario:
so that from now on, whatever has been given or granted in this place, or whatever divine mercy wishes to increase in the future by any person, they may hold and possess without any disturbance or compulsion.

322
00:48:25,941 --> 00:48:34,838
This is with the condition that no king, duke, count, tax collector, or public official shall impose any forced service, restriction, burden, or command over them.

323
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:40,406
Except for what the faithful canons of the aforementioned place wish to grant from their own goodwill.

324
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:50,886
Establishing and proclaiming before God and His terrible judgment, through the confirmation of this apostolic privilege, we decree by the authority of blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles.

325
00:48:50,886 --> 00:49:09,008
We urge future bishops of the apostolic see, as well as those administering ecclesiastical functions, and individuals of all ranks, that no one shall have permission in any way to separate or alienate any of these chapters, granted by us, from the often-mentioned place, especially for the grace of apostolic prayer joined together.

326
00:49:09,336 --> 00:49:40,149
If anyone, though we do not expect it, recklessly dares to oppose what has been piously and firmly decreed by our authority through this privilege of ours,
or presumes to go against or transgress in any way the things ordained by us for the glory of God and the stability of the aforementioned church,
let them know they are bound by the authority of Saint Peter, the chief of the apostles, whose unworthy representatives we are,
and are to be punished with eternal fire along with the devil and his most terrible followers, as well as Judas, the betrayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.

327
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:53,514
However, whoever, with pious intent, acts as a guardian and observer in all things, keeping this apostolic decree with reverence for God,
may they receive eternal blessing from our most merciful Lord God and be deemed worthy to partake in eternal life.

328
00:49:53,568 --> 00:49:56,883
Epistle of Pope Agapetus the Second to the People of Auvergne.

329
00:49:56,883 --> 00:50:02,178
(Year Nine Forty-Six to Nine Fifty-Five.)
Bandits should be kept away from the Celsinian Monastery.

330
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:11,216
AGAPETUS, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the children of God's holy Church dwelling in Auvergne, eternal peace and everlasting salvation in Christ Jesus.

331
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:17,098
We are deeply astonished as to why those entrusted with pastoral care among you have their minds' eyes closed.

332
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:33,035
They allow the holy Church, as has been reported to us, to be torn apart by the rage of the wicked, devastated, and stripped of its possessions, without standing as a wall for the house of Israel, nor standing in battle on the day of the Lord to use their authority to confront robbers and bandits.

333
00:50:33,035 --> 00:50:39,078
Instead, they see their own mother dishonored and remain silent, not rebuking the wrongdoers with harsh reproach.

334
00:50:39,078 --> 00:51:50,847
It seems as though we either ignore or are not at all afraid of that terrible voice which said: "Cursed is he who keeps his sword from blood" from the book of Jeremiah, Chapter Forty-Eight, Verse Ten.
Therefore, we express our sorrow to all of you, fearing that the wrath of God, from His sanctuary, that is, from the foolish prelates, may be justly allowed to strike down upon their sheep.
You know well, brothers, and if anyone is unaware, let them become aware, that the place of Celsinian belongs specifically to the holy Roman Church since its founding and has remained under its protection from the beginning.
We have determined that it should be cherished with special love and judged to be elevated with great honor at all times.
This is not without reason, for the beneficial fragrance of the monastic order arising from that place seems to be spreading usefully in our regions, by the grace of God.
Therefore, we ask and beseech you, and earnestly implore you, to ensure that you show reverence to the aforementioned place and that no one presumes to disturb those serving God there.
If anyone unjustly holds anything from the land belonging to the said monastery or those monks, or from their family against the will of the abbot of that monastery, we command by our apostolic authority that they hasten to return it without delay.

335
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:55,209
If he doesn't do this, we order him to come before us to explain his reasons.

336
00:51:55,209 --> 00:52:05,600
But if he also refuses to do that, he will be punished and bound by our excommunication, as we act, though unworthy, in the place of the blessed Peter, whose rights he unjustly invades without fear.

337
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:21,975
Therefore, we specifically beseech and command Lord Stephen, the bishop of Arverni, on our behalf, since the Celsinianias monastery is in his diocese, that he should not hesitate to use the sword of excommunication against all those who destroy the property of the monastery or harm the monastic community there.

338
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:28,378
They should be excluded from the holy Church of God until they are compelled to make amends with appropriate satisfaction.

339
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:31,286
XVII. LETTER OF AGAPETUS II TO LANDULF OF CAPUA.

340
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:35,754
(Year 946-955.)
Urges against violating the freedom of the monastery of Capua.

341
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:40,223
AGAPETUS, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to LANDULF, Prince of Capua.

342
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:46,640
We have learned, and it pains us deeply, that the monks of Monte Cassino are acting dishonorably and shamefully.

343
00:52:46,640 --> 00:53:00,447
No faithful person is unaware of how harmful and wicked this is, as the Prophet testifies:
"The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are regarded as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!"
(Lamentations 4:1).

344
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:07,437
These monks, who should serve God according to the rule of Saint Benedict, seem instead to be living in towns and streets.

345
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:14,770
Abandoning the monastic life, they follow their own desires and pleasures as if that were the rule, instead of serving the Lord.

346
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:26,859
This misconduct reflects on your late father Landulf, who, by building a monastery within Capua, not out of reverence for God but for temporal glory, ignored the danger to souls, aiming to control the monastery.

347
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:34,937
He wanted to rest with a corrupted flock so that the entire possession of the monastery would be left to his heirs as if by hereditary right.

348
00:53:34,937 --> 00:54:00,661
We are deeply saddened by this and surprised that such a great man did not reconsider his blind greed, which took over the property of the ruined church of Cassino against the Prophet's words:
"All the princes who have said: Let us take possession of the sanctuary of God for ourselves; My God, make them like a wheel, as stubble before the wind, as the fire that burns the forest, and as the flame that sets the mountains on fire"
(Psalm 83:13-15).

349
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:03,411
May God avert such things from him, if possible.

350
00:54:03,411 --> 00:54:20,369
However, he was frequently warned, and as long as he lived, as Abbot Baldwin himself testifies, he admitted his guilt before his bishop and fully restored the aforementioned monastery with all its possessions to the same abbot, leaving no further power of dominion for himself or his descendants.

351
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,151
Let us now give thanks to God for the reverence of the blessed Father Benedict.

352
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:31,773
We have decided to ordain the Capuan monastery with the mentioned abbot and strengthen it with the privilege of our authority.

353
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:47,698
By the authority of God and the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, we establish and ordain that in this Capuan monastery, which was built not out of love for God but out of worldly desire, one, two, or at most three elder monks, whose lives are beyond doubt, should remain to manage and guard it.

354
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:58,787
All other monks, both senior and junior, along with all the monastery's possessions, should return to the main monastery of Monte Cassino to serve God there, living under the rule of the blessed Father Benedict.

355
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:15,973
It has been defined and proclaimed since ancient times by our predecessors, emperors, and kings, that it should not be subject to the rule of any prince, duke, steward, or any great or small person in any way, but should be governed and managed with fear of God under our and the kings' protection, under the abbot's direction.

356
00:55:15,973 --> 00:55:43,565
Anyone who presumes to act otherwise, or attempts to make any arrangement concerning this monastery, or presumes to invade the possessions of the aforementioned monastery, and attempts to break this our apostolic command in any way, should know that, unless they repent, by the authority of God and the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, and our authority, acting in his place, they are excommunicated, deprived of the church's entry, and of the body and blood of Christ, and segregated from the company of Christians.

357
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:48,821
Furthermore, they should know they are bound by the chains of anathema by the sanction of privilege.

358
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:56,126
However, whoever acts as a guardian, observer, and helper will multiply the grace of blessing and heavenly reward from Christ our Lord God.

359
00:55:56,126 --> 00:56:01,907
We command that this apostolic command be held as a testimony for the future for the aforementioned monastery.

360
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:02,866
Letter 18.

361
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:07,823
A letter from Pope Agapetus the Second to Archbishop Wilhelm of Mainz, Year Nine Fifty-Five.

362
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:11,864
He grants the same privilege that Maximus the Second had given to Friduric.

363
00:56:11,864 --> 00:56:28,404
Inspired by brotherly love and guided by the faith of the ancients, we cannot deny you and the holy Church of Mainz, which you lead, the requests your messengers have brought to the holy seat of the prince of the apostles and our apostolic authority, just as our predecessors did not deny your predecessors.

364
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:50,333
We understand from your letters that Saint Boniface, your predecessor, received this authority from Gregory the Second, Gregory the Third, and Zachary, among our predecessors, and indeed from our predecessor Marino to Friduric, our fellow brother and your predecessor, so that he might serve as the overseer of the holy seat of Mainz across all parts of Germany and Gaul, as an apostolic vicar and emissary.

365
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:59,977
Thus, if he encountered anyone straying from the path of justice, he could summon them, admonish, correct, and organize a synod wherever needed, wielding the power of the apostle.

366
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:21,690
Since you profess faith and submission as nearly all previous overseers of the holy seat of Mainz have done, we grant you the same authority that our previous apostolic leaders granted to your predecessors:
so you may correct the wicked and those living depraved lives, guiding them back to the path of truth through your exhortations, as you know, our vicar was sent to the regions of Germany and Gaul.

367
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:40,062
Wherever you find bishops, priests, deacons, monks, or people of any status violating the canons and constitutions of the holy Fathers, or disregarding ecclesiastical rule, do not hesitate to correct them with apostolic authority, in accordance with the canons and constitutions of the holy Fathers, and guide them back to the path of truth.

368
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:50,900
We grant you, the provisional metropolitan of the Mainz seat, the authority to convene a synod wherever it seems appropriate for the regions of Germany and Gaul, without facing opposition from anyone.

369
00:57:50,900 --> 00:58:00,891
However, if anyone, God forbid, tries to oppose you, the apostolic vicar, by appealing to the apostolic seat, they should know they will not receive our decision before the time you have set.

370
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:05,232
They will lose the apostolic blessing and be bound by the chain of excommunication.

371
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:13,915
We also write a privilege for the holy seat of Mainz, stating that if anyone, regardless of their position, attempts to plunder it, they themselves will be plundered.

372
00:58:13,915 --> 00:58:21,760
Unless they repent, they will be bound by the eternal chain of excommunication, imposed by apostolic authority, which has the power to bind and loose.

373
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,834
They will have to account for it on the day of judgment, by which I mean the day of all traitors.

374
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:37,536
Nineteen: Privilege of Pope Agapetus the Second for the Monastery of Saints Stephen, Dionysius, and Sylvester in Capite (Year Nine Hundred Fifty-Five)

375
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:38,829
In the name of the Lord.

376
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:44,541
This is a copy of the privilege written on parchment, and here's what it says, though it's barely legible.

377
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:58,714
AGAPETUS, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the beloved in Christ, Leo, a devout son, priest, and monk, appointed and ordained by us as abbot of the venerable monastery of the saints, martyrs of Christ, Stephen and Dionysius, and the confessor Sylvester.

378
00:58:58,714 --> 00:59:07,821
This monastery is known as being at the head of the former Pope Paul, and it is for you and your successors, the abbots and monks residing in the same monastery forever.

379
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:17,037
It is fitting for apostolic governance to assist those who excel in pious religion with benevolent compassion and to support their perpetual devotion with an eager spirit.

380
00:59:17,037 --> 00:59:26,575
This earns the highest reward from the Creator of all, the Lord, for those who are worthy of mercy, or for venerable places of the saints, undoubtedly brought to a better state.

381
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:39,886
Therefore, because your religiousness has humbly requested our apostolic authority to grant and confirm to you and your successors forever the aforementioned monastery with all its churches, buildings, and appurtenances, both within and around it.

382
00:59:39,886 --> 00:59:50,987
This includes the mountain called Augustus of Saint Angel at its summit, along with the vineyards and lands around that mountain, and the church of Saint Nicholas in its entirety with all its appurtenances.

383
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:56,160
The borders are defined on one side by the public road leading under the arch known as Virgin's.

384
00:59:56,592 --> 01:00:01,366
The form itself is hidden; it's the very form of the Virgin and the mountain known as Pinzi.

385
01:00:01,366 --> 01:00:10,914
On the third side, there's the wall of this city of Rome and the gate of Saint Valentine, and on the fourth side, the wall extends back to the Posterula, which belongs to Saint Agatha.

386
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:25,341
The road next to the Posterula leads by the mentioned church into the public road, and the sowing land held by Constantius, a nobleman, as well as the public road that goes to the Posterula from Pigna, the church of Saint Blaise, and leads to the form of the Virgin with lands .

387
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:25,393
.

388
01:00:25,393 --> 01:00:25,445
.

389
01:00:25,445 --> 01:00:25,912
benefits.

390
01:00:25,912 --> 01:00:37,692
We also confirm to you the entire monastery of Saint Valentine, with all its buildings and surroundings, and its properties everywhere, said to be outside the gate of Saint Valentine, which rightfully belongs to your monastery.

391
01:00:37,692 --> 01:00:45,580
Additionally, we grant and confirm to you the Molvian Bridge in its entirety with all its entrances and exits and gifts and tributes in the same manner.

392
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:59,696
The vacant sowing land, about a bushel of wheat, with all that pertains to it, is located before the gate of Saint Valentine next to the often-mentioned wall of this city of Rome, and it neighbors, on one side, the Fossant, that is, the Carbonaria between the wall itself.

393
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:02,290
This land extends from there to the larger river .

394
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:02,342
.

395
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:02,394
.

396
01:01:02,394 --> 01:01:08,414
public road which leads and returns to Saint Valentine, and on the fourth side, the rights of the Holy Roman Church.

397
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:18,378
Moreover, another sowing land in its entirety, with all that pertains to it, is positioned with the right hand there going to Saint Valentine with the larger arch within it, called Passarana .

398
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:18,430
.

399
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:18,481
.

400
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:28,705
in the place known as Orto Pisce, between neighbors on one side already mentioned public road, and on the second side, the fountain of living water which is shared between the monastery and heirs .

401
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:28,757
.

402
01:01:28,757 --> 01:01:28,809
.

403
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:41,010
Once, to Gregory, the custodian of the school of the confession of Blessed Peter, extending up to the top of the ancient wall, and on the third side, land from the venerable monastery of Saint Cyriacus, known as Via Lata.

404
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:45,767
It runs straight along the boundary leading up the slope of the mountain called Bassitulo.

405
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:52,745
On the fourth side, it borders the public road that descends through the valley named Bussitudo and leads out onto the Via Flaminia.

406
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:59,828
We also confirm for you the entire estate, which Girulo owns, complete with various trees and everything generally associated with it.

407
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:09,290
This property appears to belong to you according to the series of writings mentioned earlier, located in the area of Saint Valentine, approximately one mile from the city of Rome.

The boundaries include, on one side, the public road with ancient stone leading to Sanguinaria, and on the second side, a small stream that flows from beneath the mountain of the aforementioned Girulo or the meadow of the venerable monastery of Saint Cyriacus.

This includes everything generally pertaining to it, as it was once granted to your aforementioned monastery through an exchange document by Alberic, the former senator of all Romans.

414
01:02:56,811 --> 01:03:14,044
He and his siblings, Constantius, a nobleman, Sergius, bishop of the holy church of Nepi, along with Bertha and another Bertha, subscribed and consented with their own hands, specifically for the valley of Saint Vitus, which Alberic donated to the venerable monastery of Saint Agnes, placed from your aforementioned monastery.

Just as John, known as Oudino, once did through a charter gift in your aforementioned monastery, with sowable lands, sand pits, fields, meadows, pastures, buildings, ruins, and adjacent flat areas and wells; whether cultivated or uncultivated, with all things that generally and completely pertain to it located outside the Salarian Bridge, about a mile from that bridge.

This plot also consists of gravel pits, ruins, and specific areas, whether they are in use, cultivated, or left uncultivated, along with everything generally associated with them.

443
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:05,202
These are situated outside the gate of Saint John, known as the Via Latina, approximately nine miles from the city of Rome.

If anyone, whether one of our successors as pontiff, a powerful person, or someone of lower status, regardless of their rank, presumes for any reason or pretext to disrupt or diminish what we have established and confirmed for the worship of God, and, though we do not wish it, tries to take away or alienate any place, possession, or anything recognized as belonging to the aforementioned monastery, let them know that by the authority of our Lord and the blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, they are bound by an unbreakable anathema and alienated from the kingdom of God.

539
01:20:35,115 --> 01:20:45,848
All the saints resting in that same monastery stand against them, and they will be called before the judgment seat of Almighty God on the dreadful day of judgment to account to those same saints.

They will be condemned with the devil and his most wicked followers, and with Judas, the betrayer of our God and Savior Jesus Christ, along with all the impious, to be consumed in the infernal fire and unquenchable blaze and the abyss of chaos forever.

Therefore, it is our duty to care with a sincere pastoral heart and to diligently provide the support they require.

574
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:15,763
The grants we have made for the sanctity, honor, praise, and glory of our Lord Almighty's divine majesty to our venerable places should be acceptable and bring us abundant mercy, worthy of this kind of pious work, as a reward in the heavenly realms.

575

579

This is to ensure that from you and your successors, each according to the ecclesiastical regulations, a tribute of ten silver coins.

580
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:12,891
.

581
01:27:12,891 --> 01:27:12,948
.

582
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:19,936
Twelve denarii should be paid promptly for our improvement or decision, ensuring there is no doubt in handling this matter.

583
01:27:19,936 --> 01:27:23,849
Moreover, there should be no delay from you in making the annual payment.

584
01:27:23,849 --> 01:27:28,190
It should be given to the shareholders of our holy Church at the designated time.

585
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:46,735
We decree with apostolic authority, by the authority of the blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, under the threat of divine judgment and anathema, that none of our successor pontiffs or any other person, regardless of their status, should presume to remove these aforementioned places from the power and control of the aforementioned monastery.

586
01:27:46,735 --> 01:28:01,153
If anyone, regardless of their status, dares to act against this apostolic command of ours with reckless boldness, let them know they are bound by the chain of anathema, alienated from the kingdom of God, and condemned with all the wicked to eternal punishment by fire.

587
01:28:01,153 --> 01:28:07,264
However, whoever observes this command is deserving of grace, mercy, and eternal life from our most merciful Lord.

588
01:28:07,264 --> 01:28:13,374
Written by the hand of Leo, scribe of the holy Roman Church, in the month of October, in the thirteenth indiction.

589
01:28:13,374 --> 01:28:13,856

01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:30,683
Agapetus, bishop and servant of the servants of God, grants to Baldwin, a beloved son and abbot of the venerable Monastery of Monte Cassino, and to all those who enter it in accordance with the rules, forever.

592
01:28:30,683 --> 01:28:39,537
It is fitting for apostolic leadership to provide compassionate assistance to those strong in pious religion and to grant suitable support to just desires.

593
01:28:39,537 --> 01:29:22,550
Therefore, because you have requested us to grant you the Monastery of Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Christ, which has long been in ruins and deserted, along with its churches, cells, waters, streams, lands, fields, pastures, forests, cultivated or uncultivated, and everything generally belonging in entirety to the aforementioned monastery, situated in the territory of Terracina within these boundaries:
From the first boundary, the farm called Vorke, and the farm Clevini;
From the second boundary, descending the mountain slope as it ascends by the foot of the mountain, under the very mountain, by the foot of Mount Lacui, and as it goes to Campilla Mountain, by the Balanus stream, the mountain of Montania, and the farm Rustizanu and Tauri.

594
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:29,747

595
01:29:29,975 --> 01:29:39,016
By the authority of the holy Roman law, which we serve under God's guidance for the Church, we are obliged to grant you the right to maintain it for all time.

596
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:52,061
In response to your requests, through this decree, we grant you and your successors the right to hold the aforementioned monastery and everything related to it, as stated above, starting from the present 14th indiction, forever.

597
01:29:52,061 --> 01:30:10,141
We decree and proclaim, under divine judgment and the threat of excommunication, that none of our successors, nor any person of any rank, should presume to take away what you have received from us for the restoration and return to its former status, for the salvation of the soul of our spiritual daughter Stephania.

598
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:23,759
However, if anyone, which we do not wish, should dare to oppose this apostolic decree of ours, let them know they are bound by the authority of God and of the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles, and excluded from the kingdom of God.

599
01:30:23,759 --> 01:30:36,061
But those who, with pious intent, act as guardians and observers of this apostolic constitution of ours in all things, may they merit to obtain the grace of blessing and mercy from our righteous judge, the Lord God.

600
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:43,785
Written by the hand of Acritioneri, the scribe of the holy Roman Church, in the month of October, in the aforementioned 14th indiction.

601
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:44,300
Farewell.

602
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:52,939
Given on the 17th day before the Kalends of November, by the hand of Andrew, the divine, with regard to grace, the treasurer of the holy apostolic see.

603
01:30:52,939 --> 01:31:05,470
In the year, by God's favor, of the pontificate of Lord Agapitus, the supreme pontiff and universal pope, in the most holy seat of the blessed Peter the apostle, the 10th year, in the aforementioned month and indiction.

604
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:11,088
Twenty-Two: Privilege of Pope Agapetus II for the Cell of St. Mary and St.

605
01:31:11,088 --> 01:31:14,714
Hunegund of Humolaria (Year Nine Hundred Fifty-Five)

606
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:21,934
In the name of the holy and inseparable Trinity:
I, Agapetus, with the help of Christ's mercy, am the bishop of the holy Roman seat.

607
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:27,568
When we respond favorably to the holy requests of the devout, we believe we are serving the Lord's will.

608
01:31:27,568 --> 01:31:47,285
Therefore, let it be known to all the children of the Catholic Mother Church that our son, the child of glorious nature, Lothair, King of the Franks, has humbly asked us to strengthen a certain cell located in the region of Vermandois, built in honor of the blessed Mother of God, Mary, and Saint Hunegundis, the virgin, with the protection of apostolic authority.

609
01:31:47,285 --> 01:32:03,861
At the suggestion of his father, King Louis, and equally to himself, King Lothair, Count Adalbert, and a suitable man named Eibert, who possessed the same little abbey by right of benefice, are trying to elevate it to the venerable worship of sacred religion and strive to reinforce it with a royal decree.

610
01:32:03,861 --> 01:32:09,224
Rejoicing in his request, we exercise the strength of ecclesiastical vigor, bolstered by authority.

611
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:28,942
We command that no secular person should ever possess the aforementioned abbey, nor should anyone usurp anything from the goods of the same cell for themselves, whether king, count, bishop, or any prince with whatever power endowed, unless perhaps for the purpose of guarding and defending, and this only with the permission of the regular abbot of the same place.

612
01:32:28,942 --> 01:32:37,013
If anyone gives money or any gift to the king or any prince, or promises to do so to obtain this, they shall be subject to the curse to be inflicted.

613
01:32:37,013 --> 01:32:50,068
Let there be, therefore, an abbot for the same cell, appointed according to the rule of Saint Benedict, and monks subjected to regular discipline, whom we prohibit, with all authority, from suffering any loss from the goods of the same cell.

614
01:32:50,447 --> 01:32:58,640
Therefore, the properties of the same church include the village of Humolarias, where a cell has been built, along with all its associated dwellings.

615
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:06,832
Additionally, the estate of Merulf with its surroundings, the estate of Eudold and its appurtenances, and Caviniacus with its dwellings are included.

616
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:14,749
In the village called Frisia on the river Summa, twelve dwellings are permanently designated for the church's benefit, specifically for fishing.

617
01:33:14,749 --> 01:33:19,642
If anyone acts against the protection of this apostolic privilege, we excommunicate them.

618
01:33:19,642 --> 01:33:23,216
Thus, they are bound by the chain of this curse and are accursed.

619
01:33:23,216 --> 01:33:23,821
Amen, amen.
