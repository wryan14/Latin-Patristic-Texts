00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,886
Historical Note.

2
00:00:00,886 --> 00:00:13,410
According to Mansi, in The Most Comprehensive Collection of Councils, volume 18, column 447, John, son of Alberic, who ruled the city, assumed the papal seat in the year 965, during the reign of Emperor Constantine the Eighth.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:25,324
Even though he didn't meet the necessary age and other requirements to be a legitimate pope, the entire clergy eventually agreed that it was better to tolerate him than to risk a schism that could divide the Church.

4
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:34,911
The whole Catholic Church understood it was less damaging to have a leader, despite his flaws, than to split the Church into two separate entities, each with its own leader.

5
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:38,569
Thus, he was recognized as the true and legitimate pope worldwide.

6
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:44,941
He was the first to change his name from Octavian to John, not abandoning but merely altering his leadership style.

7
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:54,694
His father, Alberic, had named him Octavian for temporal rule over the city, but upon taking the papal role and spiritual leadership over the world, he chose to be called John.

8
00:00:54,694 --> 00:01:03,616
With youthful zeal for threats and violence, he gathered an army with support from the Duchy of Spoleto and waged war against the Prince of Capua, named Pandulf.

9
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:10,488
When Pandulf fiercely resisted with aid from the people of Salerno, John had to retreat and seek peace through negotiations.

10
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:22,901
During his time, Berengar, freed from the fear of the deceased Liudolf, son of Otto, who had been sent to Italy to curb Berengar's tyranny, roamed Italy unchecked, devastating both sacred and secular places indiscriminately.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,788
Unable to tolerate the tyranny any longer, Pope John sent a delegation to Otto, the king of Germany.

12
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:43,551
With the help of Liutprand, he pleaded with the king through letters and signs to, for the love of God and the holy apostles Peter and Paul-whom he hoped would forgive his sins- rescue him and the holy Roman Church from their enemies, and restore them to safety and freedom.

13
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:49,371
At the same time, guided by God, the people of Milan made a similar request through an appointed delegation.

14
00:01:49,371 --> 00:02:00,363
Before leaving Germany, Otto held an assembly at Worms, where he appointed his son Otto, born of Adelaide, as king, and entrusted him to the care of Archbishop Wilhelm of Mainz, his son from another wife.

15
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:09,630
After pledging loyalty and security to the apostolic see through an oath, Otto received a promise regarding future succession in the Roman Empire and its rights and titles.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:21,323
With these preparations complete, the pious king, as Liutprand noted, gathered his troops and swiftly went to Italy, expelling Berengar and Adalbert, clearly having the most holy apostles Peter and Paul as his allies.

17
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:30,213
Once he had restored what had been taken to their rightful lords, in the year 962 of Christ the Redeemer, the seventh year of John's pontificate, he arrived in Rome.

18
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:41,690
There, he was received with great honor, wonderful splendor, and ceremony by the pope, with applause from all the people, and was called and ordained as Emperor and Augustus, receiving the anointing of the empire.

19
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:52,467
What he lawfully returned to Pope John and the gifts he added to the Roman Church are detailed in an authentic donation document inscribed in gold letters, preserved in Rome at the Castel Sant'Angelo.

20
00:02:52,467 --> 00:03:02,219
In gratitude, the pope and all the leaders of the city swore over the body of Saint Peter never to support Berengar and Adalbert, and so the emperor departed Rome and went to Pavia.

21
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,069
Meanwhile, Pope John, persuaded to defect, forgot his sworn oath and joined with Adalbert.

22
00:03:07,608 --> 00:04:51,288
When the emperor received reports from returning messengers confirming the truth, Luitprand writes that he remarked:
"He is a boy; he will easily change through the example of good men. I hope that with honest reproach and liberal persuasion, he will easily emerge from those evils."
Consequently, when the emperor returned to Rome, both the pope and Adelbert fled. Luitprand notes that the citizens welcomed the holy emperor and his entourage into the city, promising loyalty and firmly swearing that they would never elect or appoint a pope without the consent and election of Lord Emperor Otto Caesar Augustus and his son, King Otto.
Three days after his arrival in Rome, a pseudo-synod was convened under Otto's authority, where John was removed from his position, and the pseudo-pope Leo the Eighth was appointed.
After Otto's death, when he returned to the city, he deposed him as an adulterer and usurper of the seat, annulling all the acts of that council, which had been conducted without adhering to any lawful or traditional order, where Pope John had been replaced.
Regarding the unfortunate end of Pope John, the author, believed to be Luitprand, writes:
One night outside Rome, while entertaining himself with another man's wife, he was struck in the groin by the devil so severely that he died within eight days from the wound, not because, as he claimed, he was justly condemned and justly received his fate, but because, despite being warned by God through many great trials, he did not abstain from his habitual sins.
Although these accounts by Luitprand may reflect the views of an adversary of the man and are heavily attributed to Otto, I do not contest their truth, as they do not harm the Catholic faith. We unanimously profess that Peter and his successors, after receiving Christ's promise, can fail in morals but not in faith.
Regino's chronicle asserts that Pope John's death occurred in the year nine sixty-four, on the day before the Ides of May.

23
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:54,960
Pope John the Twelfth: Epistles and Privileges

24
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,756
One Letter from Pope John the Twelfth to Archbishop Wilhelm of Mainz.

25
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,912
Year Nine Fifty-Five.

26
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:05,799
He mentions that the letters addressed to Agapetus were given to him and expresses sorrow for his troubles.

27
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:13,227
John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the most reverent and beloved brother Wilhelm, archbishop of the holy Church of Mainz.

28
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:28,304
Know that we have received the letters your brotherhood sent to Pope Agapetus of blessed memory, whom the divine power arranging all things appointed to the apostolic seat upon his death, not by our merits, but by his mercy preceding us, from whom are all things that exist.

29
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:32,761
We believe nothing happens in the world unless it is done by his will or consent.

30
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:45,966
Indeed, we are saddened by the losses, miseries, and the plots of wicked men who disturb the holy Churches of God and all order and state, as the apostolic judgment decreed, to rejoice with those who rejoice and to weep with those who weep.

31
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:59,502
For we have become the head of all Christianity after the Lord, not by any human privilege, but by the voice of the Lord himself to the blessed apostle Peter, as you know well, saying: You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my Church, etc.

32
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:08,856
Therefore, if we know that any member of our body is unjustly suffering tribulations or troubles, either by letters or in any other way, we sympathize and are distressed.

33
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:13,808
With you, we oppose their plots and injustices with apostolic authority as much as we can.

34
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:22,816
In the meantime, we urge your community to stand firmly against those who choose to live rebelliously and unjustly, and who strive to destroy the churches of the Lord.

35
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:30,922
If they refuse to obey our pious commands and your warnings, do everything you can to resist them and guide them towards the path of peace, truth, and justice.

36
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:36,427
This way, we ensure that we are not found guilty before the righteous judge due to their growing wickedness.

37
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:45,297
For those whom you recognize as persisting in evil deeds and who refuse to be corrected by your instructions, send them to this our apostolic seat, as was the ancient custom.

38
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:53,759
Alongside them, send your trusted believers who can faithfully and orderly report to us about their cases and everything happening in the regions of Gaul and Germany.

39
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,589
This matter is close to our hearts, and we strongly desire that peace and honor remain in all churches and among all Christian people.

40
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,158
Any traces of evil that may have existed should be completely removed.

41
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:09,184
SECOND PRIVILEGE OF POPE JOHN THE TWELFTH FOR THE MONASTERY OF SAINT MARY HUMOLARIENSI.

42
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:09,673
Year 956.

43
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:19,820
JOHN, bishop and servant of the servants of God, to the venerable abbot BERNER of the Church of the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and through him to the entire congregation forever.

44
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,734
If we give our consent to the rightful requests of the pious, we believe we are serving the will of the Lord.

45
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:45,051
Therefore, let it be known to all the children of the Holy Mother Church, both present and future, that our son, the noble young king Lothair of the Franks, has humbly petitioned us to support with our authority a certain cell located in the district of Vermandois, built in honor of the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and Saint Hunegundis the Virgin.

46
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:58,780
Influenced by his father, King Louis, Count Adalbert, and the worthy man Gilbert, who holds the same abbey by right of benefice, he seeks to elevate it for the revered practice of sacred religion and aims to fortify it with the royal authority's decree.

47
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:26,453
We rejoice at his request, and with the strength of ecclesiastical authority, we exercise our power and command by the apostolic authority with which we are supported, that no secular person shall ever possess the aforesaid abbey, nor shall anyone usurp anything from the property of that cell, not the king, nor the count, nor the bishop, nor any prince endowed with any power, except perhaps for the purpose of protection and defense, and this only with the permission of the regular abbot of the same place.

48
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:33,887
If anyone gives or promises money or any gift to the king or any prince to acquire this, they will be subject to the curse to be imposed.

49
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:45,933
Therefore, let an abbot according to the rule of Saint Benedict be appointed for the same cell, and monks subject to regular discipline, whom we strictly prohibit from suffering any loss from the property of the same cell.

50
00:08:46,368 --> 00:09:08,056
However, the property of this same church includes the villa of Humolarias, where the cell is built, along with all the associated dwellings; Merulficurtis and its surroundings; Eudoldicurtis and its appendages; Caviniacus with its dwellings; and in the villa called Frisia on the river Somme, there are 12 dwellings, which the church is allowed to keep perpetually for the convenience of fishing.

51
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:17,999
Therefore, these properties, along with any others the church may acquire with the Lord's help, will be possessed freely and without any opposition, supported by apostolic authority.

52
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:25,101
This was written by Leo, from the sacred repository of the holy apostolic see, in the month of January, during the 14th indiction.

53
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:36,028
It was given on January 2nd, by George, the second bishop of the holy apostolic see, in the first year of the pontificate of our Lord John, sovereign pontiff and universal pope, with the Lord's favor.

54
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:40,631
Three Letter from Pope John the Twelfth to Berenger, Bishop of Verdun. Year 956.

55
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:44,627
Confirms the privileges and possessions of the Monastery of Saint Viton.

56
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:55,337
John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to Berenger, our brother, bishop of the Church of Verdun, with all those entrusted to him by God, may you receive the reward of eternal recompense.

57
00:09:55,337 --> 00:10:03,939
It is fitting for apostolic governance to support those who excel in pious religion with benevolent charity and to provide eager approval to those who ask.

58
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:12,818
For in doing so, we will undoubtedly earn the greatest reward from the Lord, the creator of all, if we improve venerable places of saints through our authority.

59
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:27,690
Therefore, dear brother, we have found among your other acts of holy conduct, that you have built a monastery in your bishopric near the city of Verdun, specifically in the church of the blessed Peter, for the love of God, where the bodies of the holy confessors rest.

60
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:38,345
And of the aforementioned church of Saint Mary, once bishops Vitonus, Pulchronius, Possessor, and Firminus, you have supported it with prudent consideration using the resources of your church.

61
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:58,323
So that if at any time the children of your Church, moved by divine love, seek to pursue the perfection of a contemplative life, they would not be seen as completely separated from your Church, but would find a refuge of solace in the monastery, which is a part of the same Church, under the habit of religion, and serve the Lord in peaceful tranquility there.

62
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:11,031
Let it be known to the diligence of all the faithful, both present and future, that we wish the same monastery built by your ordinance, with all matters and royal decrees established with your counsel, to remain unshaken forever.

63
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:19,300
Namely, the estate above Scantia, with its appurtenances; Flavigny, with its adjuncts; and the abbey of Saint Amantius, with whatever pertains to it.

64
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:51,484
To Neuville, along with its locations; to the court of Mantion, as it pertains to you; Parry, with its surroundings; the church of Marculfi-Court, with its surroundings; Arbord-Villa, with its belongings; the church of Castonis-Court, with its associated items; the church of Marleio, with its surroundings; the church of Amonzei-Villa, with its lands, vineyards, mills, servants, and maidservants; the abbey of Peter, and the church of Maroa; to Limacum, whatever pertains to that place; to Neuville in the county of Barr, whatever pertains to that place.

65
00:11:51,484 --> 00:12:29,552
All these aforementioned places, with all their general and specific belongings, and whatever by the grace of God and the vow of the faithful has been granted to this monastery, we confirm eternally through this our apostolic privilege; both to you and your successors, and further, to be strengthened by the privilege of our authority, so that the same Verdun Church, which until now was deprived of those children exposed in its care from infancy, while they sought external monasteries, may henceforth and in the future take pride in their holy devotion in a community subject to it, with the guidance of its bishop and the leadership of the glorious abbot Humbert.

66
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:51,549
However, if anyone, with reckless daring, whether of great or small status, of any order or power, dares to go against this our apostolic command, let them know that by the authority of the blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, they are excommunicated, bound by the chain of anathema, and alienated from the kingdom of God, condemned with all the wicked to eternal fire and punishment.

67
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:58,900
But whoever observes this our command, may they deserve to obtain grace, mercy, and eternal life from our most merciful Lord God.

68
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,682
Written by the hand of Leo, the notary of the holy apostolic see, in the month of January, in the fourteenth indiction.

69
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:06,195
Farewell.

70
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,790
Issued on January 9 by Martin, bishop and librarian of the holy apostolic see.

71
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:19,576
In the seventh year of the pontificate of Lord John, the Supreme Pontiff and Universal Pope, the twelfth, at the most sacred seat of the blessed Apostle Peter.

72
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,449
In the first month, during the fourteenth indiction.

73
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,064
Letter Four: Epistle of Pope John Twelve to Landulph, Bishop of Benevento (Year Nine Hundred Fifty-Six)

74
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:37,858
John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the most reverend and holy Landulph, bishop of the holy church of Benevento, and to your successors forever.

75
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:54,103
Since the summit of the highest and apostolic dignity shines with the brilliance of divine progress and strives earnestly to offer praises to God, we are compelled by our apostolic pastoral duty to promote stability in pious places and confirm them with the decree of apostolic institution.

76
00:13:54,103 --> 00:14:11,357
Therefore, as you have requested that the holy church of Benevento, under your leadership by God's favor, be adorned with the privileges of the holy apostolic see, and that we confirm the ancient boundaries granted by our predecessor pontiffs, we grant this with our authority, supporting your pious desires.

77
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:30,403
We grant to you and your holy church of Benevento whatever it has historically and rightfully possessed, from the time of your predecessors, including Bivinum, Asculum, Larinum, Sipontum, and the church of Saint Michael the Archangel on Mount Gargano, with all their appurtenances, estates, churches, families of both sexes, and properties.

78
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:44,463
We grant to your religion and your successors the right to govern and legally manage all places within the ancient jurisdiction of your parish, with all their appurtenances, whether they are cities or any castles long held by your predecessor bishops.

79
00:14:44,688 --> 00:15:01,283
We decree with apostolic authority, under the solemn witness of divine judgment and with strong prohibitions of anathema, that no person, regardless of their office or status, whether high or low, or Greek, should ever harm or take anything from the Church of Saint Benevento, or reduce its boundaries in any way.

80
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:09,448
No one should cause any trouble or malice, nor should anyone be allowed to remove anything from it or from what belongs to it, regardless of their status.

81
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:16,871
This is to ensure that the venerable Church of Saint Benevento, adorned with apostolic decrees and privileges, remains unshaken and endowed.

82
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:45,237
If anyone, which we do not desire, with wicked boldness, attempts to oppose or transgress what we have decreed for the praise of God and the stability of the Church of Benevento, whether Greek or any other person seeking power or primacy, by themselves or through another, in these churches without the will and command of the Bishop of Benevento, and those who might presume to receive them, all shall remain under the same apostolic and strict unbreakable anathema and shall not enter any church or perform any ecclesiastical office.

83
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:56,796
But whoever observes and keeps all of this decree of ours for the worship of God shall abundantly receive the grace of blessing from our most merciful Lord God, and may they be deemed worthy to partake in eternal life.

84
00:15:56,796 --> 00:16:03,211
Written by the hand of Leo, the secretary of the Holy Roman Church, in the month of December, in the fifteenth indiction.

85
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:03,688
Farewell.

86
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,180
Given on the eighteenth day before the Kalends.

87
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:23,424
In January, with the help of Bishop Marinus and the librarian of the highest apostolic see, and with the Lord's favor, during the pontificate of our lord John, the supreme pontiff and universal pope, in the most sacred seat of the blessed Apostle Peter, in the eleventh month and the fifteenth indiction mentioned above.

88
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,561
Five LETTER OF JOHN THE TWELFTH TO ARCHBISHOP HENRY OF TRIER. Fragment.

89
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:30,183
- Year 957. He grants the use of the pallium.

90
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:39,098
JOHN, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the most reverent and beloved brother HENRY, Archbishop of the Holy Church of Trier, for your life only.

91
00:16:39,098 --> 00:17:03,281
Given the day before the Ides of February by the hand of John, the librarian of the holy apostolic see, in the year of our Lord, during the pontificate of the lord John, supreme pontiff and twelfth universal pope, seated in the most sacred chair of the blessed Apostle Peter, with the most pious lord Augustus Otto, crowned by God, great emperor, in his first year, in the month of February, in the fifth indiction.

92
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,714
Six Brief Recollection.

93
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:14,894
In 958, Pope John the Twelfth compelled the residents of Subiaco, who were defiant toward the abbot of the Subiaco monastery and had seized many of its properties, to restore everything.

94
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:20,914
This occurred perhaps in the third year of Pope John the Twelfth's papacy, in May, during the first indiction.

95
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:34,542
Since the human mind is always busy with various tasks and concerns, unable to express everything in words or remember the future, the gift of writing was discovered by wise men through God's will, allowing us to inscribe what we can't keep in mind.

96
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:48,936
Therefore, I, Leo, abbot of Saint Benedict of Subiaco, recount how the Lord Pope visited our monastery for prayer and how we protested about the issues at Subiaco and other regions, regarding the constant persecutions and afflictions inflicted upon our monastery.

97
00:17:48,936 --> 00:18:00,046
Moved by compassion and mercy for this venerable place and our entire congregation, the Lord Pope began to sympathize with the injustices we had suffered since Lord Alberic of blessed memory passed away.

98
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:19,968
While the supreme pontiff stayed at the monastery with honorable bishops like Marinus of the Church of Polimartium, Constantine, bishop of Portus, John, humble bishop of Tivoli, and Roman judges like George, second secretary of the Holy Roman Church, Leo, chief secretary of the Holy Apostolic See, and many others, he commanded all adversaries to come before him.

99
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:30,147
When they appeared before the Lord Pope with us, they were greatly restrained; he ordered that all properties, dwellings, and lands, mentioned individually, be returned to the monastery.

100
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:40,218
He instructed the abbot to create a brief recollection of this affair, having it signed by the aforementioned men and other worthy individuals for the everlasting memory of the matter.

101
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:44,736
Seven Bull of Pope John the Twelfth to Abbot Leo. Year Nine Thirty-Eight.

102
00:18:44,736 --> 00:18:47,809
Confirms the goods and rights of the Subiaco monastery.

103
00:18:47,809 --> 00:19:00,720
John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the venerable priest, monk, and abbot Leo of the esteemed monastery of Saint Benedict and Saint Scholastica, located in Subiaco, and to your holy congregation and successors forever.

104
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:15,699
The desire for pious will and commendable devotion should always be supported by apostolic help for those who need it, ensuring that what is legally established remains firm through justice, undisturbed by any opposition, and maintains unbreakable right and authority.

00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:53,077
All places belonging to you and to our holy Roman Church, which we serve by the Lord's authority, are granted and confirmed to you and your successors through this apostolic privilege.

151
00:28:53,077 --> 00:29:03,121
This includes all immovable locations with all their belongings, as previously mentioned, from the present first indiction and forever, for the use and benefit of that venerable monastery.

152
00:29:03,121 --> 00:30:10,862
However, the priests and monks of that monastery must pray every day in the same church for the salvation of our soul and the souls of our successors, reciting one hundred "Lord, have mercy" and one hundred "Christ, have mercy."
The priests must offer sacred oblations during the solemnities of Mass three times each week for the forgiveness of our soul and the souls of our succeeding pontiffs to Almighty God.
We declare with apostolic authority, under divine judgment and anathema, that no one, whether any of our succeeding pontiffs or any other person, great or small, may dare or presume to act against, alienate, or remove any of the aforementioned immovable places with all their belongings and adjacencies, as previously mentioned, contrary to this our pontifical privilege.
Instead, we decree that it must remain firm and stable through perpetual and everlasting times, as we have established.
If anyone (which we do not wish) attempts to oppose this apostolic privilege and wishes to contradict or transgress it, let them know that by the authority of Almighty God and our Lord, the prince of the apostles, Peter, in whose role we serve, though undeserving, by the Lord's grace, they are bound by the chain of anathema and alienated from the kingdom of God.

153
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:29,239
But those who, with pious intent, act as true guardians and observers of this our apostolic privilege may deserve to obtain the rewards and grace of blessing and mercy from the righteous judge, our Lord God, and eternal life through the merits and prayers of blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, and Saint Benedict in the heavenly courts.

00:32:19,412 --> 00:32:26,417
After hearing this, let none of them enter the church, listen to Mass, make peace with a Christian, eat, drink, or sleep.

May you have enduring salvation in Christ for eternal life.

175
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:32,094
If shepherds are willing to face the sun and frost day and night to protect their flock, keeping a watchful eye so that none of the sheep go astray or fall prey to thieves, how much more should we, as spiritual shepherds, be vigilant for the salvation of souls?

176
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:43,924
Let us be diligent in our duty to guard the Lord's flock, ensuring that we do not flee in fear when danger comes, and so that on the day of divine judgment, we will not be found negligent, having been judged with honor above others.

177
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:56,468
Therefore, we fully affirm your primacy, expecting you to carry out the duties of the apostolic see as your predecessors did, just as it is recognized that the blessed Augustine and his successors, bishops of the aforementioned Church, have done.

178
00:33:56,468 --> 00:34:01,517
We present the pallium to you, according to tradition, for celebrating the solemnities of the Mass.

You are permitted to use it as our predecessors decreed, with the privileges of your church remaining intact.

180
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:13,959
Your wisdom is well aware of this, and everyone knows how much the honor of the garment inspires awe through the moderation of actions.

181
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:21,251
These ornaments reflect your moral character, so that, with God as your guide, you may stand out and make your life a model for your followers.

182
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:24,311
In this way, they will be inspired to imitate what they see.

183
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:34,663
May the Holy Trinity surround your fraternity with its grace and guide you in the path of its fear, so that after the challenges of this life, we may together be deemed worthy to reach eternal sweetness.

184
00:34:34,663 --> 00:34:42,975

188
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,990
This message is for you and your successors, the abbots, forever.

189
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:19,033
Since it's always important to fulfill reasonable desires, it's only right that the devotion of someone who founds a pious establishment should be granted authority in giving privileges.

190
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:36,904
Therefore, because you have requested that the aforementioned monastery of Saint Salvator be granted the privileges of the apostolic seat, ensuring it remains under the jurisdiction of our Church, which we serve by the grace of God, and not under any other church's authority; we are pleased to grant this request by our authority.

191
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:44,949

No one should presume to celebrate the solemnity of masses there unless invited by the abbot of the monastery.

193
00:35:50,888 --> 00:36:10,542
Also, to ensure that what is under the apostolic seat remains firmly established in both places and matters, whether currently held or to be acquired in the future through divine mercy, this venerable monastery shall continue to possess these rights through the gifts, offerings, and tithes of the faithful, without opposition from anyone, with perpetual firmness.

194
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:28,222
We hereby declare through this decree that anyone-whether a bishop of any Church or a person of any rank-who attempts to violate this charter, which we confirm by the authority of the chief of the apostles, shall be cursed and incur God's wrath, becoming an outcast from the company of all the saints.

195
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:36,269
Nevertheless, the dignity of the aforementioned monastery, granted by us, shall remain perpetually intact, supported by apostolic authority.

196
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:43,110
This was written by the hand of Leo, notary of the apostolic see, in the month of December, during the fifth indiction.

207
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:12,818
Whenever the privilege of concession and confirmation is requested from the Holy Roman Church, which we serve by God's authority, for the advancement of new Christianity, we have deemed it worthwhile to grant it with all diligence and love.

208
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:19,147
Lest what ought to be generously granted towards pious desires is taken away by the deceitful enemy due to neglect.

209
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:32,906
Therefore, dearest brothers, we must strive with all our strength to ensure that Christianity, which Almighty God daily extends and advances through His servants with heavenly victory, is also strengthened and sustained by our assistance through Him.

210
00:38:32,906 --> 00:38:52,719
Now, by the grace of God, our most beloved and Christian son Otto, having defeated barbarian peoples, namely the Avars and many others, approached the highest and universal seat, over which we preside by God's authority, to receive from us a triumphant crown of victory for the defense of the Holy Church of God, from blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles.

211
00:38:52,719 --> 00:39:00,699
We welcomed him with paternal affection and anointed him as emperor with the blessing of blessed Peter for the defense of the Holy Church of God.

212
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:27,831
And when we were discussing in the church of blessed Peter the apostle concerning the state and governance of all Christianity, considering what is useful according to God, the aforementioned most pious Emperor Otto informed our paternity how he had newly established in the Catholic faith the Slavs, whom he had conquered, earnestly pleading and requesting that the sheep he had acquired in Christ might not be dominated by the cunning of the ancient serpent due to the absence of a shepherd.

213
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:33,041
In response to this request, dear brothers, we have given our approval as is only right.

214
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:38,624
With all our hearts, let's ensure this new foundation is built on the rock, Christ, at the mountaintop.

215
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:41,551
He who desires no one to perish will provide strength.

216
00:39:41,551 --> 00:40:03,122
With His gracious consent, we wish and thus decree, through this document of privilege, that the monastery of Magdeburg in the Saxon kingdom, near the Elbe, which the most holy emperor established for new Christianity due to its proximity to the people of those regions, be elevated to an archiepiscopal seat, capable of guiding and governing the entire flock of God through subordinate suffragans.

217
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:19,274
We wish and through this document of privilege, we command that the monastery of Merseburg, which the pious emperor dedicated to God after defeating the Hungarians, be raised to an episcopal seat, subordinate to the seat of Magdeburg, because so many people cannot be governed by a single shepherd.

218
00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:37,485
We wish and by the privilege of our authority, decree that the tribute and tithing of all the peoples, whom the pious emperor baptized or will be baptized by him, his son the king, and their successors with God's blessing, be allocated and subjected to Magdeburg, Merseburg, or any future seat they choose, by them and their successors.

219
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:55,642
We also wish, dear brothers, and by the command of the blessed Apostle Peter, we order that the archbishops of Mainz, Trier, Cologne, Salzburg, and Hamburg, be steadfast supporters with all their heart and strength for the elevation of the Magdeburg monastery to an archiepiscopal seat and the Merseburg monastery to an episcopal seat.

220
00:40:55,967 --> 00:41:10,078
When Almighty God, through His servant, the most invincible emperor, his son the king, and their successors, led the neighboring Slavic people to embrace the Christian faith, we aimed to establish bishoprics in suitable locations as opportunities arose.

221
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:19,448
We seek to have bishops consecrated by the Archbishop of Magdeburg as suffragans, with the consent of the aforementioned individuals, their archbishops, and successors.

222
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:42,036
However, if the sons of our most pious emperor, and the successors of his son the king, attempt to break these statutes, or if the bishops of the mentioned churches, along with others and their successors, do not support or agree with the Archbishop of Magdeburg, his successors, and their suffragans, may they be struck with the sword of excommunication and face eternal damnation from the supreme judge.

223
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:54,529
Therefore, may Almighty God grant our most serene emperor Otto and his son, the king, who is spiritually our son, a long life, so that living peacefully in this world, they may receive the palm of unfading glory in the next.

224
00:41:54,529 --> 00:42:00,609

It's a fragment from the year 962.

229
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:30,300
The Pope reinstates the use of the pallium to him.

230
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:40,934
John, servant of the servants of God, addresses the most beloved and most reverend Henry, Archbishop of the holy Church of Trier, granting this privilege only during the days of his life.

231
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:51,227

John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, extends greetings to our beloved son in the Lord, the appointed abbot Theofilact, and to the venerable monastery of Dionysius and Sylvester, known as Cata Pauli, and to your successors as abbots forever.

235
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:32,922
It is fitting for apostolic leadership to support those who excel in pious religion with kind compassion and to eagerly grant approval to those who seek it.

236
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:40,422
By doing so, we earn a reward from the Creator of all, the Lord, or receive pardon if venerable places of saints are undoubtedly improved.

237
00:43:40,422 --> 00:43:51,780
Therefore, since your devotion humbly requested from the apostolate that we grant and confirm to you the aforementioned monastery with all its churches, buildings, and appurtenances, both within and around it.

This includes the servants and maidservants residing there, who already belong to your monastery.

320
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:19,359
Furthermore, we confirm the assets that rightfully belonged to you through the documents of the same monastery in the Alto territory, once belonging to Amaro.

321
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:30,644
Likewise, we confirm the entire estate called Paccianum, with all its appurtenances, located in the Sutrino territory, including the cell of Saint George and its appurtenances in the aforementioned Sutrino territory.

322
00:57:30,644 --> 00:57:43,965
Similarly, we confirm all matters that pertain to the rights of your aforementioned monastery in the Collinense territory, in the place called Vallis and Tintorissi, on the mountain called Arca, as well as in Saint Cassano and in Curte, and in Baccaricio.

323
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:53,369
This includes vineyards and arable lands, forests with its large marsh, along with houses and tenants and tenant women residing anywhere belonging to your aforementioned monastery.

324
00:57:53,369 --> 00:58:02,094
All of the above-mentioned immovable properties are under the jurisdiction of our holy Roman Church and the aforementioned monastery or other pious places of any kind.

325
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:09,564
Inclined by your prayers, for the salvation of souls through intercession, we confirm the inviolable stability of the aforementioned monastery.

326
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:31,454
Through this perpetual decree, we affirm the aforementioned estate called Ortana, with its vineyards and lands, small farms and mills, and all the tenants, tenant women, their sons and daughters residing there, along with the complete church of Saint Juvenalis located nearby, as well as the aforementioned Paterno in its entirety with all its appurtenances as read above from the present fifth indiction in perpetuity.

327
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:40,853
We grant and confirm to you, and to your mentioned monastery, the right to maintain and protect everything that needs improvement or defense without any disturbance.

328
00:58:40,853 --> 00:58:54,571
Make sure it is managed so that no count, steward, or anyone else, regardless of rank, can diminish, alienate, or present any document for legal action against the monastery regarding any part of the land, church property, or the families living there.

329
00:58:54,571 --> 00:59:04,913
If anyone under our apostolic authority tries to litigate against the monastery concerning the mentioned land or church, we declare it null and void because it is unjust and against the law.

330
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:19,066
By apostolic authority and under divine judgment, we decree, with the interdict of Saint Peter the Apostle, that none of our successors or any other person of great status may dare to impose upon the named land, church, vineyards, lands, or all its belongings.

331
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:26,252
Instead, it should remain for the benefit and use of the monastery, supporting and sustaining the monks residing there for all time.

332
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:46,012
If anyone presumptuously ignores this apostolic confirmation issued by us, let them know they are bound by the anathema of our Lord's apostle Peter, alienated from the kingdom of God, and condemned to eternal fire with the devil and his most terrible followers, as well as with Judas, the betrayer of Jesus Christ, and cast into the abyss of hell with the wicked.

333
00:59:46,012 --> 00:59:59,457
But whoever, with pious intent, acts as a guardian, obedient and observant of this saving decree of our confirmation, may they be worthy of receiving the blessing and grace of heavenly reward and eternal joy under our just judge, the Lord our God.

334
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:04,690
Written by Leo, a notary of the Holy Roman Church, in March during the fifth indiction.

335
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,197
Farewell.

336
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:18,901
Issued on the eighth day of March by John, bishop and librarian of the holy apostolic see, in the seventh year of the pontificate of our Lord John, the supreme pontiff and universal pope, twelfth in the sacred see of the blessed apostle Peter.

337
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:26,176
I, Cirinus, notary of the Holy Roman Church, found in the parchment privilege of Bishop John, neither added nor removed anything.

338
01:00:26,176 --> 01:00:29,053
I wrote and faithfully copied it: Thanks be to God.

339
01:00:29,053 --> 01:00:46,873
I, John, son of Lawrence Angel of the City, notary by the authority of the Holy Roman prefecture, at the request of the religious and honorable Lady Jacoba de Comite, abbess of the monastery of Saint Sylvester of the Head, found in the document or written copy by Cirinus, formerly a notary of the Holy Roman Church.

340
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:59,449
This was faithfully taken from the parchment privilege, as I was able to perceive, faithfully copied, and rendered into public form from that copy, which appears in the Limentana Letter, also known as the Beneventan Letter.

341
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:16,932
With the learned men, especially the venerable Lord John, bishop of Nepi, vicar general of the lord pope in the City, and in the presence of John of All Saints, John son of Lawrence, Peter son of Lawrence, James son of Nicholas, All Saints, and Francis son of Lawrence Mancini, notaries as requested witnesses.

348
01:01:34,584 --> 01:01:40,751
Fifteen Privilege of Pope John the Twelfth for the Monastery of Saint Peter in Bivore, Year Nine Sixty-Three.

349
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:49,862
The monastery of Saints Peter, John, Vitus, Stephen, and Agatha in Bivore, founded by Count Billingo, is placed under the jurisdiction of the one apostolic seat.

350
01:01:49,862 --> 01:02:00,160
Its properties are confirmed with the condition that a reasonable payment of one pound of silver is offered on the altar of Saint Peter by him and his successors every fifteen years.

351
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,254
With the highest apostolic authority.

352
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:08,256
The sixteenth letter of Pope John the Twelfth to the bishops of the Roman Synod, from the year 963.

353
01:02:08,256 --> 01:02:11,319
We have heard that you wish to appoint another pope.

354
01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:19,154
If you proceed with this, I excommunicate you by the power of Almighty God, preventing you from ordaining anyone or celebrating Mass.

355
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:20,736
Doubts

356
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:29,616
Letter Seventeen: Letter of Pope John the Twelfth to John the Archpriest, John the Second, and John the Third, Priests (Year Nine Hundred Fifty-Seven)

357
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:40,693
John, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the beloved sons in Christ: the devoted Archpriest John, and the devoted priests John the Second and John the Third, along with their brothers and your successors forever.

358
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:48,196
Apostolic guidance should support those who excel in pious devotion with compassionate kindness and grant the desired agreement to those who seek it.

359
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:56,403
This is particularly important because a reward is kept with God, the creator of all things, when venerable places are properly organized and undoubtedly improved.

360
01:02:56,403 --> 01:03:11,560
Since you have asked us to grant and confirm to you and your successors that the church of Saint Tryphon, martyr of Christ, be protected and free from all conditions with all its belongings, which has been newly built by Crescentius, the noble prefect of Rome, or by the other neighbors of the church.

361
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:24,097
Indeed, through the intervention of our esteemed prefect, Crescentius, we confirm this church to you and your successors with this privilege of our authority, so that you may remain there perpetually and continually offer praises to the eternal God.

362
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:28,176
From the present fifth indiction, we grant it to you and your successors to hold.

363
01:03:28,176 --> 01:03:40,009
On the day of the sacred dedication of this church, when we placed the most holy body of the blessed Tryphon, martyr, there with our own hands, we declared that just as other Catholic churches within Rome are honorable, so is this one.

364
01:03:40,009 --> 01:03:49,375
It is fitting that we serve Saint Tryphon, martyr, with utmost devotion, and that the church under his name, dedicated by us and our successors to Almighty God, should receive due honor.

365
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:53,957
At the appointed procession or station, the choir of our sacred palace should gather there.

366
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:00,428
The excellent martyr offered his body to God through various punishments, earning the crown of the heavenly kingdom.

367
01:04:00,428 --> 01:04:06,340
If he sees us devoted in his service, through his intervention, we will be able to escape the punishment of hell.

368
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:16,646
Such a noble task is not reserved for him alone, especially since his sanctuary, which has existed for a short time, is built on a distinguished foundation, raised in height, and extended in width.

369
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:22,139
What previously seemed narrow and unsightly now, with divine grace leading, appears bright and beautiful.

370
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:32,811
Just as this sanctuary was completed to honor Almighty God and the most precious martyr Tryphon, so will all who helped in its construction find splendid and well-decorated homes in the heavenly homeland.

371
01:04:32,811 --> 01:04:39,089
The eminent martyr himself rejoices with Christ, and all his servants who offer him grateful services will also rejoice.

372
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:45,000
As the benefits of our Redeemer increase daily within us, many services should be performed by us for his church.

373
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:53,057
May God be glorified through us, his servants, so that the holy martyr, for whose love it was constructed, may lead his devoted servants to eternal glory.

374
01:04:53,057 --> 01:05:05,455
We also affirm for you and your Church of Saint Tryphon the oratory built in honor of Saint Stephen the first martyr, along with the books and decorations of this oratory, the portico next to it, and the vacant land around it for burial.

375
01:05:05,455 --> 01:05:22,929
We confirm for you the entire area called "a Pila," with the pila itself located within the Tiber River in that area, including water for building a water mill and the bank of that area.
May you receive from there the bank tax from the area of Saint Lucia to the area of Saint Martin, along with all things pertaining to this oratory.

376
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,987
The property in the Campomartis region is situated next to the gate and is bordered on one side by a marker and relatives.

377
01:05:29,987 --> 01:05:38,735
The second side is next to the riverbed, the third side is adjacent to the city wall and John the caretaker's house, and the fourth side is along the public road.

378
01:05:38,735 --> 01:05:48,076
The noble Crescentius, the esteemed prefect of the city, donated and granted the oratory of Saint Stephen the Proto-Martyr to you and your church through a deed of donation.

379
01:05:48,076 --> 01:06:00,819
We hereby grant and confirm this to you and your church forever, free and secure from any conditions imposed by other churches, whether temporal or spiritual, along with all its parish, holdings, and appurtenances, as previously stated.

380
01:06:00,819 --> 01:06:14,480
We also wish and, by apostolic authority, command that none of our successors, who may serve in the place of Blessed Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, shall alter or violate this privilege of our concession and confirmation under any pretext or deceit.

381
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:45,205
If anyone, though we do not foresee it, should rashly attempt to oppose this apostolic privilege or presume to break it in any way, and does not adhere to the terms outlined above, let them be aware that, unless they repent, they are bound by the authority of Almighty God and of Blessed Peter and Paul, and by our authority as their vicar, to be tied with the chain of excommunication and alienated from the kingdom of God, to be burned with the devil and his dreadful hordes, along with Judas, the betrayer of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the fire of eternal punishment.

382
01:06:45,205 --> 01:07:03,672
But whoever, with pious intentions, acts as a guardian and observer of this apostolic constitution of privilege, may they be worthy of obtaining the grace of blessing from the just judge, our Lord God and Savior Jesus Christ, and from His holy mother, the Virgin Mary, and eternal life with all the saints and chosen of God, forever and ever.

383
01:07:03,672 --> 01:07:03,942
Amen.

384
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,082
Letter Eighteen: Bull of Pope John Twelve for the Monastery of Volturno St.

385
01:07:09,082 --> 01:07:11,496
Vincent. Year Nine Hundred Sixty-Two.

386
01:07:11,496 --> 01:07:24,604
John, bishop and servant of the servants of God, sends greetings to the venerable Abbot Paul and the monastery of Saint Vincent, martyr of Christ, located above the source of the Volturno River in Samnium, within the territory of Benevento.

387
01:07:24,604 --> 01:07:30,831
This message is also for your successors who will be regularly appointed in the same venerable monastery, forever.

388
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:39,844
We are deeply committed to ensuring that all churches of God and holy places do not suffer from any lack of necessities, but instead thrive with their own resources.

389
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:49,402
Therefore, it is our duty to ensure the stability and integrity of these venerable places with complete pastoral dedication and to provide them with support for their benefit.

390
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:59,289
What is offered to these venerable places in honor of His holy name, for the praise and glory of His divine majesty, is acceptable to us and deserving of full mercy in His presence.

391
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:02,511
Such a pious work may receive a reward in heavenly actions.

392
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:22,065
Therefore, because you have asked us to protect the monastery of the blessed Vincent, the martyr, situated above the Volturno River in the Benevento territory, in the parts of Samnium, along with its dependencies and monasteries, namely the monastery of the blessed Peter the Apostle located near the Sabbato River, in the aforementioned Benevento territory.

393
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:36,649
Also included are the monastery of the Holy Mother of God, Mary, in the place called Sano; the monastery of the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, located in Alife; and the monastery in honor of Saint Mary, built in the territory of Marsi, in the place called Apinianici.

394
01:08:37,032 --> 01:08:50,536
Furthermore, we grant you and your successors, the future abbots, the monastery of Saint Maurus within the county of Atina, along with another monastery dedicated to Saint Mary, the Mother of God, located in the territory of Penne in a place called Marano.

395
01:08:50,536 --> 01:09:05,729
Additionally, another monastery in honor of Saint Mary, the Mother of God, at a place known as Two Basilicas, along with other monasteries, cells, estates, and houses, as well as the men and women servants residing there, with all their belongings, are granted to you and your successors.

396
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:13,905
These are to be held under the jurisdiction of our holy church, which we serve with God's help, and not to fall under the jurisdiction of any other church.

397
01:09:13,905 --> 01:09:18,600
Therefore, in support of these pious desires, we grant by our authority what you request.

398
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:37,064
Thus, we grant you and your successors, the abbots, the permission from our apostolic seat to have the power to invite any bishop you choose into the mentioned venerable monastery for the needs of Christians, to consecrate churches, and to perform ordinations of subdeacons and deacons over time, fulfilling every ecclesiastical rank there as needed.

399
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:45,768
We also declare that no bishop should summon a subdeacon to his synod unless it is his own wish, nor should he judge or excommunicate an abbot or monk in any manner.

400
01:09:45,768 --> 01:10:00,011
We also wish to impose apostolic authority on you and your successors, the abbots who will be ordained over time, that if priests or clerics from any church come to join the brotherhood, or if they choose to adopt the monastic habit, they should be immediately accepted.

401
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:06,974
You are always allowed to obtain chrism and confirmation from any bishop you wish, as we have stated, under our apostolic authority.

402
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:17,390
We prohibit any priest from any church from having jurisdiction or authority over the aforementioned venerable monastery, except for the apostolic seat, unless invited by the monastery's abbot.

403
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:21,294
No one should presume to celebrate masses there without such an invitation.

404
01:10:21,294 --> 01:10:38,523
We further decree, under apostolic censure and the threat of divine judgment, as well as severe and formidable anathemas, that no one of any rank should presume to take authority over the venerable monastery or its matters, or to take or alienate its properties, possessions, or churches, or anything belonging to them, in any way.

405
01:10:38,523 --> 01:10:52,109
Nor should anyone inflict any harm or inconvenience during times of peace or barbarian invasions, since we have decreed that the monastery should remain under the firm stability of our holy church's jurisdiction during both peace and barbarian times, as stated.

406
01:10:52,109 --> 01:11:19,437
We also declare, by the authority of the blessed apostles, in front of God and His terrifying future judgment, through this page of our apostolic privilege and decree, that the places exchanged or granted by any abbots to you in the venerable monastery of Saint Vincent, martyr of Christ, as well as other possessions granted or offered by kings, dukes, or any Christians, or those granted there in the future, should remain under the firm stability of the jurisdiction of the aforementioned monastery and remain perpetually.

407
01:11:19,437 --> 01:11:26,360
No one should have the permission, as stated, to cause any trouble or take away what was given to it from the monastery's properties.

408
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:32,815
These should remain inviolate according to the apostolic institutions and privileges associated with these venerable places.

409
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:36,979
The monks of the congregation should always have the right to elect their abbot.

410
01:11:37,344 --> 01:11:45,015
The abbot himself should have the authority to judge his monks, whether they're from a male monastery or even a female one under his jurisdiction.

411
01:11:45,015 --> 01:12:02,616
However, if anyone dares to boldly oppose what we've established for the glory of God and the stability of this revered monastery, or if they wish to transgress in any way, let them be bound by excommunication and consigned to eternal fire with the devil, his most atrocious followers, and Judas, the betrayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.

412
01:12:02,616 --> 01:12:16,067
But truly, whoever faithfully observes all these things with a pious intent, keeping our apostolic decree aimed at the worship of God, may they receive an abundance of blessings from our most merciful Lord God and be deemed worthy to share in eternal life.

413
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:16,540
Farewell.

414
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:27,941
Written by the hand of Benedict, scribe of the holy Roman Church, in the month of July, in the fifth indiction, at the most sacred site of the blessed apostle Peter, in the eighth year of the pontificate of Lord John.

415
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:31,736
LETTER FROM POPE JOHN TO KING AEDRED OF THE ENGLISH (Year 955-63).

416
01:12:31,736 --> 01:12:38,199
This letter encourages the protection of the privileges of the oldest monastery of Saints Peter and Paul in Canterbury.

417
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:49,929
JOHN, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to AEDRED, most excellent king, and to all bishops, dukes, counts, abbots, and the entire faithful people of the English nation, dearest greetings and apostolic blessing.

418
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:55,415
With a zeal for promoting divine worship, we are always focused on the stability of venerable places.

419
01:12:55,415 --> 01:13:04,919
Our hope is that through the devoted efforts of souls dedicated to Christ, who have chosen to serve there during their lives, they can continue undisturbed under regular rule.

420
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:09,698
We want the structures built for God's praise and religious worship to remain steadfast.

421
01:13:09,698 --> 01:13:23,547
Therefore, I urge you, illustrious king and dearest son, along with all our spiritual sons of the mentioned people, to carefully regard the monastery established among you in honor of the blessed apostles, the prince Peter and the teacher of nations Paul.

422
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:26,859
Ensure that no one, regardless of status, faces disturbances.

423
01:13:26,859 --> 01:13:33,702
And that the abbot and monks serving God there may have your full support and freely possess whatever belongs to their rights.

424
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:37,504
This will help them lead their lives more effectively in holy conduct.

425
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:46,519
When the time comes that the abbot passes away, someone from the same community, chosen with common counsel, should be appointed and consecrated there to take charge.

426
01:13:46,519 --> 01:13:52,385
No bishop should seize any authority there, nor presume to celebrate their Mass unless invited by the abbot.

427
01:13:52,385 --> 01:13:59,553
This is in line with what our predecessors, worthy of God, have granted to the same Church in their apostolic rights and privileges.

428
01:13:59,553 --> 01:14:06,613
To prevent anyone from opposing with reckless actions, we have also taken care to add our writings, backed by apostolic authority.

429
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:13,615
This monastery was the first to be graced with the presence of holy monks from the very start of your Church's rise.

430
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:26,478
It was built from the ground up by Aethelbert, the most Christian king, who was brought to the faith of Christ by blessed Augustine, a disciple of the revered Gregory, through the encouragement of the same Father, your apostle Augustine.

431
01:14:26,478 --> 01:14:32,177
He appointed Peter, a monk sent from this apostolic seat, to be the abbot over monks who feared the Lord.

432
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:41,838
There, following Gregory's command, Father Augustine chose a place for the king himself, his successors, and archbishops, where their remains would await the day of resurrection.

433
01:14:41,838 --> 01:14:52,964
If anyone tries to defile or destroy this holy purpose, let them know they are bound by apostolic authority with the chain of anathema and will suffer eternal fire alongside Judas, the traitor of the Lord.

434
01:14:52,964 --> 01:14:56,003
Therefore, we command the canons of the monastery of St.

435
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:59,856
Savior who reside there not to disturb this holy commitment in any way.

436
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:02,244
If they do, let them face the same anathema.

437
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:05,447
In Christ, may you, my lord son, be well with all of yours.

438
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:13,479
Given on the tenth day before the Kalends of May, in the eleventh year of the reign of our most pious lord, Emperor Otto, in the eleventh indiction.

439
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,756
Twenty To the clergy of England.

440
01:15:15,756 --> 01:15:20,508
(Years 955-63.)
He confirms the privileges of the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul.

441
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:36,941
John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, sends greetings and apostolic blessings to Eadred, most excellent king of the English, and to our beloved son Odo, archbishop of the Church of Canterbury, along with all the bishops, dukes, counts, abbots, and faithful people of the English nation.

442
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:50,189
Among your sacred faith's illustrious virtues, which you, most excellent son, and the kings under you, with your nobles and people, have embraced in submitting to the Christian religion, we especially cherish this warmth of your charity.

443
01:15:50,189 --> 01:16:07,126
This seeks to confirm through us the ancient dignity and freedom of the monastery in the suburbs of Canterbury, dedicated to the chief apostles Peter and Paul by Augustine, the first teacher and apostle of the English, and founded by Aethelberht, the first Christian king of the English, beloved by God.

444
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:13,834
It is where, by apostolic authority, the bodies of the kings and archbishops of Canterbury will be buried in perpetuity.

445
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:24,231
Your royal eminence requests that we confirm this as it was sanctioned by your predecessors, the kings, and our predecessors, the pontiffs, with the privileges described by the apostles.

446
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:38,485
Therefore, we gratefully decree that this apostolic Church, considered by you as the first-born in the grace of the chief apostles, shall be the primary mother among all other monasteries in your kingdom that exist now or will arise in future generations.

447
01:16:38,485 --> 01:16:47,820
By royal and apostolic confirmation, it will be free from all secular servitude, ensuring that no bishop or successor of your kings will harm or disturb it in any way.

448
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:58,440
No occasion for servitude shall ever be demanded from any of its properties, even in the slightest way, so that under its king, as a defender, not a tyrant, it may serve Christ alone freely.

449
01:16:58,943 --> 01:17:11,885
To our beloved son and fellow priest of the Church of Canterbury, Odo, we instruct, in the name of the blessed apostles and the chief Peter, that he should not use the pride of leadership but instead offer the service of love where it is needed.

450
01:17:11,885 --> 01:17:25,830
He should regard the abbot as a Roman legate and fellow minister of the Gospel of peace, considering him a brotherly companion, not a subordinate, in all things, just as the holy and God-beloved sons of the apostolic see, Archbishop Theodore and Abbot Adrian, did.

451
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:34,388
Let no one seize control of this Church, nor should anyone assume any role (except for the ordination of the abbot) without his approval and that of the brothers.

452
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:45,111
No one should take or do anything from its closest and specific places, parishes, or in any privilege of its right without the abbot's consent, so that no abuse may disturb the peace of the Lord's flock.

453
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:49,601
Those who cause such scandal would be better off sunk with a millstone in the depths.

454
01:17:49,601 --> 01:18:01,697
The abbot should also be considered the first among the rest, so that he may lead his brothers affectionately rather than imperiously, as the firstborn and in the place of Rome, towards the unity of holy faith, love, and harmony.

455
01:18:01,697 --> 01:18:14,586
Therefore, we affirm that these and other matters, whether by you or your predecessors, or by you, or your successors, or by any persons, will be observed by all the kings, princes, and people of Britain according to your request until the end.

456
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:27,158
Let no one who acts against this (God forbid) be cut off by the sword of excommunication of Saint Peter, the chief of the apostles, and perish, but rather let those who support the Church be admitted by its key and rejoice in the kingdom.
