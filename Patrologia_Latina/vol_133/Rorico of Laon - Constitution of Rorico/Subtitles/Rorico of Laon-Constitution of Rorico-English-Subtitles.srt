HISTORICAL NOTICE.

2
00:00:01,191 --> 00:00:15,618
(From Gallia Christiana, volume 9, page 520.)
In the year 949, as Flodoard mentions in his Chronicle, the people of Laon, who were loyal to King Louis, selected Rorico, a deacon and the king's brother, as their bishop.

3
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:19,191
Rorico was the illegitimate son of Charles the Simple.

4
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:28,192
Although Artold, the archbishop of Reims, consecrated him, he wasn't accepted in Laon and stayed at the fortress by the bridge of Petra.

5
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:32,957
In 955, he was present at the ordination of Hadulf, the bishop of Noyon.

6
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:39,641
In 961, after the death of Artold, he served as archchancellor until Odalric took over as archbishop.

7
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:45,729
That same year, he reinstated the monks in the abbey of Saint-Vincent, replacing the canons.

8
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:57,641
In 962, he attended a synod of thirteen bishops in the region of Meaux, where he worked with Gibwin of Chalons to stop the see of Reims from being returned to Hugh, Artold's rival.

9
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:03,134
During that year, he laid hands on Odalric, who was consecrated by Guy of Soissons.

10
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:11,605
On June 3, 969, he agreed to donate half of the abbey of Saint-Hilary, along with the church, to the monastery of Saint-Vincent.

11
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:17,760
In 973, he gave the church of Saint-Medard in the village of Caprimiac to the same monastery.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,855
In 976, as noted by Flodoard in his Chronicle, he was afflicted by paralysis.

13
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:31,988
Despite this, he gave thanks to God for his infirmity and passed away on the eve of Saint Thomas the Apostle after morning praises to God.

14
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:37,547
The Vincentian Necrology notes: On December 20, Rorico, bishop of Laon, passed away.

15
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:44,297
He established a new rule for this monastery and donated many possessions, including lands and altars.

16
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:52,239
Atso the monk attests to his learning in the book about the Antichrist, which he wrote at the request of Queen Gerberga.

17
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,477
Restoration of the Monks in the Monastery of St.

19
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:08,930
With the help of heavenly grace, I, Rorico, though unworthy, have assumed the leadership of the holy Church of Laon.

20
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,768
I realize that the final summons is imminent for me, as it is for others.

21
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:20,813
Burdened by my sins, I began to consider what would benefit this seat, which I preside over by the will of God, and what is necessary to address my sins.

22
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:27,910
On the mountain's side, overlooked by the city, there is a church dedicated to the worship and honor of the great martyr Saint Vincent.

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,589
In ancient times, it was known for its monastic life, but in modern times, it fell into poverty and neglect.

24
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:40,213
My predecessor Adelelmus established a community of twelve canons living a religious life there, supported by various sources.

25
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:45,839
After his death, due to the troubles of various plagues, it nearly returned to its previous desolate state.

26
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:53,410
I could not remain calm about this, especially since it served as a burial place for both the bishops of this seat and for nobles and laypeople.

27
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:02,243
Calling a general assembly and with its advice, I decided to restore it to its former monastic state and to gather as many monks as the opportunity of the time allowed.

28
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:10,276
After inviting twelve monks from the monastery of Saint Benedict, situated above the Loire, I appointed the venerable Melchan as their abbot.

29
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:14,217
I established him and the other monks in the same monastery to serve God.

30
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:22,910
Among various benefits I provided, I confirmed the dignity of the second seat of the bishopric, which had been granted to the Church by our ancient predecessors.

31
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:32,412
I also granted them the burial rights of bishops, canons, priests, custodians, chaplains, and their servants and families, along with jurisdiction over the valley and mountain.

32
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:40,079
To ensure this authority held stronger validity, we decided to endorse it with both our seal and the testimony of our clerics and noble laity.

33
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,724
The sign of Roricon, the unworthy bishop of Laon.

34
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:56,168
We decided to send it to the venerable synod, held at Mont Sainte-Marie in the district of Tardenois in May, where it was read in the presence of Lord Adalbero, the archbishop, along with his fellow bishops, and strengthened by their common consent.

35
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:00,541
Adalbero, archbishop of the holy Church of Reims, I have signed and confirmed it.

36
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:09,720
Done in Laon in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ nine sixty-one, in the fourth indiction, on the first of October in the seventh year of King Lothair.
