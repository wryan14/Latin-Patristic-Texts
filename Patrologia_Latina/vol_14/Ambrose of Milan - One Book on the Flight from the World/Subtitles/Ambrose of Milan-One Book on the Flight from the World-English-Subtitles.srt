00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,887
On the Flight from the World
Ambrose of Milan

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,232
Chapter One

3
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:08,810
One cannot escape earthly temptations and desires without divine help.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:15,455
We face many obstacles from our senses; it is essential to prioritize the sorrowful over the joyful, as joy often leads to vanity.

5
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:19,238
Ultimately, anyone who wants to be saved must rise above worldly concerns.

6
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,130
We often discuss escaping this world.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:28,542
Refer to Saint Augustine, Book Two against Julian the Pelagian, Chapter Eight, and Book against the two letters of the Pelagians, Chapter Eleven.

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:32,580
If only our feelings were as cautious and sincere as our words are easy to say.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,465
What's worse, earthly desires often sneak in, filling our minds with vanity.

10
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:42,600
We end up thinking about and dwelling on what we strive to avoid; it's hard to guard against and even harder to discard.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,296
The Prophet acknowledges this struggle, saying: "Turn my heart toward your testimonies and not toward selfish gain" (Psalm 119:36).

12
00:00:49,296 --> 00:01:01,616
Our hearts and thoughts are not under our control, and when they are suddenly released, they confuse our mind and spirit, leading us away from our intentions, recalling worldly things, introducing mundane matters, and weaving in temptations.

13
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:06,114
Just when we prepare to lift our minds, empty thoughts cast us down to earthly concerns.

14
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,233
But who is so blessed that they always ascend in their heart?

15
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,584
How can this happen without divine assistance?

16
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,504
Indeed, it cannot.

17
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:18,076
Scripture says: "Blessed is the man whose help is from you, Lord, whose ascent is in his heart" (Psalm 84:5).

18
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:26,306
Clearly, blessed is the one whom delight does not distract, whom pleasure does not sway, who does not look to lower things; even Lot's wife could not avoid this.

19
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:38,115
Inspired by this example, the Apostle, forgetting what is behind and reaching out for what is ahead, hurried toward the prize and deserved to reach it; because he saw Christ before him, who called him to the crown of righteousness.

20
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,722
He achieved this by denying himself to gain Christ.

21
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:43,431
Ultimately, he did not live, but Christ lived in him.

22
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:48,950
Amid so many sufferings and temptations, who can keep their path safe and undefiled?

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:59,187
The eye looks and the mind's focus shifts; the ear hears and concentration wavers; the nose inhales and thoughts are disrupted; the mouth tastes and sin is reported; touch ignites desire.

24
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:02,690
Death enters through the window, says the Prophet Jeremiah 9:21.

25
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,004
Your window is your eye.

26
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,850
If you see someone and feel lust, death has entered.

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,423
If you hear seductive words, death has entered.

28
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:12,434
If luxury captivates your senses, death has penetrated.

29
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:19,879
Therefore, whoever wants to ascend should not follow the joys, pleasures, or delights of the world, but rather embrace pain and weeping.

30
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,437
It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of joy.

31
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:28,583
Indeed, Adam would not have been driven from paradise if he had not been deceived by pleasure.

32
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:35,754
Thus, David, who experienced the dangerous glances of man, rightly calls blessed those whose hope is in the name of God Psalm 39:5.

33
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:41,612
For they do not focus on vanities and false insanities if they always look to Christ with their inner eyes.

34
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:46,429
Hence, turning to Him again, he says, Turn away my eyes from seeing vanity Psalm 119:37.

35
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,618
Vanity is the circus, for it is useless.

36
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:52,177
Vanity is the speed of horses, for it is deceitful for salvation.

37
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:53,381
Vanity is the theater.

38
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,531
Vanity is every game.

39
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:57,870
All is vanity, says Ecclesiastes 1:2, which is in this world.

40
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,658
Indeed, whoever wants to be saved should rise above the world, seek the Word with God, flee this world, and leave the earth.

41
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:08,435
For they cannot grasp what truly is unless they first flee from here.

42
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:14,457
Therefore, the Lord, wanting to draw near to God the Father, said to the apostles, Arise, let us go from here.

43
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,896
Chapter Two

44
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:34,810
The law about cities of refuge teaches us to flee from the world, with four main points discussed:
First, why these cities were chosen by the lot of the Levites;
Second, why there are six in number;
Third, why three of them are beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of Canaan;
Fourth, why a killer is commanded to wait there for the death of the high priest.

45
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,291
All these points are applied to different virtues.

46
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,367
The law also teaches us to flee from the world and follow God.

47
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:51,433
For what else does it mean when it says, "You shall designate cities for yourselves as cities of refuge, and they shall be for you a refuge, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there" (Numbers 35:11)?

48
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:59,969
And later: "Six cities of refuge shall be for you, three cities you shall give beyond the Jordan, and three cities you shall give in the land of Canaan" (Numbers 35:13-14)?

49
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,435
Clearly, these cities of refuge are set up for those who commit the crime of manslaughter.

50
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,271
But let us consider this more deeply.

51
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:11,382
There are four points that remind us that the secrets of this reading must be examined more profoundly.

52
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:21,357
First, why from these cities, which fell to the Levites by lot, six cities were given for those burdened by the crime of manslaughter, and why not the cities of other tribes were assigned to this duty.

53
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:27,162
Second, why the number six; this number does not seem to be prescribed without reason, neither more nor fewer cities.

54
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:32,671
Third, why three cities beyond the Jordan and three in the region of Canaan were set up as refuges for sinners.

55
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:45,523
Fourth, why the timing and definition of the period are included, during which the killer must stay in the city of refuge until the high priest dies, and after the death of the high priest, the killer may return to their own city of residence (Numbers 35:25).

56
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:49,940
Therefore, we must discuss each point in the order we proposed and resolve the questions.

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,101
It is fitting, therefore, to first explain why the cities of the Levites were given as cities of refuge.

58
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:59,765
It is clearly appropriate because the Levites are those fleeing from this world to please God.

59
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,983
They leave their homeland, parents, children, and all relatives to adhere to one God.

60
00:05:04,728 --> 00:07:06,120
Finally, it was said to Abraham: "Go out from your land, and from your kindred, and from your father's house" Genesis 12:1.
But you might say: He was not a Levite. However, he had Levi in his body, as we read in Hebrews 7:10.
And the Lord says to the Levites, with His disciples, that is, the apostles: "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me" Luke 9:23.
Although it has already been said to all: "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession" First Peter 2:9.
The fullness has come, the remnants have ceased. For Christ called everyone; it is open to everyone indeed, so that all may follow. The kingdom is offered to everyone, and eternal life.
Therefore, he to whom God is a portion Cui portio, should care for nothing except God, so that he is not hindered by the service of another necessity. For what is offered to other duties is taken away from the worship of religion and our duty.
For this is the true flight of a priest: the renunciation of domestic things, and a certain alienation from the dearest ones; so that even from his own he denies himself, who desires to serve God.
Therefore, rightly did the eternal law's sanction commend the fugitives to the fugitives; so that those who have forgotten this world may receive those who, condemning their sins and deeds, seek to forget their former life, and wish to abolish the secular things they have done.
Therefore, the minister of the sacred altar is a fugitive from his own. Hence the Lord, as the chief priest, giving an example to the Levites in His Gospel, said: "Who is my mother, or who are my brothers?" Matthew 12:48.
That is, I do not recognize a mother, I do not acknowledge brothers, I am ignorant of relatives. My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it Matthew 12:50.
Therefore, the minister only knows the word of God when he knows those in whom the word of God works. And so he is an exile from the world, fleeing the body, fleeing passions, renouncing all things, so that he remains alone, as Elijah said: "And I alone am left" First Kings 19:14.
But he was not alone with whom Christ was.

61
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,943
And the Lord Himself was left alone.

62
00:07:07,943 --> 00:08:30,144
But He says, "I am not alone, because the Father is with me" John 16:32.
The Levites are ministers of God, and their cities are appointed by law as refuges for those who commit murder. They have the authority to carry out divine commands concerning those who have committed mortal sins. The Church does not make its own laws but obeys the command of the Lord's priest. Hear the Levite saying: "I have handed over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ" First Corinthians 5:5. Thus, struck by the Levitical sword, the sense of the flesh should die in us so that our soul may live. For if the sense of the flesh does not die, there can be no fruit of eternal life.
There are six cities of refuge. The first city represents the knowledge of the Word and living according to its image. Whoever enters that knowledge is safe from punishment, as the Lord says: "You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you" John 15:3. And elsewhere: "This is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" John 17:3. This city is like a metropolis, with the other five cities of the Levites adjacent to it. The second city is the consideration of the divine operation by which the world was created. The third city is the contemplation of royal power and eternal majesty. The fourth city is the view of divine propitiation. The fifth city is the contemplation of the divine law, which commands what must be done. The sixth city is also the portion of the law that prescribes what must not be done.

63
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:33,050
How abundant is divine mercy and how rich is His kindness!

64
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:43,074
Considering each person's efforts and the frailties of the human condition, which often lead us into fault even unwillingly, and resisting, we often commit unintentional sins, overcome by temptations.

65
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:53,247
Yet, He provides us with different refuges, namely six cities, so that the remedy against worldly vices and the shipwreck of this age would be provided in the same number with which the world was formed.

66
00:08:53,247 --> 00:09:07,330
Therefore, the first remedy is that if a fault creeps into the life of a well-intentioned person, they should, without delay, if they seek perfect security, hurry to the very pinnacle of all things, where the Word of God resides in the paternal bosom, the secret and recess of God.

67
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,394
This is where the fountain of wisdom lies, from which they may draw the immortal drink for eternal life instead of death.

68
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:20,561
The second remedy is for those who cannot grasp the knowledge of that good and are slower either in intellect or in the comprehension of faith.

69
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:26,976
Since the highest knowledge requires swift intellect and sharpness of mind, they should at least consider the works of the Lord.

70
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:30,684
From these creations, they can contemplate the author of such great works.

71
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:38,402
From the good things in the constitution of this creation (for they are very good as stated in Genesis 1:31), that supreme and eternal good is understood.

72
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:40,908
What order of things, what discipline, what grace?

73
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:43,765
Do not these provoke even a dull mind to love its author?

74
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:50,230
For if we love our parents because they gave birth to us, how much more should we love the creator of our parents and our author?

75
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:58,850
Therefore, the operative power of God, even if not seen, is estimated from His works, and His works reveal the worker, so that He who is not comprehended may be understood.

76
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,010
Hence the Lord also said: If you do not believe me, believe the works (John 10:38).

77
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:13,434
Therefore, this city is also a good refuge, testifying to the grace of its builder and stirring our affection, so that we may desire Him more, who seems to have bestowed upon us such beauty in this structure.

78
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:21,065
The third order is the contemplation of royal power, so that we submit to the king, even if we do not honor him as we would a parent.

79
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:26,588
Often, obedience to authority stems from fear of the ruler, who may be ungrateful for the safety provided.

80
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:32,058
This fear teaches the necessity of sobriety to those who neither desire nor recognize the grace of piety.

81
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:35,497
Therefore, necessity corrects those whom piety should have guided.

82
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:45,136
These are the three cities across the Jordan, given for more perfect prudence as a refuge; first, we flee from guilt through the inspiration of the soul, conforming to the image of God.

83
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:50,607
We were created in this way, with God saying: "Let us make man in our image and likeness" (Genesis 1:26).

84
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,378
This is the law of the first city.

85
00:10:52,378 --> 00:11:03,111
If, due to the frailty of the flesh and the temptations of the world, we cannot shape our minds in this way, let us alleviate sin through the reverence of fatherly generation and the diligence of offspring.

86
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:05,143
For charity covers a multitude of sins.

87
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:09,676
Therefore, if one cannot be in the image of God, let him be in the fullness of charity.

88
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,802
The first city excludes guilt, while the second absolves it.

89
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:21,190
This is the law of the second city: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength" (Deuteronomy 6:5).

90
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:31,558
But if there are those of narrow and small spirit who cannot receive the abundance of charity and grace, there is the third city; so that the fear of divine power makes you sober, and fear bends you.

91
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:37,915
This is the law of the third city: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve" (Deuteronomy 6:13).

92
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:42,343
These then are the chief virtues, placed beyond the Jordan for the few, not the many.

93
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:47,866
Express the archetype as an image, love as a son loves a father, and worship as a subject worships a king.

94
00:11:48,647 --> 00:12:00,086
Those who cross the Jordan, their descent into the Jordan is spoken of: those who descend from higher virtues to these lower ones, where integrity, charity, and humility waver, have refuges closer to humanity that they can seek.

95
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:07,360
So that those who are burdened with sins and bent by involuntary vices may hope that the Lord can be reconciled to them if they seek forgiveness.

96
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,537
They may hope that they can be corrected if they follow the commandments of the heavenly Testaments, which either guide us to innocence or call us back from guilt.

97
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:22,862
Therefore, these cities within the Jordan are as follows, so that we may appease God:
let us follow what He commands, and avoid what He prohibits.

98
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:28,882
Let the ambition of appeasing the divine be obedience to His commandments and caution against prohibited transgressions.

99
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:36,508
By which we venerate God's propitiatory mercy and His law-giving providence, either through obedience to His institutions or by avoiding the prohibited.

100
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:44,785
The fourth remains, which speaks about the death of the high priest:
Because until that time, the murderer will be in the city of refuge, until the high priest dies.

101
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:45,387
Joshua 20:6.

102
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:48,447
In this, according to the letter, the interpretation falters.

103
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:52,862
First, the very flight is determined more by chance than by any examination of fairness.

104
00:12:52,862 --> 00:13:00,086
Then, in equal cases, there is an unequal outcome; for it could happen that after the murderer’s refuge, the high priest might die the next day.

105
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:02,494
But what is the judgment under such uncertainty?

106
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:06,157
Therefore, because the letter falters, let us seek the spiritual meaning.

107
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:16,742
Who is this great high priest, if not the Son of God, the Word of God, whose advocacy we have with the Father, who is free from all voluntary and incidental sins, in whom all things in heaven and on earth exist?

108
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:21,508
For all things are bound by the bond of the Word, held together by His power, and exist in Him.

109
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:25,070
Because in Him all things were created, and in Him all fullness dwells.

110
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,341
And therefore, all things remain because He does not allow to be dissolved what He has bound, because they exist by His will.

111
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:36,659
For as long as He wills, He controls and governs them by His command, and binds them with natural harmony.

112
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,988
The Word of God lives, especially within the souls of the faithful.

113
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,063
The fullness of divinity never perishes.

114
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:46,694
For the eternal divinity and the eternal power of God are everlasting.

115
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:50,378
However, it feels like it dies for us if it is separated from our soul.

116
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:54,425
Not because it is tainted by death, but because our mind becomes disconnected.

117
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:57,589
True death is indeed the separation of the Word and the soul.

118
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,584
When this happens, the soul immediately becomes vulnerable to voluntary sins.

119
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:03,240
Chapter Three

120
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:12,302
In the previous chapter, we explored the different kinds of virtues mentioned by the Apostle, not just outlined but clearly expressed, supported by various testimonies from him.

121
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:33,191
We see these virtues clearly demonstrated in the Apostle when he says:
"So as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome."
"For I am not ashamed of the gospel."
"It is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew and then to the Greek."
"For in it, the righteousness of God is revealed, that is, in the one who believes" (Romans 1:15 and following).

122
00:14:33,191 --> 00:15:11,078
He then adds:
"From faith to faith, as it is written: ‘The just shall live by faith.’"
So, in whom is the righteousness of God revealed, if not in the one who conforms to the image of the Son of God?
This is the first precept according to the image of God.
The second precept states that the invisible attributes of God, understood through His creations, reveal His eternal power and divinity.
This is His operative power.
The third precept concerns imperial authority, as the Word of God is royal, judicial, and full of priestly justice, rewarding good actions and punishing evil ones in His coming judgment, as the Apostle says:
"We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things" (Romans 2:2).

123
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:16,300
Therefore, anyone who knows the truth and justice of God should not engage in actions worthy of death.

124
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:28,229
Next, we consider the propitiatory goodness of God, about which he says:
"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering? Do you not know that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?" (Romans 2:4).

125
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:30,482
This means it should lead you to repentance.

126
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:34,629
It calls you because God is good, offering hope for the forgiveness of your sins.

127
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,496
For He does not seek vengeance, but is ready to forgive.

128
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:47,685
He also mentions legislation, or nomothetics, suggesting that if anyone is softened by contemplating divine goodness and is provoked more to negligence than to repentance, they should follow the law.

129
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:56,491
As it is said, “For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law” (Romans 2:12).

130
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,485
The law, however, is twofold: natural and written.

131
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,562
Natural in the heart; written on tablets.

132
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,943
Therefore, everyone is naturally under the law.

133
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,666
But not everyone is their own law.

134
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:12,860
The one who is a law unto themselves is the one who willingly does what the law requires and shows the work of the law written in their heart.

135
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,433
You know what the good things of the law are; these we should not only know or hear superficially but also do.

136
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:24,209
For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.

137
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,134
You also know what the bad things are.

138
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,313
First, nature itself teaches us good deeds.

139
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:35,608
You know not to steal, and if your servant steals from you, you punish them; and if someone desires your wife, you think they should be pursued.

140
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:38,040
So why do you commit what you condemn in others?

141
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,168
Do you who preach against stealing, steal?

142
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,955
Do you who say not to commit adultery, commit adultery?

143
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:45,083
The law given through Moses also followed.

144
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,261
Through the law comes the knowledge of sin.

145
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:51,618
You have also learned what to avoid, and yet you do the things you know are forbidden?

146
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:55,418
What does the law accomplish except to make the whole world subject to God?

147
00:16:55,418 --> 00:17:00,687
For it was not only given to the Hebrew but also called the foreigner and did not exclude the proselyte.

148
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,842
But because the law could silence everyone’s mouth, it could not convert the mind.

149
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:14,164
Therefore, the ultimate remedy was needed, in which there would be a saving refuge; so that the death of the high priest would free us from every fear of death and strip away our fear.

150
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:18,420
(See St. Augustine, Book IV, against the two epistles of the Pelagians, chapter 11).

151
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:25,158
Who is this, but the one of whom it is written: "Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).

152
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:30,782
Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood to demonstrate his righteousness (Romans 3:25).

153
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:33,011
Understand that he is the great high priest.

154
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,912
The Father swore about him, saying: "You are a priest forever" (Psalm 109:4).

155
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:46,589
Rightly forever, as all others are temporary and under sin, but he holds an unbreakable priesthood: all are under death, but he always lives; for how could he who saves others perish himself?

156
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:51,813
Such a one, he says, was fitting for us Hebrews 7:2-3. A proper expression.

157
00:17:51,813 --> 00:18:02,579
Indeed, even among those who have chosen their words and expressions carefully, such a phrase is found, as someone says:
A higher place than what was fitting for the victors (Sallust, Book One Histories).

158
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:09,017
I did not pass over this so that we may know that the Apostle uses words more naturally than commonly or according to art.

159
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:17,039
So, he says, such a leader was fitting for us: a priest, righteous, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.

160
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,944
This is the Word that, dwelling above the heavens, illuminates all things.

161
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:29,651
Hence, it is also read that he was anointed by God the Father by nature Acts 4:27;
because he is the true light that illuminates every person coming into this world.

162
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:43,161
This is the Word of God, in which there is a great priesthood, whose garments Moses describes in the vestments of the high priest in that garment Exodus 29:5 and following,
which by its virtue clothes the world and shines in all things as if clothed by it.

163
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:59,995
For he clothed himself with the kinship of the human race by taking on this body and poured out his ineffable love to all by his spirit and the fullness of his divinity, from whose fullness we all have received;
so that we may know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge and be filled with all the fullness of God.

164
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:08,334
For Christ is the head of all, from whom the whole body is produced and joined together by mutual connection, receiving its growth in the building up of love.

165
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:20,893
Therefore, this is the Word that surpasses, which he says to Moses in the building of the ark of testimony:
You shall place in the ark the testimony that I shall give you, and you shall make the covering of the mercy seat Exodus 25:16-17.

166
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:37,728
And later:
You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and inside the ark you shall place the testimony that I shall give you; and I will meet with you there, and I will speak with you from above Exodus 25:22,
that is, from where it is above the heavens, where it is with the Father, from there I will speak to you.

167
00:19:38,256 --> 00:19:39,600
Chapter Four

168
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,631
What it means to flee the world, with an exhortation to do so and to avoid its contamination.

169
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:49,717
This flight is shown to be glorious with the examples of many Fathers, especially Saint Jacob.

170
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:54,479
How successfully he fled; and why Laban could find nothing of his among his possessions?

171
00:19:54,479 --> 00:20:01,783
Let us therefore, supported by faith and lifted by its guidance, approach that seat of grace, fleeing this world and its contamination.

172
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:10,981
To flee means to abstain from sins, to take on virtues in the likeness and image of God, and to extend our efforts to imitate God according to the measure of our ability.

173
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:13,362
A perfect man is the image and glory of God.

174
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:17,041
Hence the Lord says: Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.

175
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:22,614
Matthew 5:48
Therefore, to be like God is to have justice, to have wisdom, and to be perfect in virtue.

176
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,858
For God is without sin.

177
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,563
And so, whoever avoids sin bears the image of God.

178
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:29,810
There is thus no doubt that one who abstains from sin flees.

179
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,569
Hence the Apostle cries out: Flee from fornication.

180
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:42,795
First Corinthians 6:18
For the allurements of sins pursue us, lust pursues us: but you must flee from it as from a mad mistress, who, if she catches you, will not let you rest day or night.

181
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,851
She harasses, burns, and inflames you.

182
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:47,557
Flee greed, so it does not capture you internally.

183
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:51,723
Flee envy, which not only harms others but even more so the one it possesses.

184
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:54,320
Flee treachery, lest it ensnare you in its nets.

185
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,378
Hence the Lord says: When they persecute you in this city, flee to another.

186
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:01,299
If they persecute you in another, flee to yet another.

187
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:06,710
Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

188
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,413
Matthew 10:23

189
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:20,265
Even though our flesh may be weak and we may feel advised to flee, it's better to escape from worldly temptations; to not be held by concerns over our riches, the contemplation of our wealth, or the desire for this life.

190
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:31,124
Instead, with a direct intention of the mind, we should hasten towards the glory of the heavenly kingdom, rush towards the crown, and not be called back by the passions of our body due to earthly things.

191
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,922
Therefore, fleeing can represent either a celebrated or shadowed death.

192
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:49,420
It might also symbolize those cities of legitimate refuge, so we may seek solace in the heights of virtues, dispensed elsewhere as rewards to the good lender, saying: "Because you have been faithful in little things, you will have authority over ten cities" (Luke 19:17).

193
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:59,851
The old law recognized these cities, but because he fulfilled the law, who said: "I did not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it" (Matthew 5:17), he grants a more perfect number of rewards.

194
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,670
So, let us not be ashamed to flee.

195
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,666
This is a glorious flight, to flee from the face of sin.

196
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,806
Thus, Jacob fled at his mother's urging.

197
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:10,229
For Rebecca said: "Get up, flee to Mesopotamia" (Genesis 27:43).

198
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:15,686
Moses fled from Pharaoh, the king, to avoid being defiled by the royal court or ensnared by its power.

199
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:20,394
Ultimately, he considered the reproach of Christ more valuable than the riches of Egypt.

200
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:23,282
Similarly, David fled from King Saul and from Absalom.

201
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:28,257
As he fled, he showed piety, sparing his pursuer and praying for the safety of the parricide.

202
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:32,591
The Hebrew people fled, allowing their faith and life to part the waves for them.

203
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:36,335
That flight was a path of innocence, a way of virtue, an act of piety.

204
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:42,434
I dare to say, Jonah fled to Tarshish not physically, but in the ascension of his mind, becoming a type of Christ.

205
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:52,651
Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so too, he said, will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights (Matthew 12:40).

206
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:57,680
If Jonah had not fled in this way, he would never have been heard from the belly of the whale.

207
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,709
If you doubt this, let Rebecca show you how blessed the flight that Jacob undertook truly was.

208
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,447
Rebecca advised, "Flee to Mesopotamia" (Genesis 28:2).

209
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:57,801
Isaac also said, "Get up and go to Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel." In hymns or oracles, Bethuel is often said to mean wisdom, but in Latin interpretation, it signifies the daughter of God. Therefore, Jacob is sent to the house of wisdom and is instructed to take a wife from the daughters of Laban, who lived in Haran. Haran means caves, symbolizing the senses like sight, hearing, smell, and taste, which are enclosed within the body.
Those who delight in this world and revel in bodily pleasures are subject to the passions of the senses and are influenced by them. Rebecca advises Jacob to stay with Laban for a few days, not for a long time, so that he does not get tarnished by bodily pleasures and captured by the allurements of the world. She wants him to stay to diligently learn the discipline of virtue and understand the workings of the flesh, so he can know himself and comprehend why and for what purpose he was created.
"Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her" (Matthew 5:28).

210
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,601
The eye falls into sin in this way.

211
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:04,073
Therefore, let the eye perform its duty without being led by a slippery mind into vice.

212
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:10,550
A short time is given to understand the senses, or rather to experience them, and this is often the beginning of tender youth.

213
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:19,494
Immediately, he is called back, lest he stumble further on the slippery path, and the inner footprints of the soul are overwhelmed by the flood of bodily and worldly desires.

214
00:24:19,751 --> 00:26:06,551
When someone has experienced or stood on unstable, uncertain, and damp ground, patience or perseverance, like a mother, calls them back, saying:
"I will send for you and bring you back from there" Genesis 27:45.
So that even in slippery places, you may find a safe harbor of wisdom that prevents you from floundering like in a shipwreck.
And you may return and persist in the worship of God, and be among the gathering of nations, indicating the Church of nations to be assembled by faith.
Thus, trained by the disciplines of patience and perseverance Genesis 29:23 and following, Jacob set out and acquired for himself a union with wisdom, his companion in purpose, richly endowed with prudence.
With this wisdom, he could pass through life's times without any offense.
With the added treasure of wisdom, he established a flock of various sheep for himself. But this flock was rational, shining with the diversity of many virtues.
Hence, he cut away the boastfulness of his flesh Genesis 32:25, which is symbolized by the numbness of the thigh, while preserving the sacred interpretation of the mystery.
Therefore, with these virtues as certain steps, his mind ascended to heaven, and he knew God's secrets. He was strengthened and filled.
So that when Laban searched his house, he found nothing empty, nothing void, no idols, no image of vanity. For there was no image with him, but truth: not a figure of laziness, but a solid form of justice, and an intelligible expression of true virtue.
Thus, Laban searched his spiritual house and found no images. For it was full, not of figures, but of affairs.
He might have found the foundations and peaks of virtues if he had not carried the blindness of heart and the darkness of a deceitful mind.
Indeed, blinded by this wickedness, the minds of the Sodomites could not find the door of holy Lot.
For how could an impious mind see either the exit or entrance of a holy man?
The Lord Himself also says in the Gospel: "The ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me" John 14:30.

215
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:13,431
How could he find nothing in Him, in whom the fullness of divinity dwells bodily, from whom virtue flows out and heals everyone?

216
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:19,020
How could he find nothing in the solidity of virtue, the abundance of wisdom, intelligence, and justice?

217
00:26:19,020 --> 00:27:10,236
You yourself said, Lord, Isaiah 1:11: "I am full." You also said: "Put your hand into my side, and do not be unbelieving, but faithful" John 20:27.
He who did not believe put his hand in and found you to be Lord and God. Therefore, it is not you who are empty, but the blind and empty prince of this world, who knows only how to see and find his own things; he does not know how to recognize the things of Christ.
Or if, as many hold: "He will not find nothing in me," meaning he will not find malice in me, because malice is nothing: he will not find the dead, because he is not dead. But how could he find the dead in Him who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were?
He says he will not find sin in me, who took away the sin of the world. For how can he have nothing, who has everything? And, what is more, he has everything that the Father has, as He himself said: "Everything that the Father has is mine" John 16:15.

218
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:11,687
Chapter Five

219
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:26,320
Why we should flee from here and how to cross over with Moses to see God, removing the shoes from our feet: also how to leave behind the shadow of this life, and with holy David, if not like an eagle, at least like a sparrow; if not to heaven, at least to the mountains fly.

220
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:37,268
Therefore, let us flee from here, where there is nothing, where everything that is thought to be magnificent is empty, where even someone who thinks they are something is nothing and is absolutely nothing.

221
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:44,584
"I have seen the wicked exalted and lifted up beyond the cedars of Lebanon, and I passed by, and behold, he was not there" (Psalm 37:35).

222
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:50,726
And you, pass by like David, pass by like a good servant, so it can be said to you: "Pass by, recline" (Luke 17:7).

223
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:55,692
Pass by like Moses, to see the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to see the great vision.

224
00:27:55,692 --> 00:28:05,572
This is the great vision, but if you want to see it, remove the shoes from your feet, remove every bond of iniquity, remove the ties of the world, leave behind the shoe that is earthly.

225
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:11,874
This is why Jesus sent the apostles without shoes, gold, and silver, so they would not carry earthly things with them.

226
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:25,011
For whoever seeks the good is not praised for their shoes, but for the swiftness and beauty of their feet, as the Scripture says: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings" (Isaiah 52:7)!

227
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:30,298
Therefore, remove the shoes from your feet, so they may be beautiful for proclaiming the good news.

228
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:47,120
He said "Remove" (Exodus 3:5), not "Tie."
Remove, so you can pass by, and find that the wicked one you marveled at on earth is nothing, has no power.
So pass by, that is, flee from the lands where there is malice, where there is greed.
This is why David says to you: "Turn away from evil and do good" (Psalm 34:14).

229
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,936
To turn away is certainly to flee.

230
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,339
However, evil is on earth, good is in heaven.

231
00:28:51,339 --> 00:29:00,151
Hence, he added: "Seek peace and pursue it."
Peace is in heaven.
Finally, coming from heaven, he says: "My peace I give you, my peace I leave with you" (John 14:27).

232
00:29:00,791 --> 00:30:56,807
Therefore, because evil should be avoided and turned away from, and evil exists on earth, iniquities are on earth: let us flee from earthly things so that iniquities do not catch us, as they even caught the holy David, as he himself testifies, saying:
"My iniquities have caught up with me, and I could not see."
Psalm 40:13.
Because the eye of the soul is blinded by the smoke of iniquity, it cannot see what is bright. Similarly, Laban could not see the good in Jacob, nor could the ruler of this world see the glory of Christ.
But you might ask: Why then was Jacob sent to Laban, if Laban is blameworthy? If we consider the name, it means "white" in Latin. Therefore, Jacob is commanded to go out to brighter things. But since he was worldly, we understand it as the brighter things of this life.
As someone not yet perfect, he first goes to him, where he might rejoice for a while in his light. However, he had worse sons, meaning a tolerable name but not deeds. And so, by the advice of his mother, a divine oracle, and Jacob's own will as a lover of discipline, he quickly leaves and abandons him.
Rachel, that is, the Church or wisdom, hides the sacred idols, because the Church does not know the empty ideas and vain figures of idols, but knows the true substance of the Trinity. Finally, the shadow is abolished, the splendor of glory is revealed. Therefore, let us leave the shadow, we who seek the sun; let us abandon the smoke, we who follow the light. Smoke is iniquity; because just as smoke affects the eyes, so iniquities affect those who live that life.
Life is a shadow: our life on earth is a shadow, as Job said.
Job 8:9.
What is there here besides temptations? All time is spent in anxiety, all life in troubles.
"In the midst of snares we walk."
Ecclesiasticus 9:20.
And another complained about snares laid out for him but hidden on the path he walked,
Psalm 142:4,
so that he would not be caught and fall. He wanted to flee like a bird: but the snare was not yet broken.
"Escape has perished from me."
Psalm 142:5.
His wings were weighed down by that dark water in the clouds of the air, and perhaps he could not fly away.

233
00:30:56,807 --> 00:31:06,150
Finally, he sought to receive those wings so that he might fly away and rest, as it is written: "Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and rest" (Psalm 55:7)?

234
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,389
For where there is flight, there is rest.

235
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:15,601
Indeed, elsewhere it says: "If you sleep among the midst of the folds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver" (Psalm 68:14).

236
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:24,451
But perhaps you might ask: "How, then, does he say here that he has lost his escape, when he previously said: 'If I take the wings of the morning'" (Psalm 139:9)?

237
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,653
Is this contradictory?

238
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:26,309
By no means.

239
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:28,712
For the struggles of the righteous are many.

240
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,570
Does an athlete wrestle only once?

241
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,776
How many times, after winning many crowns, is he defeated in another contest!

242
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:39,748
How many times does someone who has often won sometimes falter and hesitate in uncertainty!

243
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:46,905
And it often happens that the strong face strong opponents, and greater contests arise, where greater proofs of strength are shown.

244
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:53,788
So David, when he was seeking escape to avoid his adversary and could not find his wings, was wavering in a difficult contest.

245
00:31:53,788 --> 00:32:01,710
For when he has his wings in his power, the title of the psalm is "To the End" (Psalm 139), that is, to the perfection and completion of victory.

246
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:08,976
Indeed, as a victor, he says: "Lord, you have tested me and known me: you have known my sitting down and my rising up" (Psalm 139:1).

247
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:13,674
Rightly did he have the ability to fly, for he had received the wings of resurrection.

248
00:32:13,674 --> 00:32:25,147
But here he is still in the cave, that is, in the flesh, in a certain cave of this body, with King Saul, son of hardness, and deciding with the power of that intelligible prince, who is not seen but understood.

249
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:33,068
Hence, the title of the psalm is "Understanding" (Psalm 55), which David, placed in the flesh, concluded: but he deserved to conclude by praying.

250
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:35,527
Therefore, he began with the voice of prayer.

251
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:42,256
Add this: The psalm is spoken from the perspective of the Savior, while this one is from the perspective of David.

252
00:32:42,256 --> 00:32:46,631
In the year 430, David did not have victory in his power but hoped for it from Christ.

253
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,549
He raised his hands to God, like the wings of his soul, and fled to the Lord.

254
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:54,161
He asked for the guidance of the Holy Spirit to know the way to ascend.

255
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:59,707
Then, he saw the heavens bending down so that Christ might descend, and he asked to be lifted up by His hand.

256
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:05,405
Or perhaps he no longer sought his own wings because, having become more perfect, he desired the hand of Christ.

257
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:11,052
Therefore, whoever wants to be lifted by the hand of Christ should first fly up himself and have his own wings.

258
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:21,584
Whoever flees the world must have wings; and if he does not have his own, lest he alone have his wings who has the power to fly, if, I say, he does not have his own, he should receive them from one who does.

259
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:28,147
Therefore, whoever flees the world flies: "Behold," he says, "I have fled far away, and I stayed in the wilderness" (Psalm 54:8).

260
00:33:28,147 --> 00:33:32,167
David therefore flew like an owl in a ruin, like a solitary sparrow in a house.

261
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:39,951
But if you refer this to Christ, He flew in the suffering of His body, so that under the shadow of His wings He might protect the peoples of the nations.

262
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:48,142
He flew divinely, remained in the body, and dwelt in the desert; so that the children of the desolate would be more numerous than those of her who had a husband.

263
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:51,144
Let us therefore follow that body, so that we too may rise.

264
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:53,586
For where the body is, there too are the eagles.

265
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:56,690
Whoever cannot fly like an eagle, let him fly like a sparrow.

266
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:04,678
Whoever cannot fly to heaven, let him fly to the mountains, fleeing the lowlands, which are quickly corrupted by moisture, and let him pass to the mountains.

267
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:12,055
Lot's nephew passed to the mountain of Zoar and was saved; but she who could not ascend, reclining in her feminine affection, lost her salvation.

268
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:22,587
Approach the eternal mountains, the Lord says through the prophet Micah: "Rise and depart, for this is not your place of rest. Because of uncleanness, you are destroyed and suffer corruption" (Micah 2:9-10).

269
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:26,708
And the Lord says, "Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains" (Luke 21:21).

270
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:33,087
Where Mount Zion and the city of peace, Jerusalem, are built not with earthly stones but with living ones.

271
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:40,560
And ten thousand angels, the church of the firstborn, the spirits of the perfected, the God of the just, who spoke better in His blood than Abel.

272
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,848
For he cried out for vengeance, but He for forgiveness: he accused his brother's sin, but He forgave the sin of the world.

273
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:52,621
He revealed the crime, but He covered it as it is written:
Blessed are those whose sins are covered
Psalms 31:1.

274
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,119
Chapter Six

275
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,908
How should someone who wishes to flee do so quickly?

276
00:34:56,908 --> 00:35:00,447
Where should they flee, and to what good should we lift our souls?

277
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,503
Let the one who flees, flee quickly, lest they be caught.

278
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:07,310
They should swiftly plunder this world, as the Hebrews plundered Egypt.

279
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:13,530
Whoever is in labor, let them give birth, lest, burdened and weighed down by the sins of the mind, they cannot flee.

280
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,444
And let them flee not as one carrying an infant, but as one unencumbered.

281
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:20,554
Not bearing a child, but presenting one perfect in Christ.

282
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:25,380
Let them flee not as one resting on the Sabbath, but as diligently as a worker on the job.

283
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,919
Not as a barren one in the cold, but as a fruitful one at harvest.

284
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:33,799
Therefore, it has been said: Pray that your flight may not be in winter, or on the Sabbath.

285
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:34,657
(Matthew 24:20).

286
00:35:34,657 --> 00:35:37,820
This flight is rich in virtues, not accomplished by merits.

287
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:46,560
It knows not the cold of fear, the trembling of death, the contraction of anxiety, the idleness of dissolution, the holidays of indulgence, or the torpor of sloth.

288
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:55,676
But the heavenly life requires a diligent traveler, a determined competitor for the higher kingdom, a rich farmer who gathers his fruits, and by gathering, plunders them.

289
00:35:55,676 --> 00:36:01,521
For what else is required of you, O man, but to fear the Lord, seek Him, walk after Him, and follow His ways?

290
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:02,593
(Deuteronomy 10:12).

291
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,845
In what, He says, shall I follow the Lord?

292
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,883
Shall I follow Him in burnt offerings?

293
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:13,692
Not in ten thousand goats, not in thousands of rams, not in the fruits of wickedness is the Lord reconciled, and sins redeemed.

294
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,802
But in a good life, the grace of the Lord is comprehended.

295
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:21,736
It has been declared to you, He says, O man, what is good, or what the Lord requires of you.

296
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:26,561
What else, but to do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord your God?

297
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:29,832
Therefore, the Gospel says to you: Rise, let us go from here.

298
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:30,529
(John 14:31).

299
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:33,210
The law says to you: Walk after the Lord your God.

300
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,229
(Deuteronomy 13:4).

301
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:37,286
You have learned how to flee from here, why do you delay?

302
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:42,487
The Gospel says to you again: Offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

303
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:43,237
(Matthew 3:7).

304
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:47,045
And this He says to those who were coming to the baptism of repentance.

305
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,652
Therefore, fleeing through repentance is good: fleeing with the grace of God is good, for it involves the assumption of the one fleeing.

306
00:36:55,652 --> 00:37:00,215
Fleeing to the desert is good, where Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist sought refuge.

307
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:06,075
Elijah fled from Jezebel, symbolizing the outpouring of vanity, and went to Mount Horeb, which signifies dryness.

308
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:11,260
This was so that the flow of carnal vanity would dry up in him, allowing him to know God more fully.

309
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:23,187
He was at the brook Cherith, meaning knowledge, where he could drink abundantly from the flowing divine knowledge, avoiding the world to the extent that he did not seek bodily food except what the birds, the servants, brought him.

310
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:25,106
His sustenance was often not earthly.

311
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:29,151
In fact, he walked for forty days on the strength of the food he had received.

312
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:32,884
Such a great prophet was not fleeing just a woman, but the world itself.

313
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:39,211
Was he afraid of death, he who had offered himself to his pursuer and said to the Lord, "Take my soul" (First Kings 19:4)?

314
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:48,804
He endured the weariness of this life not out of desire but to escape secular temptation, the contagion of a stained way of life, and the sacrileges of an impious and rebellious nation.

315
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:56,738
Solomon, too, in the form of that woman, reveals the corruption of this world and teaches us to avoid the arts of prostitutes (Proverbs 7 and elsewhere).

316
00:37:56,738 --> 00:38:01,094
This foreign and adulterous woman is one from whom he urges you to protect yourself.

317
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:07,679
Do not let your heart turn to the ways of the world, but place it in the hand of the Lord, in which lies the heart of the king.

318
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:14,939
For he who governs himself, which is more valuable than ruling others, has his heart in the hand of God, and God turns it wherever He wills.

319
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:18,569
It is no wonder if He turns it to good, for He is of perfect goodness.

320
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:31,585
Therefore, let us be in the hand of God, so that we may seek the good, that incorruptible and unchangeable good, about which the prophet Amos says: "Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and so the Lord God Almighty will be with you" (Amos 5:14).

321
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:45,586
How have you said: "We hated evil and loved good"? Where then is the good God, there are the good things, which David desired to see, and believed he would see, as he himself says: "I believe I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living" (Psalm 27:13).

322
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:50,314
The good things are the ones that last forever, untouched by time or age.

323
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:53,572
In those good things is the one who has sought and found God.

324
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:56,563
Where a person's heart is, there is also their treasure.

325
00:38:56,563 --> 00:38:59,821
The Lord does not usually deny a good thing to those who ask.

326
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:07,245
Because the Lord is good, and especially good to those who endure for His sake, let us cling to Him with all our soul, heart, and strength.

327
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:11,892
So that we may be in His light, see His glory, and enjoy the grace of heavenly delight.

328
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:15,951
Let us lift our spirits to that good, be in it, live in it, and cling to it.

329
00:39:15,951 --> 00:39:20,811
It is beyond all understanding and consideration, bringing perpetual peace and tranquility.

330
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:24,283
Peace, however, is beyond all understanding and beyond all sense.

331
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:28,769
This is the good that penetrates everything, and we all live in it and depend on it.

332
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:32,989
It has nothing above itself, for it is divine; no one is good except God alone.

333
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:36,300
Therefore, what is good is divine; and what is divine is good.

334
00:39:36,300 --> 00:40:07,759
And so it is said: "When you open your hand, they are filled with good things" Psalm 104:28.
Through the goodness of God, all good things are given to us by merit, untainted by evil. These good things are promised by Scripture to the faithful, saying: "If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good things of the land" Isaiah 1:19.
Therefore, let us be like that good, so we may obtain those good things. The good that is without iniquity, deceit, or harshness, but with grace, piety, sincerity, benevolence, charity, and justice. All virtues embrace goodness as a fertile mother.

335
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,743
Chapter Seven

336
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:14,753
The greatest reason why we should flee from here is because this is the very seat of wickedness.

337
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:16,109
What does it mean to flee?

338
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,875
Wickedness does not perish here, and for what reason?

339
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:23,779
Regarding the condemnation of the serpent, how does it differ from the judgment passed on man?

340
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:26,545
To this is added an explanation of the same judgment.

341
00:40:26,545 --> 00:40:35,624
Therefore, there is no small reason why we should flee from here: so that we may go from evil to good, from uncertainty to faithfulness and full of truth, from death to life.

342
00:40:35,624 --> 00:40:43,294
The Lord Himself also said, "I have set before you good and evil, life and death" (Deuteronomy 30:15), showing that good is life, but eternal life.

343
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:53,573
For if this life is subject to the world and its wickedness, certainly that life is good, which is neither corrupted nor changed, which does not degenerate by any vice, which is acquired by virtue.

344
00:40:53,573 --> 00:41:01,191
Therefore, let us flee the wickedness of this world, in which the days themselves, he says (Ephesians 5:16), are evil; and let us flee diligently.

345
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:19,819
And so Isaiah cries out, "Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees" (Isaiah 35:3), which means, not the knees of the body, but of the soul; strengthen them, so that the path of the mind may be lifted up to the highest heights of heaven, so that the guide may be firmer, the life more mature, the grace fuller, the prudence more circumspect.

346
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:35,263
For this is to flee, to know where you are heading, to lift yourself up from the world, to lift yourself up from the body; lest anyone again exalts himself in vain, and inflated by the mind of his flesh does not hold onto the head, and it is said of them: "They fled, and did not see" (Job 9:25).

347
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:49,873
But this is to flee from here, to die to the elements of this world, to hide your life in God, to avoid corruptions, to not be stained by desires, to be ignorant of the things of this world, which generates various pains for us, empties us when it fills, fills us when it empties.

348
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:53,734
And all these things are empty and void, in which there is no solid fruit.

349
00:41:53,734 --> 00:42:02,813
The rich man died, and he has nothing; because he is not rich toward God: and therefore foolish, because wisdom is the worship of God, and abstaining from evil is discipline.

350
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:08,605
Who then would not flee from the place of wickedness, the workshop of depravity, which knows not how to perish?

351
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:17,469
Finally, the mark placed on Cain was not for nothing; it ensured that no one would kill him, signifying that wickedness should not be entirely extinguished from the earth.

352
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,656
Cain was afraid of being killed because he didn't know how to flee.

353
00:42:20,656 --> 00:42:29,360
Wickedness grows and accumulates with use, knowing no moderation or end, acting through deceit and fraud, as shown by its actions and the blood of the slain, just as Cain was exposed.

354
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:37,494
Thus, wickedness roams the earth and wanders here; and so we pray for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10), so that innocence may also be here.

355
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:45,247
Since wickedness no longer has a place there, it moves around here, rages here, and spills over, not drowned by the worldly flood, nor burned by the fire of Sodom.

356
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:51,193
It grew more severely later in the schools, even laying its murderous and sacrilegious hands on the very author of salvation.

357
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,857
The law condemns the act but does not remove wickedness.

358
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:59,136
The Lord Jesus himself condemned sin, but spared its author, so that the righteous might be tested through him.

359
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:10,267
For God did not create evil; the devil's malice planted it, and God delayed vengeance so that the devil might be defeated by those he had deceived (Confessions of Saint Augustine, Book IV against the two Pelagian letters, Chapter 11).

360
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:17,544
Therefore, those deceived are put to the test, to pay the price of their vulnerability and to take up the pursuit of virtue and the diligence of caution.

361
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,208
Hence he says: Be as shrewd as serpents (Matthew 10:16).

362
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,064
Why like serpents?

363
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:27,675
So that he may be stripped of his own, and he who wanted to strip others may lose what is his, not his venom, but the merits of his nature.

364
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,626
Finally, he is cast down when you ascend.

365
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:33,241
For it is written: I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven (Luke 10:18).

366
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:39,091
It does not say lightning, but like lightning; because he lost his light, which he had before he wanted to take your light.

367
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:44,466
But perhaps you will say that we also read about the Savior that he will flash like lightning from under the sky.

368
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:44,513
.

369
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:44,561
.

370
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,082
so will be the coming of the Son of Man (Luke 17:24).

371
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,983
Well, here too like lightning, because it is above lightning.

372
00:43:49,983 --> 00:43:53,456
For lightning is from under the sky; but the true light is above the sky.

373
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,746
Therefore, Satan fell like lightning because he lost what he had.

374
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:59,831
But you have regained what you had lost.

375
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:02,853
The judgment against him was not lifted as it was for you.

376
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:05,250
The grace of Christ that freed you, bound him.

377
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,793
The curse remains directly on the serpent because of your deception.

378
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:13,274
Thus it was said to him: Cursed are you above all livestock on the earth Genesis 3:14.

379
00:44:13,274 --> 00:44:18,745
He is the common enemy of all, who was an enemy of good and is condemned for those he had not yet harmed.

380
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:22,706
Because he harmed man, to whom all things are subject, he harmed everything.

381
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:27,395
He broke the common law by which he himself was subject to man along with other creatures.

382
00:44:27,395 --> 00:44:31,355
Therefore, his curse is burdened by the common hatred and execration of all.

383
00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:39,380
The nature of his condemnation is not death but long-lasting punishment: You will crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life Genesis 3:14.

384
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,663
A guilty conscience had to be pressed down, and malice crushed.

385
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:46,154
The deceitful secret had to be banished as if from the face of God.

386
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:49,853
At the same time, it shows that earthly malice bends down to the earth.

387
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:53,813
Finally, it added: You will eat dust all the days of your life Genesis 3:14.

388
00:44:53,813 --> 00:45:06,058
Indeed, the nature of the serpent seems to be described by these words, but more so is every vessel of malice, every serpent of wickedness, that throws itself down to the belly, encloses its venom within, and rolls it inside its chest.

389
00:45:06,058 --> 00:45:16,845
It is slippery in its thoughts, walking over its own frauds, entangling itself in its own deceit, always moving and agitating its venom when it thinks, trampling its belly, that is, the seedbed of its heart.

390
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:22,681
Hence, David beautifully said: The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.

391
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:31,695
Their venom is like the venom of a serpent, like a deaf adder that stops its ears, so that it does not hear the voice of charmers, or of the cunning enchanter Psalms 58:3-5.

392
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:38,729
Because of this, it also seems beautifully said what we read in the prophetic book: My belly, my belly, I writhe in pain Jeremiah 4:19.

393
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:40,361
Matthew 4:19.

394
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:52,342
Where there should be innocence, there is wickedness; and what should be peaceful within us is troubled, trampled by traces of wickedness, pricked by claws, and shaken by the spread of evil, where the fertile seedbed of eternal posterity lies.

395
00:45:52,342 --> 00:46:00,873
This seems to refer to the fact that he grieved over losing the children he created and accepted, but even more so because he did not have the seed of the word in his heart.

396
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:03,535
Therefore, he calls his heart the most precious thing.

397
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:11,523
Indeed, the heart of the mind is precious, where the fertile crop of plans sprouts from the seed of the word, forming parts of all life, virtues, and disciplines.

398
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:16,750
Returning to the point, God thought malice should be restrained for the time being, rather than abolished.

399
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:25,724
He said to the serpent: "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; she will crush your head, and you will strike her heel" (Genesis 3:15).

400
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:31,394
Where there is enmity, there is discord and the desire to harm; where there is the desire to harm, there is malice.

401
00:46:31,394 --> 00:46:35,142
Therefore, discord between the serpent and the woman has malice at its root.

402
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,276
Malice was not removed.

403
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:41,700
The serpent was allowed to observe the heel of the woman and her offspring, to harm them and inject his venom.

404
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,447
Therefore, let us not walk in earthly things, so the serpent cannot harm us.

405
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:52,399
Let us take up the Gospel footwear, which excludes the serpent's venom and dulls his bite, fitting our feet with the readiness of the Gospel.

406
00:46:52,399 --> 00:47:02,656
Perhaps that is why Moses was ordered to remove his sandals, to take the sandals of the Gospel; or because the preaching of the Gospel was owed not to Moses, that is, not to the prophets, but to the apostles.

407
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:06,009
This is the sentence we mentioned above, spoken against the serpent.

408
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:09,115
Let us consider what kind of sentence was directed against man.

409
00:47:09,115 --> 00:47:13,355
Cursed is the author of sin; but he who was deceived by another's fraud is not cursed.

410
00:47:13,355 --> 00:47:17,497
Yet because he did not keep God's command, he is condemned to the toil of his works.

411
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:24,511
The earth is cursed because of the works of the sinner (Genesis 3:17) and remains cursed until it returns to the ground.

412
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:28,371
This is why Jesus took on human flesh: to remove the curse of sinful flesh.

413
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:36,194
He became a curse for us so that blessing could overcome the curse, purity could conquer sin, mercy could replace judgment, and life could defeat death.

414
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:41,650
He even accepted death to fulfill God's judgment, which was that sinful flesh would be cursed until death.

415
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,539
Therefore, nothing happened against God's judgment because the divine decision was carried out.

416
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:49,730
The curse lasted until death, but after death, there is grace.

417
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:54,414
So, since we are dead to the world, why do we still concern ourselves with worldly matters?

418
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:58,222
We are dead with Christ, so why do we still seek the actions of this life?

419
00:47:58,222 --> 00:48:03,214
We carry the death of Christ in our bodies so that the life of Christ may also be revealed in us.

420
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:10,368
Therefore, we no longer live our old lives, but instead live the life of Christ—a life of innocence, chastity, simplicity, and all virtues.

421
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:18,037
Since we have risen with Christ, let us live in Him, ascend with Him, so that the serpent (symbolizing evil) cannot find our heel to strike on earth.

422
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:19,895
Chapter Eight

423
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:26,554
Though our bodies are here, we can and should let our spirits flee so we do not vanish with the transient world and its deeds.

424
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:33,159
To avoid this, let's adhere to God's commandments and strive in any discipline, just as many holy ones have done in the past.

425
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:36,276
Let us flee from here in spirit, even if our bodies remain.

426
00:48:36,276 --> 00:48:45,788
We can be here physically but present with the Lord if our souls cling to Him, if we follow Him in our thoughts, if we walk by faith and not by sight, and if we seek refuge in Him.

427
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:51,601
For He is our refuge and strength, as David says: "I took refuge in You, and I was not deceived"
(Psalm 76:3).

428
00:48:51,601 --> 00:49:05,551
Therefore, because God is our refuge, and He is in heaven and above, we must flee from here to there, where there is peace and rest from our labors, celebrating the great Sabbath, as Moses said: "And the Sabbaths of the land will be food for you"
(Leviticus 25:6).

429
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:09,144
It is a joyous banquet to rest in Christ and experience His delight.

430
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:11,680
So, will we who flee to God return to the world?

431
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,058
Will we who have died to sin repeat our sins?

432
00:49:14,058 --> 00:49:17,334
Will we who have renounced the world cling to its filth again?

433
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,712
Let us flee from here, for the time is short.

434
00:49:19,712 --> 00:49:39,369
Listen to how you should flee:
"Those who have wives should be as though they have none; those who weep, as though they do not weep; those who rejoice, as though they do not rejoice; those who buy, as though they do not possess; and those who use this world, as though they do not use it. For the form of this world is passing away"
(First Corinthians 7:29 and following).

435
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:45,129
Therefore, let not our deeds vanish with this fleeting world, lest we also pass away; let us remain in truth.

436
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:55,116
If we remain in Christ, we stay in truth, we will be with Him and not pass away, and we will say:
"The blessing of the Lord be upon you; we bless you in the name of the Lord"
(Psalm 128:8).

437
00:49:55,116 --> 00:50:02,620
Those who pass away cannot say this because they did not say it while passing by:
"The blessing of the Lord be upon you," as the Prophet said.

438
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:10,307
So, if we want our works to last, we must not neglect God's commandments, the diligence in seeking Jesus our Lord, nor earning His grace.

439
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:16,849
That woman did not neglect Him when she entered the Pharisee's house, where Christ was reclining, and poured perfume on His feet.

440
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:21,616
We must not neglect progress in any discipline, just as young Joseph did not neglect his duty.

441
00:50:21,616 --> 00:50:25,875
He sought his brothers and hurried to the place where they were grazing their sheep.

442
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,462
When he learned they were in Dothan, he went there.

443
00:50:28,462 --> 00:51:42,754
The word "Dothan" signifies a significant decline, meaning a complete and substantial decline of false opinions, which leads to the progress of the soul. For a wise person, when they diminish something, they add to it. Secular opinions, compared to weak women, decline. Thus, it is beautifully shown that Sarah reached maturity to bring forth joy and happiness. She said, "Sarah was past the age of childbearing" Genesis 18:11. Therefore, the decline of desires and vanity is good because it is an addition of truth. Thus, the holy David said, "My soul faints with longing for your salvation" Psalm 119:81. She who had conceded and promised to God was about to give birth to joy and a sober kind of joyful intoxication, giving birth unexpectedly through the swiftness of her mind, the offspring of wisdom. Finally, you also have it written about other Hebrew women that they give birth before the midwives arrive Exodus 1:19, because the souls of the righteous do not wait for arts and disciplines for the sake of inventions, nor do they seek aids for childbirth, but they bring forth their offspring spontaneously, ahead of expectations.
Jacob was no less diligent in finding than in executing. When his mother told him to bring food to his father, we see that he had all the necessary definitions. He quickly found what he needed and testified that God was the author of his discoveries, signifying both the reward of diligence and the abundance of his ingenuity.

444
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:51,614
The first definition in discovery is this: what is found is sought, and what is sought involves time; what involves time surely requires diligence.

445
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:58,230
But what surpasses the use of time, God instills, God gives: what God gives pertains to nature, not to diligence.

446
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,279
Therefore, talent is a divine gift.

447
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:02,679
What is a divine gift pertains to nature.

448
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:09,003
So, talent is of nature, while discovery is of diligence: the former is without time, the latter needs time.

449
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:17,316
Consequently, the former is present in time, the latter is investigated in the span of time: the former is above us, the latter relates to us.

450
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:34,412
To one seeking the food of the word (for man does not live by bread alone, but by every word of God: Isaac was seeking such food, Peter was hungry for such food when he saw the mysteries of the Gentile people who would believe), Esau did not have the food of spiritual and swift talent ready.

451
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:47,527
While he was hunting and seeking, and preparing to present a very harsh and wild speech, Jacob anticipated with a quick discovery, and with a gentle and almost familiar reply, offering a sweet word to soothe and delight him.

452
00:52:47,527 --> 00:52:57,539
Wherefore the astonished father said: "What is this, that you have found so quickly, my son?" Jacob answered: "Because the Lord your God brought it to me" (Genesis 27:20).

453
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:01,403
The first definition is in the question, the second in the answer.

454
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:13,815
Thus finding everything complete, whether of talent or diligence, the father concluded with a definition saying: "See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed" (Genesis 27:27).

455
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:23,007
For the field has both the natural talent of fertility and the temporal diligence of cultivation, and rightly in it is fullness, to which nothing is lacking.

456
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:39,224
When he added: "Which the Lord has blessed," he seems to have preferred the grace of nature to the labor of cultivation. And Esau confirmed it, saying: "Rightly is his name called Jacob. For he has supplanted me these two times, and he has taken my birthright" (Genesis 27:36).

457
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:44,142
But perhaps you might say: In what did he delay, who was sent by his father to hunt?

458
00:53:44,903 --> 00:53:50,397
But consider that even the father declared he couldn't have it ready because it was asked for spiritually.

459
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:54,544
Since he lacked the intelligence or means to provide it, he demanded assistance.

460
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:57,653
He also reminds us of speed, saying: Take the bow and arrow.

461
00:53:57,653 --> 00:53:58,638
Second Kings 13:18.

462
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:03,510
However, he received the fruit of diligence, recognizing that the gift of intelligence is 438.

463
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:08,537
And rightly, he brought domestic food, having acquired wisdom from the domestic seed for himself.

464
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:12,787
Diligence combined with wisdom is beneficial, as is invention with natural talent.

465
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:18,696
Finally, the holy Isaac, having wisdom in abundance, was walking in the field, or rather, he was being distracted.

466
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:23,464
We should first join wisdom and then go out into the field with the desire to seek and find.

467
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:25,123
Many seek poorly without wisdom.

468
00:54:25,123 --> 00:54:34,193
Therefore, Cain, who had not received prudence from God, sought poorly and went out into the field poorly; whereas Abel, who completed the perfect gift of sacrifice, did well.

469
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:38,132
The sacrifice of wisdom is good, faith is a good offering, and every virtue.

470
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:41,552
Finally, wisdom killed her victims and mixed her wine in the bowl.

471
00:54:41,552 --> 00:54:48,135
To give the drink of faith to the foolish Gentiles, she called them to her bowl saying: Whoever is foolish, let him turn to me.

472
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:48,808
Proverbs 9:4.

473
00:54:48,808 --> 00:54:54,043
And to those lacking sense, she said: Come, eat of my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed for you.

474
00:54:54,043 --> 00:54:54,717
Proverbs 9:5.

475
00:54:54,717 --> 00:55:03,942
Plato thought this bowl should be transferred into his books, calling souls to its drink, but he did not know how to fill them, offering not the drink of faith, but of treachery.

476
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:06,168
Chapter Nine

477
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:16,406
He urges us to flee from here, just as Jacob fled from his homeland, and like deer to springs; those who long for these springs must pour out their souls over themselves, following Susanna's example.

478
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:23,095
Just as Paul and Lot fled, we too must flee to the heavenly city until the high priest dies: with whom our old self must also die.

479
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:26,439
Let us flee from here just as Saint Jacob fled from his homeland.

480
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:28,754
For he knew that the true homeland was above.

481
00:55:28,754 --> 00:55:34,362
Let us flee like deer to the springs of water, which David thirsted for, and our souls should thirst for too.

482
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,391
What is that spring?

483
00:55:35,391 --> 00:57:01,107
Listen to what is said: "For with You is the fountain of life" Psalm 36:9. To this fountain, let the soul say: "When shall I come and appear before Your presence?" Psalm 42:2. For God is the fountain, but whoever desires this fountain must pour out their soul over themselves; leaving nothing to the desires of the flesh, but letting the soul overflow everywhere.
Susanna beautifully poured out her soul, so that the fires of the body, the fears of death, and the desires of life could not evaporate in her. The soul poured out over her extinguished all carnal desire and worldly ambition. She was even able to extinguish the flames of the wicked elders and shameless priests, except that in them the flood of lust overflowed. When they accused her, if she denied their adulterous demands, Susanna groaned and said: "I am trapped on every side. For if I do this, I will perish eternally: but if I do not, I will not escape your hands" Daniel 13:22. However, she judged it better to flee from the crime rather than the danger. So she wept when the crime was accused of her: she wept when the judgment of an adulteress was vindicated against her, not mourning death, but the slander against her chastity. She wept for the injury to her religion and poured out over herself not her body, but her soul. For she would have poured out her body, if she had yielded to carnal desires. Finally, when she was condemned to death, she cried out like a judge of the guilty, an arbiter of the slanderers; and with the authority of her innocent conscience, she called upon divine judgment to witness, not driven by the fear of death, but by the high power of a rebuking conscience.

484
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:09,241
Susanna fled from the world and dedicated herself to God, finding refuge in the eternal city that encompasses everything, because all things exist within God.

485
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:15,234
Paul also escaped by being lowered through a window in a basket, knowing that a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.

486
00:57:15,234 --> 00:57:20,335
He fled to spread the Gospel of the Lord throughout the world, and thus, he was taken up into paradise.

487
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:27,318
Let us also escape through the window by listening to the Lord's commandments, keeping a clear vision, and preserving the purity of our eyes.

488
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:30,983
Let us flee like Lot, fearing the sins of Sodom more than its punishments.

489
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:35,936
A truly pious person avoids the contamination of sins, just as Lot closed his home to the Sodomites.

490
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:39,948
He did not live with them, did not know their crimes, and shunned their disgrace.

491
00:57:39,948 --> 00:57:43,266
He did not look back at those whose ways of life he did not desire.

492
00:57:43,266 --> 00:57:55,698
Therefore, flee like Lot, who renounces vices, rejects the behaviors of the inhabitants, does not look back, and enters that higher city with the entrance of his thoughts, not leaving it until the High Priest, who took away the sin of the world, dies.

493
00:57:55,698 --> 00:58:03,969
He died once, but he dies for each person who is baptized into the death of Christ; so that we are buried with him, rise with him, and walk in the newness of his life.

494
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:07,832
You flee well if your heart does not follow the plans and thoughts of sinners.

495
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:12,983
You flee well if your eyes avoid cups and flasks, so as not to become lustful while lingering over wine.

496
00:58:12,983 --> 00:58:17,688
You flee well if your eyes turn away from what is not yours, so your tongue can keep the truth.

497
00:58:17,688 --> 00:58:20,461
You flee well if you do not respond foolishly to a fool.

498
00:58:20,461 --> 00:58:22,987
You flee well if you avoid the path of the foolish.

499
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:28,336
It is easy to go astray with bad leaders; but if you want to flee well, keep your ways far from their words.

500
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:32,199
The High Priest died for you, he was crucified for you, so cling to his nails.

501
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:40,966
He took on your flesh and your sins: the records of your offenses are nailed to the cross; so you no longer owe anything to the world, which you have renounced once and for all.

502
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:48,426
And rightly, you owe nothing, for you can say:
For the world is crucified to me, and I to the world
Galatians six fourteen.

503
00:58:48,426 --> 00:58:53,754
So you no longer fear death if you bear Christ, in whom you can say:
Where, death, is your victory?

504
00:58:53,754 --> 00:58:57,251
Where, death, is your sting
First Corinthians fifteen fifty-five?

505
00:58:57,251 --> 00:59:05,485
For when our old self was nailed to the cross, sin was destroyed, the sting was dulled, and guilt was emptied;
so that we may no longer serve wickedness.

506
00:59:05,485 --> 00:59:07,260
For the old self has passed away.

507
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:19,583
Now, however, it is not the old self in us: but a new creation, having within it the likeness of Christ,
whose death we have been buried with, and we have taken on the likeness of his life, receiving the wings of spiritual grace.

508
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:26,632
So fly in such a way that it is said of you:
Who are these who fly like clouds, and like doves with their young
Isaiah sixty eight?

509
00:59:26,632 --> 00:59:30,776
Let your clouds rain righteousness, and let the doves bring forth simplicity.

510
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:40,462
Sail in such a way as to cross the world, not wandering, like the ships of Tarshish;
so that you may direct your course to the intelligent harbors, and bring the wealth of the sea.

511
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:46,274
Hurry in such a way that it is said of you:
They have become swifter than eagles
Lamentations four nineteen.

512
00:59:46,274 --> 01:00:01,395
For you see that you must flee from the coming wrath, which those who place their hope in repentance and have drawn faith in future reconciliation through our Lord Jesus Christ will be able to avoid,
to whom is the kingdom from ages past, and now, and always, and forever and ever.

513
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:01,664
Amen.
