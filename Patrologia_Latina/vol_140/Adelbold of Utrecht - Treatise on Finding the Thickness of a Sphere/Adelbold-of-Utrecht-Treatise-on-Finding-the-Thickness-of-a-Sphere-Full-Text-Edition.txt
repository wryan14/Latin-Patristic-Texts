## A Short Work by Adelbold, Bishop of Utrecht, of the Order of Saint Benedict, on the Method of Finding the Volume of a Sphere, addressed to Pope Sylvester the Second

This work now appears for the first time in print, from manuscripts of the celebrated monasteries of Tegernsee and Saint Peter's in Salzburg, through the efforts of the most reverend Father Alphonsus Hueber, monk of Tegernsee.


## Preface

To Lord Sylvester, supreme pontiff and philosopher, Adelbold the scholar wishes perpetual life and happiness.

It is a grave offense to disturb someone devoted to the public good with private requests. But I trust in your ability to attend both to the needs of the commonwealth and to answer what I am asking.

And yet I act rashly, and I sin knowingly, that I, a young man, approach so great a man as though he were my fellow student. But confession of sin not only seeks pardon, I say, but demands it.

Perhaps you think that I sin in such a way that I do not wish to repent of having sinned, and therefore my confession, being without the fruit of repentance, should neither seek pardon nor demand any remission. To this I will respond that if I offend your kindness in this approach, I will regret having approached you more than you could believe. And therefore I judge that pardon ought to be granted to one who grieves and repents, who confesses his sin, and who wishes to abstain from such offense in the future—especially by one who holds the place of him to whom it was said, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter eighteen, verse twenty-two: I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.

But if I do not offend, and if I seek what I will obtain through your goodwill—since in obtaining it I will rejoice to benefit both myself and many others—then regarding the questions I have already sent to your authority, since they have not been answered, I either fear that I have offended you with them, or I hope that something great will come from the delay in their solution.

But I will not propose yet another question, so that either from what I fear I might grieve more, and the magnitude of my grief might move you to pardon, or from what I hope I might rejoice more, and the fullness of my joy might implore future reward for you.

And indeed, regarding what I now wish to propose, I seem to see by what reasoning it can be analyzed and brought to understanding. But I await your careful attention to settle the matter definitively, so that the authority of so great a man may either correct or confirm my understanding.

What the problem is, then, and by what thought processes I am both misled and held to certainty concerning it, I will now reveal, so that once the wound of hesitation is opened, the medicine of certainty may be ready from you.


## Section 1

Macrobius, in his commentary on the Dream of Scipio, where he speaks about the size of the heavens, earth, sun, and moon, and their spherical roundness, says that it has been discovered by the most expert geometers that with two circles, if the diameter of one is double the diameter of the other, the volume of the circle whose diameter is double is eight times the volume of the circle whose diameter is half.

To find the circumference from the diameter, the diameter from the circumference, and the area from the diameter and circumference, and therefore to compare diameter to diameter, circumference to circumference, and area to area—this is easy for those who are accustomed to dealing with such matters.

But how can someone compare volume to volume who has not yet grasped what volume is? For the comparison of two things does not precede knowledge of them, but follows it. Hence it happens that one cannot understand that one volume is eight times another volume if one does not know how the volume of each sphere is calculated.

What I have already understood from this I will reveal—not, as they say, teaching Minerva her letters, but to show what I think, so that if I err, I may be led back to the path by your wisdom, or if I hold the path though stumbling, I may be supported by reliance on your authority. But to reach what I aim for, I will begin with things that are known to many.


## Section 2

I take a diameter of seven feet. From this I find the circumference as follows: I triple it, and add one seventh of that tripled amount to it, and thus I have a circumference of twenty-two feet.

Now when I multiply half the diameter, which is three and one half, by half the circumference, which is eleven, I get an area of thirty-eight and one half square feet for this same circle.

So now I have the diameter, I have the circumference, I have the area! But to find the volume, I cube this same diameter, and I construct a cube of such a kind that it touches the roundness of the sphere on its faces, but exceeds it at the corners and along the lines running from corner to corner.

From such a cube it is necessary to cut away that volume which extends from the spherical surface to the corners and lines, so that when this is cut away, only the solid volume of the sphere remains.

I make this reduction in the following way. I divide the total of the whole cube into twenty-first parts. From this I take one twenty-first part of the cube, which is sixteen: I multiply it by ten, and I have the portions cut away from the cube. Then by eleven, and I have the volume of the sphere. That is, from these twenty-first parts I assign ten to the excised portions of the cube; the remaining ones I leave to the volume of the sphere.

This would be the same if I multiplied the total of the whole cube by eleven, and from that product subtracted one twenty-first. For this twenty-first part is as large as those eleven twenty-first parts that were taken from the simple cube.


## Section 3

To make what we are saying clearer, we will assign definite numbers to two volumes so that we can compare the assigned values to each other—not because these are more accurate, or because we believe you are ignorant of them, but so that having shown our methods to your careful attention, we may henceforth be guided by you and not go astray.

For a circle whose diameter is seven feet, I find the volume as follows. I cube the diameter and say: seven times seven makes forty-nine. Again, seven times forty-nine makes three hundred forty-three. Behold the cube of that square whose each side is seven feet, and this cube completely encloses the spherical volume.

But to cut away the excess portions, I do this: I take one twenty-first of three hundred forty-three, which is sixteen and two thirds. If I multiply this by ten, I have one hundred sixty-three and one third, namely the excess portions of the cube. If by eleven, I have one hundred seventy-nine and two thirds, namely the volume of the sphere.

To make what we are saying more evident, let us draw a circle within a square, so that what is seen in the plane may be more easily understood in three dimensions.

Behold, in this sphere the diameter is seven feet, the circumference twenty-two, the area thirty-eight and one half, and the volume one hundred seventy-nine and two thirds.

Now it is not surprising if the cube obtains nearly half of its volume in its excess portions, since this square in the plane retains scarcely a third in its projecting portions.

For in this square, when each side is seven feet, it will have an area of forty-nine according to the measurement of the sides. And when the circle has taken thirty-eight and one half of these for itself, the square will retain only ten and one half in its cut-away corners.


## Section 4

Why this seems to me to be so, if it is not tedious for you to hear, will not be burdensome for me to say.

For here is what happens: if the square is raised upward seven times in height, it yields three hundred forty-three cubic feet, carrying upward with it both its excess portions and the area of the circle. For seven times ten and one half, that is the excess portions, makes seventy-three and one half; and seven times thirty-eight and one half, that is the area of the circle, makes two hundred sixty-nine and one half. But seventy-three and one half and two hundred sixty-nine and one half make three hundred forty-three.

Therefore, raising the square upward is nothing other than carrying along with it its excess portions and the area of the circle.

Therefore from that cube which had risen from an area of forty-nine square feet, if someone cuts away seven times ten and one half, that is seventy-three and one half, he has not yet achieved spherical roundness, but has established something shaped like a bushel measure, carried from equal circular area to equal circular area, namely into two hundred sixty-nine and one half cubic feet.

But from this cylinder we should remove not half, lest it be sharpened on both sides like a spinning top, but one third, which is eighty-nine and three ninths, in order to shape the sphere.

But this third part, together with the corner excess portions, though not yet completely spherical in form—that is, eighty-nine and three ninths plus the seven corner excesses, that is seventy-three and one half—yields the same as the ten twenty-first parts which were removed from the whole cube in order to round the sphere on all sides. And these ten twenty-first parts would nearly reach half of the cube, except that one forty-second part of the same cube prevents it.


## Section 5

Now it is easy to see, since the square does not surpass the circle by even a third of itself, why the cube exceeds the spherical volume by nearly half of itself.

But this cylinder-shaped form, which is rounded by cutting away the sides of the cube on all sides, although it cannot be fully represented, let it nevertheless be illustrated to some degree, so that what the inadequacy of words conceals, the truth of a drawing may reveal.
