Part Two of the Miracles

So he went to Rome with all devotion of mind, in order to be healed there through the blessed bodies of the saints, which rest there in countless numbers. He stayed there for almost five years in prayer, but did not obtain a cure for his blindness. 

Finally, while he was there, he heard from pilgrims coming to Rome from the lands of the English to the tombs of the Apostles, that the Lord was healing countless illnesses through the merit of Saint Swithun. 

He quickly left the said city, and returning to the region from which he had been born, he sought the tomb of the holy bishop. That very night, he was granted to receive his former sight, and illuminated by the Lord, the Creator of the world, he returned home safe, glorifying the King of Heaven and praising the all-creating God.

He was led by his relatives to Winchester, where he received healing through the omnipotence of the Holy Trinity. 

Indeed, after he approached the church where the remains of the holy man were resting, he persevered in vigils and prayers for three days and nights. When these were completed, his eyes were opened, and the old strength returned to his arms and hands. 

Soon he left there healthy, blessing God.

He had a guide as the blind usually have, who would lead him either to the church or wherever he needed to go, and then bring him back home whenever he wished. 

On one occasion, the guide, in anger, left the blind man far from his lodging. When he had no idea how to return home, he prayed to God, the ruler of all things, with heartfelt cries that He would look upon him more kindly, pouring out such prayers: 

"O Lord, ruler of angels and men, I know that nothing can escape your providence. You see me deprived of light, far removed from my own home, and abandoned by my stubborn guide. 

Look upon my humility; direct my actions according to your will, guide my steps to you, and grant me, unworthy as I am, eternal light in heaven with the saints and the chosen ones. 

Have mercy on me, Lord, according to your will, and deal with me according to the mercy of your kindness. Do not leave me any longer in the hands of the wicked, but either receive my soul from this little body or restore clear light to my blindness through the merits of Saint Swithun. 

I also ask you, most merciful bishop, through whom the magnificent Creator of things offers healing to various illnesses, that you assist me with your holy prayers. For I believe that you will immediately obtain anything you ask from the Lord. 

Therefore, ask the Prince of Light to restore the light of my eyes."

He returned home safe without a guide, to the amazement of his neighbors and relatives, beyond what can be believed, how their kinsman, who had left there shortly before deprived of light, was evidently illuminated by the Lord. 

When they learned how their friend had recovered his health through the venerable bishop of God, they glorified the Lord with one voice, who alone does great wonders, whose name and dominion remain forever and ever.

, who were tormented by pains for many summers and by various...

During these distressing times, there were two blind men and two women who were crippled in both hands and lame in their feet. Hearing about the miracles God had performed through His servant, they went to the tomb of the holy bishop, praying earnestly to the triune and one God of heaven and earth.

As soon as they arrived together, the blind men’s eyes were opened, and the women’s hands and feet were instantly healed, allowing them to walk in front of everyone and make the sign of the holy cross on their foreheads with their hands.

They then performed all necessary tasks and returned home, blessing the Lord, the author of their healing.

At the same time, a servant girl had been stolen from a man in the northern regions of the Angles and brought to the city where the holy bishop's body rested. She was sold to a man named Urban in that city. After living for a long time under this new master, the man from whom she had been stolen came to Winchester to buy what he needed.

When the girl heard this, she boldly spoke to her former master without the permission of her current one.

When her mistress found out that she had been talking to a man from another province, she ordered the girl to be heavily shackled to prevent her from returning to her former master.

The next day, the mistress left early in the morning to attend to some business, leaving the shackled girl at home.

The girl, as soon as she could, went outside and sat miserably by the threshold of the house. With all her heart, she began to pray to the Creator God to free her from the cruel bonds of her wicked mistress.

Turning towards the temple where the holy bishop’s body was venerated, she fervently prayed for God’s help through his intercession and immediately received the desired relief.

Meanwhile, an elderly priest with a venerable appearance, dressed in pure white garments, quickly approached the shackled girl.

He gently asked her why she was sorrowful, took her by the right arm, and led her to the saint’s tomb in a moment.

Amidst the countless crowd surrounding the monastery’s entrance, he placed her, still shackled, near the sacred altar where the holy man’s body rested.

It was astonishing that no one saw her or the priest who brought her until she was placed in the chapel, which the present crowd saw was locked by the custodians. Her mistress, as best she could, hurriedly followed the servant girl’s tracks.

When the monk who guarded the saint’s body and held the chapel’s key saw this, he was greatly amazed and said to himself,

“Who locked this woman inside the saint’s chamber that I see? Do you think she found the door open, which I had closed just a moment ago with the bolt?”

Approaching the chapel door and speaking to her within earshot of the crowd, he asked, “Who brought you into this venerable place where you now stand? With what boldness did you dare to enter the enclosure where Christ's bishop rests? How did you manage to hide since I did not see you when I closed the door?”

She, seeing a young cleric standing behind her outside the balcony, responded to the monk, saying, “This cleric lifted me onto his shoulders and carried me to this place, placing me before the saint.”

The cleric, on the other hand, responded with an oath, “I have never seen you before with my own eyes.”

The woman said: "You indeed brought me here."

The cleric replied: "I would prefer that the dogs of the night tear you apart with dreadful bites than to place such an unworthy burden on my back."

She, gathering herself, retorted: "A certain priest, gray-haired and very venerable, dressed in dazzlingly splendid garments, found me weeping at the Lady's threshold and comforted me with the sweetest words."

Taking hold of my sleeve, he swiftly brought me to this basilica with such speed and grace that I cannot describe it in words."

And since, after he left me at this entrance, I saw no other cleric around except this young man, I thought he was the one who brought me here."

And when the crowds of people, who were present from different parts of England, heard this, they were greatly amazed and glorified the Lord, King of all, and Savior of mankind, who deigned to perform such unheard-of miracles through the merits of His glorious saintly priest.

To Him be glory, praise, and dominion, who lives as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and reigns as God for endless ages.

At that time, two women from distant western lands came to the tomb of the man of God to pray.

One of them could not see with her own eyes, and the other had been mute from birth until nearly old age.

The mute woman guided the blind one throughout the journey, asking passersby for directions.

When they reached the place where the holy bishop rested, the blind woman received her sight, and the mute woman gained the ability to speak.

They were healed from above through the merit of the glorious man, and they immediately returned home, glorifying the almighty Lord.

Then, thirty-six sick people came to Winchester to seek recovery of their health.

Among them were some who were blind, some deaf, some mute, and some paralyzed.

When they approached the monument of the holy bishop and prayed before God, all of them were healed through his intervention within three days; thus, they joyfully returned home with great happiness, magnifying and praising the Lord.

Not long after, one hundred and twenty-four people afflicted with various illnesses came to the same saint from different parts of Anglo-Saxon lands.

All of them were healed from various ailments by the merit of the holy bishop, with God's will, within two days, and they returned home healthy, blessing the Lord, who had gathered them when they were weak and sick.

I consider it unworthy to pass over in silence what a certain man, who had committed an illicit parricide, endured.

He had been bound cruelly with iron, bearing nine iron rings on his body, suffering for nine years abroad for his crime.

Hearing through rumors about the renowned miracles of God performed through His saint's merit in the province of the English, he came to Winchester from across the seas.

While fervently praying to God for a long time, seeking relief from his unbearable pain through the intervention of the holy healing bishop, the iron ring, which had cut into his stomach and was penetrating his vital organs, broke and sprang out of his body, releasing him from immense pain.

Another ring, which was causing severe torture to his arm due to the swelling flesh wound, covered in pus and blood, immediately fell at his feet, and the sharp pain instantly left him.

That ring was so tight that it barely seemed to fit three fingers, and it was miraculous that it sprang whole from the man's arm, and it was hung in the monastery as a testimony to this miracle.

In those times, a certain merchant named Flodoald, a man wise in worldly matters and abundant in wealth, had a servant whom he loved dearly.

The servant was arrested for a certain crime by the king's official and ordered to be guarded by the royal servants until his master arrived, and the ignited...

It happened as it is written in this page.

At the same time, a certain consul, highly favored by the king and very powerful in earthly matters, was riding urgently with a huge entourage, as is the custom among the Anglo-Saxons, to a certain village where a grand feast was prepared for necessary dining.

However, on the journey, a boy of exceptional character, whom the consul loved more than the others, fell hurriedly from his horse, breaking his leg and arm.

He was so completely injured that everyone present believed he was dead.

The head of the household, seeing his beloved boy dying and greatly saddened by the event, earnestly prayed to the Lord to have mercy on the dying boy through the intercession of the glorious and venerable bishop.

He said, "Saint Swithun, I beg you to plead with the Redeemer of the world to grant this boy life and health."

If my request is granted, I will be your most faithful servant for the rest of my life.

Moreover, I will bring this innocent child to your sacred tomb, so that through your healing intercession, he may experience the grace of Christ."

While the man was praying to God with such words, the boy suddenly jumped up, completely healed.

He who had just been lying in the grip of death now stood up.

When the consul saw this, he was overjoyed beyond words and began to glorify God with all the devotion of his heart, for God does not despise a contrite and humble heart.

Miracles attributed to this saint occurred not only in England but also in the land of the Franks.

In that region, as witnesses attest, a certain thief caught in a heinous crime was held in a dark prison, bound with wicked chains and a harsh shackle, awaiting execution the next day.

He had heard from merchants crossing the ocean for trade that a saint had been discovered in foreign lands, through whose intercession the sick were healed from various ailments.

Remembering this in the darkness of the night, he prayed to the incomprehensible power of Almighty God.
