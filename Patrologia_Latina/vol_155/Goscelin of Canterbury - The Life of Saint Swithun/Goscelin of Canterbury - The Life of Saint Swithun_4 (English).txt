CHAPTER ONE. Part one of the miracles.

After the body of the most holy bishop was placed inside the church, as previously mentioned, four or five sick people were healed at his tomb within the span of three days.

After the three days were completed, for nearly five months, there was rarely a day in the basilica where the relics of the holy man were kept that the sick were not healed—sometimes more than sixteen or eighteen, sometimes fewer, five or three, and very often seven, eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen.

We saw more than two hundred healed in ten days by the merit of the saint, and in the course of the year, they were countless.

We also saw around the aforementioned monastery streets so crowded on both sides with groups of the sick that any traveler would find it difficult to find a path to walk to it.

After a few days, they were cured by the grace of God and the merits of the saint so that within the basilica, scarcely five sick people could be found.

Therefore, let the envious and reprobate, who deny or twist the glorious miracles of this saint, be silent.

Let unbelievers also come to the holy servant of God to recognize the benefits of the Creator and praise the Creator.

Let the faithful know that our Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten of God, who at the beginning of this age, clothed in flesh, by Himself enlightened the blind, gave the lame the ability to walk, restored hearing to the deaf, cured the paralyzed, raised the dead, and walked on the sea with dry feet; the same, in our times, to glorify the omnipotence of His majesty and to manifest the merit of an outstanding priest, grants the benefit of health to countless sick bodies, like the sands of the sea, which are beyond counting.

In those days, three blind women lived on the Isle of Wight; one had never seen the light of day; two had been blind for nine years.

When they heard that the blind were being healed at the tomb of the holy bishop and that, through the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, the sick were also being cured, they asked their relatives and friends to take them as soon as possible across the island, which is entirely surrounded by the waters of the Ocean, from where they could more easily reach the place where the body of Christ’s bishop rested.

When they were set outside the island and were wandering without a guide, not knowing what to do, the compassionate Creator of creatures, pitying their plight, provided them a young man mute from birth, about 20 years old.

When they reached that place, the women began to implore him with one voice to lead them to the city of Winchester, where the holy bishop excelled in miraculous signs.

By the marvelous design of God, heeding their prayers, he led the blind women by a winding path to the specified place.

On the very night they entered the basilica where the bones of the servant of God rested, the three blind women, by the merit of the holy bishop, deserved to receive the light of their eyes from the true Light, God.

The young man, the guide of the women, with the dawn of light shining, was able to speak correctly.

He wanted it, and soon gave a signal to the guard to go outside the church so he could speak to him. The guard, curious about what he wanted to say, came to him asking why he called him. The young man said: 
"You should know that now I can speak properly."
 The guard asked: 
"Could you speak before?"
 He replied: 
"I have never spoken before, and now you have heard the first words that have come from my mouth. Yesterday, when I was mute, I led three blind women here who, with God’s help, now can see. So go, call the brothers, so they can give thanks as usual."

At the same time, a certain young servant girl was chained with iron shackles and terrible manacles by her master in Winchester for a small offense. She was to be tortured with cruel beatings and some bruises the next day. She spent the whole night praying to God with tears, asking to be freed from the wicked torturer through the intervention of the holy bishop. At dawn, the hour when she was to be tortured, as she prayed and cried, the shackles fell from her feet. She immediately escaped the danger, while her masters slept, and fled to the tomb of the holy bishop, still bound with the manacles. When her master was informed that the servant girl had fled to the servant of God and had been freed from her shackles through his intervention, he was filled with anger. He hurried there with great haste, and not by his own will but compelled by God, he removed the manacles and let her go unharmed, and did no further harm to her for that incident.

A certain man had been paralyzed for many years in a province of the English called Hamme in their language, so debilitated in all his limbs that he could not rise from his bed by any means. Hearing about the miracles the Lord was performing in Winchester through the merits of the holy prophet, he began to think it would be better for him if he could spend at least one night before the relics of the man of God. He called his relatives and friendly neighbors, begging them to harness their horses and carry him on a bier to the body of the holy bishop. His friends obeyed the sick man’s request and quickly did what he asked. But before the sick man finished speaking, he was cured through the compassion of the glorious bishop. Rising from his bed, he began his journey on foot and outpaced all the riders and companions who were accompanying him. He reached the revered relics of the holy bishop, healthy and ahead of his companions, although they were riding and using crutches to support him.

A certain noble matron lived in another English province called Bedfordshire. She had been blind for three years, unable to see the light of the sun. Suffering greatly, she promised to give many gifts to the holy bishop Swithun if she could regain her sight through his merits. When she was brought to the bones of the most blessed man by her servants, she gave a certain garment to God and Saint Swithun. As she laid it on the altar, she immediately regained the sight she had lost. Devoutly praising God and eating after receiving her healing, she returned home very joyful, having come to the bishop’s tomb in great sorrow, through the power of the all-creating God and our Savior Jesus Christ.

Another housewife also began to suffer from a severe illness at that time. All her relatives and servants came to her in turn, urging her with lamentations to arrange her affairs before her death.

Death was approaching, as they believed she would soon die.

But as her unbearable illness grew worse each day, losing hope for this life and nearing the proximity of death, she promised God and Saint Swithun that if she deserved to receive any remedy for her illness through his intervention, she would come to his tomb with many offerings as soon as she could, and spend one night in vigil before the most sacred body of God's servant.

While making this promise, she regained her bodily health but lost her mental vigor, for she forgot God's benefits, did not keep the promises she had made, and did not give thanks to God as was proper.

After some time, while planning to ride to a wedding with her husband, she ordered the servants to prepare the best horses.

Once they were splendidly adorned with trappings, her husband, with a few attendants, went ahead, and she followed quickly with more attendants.

While mounting the decorated horse and riding after her husband, she did not feel any pain or discomfort from her illness.

However, when she arrived at the wedding, where many noblemen and the king's prominent attendants were present, she was suddenly struck again by the illness from which she had recently been healed by God's holy servant.

Then, realizing her wrongdoing, as she had been cured by God through the merit of the saint but had not given glory to the Creator, she immediately repented as much as she could.

Summoning her attendants, she begged them to carry her as quickly as possible to the place where the holy man rested, so that through God's mercy, she might again regain her health.

Once she was brought there with the help of her attendants, she was healed again the following night.

The next day, she returned healthy to the aforementioned wedding, giving the most just thanks to the Almighty God.

While the Lord and renowned Savior of the world was working wonders and miracles through his saint, the venerable bishop Adelwold, who presided over the Winchester diocese in those days, commanded the brothers living there that whenever any sick person received the desired bodily healing through the Lord's power and the saint's merit, all the brothers of that place should immediately leave whatever they were doing, go to the church, and glorify God suitably.

It happened that some, deceived by the tricks of demons, were greatly disturbed by being awakened so often from their nightly rest—sometimes three, sometimes four times in one night—and they wrongly persuaded others to abandon what their bishop had piously commanded.

When this precaution was neglected for an interval of fifteen days, the holy servant of God, grieved that the aforementioned brothers were neglecting the good work and not obeying their bishop's commands, nor giving due praise to God, but falling into the harmful snares of Satan, appeared one night in a dream to a certain venerable matron.

He was dressed in a white cloak and a long robe, wearing a golden crown on his head adorned with precious gems and beautiful Indian pearls, and shod in very beautiful sandals.

He said to her in the kindest words, "As soon as you see the bishop of Winchester, beloved of God, tell him to command the monks living there not to cease glorifying Almighty God whenever any sick person receives healing at the tomb of Bishop Swithun.

It greatly displeases Almighty God, the author of miracles, that he performs countless miracles daily before the eyes of the saints, and they act so unjustly by not giving praise to God but, shamefully preferring transient evil pursuits to divine works.

Let it not be grievous for them to glorify the Creator of all virtues through the virtues of the Omnipotent King, so that they do not feel the wrath of the Judge of the living and the dead."

Why say more?

Next, if anyone stops praising, filled with the blemish of envy, laziness, and pride, unless they erase this sin with repentance, they will inevitably suffer from the deception of vices.

Surely for this reason, God presents so many unheard-of miracles to the world in recent times so that the stone hearts of men might soften and the hearts of the wicked might repent and hurry toward heavenly joys through good works.

For signs are meant for unbelieving people, but they are not necessary for the faithful.

Do those who scorn His blessings obey God, the Creator of all things?

Do they not provoke the Lord to anger by denying His magnificence in silence?

Add to this that if the brothers cease from their praises, the great deeds of God will also cease.

However, if they do not stop glorifying the heavenly King, the Lord of all will perform as many and as great miracles there as no one living on earth remembers having been done anywhere before, ever since the divinity, which joined the twin powerful natures in the one person of Christ—God and man, servant and lord, creature and Creator—carried our humanity to the heavens.

The holy servant of God, as soon as he conveyed such glorious commands to the matron in a vision of sleep, ascended to heaven with a shining light, removing his angelic face.

The matron, upon awakening from the heaviness of sleep after the saint's departure, began to grieve greatly that she lacked the ineffable brightness she had seen in her dream.

She then rose as quickly as she could from the bed where she lay and, having summoned the venerable bishop, sought to communicate everything she had received from the angel of Christ in her dreams.

The bishop, slightly moved as befits a wise man, questioned why the brothers had not acted according to the command and again sent instructions to the monks from the king's palace, where they served for the common good of the kingdom, dedicating themselves to God in those days.

He instructed that if anyone present did not give praises to God and did not hurry to the church immediately so that any sick person might receive healing through the power of the Holy Trinity, they should do penance for seven days, consuming nothing but water and bread.

From that time, it was never neglected; whenever a miracle was performed at the body of the blessed man, whether by day or in the middle of the night, upon the ringing of a small bell, the brothers would always go to the monastery to glorify the omnipotent Lord, to whom be honor, power, and dominion, glory, majesty, peace, and rejoicing through the immortal ages of ages.

A certain man from London was so weakened in all his limbs at that time that he could no longer hope for any cure.

Hearing of the miracles performed through the mercy of the Savior of the world at the prophet’s mausoleum, he was carried to Winchester by his relatives according to his desire, wishing to approach the holy body of Christ’s servant and spend one night there awake, but he could not because of excessive pain.

After several days, when he was brought there, he was healed that very night from heaven.

For this man was struck with such a severe illness that his hands and feet were seen turned behind his back.

But Almighty God, merciful and kind, who does not abandon all who hope in Him, through the merit of Saint Swithun, had mercy on His creation, granting the sick man the former strength of his body for the glorification of His name, so that, becoming healthy, he might magnify the Lord, who alone does great wonders, all the days of his life.

Furthermore, from the aforementioned city, sixteen blind men and women came together to Winchester.

Of these, fifteen were divinely illuminated on the first day, and the sixteenth received his sight on the following morning, along with many other sick people, through the merit of the holy bishop.

They then returned joyfully to London, giving the most just thanks to God, who had recently come there blind but now were able to see.

A certain man, lame in both feet, was also residing in the same city of London, who, searching for healing through various means, heard...

He had nearly exhausted all his resources across the provinces. Finally, he rode on horseback to 
Saint Augustine
, the archbishop of Canterbury, and through his intercession, he was granted healing for one foot. After some time, upon hearing about the miracles, he went to Winchester and approached the body of the holy man. On that very day, his other foot was healed, and he joyfully returned home on his feet, praising the Lord with his words.

At one time, twenty-five sick people came to the holy servant of God from various provinces of England, suffering from different ailments such as blindness, lameness, deafness, and muteness. All of them, in the span of one day, were granted healing by the Lord through the glorious intervention of the distinguished priest.

A certain very wealthy count had a son who used his sight for the first five years of his life but lost it afterward, and for another five years, he was blind. One night, while his mother and a large group of attendants kept vigil in the temple where the venerable man's relics rested, at dawn, the glaucoma left his eyes, and by God's will, he was able to see clearly.
