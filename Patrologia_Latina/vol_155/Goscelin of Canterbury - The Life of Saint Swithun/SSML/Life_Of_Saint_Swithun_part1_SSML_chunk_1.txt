      During the reign of the glorious King Egbert of the English who succeeded King Kinegils converted from idolatry by the blessed Birinus the eighth in the administration of the kingdom, the blessed Swithun, destined to be a father and pastor in the Church of God, began his course in this world, by divine mercy.

    <s>
      With his childhood years spent in pious simplicity, he wished to bear the yoke of the Lordâ€™s service upon his shoulders and carried it humbly and valiantly.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, being admitted to the clergy, he ascended from grade to grade, from virtue to virtue, with his steps directed by God in all things, and under Bishop Helinstan 
      of Winchester, he was elevated to the honor of the priesthood.
    </s>
    <s>
      Moreover, he always endeavored to present himself as a worthy and approved minister to God, to rightly and catholically handle the word of truth, to strive for kindness and gentleness, to practice works of piety above all, to correct those not living rightly or orderly with the rod of chastisement, and to humbly serve all.

      When his fame reached the ears of the king, he was summoned by him and counted among his chief friends.

    <s>
      The king entrusted to him his son Adulphus to be educated in liberal disciplines and instructed in holy morals; whom he later ordained as a subdeacon.

      However, with his father dying without an heir, and no other heir remaining except him, Pope Leo dispensed him to marry.

      After the death of Bishop Helinstan, Swithun was elected by everyone's vote.
    </s>
    <s>
      Moved by his prayers and exhortations, King Adulphus kindly granted all the tithes of the land of his kingdom to the churches of God and freely allowed them to be claimed.

      The same holy bishop constructed the bridge at Winchester, which is to the east.
    </s>
    <s>
      One day, as he was diligently overseeing its construction, a poor woman came to him carrying eggs for sale in a vessel.
    </s>
    <s>
      The playful and mischievous workers seized her and caused her great trouble, not stealing the eggs but breaking them all.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, for the injury and damage inflicted, the woman, weeping and lamenting before the bishop, moved the holy man with compassion.
    </s>
    <s>
      He took the vessel in which the eggs were kept, made the sign of the cross over it, and restored the eggs whole and unbroken.
    </s>

    <s>
      He diligently built churches in places where there were none and restored those that were ruined and broken.
    </s>
    <s>
      When dedicating sacred buildings, he did not ride a horse nor employ any secular pomp, but humbly walked barefoot, accompanied by his clergy and familiars.
    </s>
    <s>
      He did not invite the wealthy to his feasts but the needy and poor.
    </s>
    <s>
      His mouth was always open to exhort sinners to repentance.
    </s>
    <s>
      He advised those standing firm to strive not to fall and those who had fallen to rise again.
    </s>
    <s>
      He ate food not to fill his belly but sparingly and moderately for his sustenance.
    </s>
    <s>
      After many vigils and labors, he allowed himself a little sleep to avoid exhaustion, always intent on psalms and spiritual songs.
    </s>
    <s>
      To his neighbors, as well as to himself, he modestly and humbly proposed what was useful, honest, pious, and holy.
    </s>
    <s>
      The blessed man lived until the end of his life.

    In the true observance of God's commandments, he kept his heart with all diligence in all purity and spiritual cleanliness, a faithful guardian of Catholic and apostolic doctrine, a vigilant teacher and master in the study of holy conversation for the spiritually regenerated children. He earnestly followed humility and gentleness. Finally, seeking peace and holiness, he thirsted for the fountain of life and eternal happiness. And so, he happily departed from this world to the heavenly mansions on July 2, in the year 862. He ordered, however, that he be buried not inside the church but outside its walls in an unworthy and lowly place.

    After his death, he shone with many miracles. Among these, he appeared to a man suffering from an incredible weakness of all his limbs, advising him to go to Bishop Ethelwold of Winchester and tell him that it was seen by divine providence that his body should be taken from the place where it was buried and be more honorably buried inside the church in a more suitable place. If he doubted and hesitated, he would have as proof the health he would immediately recover from the illness he had suffered from for a long time. He also added that he should go to the burial place and remove one of the iron rings still seen fixed in the stone without damaging the stone and then replace it just as easily without harming the stone. The man rose perfectly healthy, found everything as foretold, and recounted everything to the bishop. He healed a certain man who was bent over and looking at the ground like an animal, making him healthy and whole.

    A noble and rich man, while walking by the riverbank at noon, suddenly saw three extremely horrible women of immense stature. They captured him as he tried to flee, afflicted him in many ways, and almost suffocated him with their pestilential breath, leaving him in incredible horror and almost insane. Brought to the church, Saint Swithun appeared to him at night and, dispelling all pain, restored him to health.

    When Bishop Ethelwold raised the body of the holy man from the ground, a wonderful fragrance filled everyone, a blind woman regained her sight, and many suffering from various ailments were cured by his merits. This translation occurred in the 110th year after his death, in the year 971 of the Lord's Incarnation, on July 15. On the same day, he healed a boy who had been miraculously crippled from birth; restored sight to three women who had been deprived of it; freed a woman bound in prison with iron chains by breaking the shackles; cured a paralytic; illuminated a noblewoman who was blind; perfectly restored twenty-five people suffering from various illnesses who had come from different places in one day; healed several blind people, two crippled women in one day; cured thirty-six people from different places suffering from different illnesses over three days, and shortly after, cured 124 people in fourteen days.

    King Edgar decreed by law to curb theft that anyone caught stealing would be deprived of their eyes, ears, hands, and feet, be scalped, and thrown to wild beasts and birds to be torn apart. However, it happened that an innocent man punished by this penalty almost lost his hearing as his ear passages were blocked with blood. Brought by his parents to the oratory of Saint Swithun, he not only regained his hearing but also received other things he had not asked for. A woman sleeping with the door open in a village in the city of Winchester was carried off by a wolf from her bed into the forest, and with a dreadful howl, he called other wolves to him. The woman, weak from hunger and age, did not know what to do. She turned to prayer, implored divine help, and called upon Saint Swithun. The wolf, hearing his name, fell asleep, allowing the woman to escape. The wolf, waking up, pursued her with his companions, but could not harm her because God protected her through Saint Swithun.
