The Life of Saint Swithun
by Goscelin of Canterbury
During the reign of the glorious King Egbert of the English who succeeded King Kinegils converted from idolatry by the blessed Birinus the eighth in the administration of the kingdom, the blessed Swithun, destined to be a father and pastor in the Church of God, began his course in this world, by divine mercy.
With his childhood years spent in pious simplicity, he wished to bear the yoke of the Lord’s service upon his shoulders and carried it humbly and valiantly.
Thus, being admitted to the clergy, he ascended from grade to grade, from virtue to virtue, with his steps directed by God in all things, and under Bishop Helinstan
of Winchester, he was elevated to the honor of the priesthood.
Moreover, he always endeavored to present himself as a worthy and approved minister to God, to rightly and catholically handle the word of truth, to strive for kindness and gentleness, to practice works of piety above all, to correct those not living rightly or orderly with the rod of chastisement, and to humbly serve all.
When his fame reached the ears of the king, he was summoned by him and counted among his chief friends.
The king entrusted to him his son Adulphus to be educated in liberal disciplines and instructed in holy morals; whom he later ordained as a subdeacon.
However, with his father dying without an heir, and no other heir remaining except him, Pope Leo dispensed him to marry.
After the death of Bishop Helinstan, Swithun was elected by everyone's vote.
Moved by his prayers and exhortations, King Adulphus kindly granted all the tithes of the land of his kingdom to the churches of God and freely allowed them to be claimed.
The same holy bishop constructed the bridge at Winchester, which is to the east.
One day, as he was diligently overseeing its construction, a poor woman came to him carrying eggs for sale in a vessel.
The playful and mischievous workers seized her and caused her great trouble, not stealing the eggs but breaking them all.
Thus, for the injury and damage inflicted, the woman, weeping and lamenting before the bishop, moved the holy man with compassion.
He took the vessel in which the eggs were kept, made the sign of the cross over it, and restored the eggs whole and unbroken.
He diligently built churches in places where there were none and restored those that were ruined and broken.
When dedicating sacred buildings, he did not ride a horse nor employ any secular pomp, but humbly walked barefoot, accompanied by his clergy and familiars.
He did not invite the wealthy to his feasts but the needy and poor.
His mouth was always open to exhort sinners to repentance.
He advised those standing firm to strive not to fall and those who had fallen to rise again.
He ate food not to fill his belly but sparingly and moderately for his sustenance.
After many vigils and labors, he allowed himself a little sleep to avoid exhaustion, always intent on psalms and spiritual songs.
To his neighbors, as well as to himself, he modestly and humbly proposed what was useful, honest, pious, and holy.
The blessed man lived until the end of his life.
In the true observance of God's commandments, he kept his heart with all diligence in all purity and spiritual cleanliness, a faithful guardian of Catholic and apostolic doctrine, a vigilant teacher and master in the study of holy conversation for the spiritually regenerated children. He earnestly followed humility and gentleness. Finally, seeking peace and holiness, he thirsted for the fountain of life and eternal happiness. And so, he happily departed from this world to the heavenly mansions on July 2, in the year 862. He ordered, however, that he be buried not inside the church but outside its walls in an unworthy and lowly place.
After his death, he shone with many miracles. Among these, he appeared to a man suffering from an incredible weakness of all his limbs, advising him to go to Bishop Ethelwold of Winchester and tell him that it was seen by divine providence that his body should be taken from the place where it was buried and be more honorably buried inside the church in a more suitable place. If he doubted and hesitated, he would have as proof the health he would immediately recover from the illness he had suffered from for a long time. He also added that he should go to the burial place and remove one of the iron rings still seen fixed in the stone without damaging the stone and then replace it just as easily without harming the stone. The man rose perfectly healthy, found everything as foretold, and recounted everything to the bishop. He healed a certain man who was bent over and looking at the ground like an animal, making him healthy and whole.
A noble and rich man, while walking by the riverbank at noon, suddenly saw three extremely horrible women of immense stature. They captured him as he tried to flee, afflicted him in many ways, and almost suffocated him with their pestilential breath, leaving him in incredible horror and almost insane. Brought to the church, Saint Swithun appeared to him at night and, dispelling all pain, restored him to health.
When Bishop Ethelwold raised the body of the holy man from the ground, a wonderful fragrance filled everyone, a blind woman regained her sight, and many suffering from various ailments were cured by his merits. This translation occurred in the 110th year after his death, in the year 971 of the Lord's Incarnation, on July 15. On the same day, he healed a boy who had been miraculously crippled from birth; restored sight to three women who had been deprived of it; freed a woman bound in prison with iron chains by breaking the shackles; cured a paralytic; illuminated a noblewoman who was blind; perfectly restored twenty-five people suffering from various illnesses who had come from different places in one day; healed several blind people, two crippled women in one day; cured thirty-six people from different places suffering from different illnesses over three days, and shortly after, cured 124 people in fourteen days.
King Edgar decreed by law to curb theft that anyone caught stealing would be deprived of their eyes, ears, hands, and feet, be scalped, and thrown to wild beasts and birds to be torn apart. However, it happened that an innocent man punished by this penalty almost lost his hearing as his ear passages were blocked with blood. Brought by his parents to the oratory of Saint Swithun, he not only regained his hearing but also received other things he had not asked for. A woman sleeping with the door open in a village in the city of Winchester was carried off by a wolf from her bed into the forest, and with a dreadful howl, he called other wolves to him. The woman, weak from hunger and age, did not know what to do. She turned to prayer, implored divine help, and called upon Saint Swithun. The wolf, hearing his name, fell asleep, allowing the woman to escape. The wolf, waking up, pursued her with his companions, but could not harm her because God protected her through Saint Swithun.
And he had undertaken to liberate by the mercy of the blessed pontiff.
He placed a certain statue of Saint Swithin, Bishop of Sherborne, which had been acquired by the brothers, honorably in his church, where remarkable miracles were frequently performed.
A certain leper approached this statue, not to obtain a cure, but to receive alms from those who were praying in that place.
As he fell asleep there for a short while, it seemed to him that Saint Swithin appeared, wiped away his leprosy with his hand, and suddenly drove away the entire disease from him.
Waking up, he joyfully loosened his belt in front of everyone and showed that he was cleansed.
HISTORY OF THE TRANSLATION AND MIRACLES
Authored, it seems, by Lantfiedus, a monk of Winchester in England.
From the oldest manuscript of Bigotius.
CHAPTER ONE.
The body of Saint Swithun divinely revealed, and the miracles.
In the times of the most fortunate King Edgar of the English and the most glorious emperor of the entire island of Albion, in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 971, in the 14th indiction, the almighty Deity deigned to reveal to the English Saxons the holy body of the blessed Bishop Swithun.
Through his merits, so many sick people, by the favor of God, were restored to their former health, as no living person has ever heard by common report, nor seen with bodily eyes, nor learned by reading, to have been healed at the tomb of any saint.
However, the life and ancient conduct of this remarkable bishop are unknown to us because no writings exist.
But the mercy of almighty God has deigned to reveal his merits most clearly through miraculous signs.
Therefore, three years before the holy remains of the aforementioned bishop were removed from the mausoleum where they had been buried long ago by the most reverend bishop of that place, Athelwold, and his brothers, the saint himself appeared in a dream to a certain truthful smith, radiant with an angelic appearance, saying to him:
"Do you recognize that canon who, along with others living poorly, was recently expelled from the old monastery? To recognize him clearly, he is called Eadsinus by name."
The smith replied: "I once knew him, Father, but now I do not know where he is."
The bishop said to him: "He now resides in Winchelcombe. I ask you, and in the name of Christ, I command you to go quickly to him and tell him my orders: This is what Bishop Swithun commands you, Eadsinus, to hasten to Winchester and tell the bishop, who now finally governs the diocese I once presided over, to elevate my body from the tomb and place it in a church, because it has been granted to him from heaven that I am to be revealed in his time."
The smith said to the saint: "Lord, he will by no means want to believe my words."
The holy man said: "So that he believes your words, tell him to go to my tomb and pull one ring from the three that are fixed to the cover of my sarcophagus. If he can immediately pull it out, let it be truly known to him that I sent you to him. But if he cannot pull it out at all, then he should by no means believe you. You can then confidently tell him that if he desires to enjoy the safety of both lives, he should change his ways and actions for the better and hasten incessantly to the blessedness of the heavenly homeland. Furthermore, prophesy to everyone that as soon as they open my tomb, they will find treasures so inestimable and precious that whatever gold and jewels exist anywhere will seem worthless in comparison to these."
After giving such commands to the smith, the holy prophet ascended to the heavens. However, that smith, at first fearing to seem deceitful, dared not reveal this vision to anyone living.
He was admonished a second and third time by the same holy bishop, who rebuked him sharply for not obeying his commands. Finally, he approached the tomb of the holy bishop, took one of the aforementioned rings, and with such a voice...
Then, to the Lord, creator of all things:
Lord God, creator of the entire universe, grant me, a sinner, that if this holy man, who rests here in body, has appeared to me three times in the sleep of the night, I may be able to pull out this iron sphere from here, as recently in the vision of the dream, the same man of God endeavored to reveal to my ears. As soon as he pulled the steel orb, it followed him from the stone mass as if it were stuck in sea sand. When he put it back in its own small crevice, it remained fixed, slightly pressed by the heel, so that afterward, no one could pull it out from there.
On the same day, as he was passing through the market, he found a certain servant of the aforementioned cleric coming to Winchester for necessary purchases. He informed him of the things he had seen in dreams and humbly begged him to tell such things to his master. After he reached his own master over a long interval of time, he remained silent, forgetful of that matter, but later, moved by repentance, he diligently narrated everything he had heard from the craftsman to his master.
At that time, the cleric, not only the bishop of the Winchester diocese but also all the brothers living there, was vexed because of the expulsion of the canons, who were using wicked and very filthy customs, for which the venerable Athelwold had expelled them from the aforementioned monastery. He refused to listen, being more eager to fulfill the orders of the holy Father. However, after the course of two years, with the favor of the supreme mercy of the Creator, who leads all those whom he presses to labor in the Lord's vineyard to his grace; the same cleric who was recently there became a venerable monk. For we ourselves saw it happen, as this present little book demonstrates. Blessed be Almighty God, who justifies sinners, who saves those who hope in Him, who humbles the proud, who exalts the humble!
So, two years before the holy discovery of the body, a certain hunchbacked man, very bent due to a large goiter, heard in a dream that he should go to Winchester, and there, through the merit of Saint Swithun, he would receive health. Rising in the morning, as best as he could, he supported his hump with twin crutches. He arrived at Winchester, where he stayed for a long time. Being admonished again by an angelic visitation, he went to the tomb of the holy bishop Swithun, and kneeling, he prayed to the Lord that he might be healed there by the merits of the saint, as he had heard in his dreams. As soon as he rose from his prayers, he was so divinely healed that no trace of the deformed hump appeared anywhere.
As the day of the most sacred solemnity approached, when the venerable bishop of God, Swithin, was released from bodily bonds and migrated from this world to the Lord, a man was miserably debilitated in all his limbs by demonic deceptions. As he was tormented for a long time, his neighbors and relatives brought him to the tomb of the holy man of God, and they spent that night awake with the sick friend in constant prayers. The sick man, however, oppressed by sleep in the morning, fell asleep a little, and it seemed to him that some people approached him and took one of his shoes off his foot. Immediately, he returned home healthy with his friends. However, his shoe was searched for everywhere but was not found. Eight other weak people were healed at the mausoleum of the holy man before his bones were taken from there.
CHAPTER II. The Translation of the Body, Other Miracles.
After these events, on July 15, the venerable Bishop Athelwold, along with other bishops, abbots, and many monks, lifted the holy relics from the monument by the command of the glorious King Edgar and placed them with great reverence in the basilica of the apostles Peter and Paul.
There, blessings are granted to all who ask with true faith.
Afterwards, four sick people received healing at his tomb over the course of three days.
Then, over five months, there was rarely a day when the sick were not healed at the honorable relics of the saint.
Sometimes three, sometimes five, sometimes seven, sometimes ten, now twelve, now fifteen.
Indeed, we saw more than two hundred sick people healed through the saint's merit in ten days, and countless in the span of a year.
Therefore, let the unbelievers come to the saint of God to recognize the blessings of the Creator and to praise the Creator.
Let the faithful know that our Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten of God, who at the beginning of this age, veiled in the garment of flesh, by Himself gave sight to the blind, made the lame walk, restored hearing to the deaf, healed the paralyzed, raised the dead, and walked on the sea with dry feet;
in our times, to show the omnipotence of His majesty and to manifest the merit of the distinguished priest Swithun, grants the blessing of health to the bodies of the sick, as numerous as the sands of the sea, which cannot be counted.
Blessed is the Almighty God, who in our time has deigned to glorify His saint with signs and virtues; who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit through all ages.
Amen.
At the time when the Lord was revealing His saint Swithun to people, it happened that twenty-six sick people came to Winchester in one day to regain their health.
Some were blind, some deaf, some mute, and some paralyzed.
When they approached the monument of the holy bishop and offered prayers before God, through his intervention, they were all healed within three days, and they returned home joyfully, magnifying and praising the Lord.
Not long after, one hundred twenty-four sick people from various parts of England and Saxony, afflicted with multiple illnesses, came to the same saint.
All of them were healed of various diseases by the merit of the holy bishop, with God's will, within two weeks and returned home healthy, blessing the Lord.
There was also a man who had been blinded during the Greater Litanies due to robbery: but since he was innocently blinded, he came to the mausoleum of Saint Swithun on the Epiphany of the Lord, humbly offering prayers.
His eyes, which had been put out with iron and completely removed, were illuminated.
He had clear vision for the rest of his life.
Therefore, since we cannot recount all the miracles that the Lord has deigned to perform through Saint Swithun, let us ask this holy bishop to heal the illnesses of our souls by interceding for us before the Lord, with whom he has earned the right to remain forever due to his good works.
Therefore, when the Savior of the world decided to show such signs at the tomb of the venerable Father Swithun, the blessed Bishop Athelwold ordered the brothers living there that whenever anyone received healing through the merit of the holy man, they should all immediately go to the church and glorify God with hymns and praises.
However, it happened that after a few days, some began to resent being awakened at night, sometimes four times, sometimes three times, and they began to persuade others to wrongly abandon what had been piously ordered by their bishop.
When this was carelessly neglected for fifteen days, Saint Swithun himself appeared in a dream to a faithful man, saying to him: Go to the old monastery and tell the brothers that their murmuring greatly displeases Almighty God, since many miracles are performed daily before...
They act so unjustly that they do not give Him praise but prioritize fleeting pursuits over divine works.
Add to this that if they cease their praises, the great deeds of God will immediately cease.
But if they continue to glorify God, He will perform as many miracles there as no one alive can recall being done anywhere.
The aforementioned man, after waking up from the saint's departure, hurried to Bishop Athelwold and informed him of everything the holy man had commanded.
The bishop, disturbed in spirit, wondered why the brothers had not acted according to the saint's directive and sent a strong warning to the monks.
He instructed them that for all healings that occurred at the saint's tomb, they should make a sign, all go together to the church, and sing praises to Almighty God with hymnic voices.
We have heard that this has been observed ever since.
To whom be glory and praise to Almighty God, who has thus deemed to glorify His saint, who lives and reigns forever and ever.
Amen.
From the very old manuscripts in the codex of the Queen of Sweden, number 769.
CHAPTER ONE. Part one of the miracles.
After the body of the most holy bishop was placed inside the church, as previously mentioned, four or five sick people were healed at his tomb within the span of three days.
After the three days were completed, for nearly five months, there was rarely a day in the basilica where the relics of the holy man were kept that the sick were not healed—sometimes more than sixteen or eighteen, sometimes fewer, five or three, and very often seven, eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen.
We saw more than two hundred healed in ten days by the merit of the saint, and in the course of the year, they were countless.
We also saw around the aforementioned monastery streets so crowded on both sides with groups of the sick that any traveler would find it difficult to find a path to walk to it.
After a few days, they were cured by the grace of God and the merits of the saint so that within the basilica, scarcely five sick people could be found.
Therefore, let the envious and reprobate, who deny or twist the glorious miracles of this saint, be silent.
Let unbelievers also come to the holy servant of God to recognize the benefits of the Creator and praise the Creator.
Let the faithful know that our Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten of God, who at the beginning of this age, clothed in flesh, by Himself enlightened the blind, gave the lame the ability to walk, restored hearing to the deaf, cured the paralyzed, raised the dead, and walked on the sea with dry feet; the same, in our times, to glorify the omnipotence of His majesty and to manifest the merit of an outstanding priest, grants the benefit of health to countless sick bodies, like the sands of the sea, which are beyond counting.
In those days, three blind women lived on the Isle of Wight; one had never seen the light of day; two had been blind for nine years.
When they heard that the blind were being healed at the tomb of the holy bishop and that, through the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, the sick were also being cured, they asked their relatives and friends to take them as soon as possible across the island, which is entirely surrounded by the waters of the Ocean, from where they could more easily reach the place where the body of Christ’s bishop rested.
When they were set outside the island and were wandering without a guide, not knowing what to do, the compassionate Creator of creatures, pitying their plight, provided them a young man mute from birth, about 20 years old.
When they reached that place, the women began to implore him with one voice to lead them to the city of Winchester, where the holy bishop excelled in miraculous signs.
By the marvelous design of God, heeding their prayers, he led the blind women by a winding path to the specified place.
On the very night they entered the basilica where the bones of the servant of God rested, the three blind women, by the merit of the holy bishop, deserved to receive the light of their eyes from the true Light, God.
The young man, the guide of the women, with the dawn of light shining, was able to speak correctly.
He wanted it, and soon gave a signal to the guard to go outside the church so he could speak to him. The guard, curious about what he wanted to say, came to him asking why he called him. The young man said: "You should know that now I can speak properly." The guard asked: "Could you speak before?" He replied: "I have never spoken before, and now you have heard the first words that have come from my mouth. Yesterday, when I was mute, I led three blind women here who, with God’s help, now can see. So go, call the brothers, so they can give thanks as usual."
At the same time, a certain young servant girl was chained with iron shackles and terrible manacles by her master in Winchester for a small offense. She was to be tortured with cruel beatings and some bruises the next day. She spent the whole night praying to God with tears, asking to be freed from the wicked torturer through the intervention of the holy bishop. At dawn, the hour when she was to be tortured, as she prayed and cried, the shackles fell from her feet. She immediately escaped the danger, while her masters slept, and fled to the tomb of the holy bishop, still bound with the manacles. When her master was informed that the servant girl had fled to the servant of God and had been freed from her shackles through his intervention, he was filled with anger. He hurried there with great haste, and not by his own will but compelled by God, he removed the manacles and let her go unharmed, and did no further harm to her for that incident.
A certain man had been paralyzed for many years in a province of the English called Hamme in their language, so debilitated in all his limbs that he could not rise from his bed by any means. Hearing about the miracles the Lord was performing in Winchester through the merits of the holy prophet, he began to think it would be better for him if he could spend at least one night before the relics of the man of God. He called his relatives and friendly neighbors, begging them to harness their horses and carry him on a bier to the body of the holy bishop. His friends obeyed the sick man’s request and quickly did what he asked. But before the sick man finished speaking, he was cured through the compassion of the glorious bishop. Rising from his bed, he began his journey on foot and outpaced all the riders and companions who were accompanying him. He reached the revered relics of the holy bishop, healthy and ahead of his companions, although they were riding and using crutches to support him.
A certain noble matron lived in another English province called Bedfordshire. She had been blind for three years, unable to see the light of the sun. Suffering greatly, she promised to give many gifts to the holy bishop Swithun if she could regain her sight through his merits. When she was brought to the bones of the most blessed man by her servants, she gave a certain garment to God and Saint Swithun. As she laid it on the altar, she immediately regained the sight she had lost. Devoutly praising God and eating after receiving her healing, she returned home very joyful, having come to the bishop’s tomb in great sorrow, through the power of the all-creating God and our Savior Jesus Christ.
Another housewife also began to suffer from a severe illness at that time. All her relatives and servants came to her in turn, urging her with lamentations to arrange her affairs before her death.
Death was approaching, as they believed she would soon die.
But as her unbearable illness grew worse each day, losing hope for this life and nearing the proximity of death, she promised God and Saint Swithun that if she deserved to receive any remedy for her illness through his intervention, she would come to his tomb with many offerings as soon as she could, and spend one night in vigil before the most sacred body of God's servant.
While making this promise, she regained her bodily health but lost her mental vigor, for she forgot God's benefits, did not keep the promises she had made, and did not give thanks to God as was proper.
After some time, while planning to ride to a wedding with her husband, she ordered the servants to prepare the best horses.
Once they were splendidly adorned with trappings, her husband, with a few attendants, went ahead, and she followed quickly with more attendants.
While mounting the decorated horse and riding after her husband, she did not feel any pain or discomfort from her illness.
However, when she arrived at the wedding, where many noblemen and the king's prominent attendants were present, she was suddenly struck again by the illness from which she had recently been healed by God's holy servant.
Then, realizing her wrongdoing, as she had been cured by God through the merit of the saint but had not given glory to the Creator, she immediately repented as much as she could.
Summoning her attendants, she begged them to carry her as quickly as possible to the place where the holy man rested, so that through God's mercy, she might again regain her health.
Once she was brought there with the help of her attendants, she was healed again the following night.
The next day, she returned healthy to the aforementioned wedding, giving the most just thanks to the Almighty God.
While the Lord and renowned Savior of the world was working wonders and miracles through his saint, the venerable bishop Adelwold, who presided over the Winchester diocese in those days, commanded the brothers living there that whenever any sick person received the desired bodily healing through the Lord's power and the saint's merit, all the brothers of that place should immediately leave whatever they were doing, go to the church, and glorify God suitably.
It happened that some, deceived by the tricks of demons, were greatly disturbed by being awakened so often from their nightly rest—sometimes three, sometimes four times in one night—and they wrongly persuaded others to abandon what their bishop had piously commanded.
When this precaution was neglected for an interval of fifteen days, the holy servant of God, grieved that the aforementioned brothers were neglecting the good work and not obeying their bishop's commands, nor giving due praise to God, but falling into the harmful snares of Satan, appeared one night in a dream to a certain venerable matron.
He was dressed in a white cloak and a long robe, wearing a golden crown on his head adorned with precious gems and beautiful Indian pearls, and shod in very beautiful sandals.
He said to her in the kindest words, "As soon as you see the bishop of Winchester, beloved of God, tell him to command the monks living there not to cease glorifying Almighty God whenever any sick person receives healing at the tomb of Bishop Swithun.
It greatly displeases Almighty God, the author of miracles, that he performs countless miracles daily before the eyes of the saints, and they act so unjustly by not giving praise to God but, shamefully preferring transient evil pursuits to divine works.
Let it not be grievous for them to glorify the Creator of all virtues through the virtues of the Omnipotent King, so that they do not feel the wrath of the Judge of the living and the dead."
Why say more?
Next, if anyone stops praising, filled with the blemish of envy, laziness, and pride, unless they erase this sin with repentance, they will inevitably suffer from the deception of vices.
Surely for this reason, God presents so many unheard-of miracles to the world in recent times so that the stone hearts of men might soften and the hearts of the wicked might repent and hurry toward heavenly joys through good works.
For signs are meant for unbelieving people, but they are not necessary for the faithful.
Do those who scorn His blessings obey God, the Creator of all things?
Do they not provoke the Lord to anger by denying His magnificence in silence?
Add to this that if the brothers cease from their praises, the great deeds of God will also cease.
However, if they do not stop glorifying the heavenly King, the Lord of all will perform as many and as great miracles there as no one living on earth remembers having been done anywhere before, ever since the divinity, which joined the twin powerful natures in the one person of Christ—God and man, servant and lord, creature and Creator—carried our humanity to the heavens.
The holy servant of God, as soon as he conveyed such glorious commands to the matron in a vision of sleep, ascended to heaven with a shining light, removing his angelic face.
The matron, upon awakening from the heaviness of sleep after the saint's departure, began to grieve greatly that she lacked the ineffable brightness she had seen in her dream.
She then rose as quickly as she could from the bed where she lay and, having summoned the venerable bishop, sought to communicate everything she had received from the angel of Christ in her dreams.
The bishop, slightly moved as befits a wise man, questioned why the brothers had not acted according to the command and again sent instructions to the monks from the king's palace, where they served for the common good of the kingdom, dedicating themselves to God in those days.
He instructed that if anyone present did not give praises to God and did not hurry to the church immediately so that any sick person might receive healing through the power of the Holy Trinity, they should do penance for seven days, consuming nothing but water and bread.
From that time, it was never neglected; whenever a miracle was performed at the body of the blessed man, whether by day or in the middle of the night, upon the ringing of a small bell, the brothers would always go to the monastery to glorify the omnipotent Lord, to whom be honor, power, and dominion, glory, majesty, peace, and rejoicing through the immortal ages of ages.
A certain man from London was so weakened in all his limbs at that time that he could no longer hope for any cure.
Hearing of the miracles performed through the mercy of the Savior of the world at the prophet’s mausoleum, he was carried to Winchester by his relatives according to his desire, wishing to approach the holy body of Christ’s servant and spend one night there awake, but he could not because of excessive pain.
After several days, when he was brought there, he was healed that very night from heaven.
For this man was struck with such a severe illness that his hands and feet were seen turned behind his back.
But Almighty God, merciful and kind, who does not abandon all who hope in Him, through the merit of Saint Swithun, had mercy on His creation, granting the sick man the former strength of his body for the glorification of His name, so that, becoming healthy, he might magnify the Lord, who alone does great wonders, all the days of his life.
Furthermore, from the aforementioned city, sixteen blind men and women came together to Winchester.
Of these, fifteen were divinely illuminated on the first day, and the sixteenth received his sight on the following morning, along with many other sick people, through the merit of the holy bishop.
They then returned joyfully to London, giving the most just thanks to God, who had recently come there blind but now were able to see.
A certain man, lame in both feet, was also residing in the same city of London, who, searching for healing through various means, heard...
He had nearly exhausted all his resources across the provinces. Finally, he rode on horseback to Saint Augustine, the archbishop of Canterbury, and through his intercession, he was granted healing for one foot. After some time, upon hearing about the miracles, he went to Winchester and approached the body of the holy man. On that very day, his other foot was healed, and he joyfully returned home on his feet, praising the Lord with his words.
At one time, twenty-five sick people came to the holy servant of God from various provinces of England, suffering from different ailments such as blindness, lameness, deafness, and muteness. All of them, in the span of one day, were granted healing by the Lord through the glorious intervention of the distinguished priest.
A certain very wealthy count had a son who used his sight for the first five years of his life but lost it afterward, and for another five years, he was blind. One night, while his mother and a large group of attendants kept vigil in the temple where the venerable man's relics rested, at dawn, the glaucoma left his eyes, and by God's will, he was able to see clearly.
Part Two of the Miracles
So he went to Rome with all devotion of mind, in order to be healed there through the blessed bodies of the saints, which rest there in countless numbers. He stayed there for almost five years in prayer, but did not obtain a cure for his blindness.
Finally, while he was there, he heard from pilgrims coming to Rome from the lands of the English to the tombs of the Apostles, that the Lord was healing countless illnesses through the merit of Saint Swithun.
He quickly left the said city, and returning to the region from which he had been born, he sought the tomb of the holy bishop. That very night, he was granted to receive his former sight, and illuminated by the Lord, the Creator of the world, he returned home safe, glorifying the King of Heaven and praising the all-creating God.
He was led by his relatives to Winchester, where he received healing through the omnipotence of the Holy Trinity.
Indeed, after he approached the church where the remains of the holy man were resting, he persevered in vigils and prayers for three days and nights. When these were completed, his eyes were opened, and the old strength returned to his arms and hands.
Soon he left there healthy, blessing God.
He had a guide as the blind usually have, who would lead him either to the church or wherever he needed to go, and then bring him back home whenever he wished.
On one occasion, the guide, in anger, left the blind man far from his lodging. When he had no idea how to return home, he prayed to God, the ruler of all things, with heartfelt cries that He would look upon him more kindly, pouring out such prayers:
"O Lord, ruler of angels and men, I know that nothing can escape your providence. You see me deprived of light, far removed from my own home, and abandoned by my stubborn guide.
Look upon my humility; direct my actions according to your will, guide my steps to you, and grant me, unworthy as I am, eternal light in heaven with the saints and the chosen ones.
Have mercy on me, Lord, according to your will, and deal with me according to the mercy of your kindness. Do not leave me any longer in the hands of the wicked, but either receive my soul from this little body or restore clear light to my blindness through the merits of Saint Swithun.
I also ask you, most merciful bishop, through whom the magnificent Creator of things offers healing to various illnesses, that you assist me with your holy prayers. For I believe that you will immediately obtain anything you ask from the Lord.
Therefore, ask the Prince of Light to restore the light of my eyes."
He returned home safe without a guide, to the amazement of his neighbors and relatives, beyond what can be believed, how their kinsman, who had left there shortly before deprived of light, was evidently illuminated by the Lord.
When they learned how their friend had recovered his health through the venerable bishop of God, they glorified the Lord with one voice, who alone does great wonders, whose name and dominion remain forever and ever.
Essex, who were tormented by pains for many summers and by various...
During these distressing times, there were two blind men and two women who were crippled in both hands and lame in their feet. Hearing about the miracles God had performed through His servant, they went to the tomb of the holy bishop, praying earnestly to the triune and one God of heaven and earth.
As soon as they arrived together, the blind men’s eyes were opened, and the women’s hands and feet were instantly healed, allowing them to walk in front of everyone and make the sign of the holy cross on their foreheads with their hands.
They then performed all necessary tasks and returned home, blessing the Lord, the author of their healing.
At the same time, a servant girl had been stolen from a man in the northern regions of the Angles and brought to the city where the holy bishop's body rested. She was sold to a man named Urban in that city. After living for a long time under this new master, the man from whom she had been stolen came to Winchester to buy what he needed.
When the girl heard this, she boldly spoke to her former master without the permission of her current one.
When her mistress found out that she had been talking to a man from another province, she ordered the girl to be heavily shackled to prevent her from returning to her former master.
The next day, the mistress left early in the morning to attend to some business, leaving the shackled girl at home.
The girl, as soon as she could, went outside and sat miserably by the threshold of the house. With all her heart, she began to pray to the Creator God to free her from the cruel bonds of her wicked mistress.
Turning towards the temple where the holy bishop’s body was venerated, she fervently prayed for God’s help through his intercession and immediately received the desired relief.
Meanwhile, an elderly priest with a venerable appearance, dressed in pure white garments, quickly approached the shackled girl.
He gently asked her why she was sorrowful, took her by the right arm, and led her to the saint’s tomb in a moment.
Amidst the countless crowd surrounding the monastery’s entrance, he placed her, still shackled, near the sacred altar where the holy man’s body rested.
It was astonishing that no one saw her or the priest who brought her until she was placed in the chapel, which the present crowd saw was locked by the custodians. Her mistress, as best she could, hurriedly followed the servant girl’s tracks.
When the monk who guarded the saint’s body and held the chapel’s key saw this, he was greatly amazed and said to himself,
“Who locked this woman inside the saint’s chamber that I see? Do you think she found the door open, which I had closed just a moment ago with the bolt?”
Approaching the chapel door and speaking to her within earshot of the crowd, he asked, “Who brought you into this venerable place where you now stand? With what boldness did you dare to enter the enclosure where Christ's bishop rests? How did you manage to hide since I did not see you when I closed the door?”
She, seeing a young cleric standing behind her outside the balcony, responded to the monk, saying, “This cleric lifted me onto his shoulders and carried me to this place, placing me before the saint.”
The cleric, on the other hand, responded with an oath, “I have never seen you before with my own eyes.”
The woman said: "You indeed brought me here."
The cleric replied: "I would prefer that the dogs of the night tear you apart with dreadful bites than to place such an unworthy burden on my back."
She, gathering herself, retorted: "A certain priest, gray-haired and very venerable, dressed in dazzlingly splendid garments, found me weeping at the Lady's threshold and comforted me with the sweetest words."
Taking hold of my sleeve, he swiftly brought me to this basilica with such speed and grace that I cannot describe it in words."
And since, after he left me at this entrance, I saw no other cleric around except this young man, I thought he was the one who brought me here."
And when the crowds of people, who were present from different parts of England, heard this, they were greatly amazed and glorified the Lord, King of all, and Savior of mankind, who deigned to perform such unheard-of miracles through the merits of His glorious saintly priest.
To Him be glory, praise, and dominion, who lives as one with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and reigns as God for endless ages.
At that time, two women from distant western lands came to the tomb of the man of God to pray.
One of them could not see with her own eyes, and the other had been mute from birth until nearly old age.
The mute woman guided the blind one throughout the journey, asking passersby for directions.
When they reached the place where the holy bishop rested, the blind woman received her sight, and the mute woman gained the ability to speak.
They were healed from above through the merit of the glorious man, and they immediately returned home, glorifying the almighty Lord.
Then, thirty-six sick people came to Winchester to seek recovery of their health.
Among them were some who were blind, some deaf, some mute, and some paralyzed.
When they approached the monument of the holy bishop and prayed before God, all of them were healed through his intervention within three days; thus, they joyfully returned home with great happiness, magnifying and praising the Lord.
Not long after, one hundred and twenty-four people afflicted with various illnesses came to the same saint from different parts of Anglo-Saxon lands.
All of them were healed from various ailments by the merit of the holy bishop, with God's will, within two days, and they returned home healthy, blessing the Lord, who had gathered them when they were weak and sick.
I consider it unworthy to pass over in silence what a certain man, who had committed an illicit parricide, endured.
He had been bound cruelly with iron, bearing nine iron rings on his body, suffering for nine years abroad for his crime.
Hearing through rumors about the renowned miracles of God performed through His saint's merit in the province of the English, he came to Winchester from across the seas.
While fervently praying to God for a long time, seeking relief from his unbearable pain through the intervention of the holy healing bishop, the iron ring, which had cut into his stomach and was penetrating his vital organs, broke and sprang out of his body, releasing him from immense pain.
Another ring, which was causing severe torture to his arm due to the swelling flesh wound, covered in pus and blood, immediately fell at his feet, and the sharp pain instantly left him.
That ring was so tight that it barely seemed to fit three fingers, and it was miraculous that it sprang whole from the man's arm, and it was hung in the monastery as a testimony to this miracle.
In those times, a certain merchant named Flodoald, a man wise in worldly matters and abundant in wealth, had a servant whom he loved dearly.
The servant was arrested for a certain crime by the king's official and ordered to be guarded by the royal servants until his master arrived, and the ignited...
It happened as it is written in this page.
At the same time, a certain consul, highly favored by the king and very powerful in earthly matters, was riding urgently with a huge entourage, as is the custom among the Anglo-Saxons, to a certain village where a grand feast was prepared for necessary dining.
However, on the journey, a boy of exceptional character, whom the consul loved more than the others, fell hurriedly from his horse, breaking his leg and arm.
He was so completely injured that everyone present believed he was dead.
The head of the household, seeing his beloved boy dying and greatly saddened by the event, earnestly prayed to the Lord to have mercy on the dying boy through the intercession of the glorious and venerable bishop.
He said, "Saint Swithun, I beg you to plead with the Redeemer of the world to grant this boy life and health."
If my request is granted, I will be your most faithful servant for the rest of my life.
Moreover, I will bring this innocent child to your sacred tomb, so that through your healing intercession, he may experience the grace of Christ."
While the man was praying to God with such words, the boy suddenly jumped up, completely healed.
He who had just been lying in the grip of death now stood up.
When the consul saw this, he was overjoyed beyond words and began to glorify God with all the devotion of his heart, for God does not despise a contrite and humble heart.
Miracles attributed to this saint occurred not only in England but also in the land of the Franks.
In that region, as witnesses attest, a certain thief caught in a heinous crime was held in a dark prison, bound with wicked chains and a harsh shackle, awaiting execution the next day.
He had heard from merchants crossing the ocean for trade that a saint had been discovered in foreign lands, through whose intercession the sick were healed from various ailments.
Remembering this in the darkness of the night, he prayed to the incomprehensible power of Almighty God.
