  <p>
    <s>
      Herod the king stretched out his hand to harm some of the Church, as it is written in the book of Acts, chapter twelve.
    </s>
    <s>
      In this reading, dearest brothers, we have three things to consider according to the letter.
    </s>
    <s>
      First, why the omnipotent and just Lord gives the wicked so much power to harm His saints.
    </s>
    <s>
      I say "gives" because, as the Apostle says, "there is no power except from God," as stated in Romans, chapter thirteen.
    </s>
    <s>
      This is corroborated by our Redeemer who said to Pilate, "You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above," as found in John, chapter nineteen.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, even the devil could do nothing against Job until he asked for and received power from the Lord, as we see in Job, chapter one.
    </s>
    <s>
      So, the Lord grants the wicked the power to harm for three reasons.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      First, to test the good.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as a furnace refines gold, a file sharpens iron, and water cleans cloth, tribulation benefits the righteous.
    </s>
    <s>
      Through the trials imposed by the wicked, who act like smiths, God polishes His chosen vessels to make them purer, brighter, stronger, and more valuable.
    </s>
    <s>
      Second, to mock and condemn the wicked, as it is written, "This dragon whom you formed to mock him," found in Psalms, chapter one hundred four.
    </s>
    <s>
      The devil and his followers are mocked in that, while they desire to harm the saints, they end up benefiting them and harming themselves more.
    </s>
    <s>
      Third, to demonstrate divine wisdom and power, which are so great that they can use the evil deeds of the wicked for good.
    </s>
    <s>
      Whatever evil they plan against God and His members, they end up serving God, who achieves His will and glory through them.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Secondly, we should consider that the Lord does not want some of His saints to remain in this world any longer.
    </s>
    <s>
      Even though, if they survived, they would seem to benefit both themselves and others greatly, He joyfully takes them out of the tribulations of this world, as He did with James the Greater, whom He took from this world by Herod's sword while still a young man before the other apostles.
    </s>
    <s>
      The all-knowing Lord does this for three reasons.
    </s>
    <s>
      The first is that He knows they have completed the merits they were to achieve, as it is written, "Completed in a short time, he fulfilled long years. For venerable old age is not the length of time, nor is it measured by years. Wisdom is the gray hair for anyone, and an unblemished life is ripe old age," as found in Wisdom, chapter four.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence, although holy young men die, they complete their days, unlike the wicked of whom it is said, "Men of blood and deceit will not live out half their days," as stated in Psalms, chapter fifty-five.
    </s>
    <s>
      The second reason is to prevent them from stumbling and perishing on the slippery path of this world, as it is written, "He was taken away lest wickedness should change his understanding or guile deceive his soul," also found in Wisdom, chapter four.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, He hastened to take him out of the midst of iniquities.
    </s>
    <s>
      The third reason is that the saints are taken from this world quickly because, as the Apostle says, "The world was not worthy of them," as stated in Hebrews, chapter eleven.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, due to their sins, people are deprived of the light of the saints.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence it is written: "The righteous are taken away and no one understands; the righteous one is removed from the face of iniquity," as found in Isaiah, chapter fifty-seven.
    </s>
    <s>
      But whatever the reason, my brothers, that the saints are taken so quickly from this miserable world, it is well and blessed for them, who are granted to quickly pass through the toil and misery of this world and enter eternal glory.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Thirdly, we should consider that the Lord powerfully rescues other saints from tribulations, allowing them to live long lives here, such as Peter and John the Evangelist.
    </s>
    <s>
      He does this to reward their greater labor, to console and educate His Church, and to shame and plunder the opposing party, which they greatly confound when they rescue the vessels of captivity.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      For these reasons, the Lord kept Peter in His Church longer and powerfully freed him from Herod's prison.
    </s>
    <s>
      In this liberation, He openly demonstrates both His mercy and omnipotence.
    </s>
    <s>
      His mercy is shown in that He was moved and took pity on the Church's prayers for their imprisoned master.
    </s>
    <s>
      His omnipotence is shown in that He freed Peter, who was imprisoned, bound with double chains, and heavily guarded.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    When the iron gate was opened, he was powerfully rescued from all these obstacles, not by human cunning, but by his angel, and mercifully restored to his Church, demonstrating to us that he is always approachable to the devout prayers of his Church and that he is always powerful to deliver it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the imprisonment and liberation that happened once in Peter, happen daily in us. For Herod, that is, the devil, who is the king of all the wicked, daily, with God's permission, lays his hands on whom he can afflict from the Church. It is not enough for him that he devours the Gentiles and Jews and other unbelievers daily unless he also kills Christians, whom he can, in soul.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, the Lord says about him to blessed Job: "He will swallow the river without notice, and he is confident that the Jordan will flow into his mouth" <break time="500ms" /> (Job 40). As if to say: The devil does not think it a great thing that he has swallowed almost the entire human race, that is, the river, from the beginning of the world until Christ, unless he also gulps down the Jordan, that is, the baptized, into the belly of his malice.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not even enough for him that he kills some of the lesser members of the Church daily, but he also hastens to kill the greater and prelates of the holy Church especially. For his choice food, as Habakkuk says, is those who are chosen <break time="500ms" /> (Habakkuk 1). Hence, it is said here: He killed James, the brother of John, with the sword, because he kills great despisers and supplanters of vices with the sword of his temptation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Seeing that this pleased the Jews, that is, the supporters of his malice, he also sets out to seize Peter, that is, the order of firm bishops, so that by harming the head, he might universally subject the lesser members to himself. He does this especially during the days of unleavened bread, because in solemnities and fasts, in which the faithful exercise themselves for greater purity, the devil exercises greater attacks against them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having seized a sinner with his temptations, he sends him into the depth and darkness of vices, and lest he escape through the gate of repentance, he hands him over to four squads of soldiers to guard. It is called a squad which has four tyrants under it, like a centurion who has one hundred.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first squad, to which the sinner is handed over by the devil to be guarded, is the spirit of foolish shame, which brings confusion to the sinner about confessing his sin. Hence Solomon says: "There is a shame that brings sin" <break time="500ms" /> (Sirach 4). This spirit has under it four subordinates, namely the shame of confessing, the shame of humbling oneself before a priest, the shame of seeking a cure, and the shame of pursuing the penance imposed.
  </p>
  <p>
    And lest this one alone is not enough to keep the sinner in his sin, a second squad is added, namely the spirit of false security, which similarly has four subordinates: the security of a light and remissible fault, the security of a longer life, the security of doing enough penance, and the security of divine mercy.
  </p>
  <p>
    And lest these two are not enough, a third squad is added, namely the spirit of obstinacy, which has four subordinates: obstinacy in sin, obstinacy in contempt, obstinacy in hardness of heart, and obstinacy in impenitence.
  </p>
  <p>
    And lest these three are not enough, a fourth squad is added, namely the spirit of unbelief. This one similarly has four subordinates: unbelief in the gravity of sin, unbelief in the resurrection, unbelief in the final judgment, and unbelief in eternal punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, with these severe guards, the devil confines and keeps the sinner in the prison of sins, intending to bring him forth for torment to the demons after Easter, that is, after the passage of death. And the sinner is indeed kept in prison this way. However, prayer must be made without ceasing by the Church to God for him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, it is clear that he is truly not of the Church who does not pray incessantly for the sons of the Church who are so captive. This is clearly against some Christians who, if they sometimes see their pastor or someone else enslaved by the chains of sins, not only do not pray for him but even rejoice, slander, and defame. Without a doubt, they incur the curse of Ham, while following his example.

        <s>The father’s sons do not cover his shame, but mock him.</s>
        <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɛnɪsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> nine.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>When the devil hopes to lead a sinner, so trapped, to eternal punishment, the sinner is meanwhile sleeping between two soldiers, in the night of his sins.</s>
        <s>That is, between the spirit of presumption, which keeps him from escaping on the right, and the spirit of despair, which keeps him from escaping on the left.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Bound by two chains, that is, love and delight in his sins, which prevent and restrain him from good works and right paths.</s>
        <s>And guards were keeping watch over the prison door.</s>
        <s>The door of the prison of sins is repentance, which the aforementioned four prevent from opening to the sinner: foolish shame, corrupt security, obstinacy, and unbelief.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Although the sinner sleeps deeply in his vices without hope, bound and oppressed, already destined for eternal damnation, nonetheless, with divine mercy hearing the constant prayers of His Church, an angel of divine power, or even a preacher, stands by, who stands by others and brings the light of contrition to the one dwelling in the darkness of sins.</s>
        <s>Striking Peter's side, that is, the sinner’s conscience, he awakens him, saying: Rise quickly from the sleep of your sins, lest you be dragged to eternal damnation.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>And immediately the chains of love and delight in sins fall from his hands, for the sins he once loved and delighted in begin to displease and torment him.</s>
        <s>He is advised to gird and restrain the softness of his wandering thoughts with self-control and to shod his feet to keep his affections from clinging to earthly desires.</s>
        <s>He is also advised to clothe himself with the garment of charity and other virtues, and to follow the admonition of salvation.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Rising, the sinner follows the angel of the saving admonition, and yet, conscious of his own frailty and weakness, he hardly believes he can break free from his sinful habits.</s>
        <s>For he is so held by habit that he thinks he cannot abstain.</s>
        <s>However, passing, with the Lord’s help, the first guard, that is, the spirit of presumption and despair, and the second, that is, foolish shame, corrupt security, obstinacy, and unbelief, he finally comes to the Iron Gate, that is, the obstacle of corrupt and stubborn habit, which opens to him with the Lord’s help.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>And stepping out, he proceeds down one street, because, after leaving the habit of sins, he walks the path of good works, and immediately the angel departs from him, for now instructed and led, he seems no longer to need guidance, and even becomes a guide to others.</s>
        <s>And the sinner, now having become righteous, reflecting on the depth of his sins from which he has been rescued, returns to himself and says, affirming what he previously did not dare hope for himself: Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and His mercy, and has delivered me, unworthy, from the hand of Herod, that is, the devil, and from all the expectation of demons.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>So, my brothers, let him who now knows he has been rescued through God's mercy from his former sinful habits, confess and bless the Lord.</s>
        <s>But let him who still sleeps in the prison of his sins hear the angel of saving admonition, and quickly rise from his sins, gird his loins with the belt of chastity, prevent his feet of affections from clinging to earthly things, fortify himself with the garment of charity and other virtues, redeem his sins with works of mercy, so that, escaping from the prison, from the chains, from the double custody of the devil, from the iron gate of habit, he may follow the path of righteousness henceforth, and bless and confess the Lord's mercy, now and forever, with the Lord Jesus Christ granting it, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.</s>
        <s>Amen.</s>
