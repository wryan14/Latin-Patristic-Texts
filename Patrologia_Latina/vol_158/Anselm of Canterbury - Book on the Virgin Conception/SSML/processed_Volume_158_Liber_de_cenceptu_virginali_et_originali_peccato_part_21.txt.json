      "original_latin": "Quod natus de Virgine, pro originali peccato habuerit\noriginalem justitiam. Ut mihi videtur, de peccato quidem originali,\nsicut proposui, sufficienter ostensum est quomodo\nad hominem de Virgine conceptum nulla ratione\ndescendere a parentibus potuit; sed potius justus,\net beatus  fieri, ratione exigente, debuit. Quamobrem,\nquoniam  de justo Patre secundum divinam,\net de justa matre secundum humanam naturam,\njustus ab ipsa origine, ut ita dictum sit, natus\nest; non incongrue pro originali injustitia, quam\n omnes alii filii Adae  habent, a sua origine justitiam\noriginalem habere dicendus est.",
