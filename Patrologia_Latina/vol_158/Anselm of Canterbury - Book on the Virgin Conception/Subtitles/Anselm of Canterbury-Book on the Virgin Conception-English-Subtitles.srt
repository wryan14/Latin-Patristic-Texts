00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,463
Prologue

2
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:05,859
I want to honor all your religious wishes as best as I can, dear brother and son Boso.

3
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:09,539
I feel especially obligated when I see these wishes arise for your sake.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:20,987
I am confident that when you read the book Why God Became Man, which you strongly encouraged me to write and in which I included you as my discussion partner, you might uncover another reason beyond the one I provided there.

5
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:25,740
This reason explains how God took on human form from the sinful mass of humanity without sin.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,858
Your keen mind is eager to explore what that reason might be.

7
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:33,151
Therefore, I would feel unfair to you if I kept my thoughts on this matter from you.

8
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:43,629
So, I will briefly share my feelings on this, in a way that respects all faithful opinions on the subject, and I won't stubbornly cling to my own view if it can be reasonably shown to contradict the truth.

9
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:49,813
However, I believe the reasoning I provided in that same work is completely valid and sufficient if considered carefully.

10
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:54,311
After all, there can be multiple reasons for the same thing, each sufficient on its own.

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,351
Chapter One

12
00:00:56,351 --> 00:01:00,144
Understanding the concepts of original and personal justice or injustice.

13
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:07,417
To grasp how God assumed a human nature from sinful humanity without sin, we first need to explore original sin, as it raises this question.

14
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:13,756
If we can understand why Christ wasn't subject to this sin and how His conception was free from all sin, it becomes clear.

15
00:01:13,756 --> 00:02:36,828
It's certain that the term "original" is derived from "origin."
So, if original sin exists only in humans, it seems to be named either from the original human nature, which is fundamental from its beginning because it originates from the essence of human nature itself, or from the origin, meaning from the start of each person, since it comes from their beginning.
However, it doesn't seem to stem from the beginning of human nature, as its origin was just when the first humans were created just and without sin.
Thus, it appears to be called original from the very start of each individual.
Nonetheless, if someone claims that sin is called original because it passes down to individuals from those who provide the origin of nature, I won't disagree, as long as it's acknowledged that original sin is inherited with the beginning of each person.
In each human, there exists both nature, which makes one human like everyone else, and a person, which distinguishes one from others, as when they are called by specific names, like Adam or Abel.
The sin of each is in both nature and person: Adam's sin was in the human aspect, which is nature, and in the individual known as Adam, which is personal.
However, there is a sin that each person inherits with nature at their very start, and there is a sin that isn't inherited with nature, but is committed by the person after they become distinct from others.
The sin inherited at the beginning is called original; it can also be termed natural, not because it is part of the essence of nature, but because it is acquired with it due to its corruption.

16
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:43,005
Once someone becomes a person, any sin they commit is considered personal because it stems from their own fault.

17
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:46,930
In a similar vein, we can talk about original and personal righteousness.

18
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,113
Adam and Eve, right from the start of their existence as humans, were immediately just and righteous without delay.

19
00:02:53,113 --> 00:03:00,102
However, righteousness is termed personal when someone who was unjust receives righteousness, which they didn't possess initially.

20
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,968
Chapter Two

21
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,582
How Human Nature Was Corrupted.

22
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:09,572
If Adam and Eve had maintained their original righteousness, their descendants would have been righteous like them.

23
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:17,437
However, because they sinned, even though they initially had the strength to maintain righteousness easily, their nature became weakened and corrupted.

24
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:22,385
The body, after sin, became like that of animals, susceptible to corruption and carnal desires.

25
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:27,906
The soul became infected with these desires due to the body's corruption and the loss of what it once had.

26
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:33,792
Since all of human nature was within them, and nothing was outside of them, the whole was weakened and corrupted.

27
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:43,532
Thus, it retained the obligation of full righteousness without injustice, which it received; and the need to make amends for abandoning it, along with the corruption incurred through sin.

28
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:49,782
If it had not sinned, it would have continued as God made it; but after sin, it propagates as it became through sinning.

29
00:03:49,782 --> 00:04:14,106
Because it cannot make amends for the sin or recover the lost righteousness on its own, and the corruptible body burdens the soul Wisdom Nine: Fifteen; especially when it is weak, like in infancy and the mother's womb, unable to understand righteousness:
it seems necessary for it to be born in infants with the obligation to make amends for the first sin, which it could always have avoided, and to have original righteousness, which it could always have maintained.

30
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:26,085
This inability does not excuse it in infants, because it does not pay what it owes, having abandoned righteousness in the first parents, in whom the whole was: and it is always indebted to have the power to maintain righteousness.

31
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:28,325
This appears to be original sin in infants.

32
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:34,107
We should also consider the sins of nearby relatives, which are passed down to the third and fourth generation.

33
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,433
While it might be debatable whether all of this should be considered in terms of original sin, I want to make it clear that I'm not downplaying its significance by questioning it.

34
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,321
So, for now, let's assume it's as serious as it gets.

35
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,080
Chapter Three

36
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,538
That there is no sin except in rational will.

37
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:59,297
Truly, whether we refer to original sin or something less, I believe it cannot be said to exist in an infant before they have a rational soul.

38
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:03,832
Just as there was no righteousness in Adam before he became a rational human being.

39
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:12,848
If Adam and Eve had conceived without prior sin, righteousness would not have been present in the seed, nor could it be before they were formed into a living person.

40
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:19,787
So, if a human's seed is not capable of righteousness before becoming human, it cannot take on original sin before being human.

41
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,503
Certainly, we should not doubt that original sin is unrighteousness.

42
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:28,420
If all sin is unrighteousness, and original sin is sin, then it is indeed unrighteousness.

43
00:05:28,420 --> 00:06:34,753
But if someone argues, "Not all sin is unrighteousness," they would have to claim that something could have sin without unrighteousness, which seems unbelievable. If it's said that original sin should not be called sin absolutely, but instead "original sin," much like a painted man isn't truly a man but a painted man, it implies that an infant, who has no sin except original sin, is innocent of sin.
And the Son of the Virgin was not the only human who, in the womb and being born, was without sin. Hence, either an infant who dies without baptism, having no sin except original sin, is not damned, or is damned without sin. But we accept none of these ideas.
Therefore, all sin is unrighteousness, and original sin is absolutely sin, which means it is unrighteousness. If God does not condemn except because of unrighteousness, but condemns someone because of original sin, then original sin is nothing other than unrighteousness.
And if that's the case, and unrighteousness is simply the absence of due righteousness-since it doesn't seem to be unrighteousness unless in a nature that, when it ought to have righteousness, does not have it-then original sin falls under the same definition of unrighteousness.

44
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:42,492
If justice is the correctness of will maintained for its own sake, then this correctness can only exist in a rational nature.

45
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:50,378
Therefore, no nature is obligated to justice except the rational one, just as no nature is capable of justice except the rational one.

46
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:57,616
Since injustice can only exist where justice ought to be, original sin, which is injustice, exists only in rational nature.

47
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:06,444
However, rational nature is only found in God, angels, and the human soul, through which a human is called rational, and without which a human is not.

48
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:11,858
Since original sin cannot be in God or in angels, it exists only in the rational human soul.

49
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:19,685
It must also be understood that justice can only exist in the will if justice is the correctness of will maintained for its own sake.

50
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:21,569
Therefore, so too can injustice.

51
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,277
The absence of justice is not called injustice unless justice ought to be there.

52
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:34,398
Thus, nothing is called just or unjust except for justice or injustice itself, unless it is the will, or because of a just or unjust will.

53
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:40,342
Through this, we say a person or an angel is just or unjust; a soul, or an action, is just or unjust.

54
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,528
Chapter Four

55
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:48,784
Nothing is inherently just or unjust, except justice or injustice itself, and nothing is punished except the will.

56
00:07:48,784 --> 00:08:00,309
Nothing, whether it's a substance, an action, or anything else on its own, is just unless it is justice; or unjust or sinful unless it is injustice; not even the will itself, where justice or injustice resides.

57
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:10,023
The power of the soul to will something is distinct: this power, which can be seen as the instrument of willing-like vision is the instrument of seeing-is what we call the will.

58
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:15,731
Justice is something else, which when possessed, makes the will just; and when lacking, makes it unjust.

59
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:21,384
The uses and affections of this instrument are also called wills, but it's too lengthy to include here.

60
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:35,598
Desires, which the Apostle refers to as the flesh, which lusts against the spirit, as mentioned in Romans Chapter Eight; and the law of sin in the members, opposing the law of the mind, as noted in Galatians Chapter Five, are not just or unjust by themselves.

61
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:42,293
They do not make a person just or unjust merely by being felt; but unjust, only when the will consents when it should not.

62
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:54,038
For the Apostle says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, as stated in Romans Chapter Eight, meaning those who do not consent to the will of the flesh.

63
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:58,154
If feeling without consent made a person unjust, condemnation would follow.

64
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:02,380
Therefore, it is not the feeling itself, but consenting to it, that is a sin.

65
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,307
If these desires were unjust by themselves, they would make a person unjust whenever they were consented to.

66
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:11,655
But when animals consent to them, they are not called unjust.

67
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:18,460
Similarly, if they were sins, they would be removed in baptism, since all sin is washed away; which is clearly not the case.

68
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,552
Therefore, there is no injustice in their essence; but in the rational will following them in a disordered way.

69
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:30,479
When the will resists them, delighting in the law of God according to the inner self, then the will is just.

70
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:36,016
Justice, as commanded by law, is known as the law of God because it originates from God.

71
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:40,352
It's also called the law of the mind because we understand it through our minds.

72
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:47,993
Similarly, the old law is referred to as the law of God due to its divine origin and the law of Moses because it was delivered through Moses.

73
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:52,816
I mentioned that no action is inherently unjust; it becomes unjust due to an unjust will.

74
00:09:52,816 --> 00:10:03,979
This is evident in situations where actions might be performed justly, such as killing in certain contexts, like Phinehas did in Numbers twenty-five, or the union of both sexes in marriage or among animals.

75
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:11,891
In cases where actions are never justifiable, like perjury and some other acts that shouldn't be mentioned, the concept is not as straightforward.

76
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:23,163
However, if an action results in something that only exists while it's being done and ceases once completed, like writing something inappropriate, the sin would exist only while the action is being performed.

77
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:29,720
If the act of writing is complete but the written words remain, the sin would cease to exist once the action is finished.

78
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,459
Yet, if the result of the action remains, the sin would also persist.

79
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:39,908
Yet, we observe that sins often aren't erased when the action stops, and they can be erased even if the result remains.

80
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:44,731
Therefore, neither the action that passes nor the outcome that remains is the sin itself.

81
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:54,594
Finally, if the body parts and senses involved in unjust voluntary actions are accused, they might argue: God has subjected us to the will, so we cannot help but follow its commands.

82
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:57,574
The will guides us like instruments to perform actions.

83
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,584
We can't resist it on our own, nor can we prevent the actions it dictates.

84
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,131
To the master God has given us, we must comply.

85
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:07,057
When we obey it, we obey God who established this law.

86
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:12,585
So, how can the body parts, senses, or actions sin if they serve the purpose God has assigned to them?

87
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:15,782
Whatever they do should be entirely attributed to the will.

88
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:22,350
Given this, you might wonder why the body's parts and senses seem to be punished for the actions of the will.

89
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,836
In reality, it's only the will that is punished.

90
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:31,414
Nothing is considered a punishment unless it's against someone's will, and nothing experiences punishment unless it has a will.

91
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:34,263
Body parts and senses on their own don't have any will.

92
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:40,686
Just as the will acts through the body parts and senses, it is also through them that the will experiences pleasure or pain.

93
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:50,891
If you're unsure about this, remember that it's the soul, where the will resides, that actually feels and acts through the senses and body parts; thus, it experiences pleasure or pain through them.

94
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:57,210
It's common to refer to the actions an unjust will commits as sins, because the sin resides in the will that commits them.

95
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,597
We also use specific terms to indicate that these actions are done unjustly, like fornication and lying.

96
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:10,937
However, we perceive something different when we consider the action itself or its expression, compared to when we consider whether it's done justly or unjustly.

97
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,056
Chapter Five

98
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:17,362
The concept of evil, which we equate with sin or injustice, is essentially nothing.

99
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:22,654
Since all essence comes from God, and nothing from God is unjust, no essence can be inherently unjust.

100
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:25,870
Injustice, like blindness, is simply the absence of something.

101
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:32,926
Blindness is the lack of sight where it should be, just as it's not something extra in the eye nor in a tree where sight isn't expected.

102
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:40,604
Injustice doesn't infect or corrupt the soul like poison to a body, nor does it directly cause something, even when a malicious person acts wrongly.

103
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:48,438
Think of a wild beast that runs free when its chains are broken, or a ship that drifts aimlessly if the captain abandons the helm, sailing into danger.

104
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:56,895
We say this happens because the chains or the helm are absent-not that their absence is something or does anything, but because their presence would prevent chaos.

105
00:12:56,895 --> 00:13:01,720
Similarly, when an evil person spirals into danger through their actions, we blame injustice.

106
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:14,483
It's not because injustice is a tangible thing or does anything, but because the will, which guides all voluntary actions, is led by desires without justice, pulling itself and everything else into various evils, recklessly and without direction.

107
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:17,181
Justice, if present, would stop this from happening.

108
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:19,878
From this, we can see that injustice has no essence.

109
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:25,793
The inclinations and actions of an unjust will, though something in themselves, are what we refer to as injustice.

110
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,491
In the same way, we understand that evil is nothing.

111
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,226
Just as injustice lacks due justice, evil is simply the absence of good.

112
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:36,999
No essence, even if labeled evil, is actually nothing, nor is being evil a thing of essence.

113
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:43,069
For any essence, being evil is merely lacking the good it should have, and this lack is not the presence of anything.

114
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:47,579
The reason something is bad isn't because of any inherent quality.

115
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:53,345
I've briefly explained this regarding evil, which is essentially nothing and is undoubtedly injustice.

116
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:57,924
Discomfort is considered evil, which is why discomforts are referred to as evils.

117
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:04,594
Sometimes it's an absence, like deafness and blindness; other times it appears to be something, like pain and sadness.

118
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:12,113
Justice is the rightness of the will, valued for its own sake, while injustice is simply the absence of justice, lacking any essence.

119
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:24,323
I believe I've adequately demonstrated that all essence comes from God, and nothing from God is anything but good, as discussed in the treatise On the Fall of the Devil, especially chapters one, fifteen, and sixteen.

120
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:28,676
I've explained justice more thoroughly in my work On Truth, chapter thirteen.

121
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,720
Chapter Six

122
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,314
When God punishes for sin, it's not without reason.

123
00:14:33,314 --> 00:15:38,327
Some people, when they hear that sin is nothing, often ask, "If sin is nothing, why does God punish someone for it, since no one should be punished for nothing?"
Although this question seems simple, because they don't fully understand what they're asking, a brief response is necessary.
Even though the absence of justice is nothing, whether it should be present or not, God rightly punishes sinners not for nothing, but for something. As I mentioned in the previous book, He requires the honor due to Him, which they refused to give willingly, from those who are unwilling. To maintain order in His kingdom, He separates them from the just in a suitable arrangement.
However, He doesn't punish creatures where justice shouldn't exist for the absence of it-that is, for nothing-because there's nothing He expects from them, nor does the order of the universe demand it.
Therefore, when God punishes for sin, which is the absence of due justice, He doesn't entirely punish for nothing. It's true that unless there's something for which He should punish, He doesn't punish for nothing at all.
Now, sin and injustice are nothing, and they exist only in the rational will; nothing else can rightly be called unjust except the will.
From what has been said, I believe this is clear.

124
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,079
Chapter Seven

125
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,326
How human seed is said to be unclean and conceived in sin, even though there is no sin in it.

126
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:55,198
It seems that a baby either has a rational soul from the moment of conception, without which it cannot have a rational will, or there is no original sin present at that point.

127
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,880
However, it's hard to accept that a rational soul is present right from conception.

128
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:10,768
This would imply that each time human seed is conceived and perishes before forming a human, a human soul would be condemned as it hasn't been reconciled through Christ, which seems too absurd.

129
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:13,645
Thus, we need to discard this part of the argument.

130
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:25,153
But if a baby doesn't have sin immediately from conception, how do we understand what Job says to God:
"Who can make clean what is conceived from an unclean seed? Is it not you who alone are?"
(Job 14:4).

131
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:31,923
And how do we interpret David's words:
"I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me" (Psalm 51:7).

132
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:41,513
So, I will explore, if I can, why infants are said to be conceived in iniquity and sin with unclean seed, even though there is no sin in them immediately from conception.

133
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:48,057
Often, divine Scripture declares something as true, even if it hasn't happened yet, because it is destined to occur.

134
00:16:48,057 --> 00:17:00,524
For example, God tells Adam about the forbidden tree:
"On the day you eat of it, you will surely die" (Genesis 2:17); not because he died physically that day, but because he received the inevitability of dying eventually.

135
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:10,960
Similarly, Paul says, because of the inevitability of dying someday:
"If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit lives because of righteousness" (Romans 8:10).

136
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:21,171
For their bodies, to whom he spoke, were not dead; but they were destined to die because of sin:
because through one man sin entered the world, and through sin, death (Romans 5:12).

137
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:30,432
Just as we all sinned in Adam when he sinned-not because we sinned ourselves, as we weren't yet in existence, but because we were destined to come from him.

138
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:38,907
At that moment, the necessity for us to sin when we came into being was established, because through the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners.

139
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,123
See Romans chapter five, verse nineteen.

140
00:17:41,123 --> 00:18:00,066
Similarly, a person can be considered to be conceived in iniquity and sin from unclean seed; not because there's impurity or sin in the seed itself, but because from that seed and conception, a person begins to exist and acquires the necessity to have the impurity of sin when they have a rational soul, which is essentially sin and iniquity.

141
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:09,648
Even if a child is born from corrupt desire, the fault isn't in the seed any more than it is in spittle or blood if someone spits with ill will or emits some of their blood.

142
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:13,415
The blame lies not with the spittle or blood, but with the ill will.

143
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:21,059
Thus, it's clear how sin isn't present in infants immediately from conception; and the truths I mentioned from divine Scripture hold true.

144
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:32,026
Indeed, they don't have sin because they lack the will without which there is no sin; yet it's said to be present because they carry the necessity to sin when they become human beings from the seed.

145
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:39,780
If these things are true, as I believe, then what is passed from parent to offspring, since they have no will, means there's no sin in them.

146
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,927
Chapter Eight

147
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:46,130
That there is no sin or necessity of future sin in the seed taken from the Virgin.

148
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,050
It is clear that in what the Son of God took on from the Virgin, there could be no stain of sin.

149
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:57,303
It's been said that seed is inherited from parents with a necessity for future sin when it is joined with a rational soul.

150
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:04,580
This is because human nature is born with the obligation to atone for the sin of Adam and of the nearest parents, something it cannot achieve.

151
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,705
As long as it doesn't achieve this, it sins because it cannot regain the justice it lost on its own.

152
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:17,034
The soul, burdened by a corruptible body, cannot even understand this justice, and it cannot be preserved or possessed if it is not understood.

153
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:24,107
If the seed taken from the Virgin can be shown to be free from these necessities, it will be evident that it carried no necessity for sin.

154
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:42,198
The necessity by which human nature alone cannot regain justice on its own, and the one by which the corruptible body burdens the soul, preventing it from preserving justice received in maturity without grace, or even understanding it in infants, can be seen as foreign to that seed through the personal unity of the one assuming and the nature assumed.

155
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:48,963
If the necessity is first removed, by which it seems bound to atone for the sins of the first and nearest parents, it becomes clear.

156
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:56,754
It will not be doubtful that no obligation follows from the nearest parents if it can be understood to be free from the obligation of the first parents.

157
00:19:56,754 --> 00:20:05,415
Therefore, with God's help, I will first try to investigate how this can be known, so that once this is demonstrated, there will be no need to labor much in other areas.

158
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:07,631
Chapter Nine

159
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:14,230
Why is the sin that condemned the human race attributed more to Adam than to Eve, since he sinned after and through her?

160
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:23,357
First, let's consider why the sin that condemned humanity is more often attributed to Adam rather than Eve, even though she sinned first and Adam's sin followed hers.

161
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:31,385
The Apostle states: "But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression" (Romans 5:14).

162
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:35,069
Many other passages also seem to place more blame on Adam than Eve.

163
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:44,087
I believe this happens because the union of the two is entirely encompassed in the name of the principal part; much like how a whole is often represented by a part.

164
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:54,699
Or perhaps because Adam, with his rib, although it was made into a woman, could still be referred to as Adam, as it is written: "God made them male and female, and blessed them" (Genesis 1:27).

165
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:57,943
And he called their name Adam on the day they were created.

166
00:20:57,943 --> 00:21:05,201
Or maybe because if Adam hadn't sinned, but only Eve, it wouldn't have been necessary for the entire human race to perish, just Eve.

167
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:12,954
God could have made another woman from Adam, in whom he had created the seed of all humans, allowing God's purpose with Adam to be fulfilled.

168
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:19,113
For these reasons, I will refer to both of them by the name of Adam, unless it is necessary to distinguish them.

169
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,311
Chapter Ten

170
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:25,677
Why do people carry the burden of Adam's sin, even though they weren't aware of it?

171
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:32,409
Each person is indeed a child of Adam, a human by creation, an Adam by propagation, and an individual with their own uniqueness.

172
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:35,408
A person doesn't exist because of Adam, but through Adam.

173
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:46,242
Just as Adam didn't make himself human, he didn't create within himself the nature of propagation; instead, God, who made him human, instilled this nature in him so that humans would be propagated from him.

174
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:53,028
There's no doubt about the source of each person's obligation: it's not because they're human, nor because they're an individual.

175
00:21:53,028 --> 00:22:03,126
If each person were guilty of this debt simply for being human or an individual, Adam would have been bound by this debt before he sinned, merely for being human and a person, which is absurd.

176
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:08,491
Thus, one becomes a debtor because they are Adam; but not just any Adam, specifically Adam the sinner.

177
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:14,960
Indeed, if Adam had never sinned, it would be absurd to think those propagated from him would still be born with this debt.

178
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,955
It's worth reiterating why each person is burdened by Adam's sin or debt because they are propagated from him, even though they were unaware of the sin.

179
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:31,739
When God created Adam, He endowed him with the nature of propagation, which He placed under Adam's control, to use as he wished, as long as he remained subject to God.

180
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:37,209
Adam was meant to use it not with animalistic and irrational desire, but with a human and rational will.

181
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:46,519
Just as animals desire nothing with reason, humans should desire nothing without reason, which they always should, because Adam received this power and could always maintain it.

182
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:56,144
God also granted him the grace that, just as He created him without any operating nature of propagation or the will of a creature, He made him both rational and just at the same time.

183
00:22:56,144 --> 00:23:03,876
So, if Adam hadn't sinned, those he generated would be both rational and just, possessing a rational soul through the operation of nature and will.

184
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:19,017
Just as it has been shown that a rational nature was created to be just, as often demonstrated in the earlier work, Book 2, Chapter 1, it's also proven that those born from human nature, without any prior sin, would naturally possess both justice and rationality.

185
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:26,603
Indeed, the one who created the first human without parents also creates those born through the nature of propagation that he established.

186
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:31,935
Therefore, every person, if no sin had occurred, would be just like Adam, both just and rational.

187
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:41,555
However, because Adam chose not to follow God's will, even though the nature of propagation remained, it was not subject to his will as it would have been if he hadn't sinned.

188
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:44,963
He lost the grace that he could have kept for his descendants.

189
00:23:44,963 --> 00:23:48,866
Everyone born through the nature he received is born bound by his debt.

190
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:58,651
Therefore, because human nature, which was entirely in Adam with nothing outside of him, dishonored God by sinning without necessity, it could not satisfy God's honor on its own.

191
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:08,711
Adam lost the grace that he could have always preserved for his descendants, and the sin, along with its penalty, spreads with the nature of propagation, no matter how far it extends.

192
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:10,847
Chapter Eleven

193
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:18,154
The birth from the Virgin does not follow the natural laws and merits of typical human propagation; there are three distinct courses of events.

194
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:25,972
We must carefully consider whether this so-called inheritance of sin and its punishment rightfully extends to a person born from Adam through the Virgin.

195
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:30,417
It's clear that Adam received the nature of propagation through both a man and a woman.

196
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:38,592
Human nature doesn't have, and it's known to be impossible, the ability for a man alone or a woman alone to create a human being through their own natural will.

197
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:52,439
Just as the clay of the earth didn't possess the nature or will to form the first man, though it was by God's action that it could be made:
in the same way, a woman wasn't made from the man's rib, nor was a man made from a woman alone, by natural processes or human will.

198
00:24:52,439 --> 00:25:08,738
But God, by His own will and power, created one man from clay, another from a woman alone, and a woman from a man alone:
though nothing happens except by God's will, whether by direct action or permission, some things His power and will accomplish directly; some by created nature; and some by the will of the creature.

199
00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:18,191
Just as created nature can do nothing on its own except what it has received from God's will, the will of the creature can achieve nothing by itself unless nature assists or permits it.

200
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:34,490
God's will alone established the nature of things in the beginning, granting each its appropriate will so that natures and wills might fulfill their roles according to the order given to them:
and He continues to do many things, working with those same natures and wills, which they could never accomplish on their own.

201
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:49,392
It is only through God's will that the sea provides a dry path for people to walk through, that the dead are brought back to life, that water is transformed into wine, and that by the Holy Spirit, people gain insights they couldn't achieve on their own or through any other means.

202
00:25:49,392 --> 00:25:53,964
It's also by grace alone that harmful desires are redirected towards what is beneficial.

203
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:59,522
Many other events occur that neither creatures nor their will could bring about under normal circumstances.

204
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:03,002
Nature tends to move light things upward and heavy things downward.

205
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:12,613
Sometimes the earth, through the efforts of those who cultivate and plant it, and sometimes without any intentional action, produces countless plants and trees that grow and bear fruit.

206
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:17,547
Many such phenomena are more easily understood through experience than through formal teaching.

207
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:24,768
Activities like making a path, building, writing, and speaking are attributed to will, as they are accomplished through intentional effort.

208
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:33,495
Therefore, when we examine everything that happens, it occurs either solely by God's will, by nature according to the power granted by God, or by the will of creatures.

209
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:39,573
The things that neither nature nor the will of creatures can achieve, but only God can, are always to be marveled at.

210
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:44,040
There are clearly three categories of occurrences: miraculous, natural, and voluntary.

211
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,339
The miraculous doesn't conform to the others or their laws at all, but rather, it freely governs them.

212
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:59,157
It doesn't do them any injustice when it appears to oppose them, because they possess nothing except what they've received from it, and it has given them nothing except under its own terms.

213
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:08,455
Therefore, the birth of a man from only a virgin is neither natural nor voluntary but miraculous, like the creation of a woman from only a man and the creation of a man from clay.

214
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:17,805
It's clear that this doesn't fall under the laws and merits of propagation, which both will and nature, although separately, operate; for will does one thing there, nature another.

215
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:26,584
Yet, it's equally true that Adam came from a non-human, Jesus from only a woman, and Eve from only a man, just as any man or woman is truly human from a man and a woman.

216
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:33,730
Everyone is either Adam or descended from Adam, but Eve came from Adam alone, and all others come from Adam and Eve.

217
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,094
Since Mary, from whom Jesus alone was born, is descended from Adam and Eve, he cannot be from them in the same way.

218
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:45,849
It was fitting that the one who would redeem the human race was born from the ancestors of all humanity.

219
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,711
Chapter Twelve

220
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,413
Adam's wrongdoings do not affect this man in any way.

221
00:27:50,413 --> 00:27:55,611
Understanding why the Son of the Virgin is not burdened by sin or Adam's debt is also straightforward.

222
00:27:55,611 --> 00:28:01,268
Adam was originally created righteous, free from the often-discussed sin and debt, and free from its penalties.

223
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:07,893
He was given the ability to always maintain the righteousness he received, along with the freedom and happiness that came with it.

224
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:14,467
Since Adam could have kept these blessings without any trouble, but chose not to, he lost them and ended up with their opposites.

225
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:22,316
Consequently, he became a slave to sin, or injustice, and incurred a debt he couldn't repay, along with the misery of being unable to regain what he lost.

226
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:37,911
Just as he couldn't take away the good things he had or attract the evils he didn't have, except by failing to preserve those goods when he could, he also couldn't take away those same goods from anyone else or impose those evils, except by failing to preserve the goods for those he had the power to help.

227
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:43,670
However, he could only preserve those goods for those whose generation he had the power to influence by his will.

228
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:53,557
Therefore, he couldn't pass on the aforementioned evils to anyone, no matter how they were descended from him, if he had neither the means to influence their generation nor the ability to do so.

229
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:59,061
Thus, there is no reason or right for Adam's aforementioned evils to affect the man conceived by the Virgin.

230
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,439
Chapter Thirteen

231
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:08,015
Even if there were no God, but only a pure man, it would still be essential for him to be like the first man was created.

232
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:18,828
If we look closely at God's wise justice with clear reasoning, it seems quite absurd that through that lineage, neither created nature, the will of a creature, nor any given power produces or plants.

233
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:31,816
Only God's own will, by a new strength, separates the world from sin through a Virgin, so that no necessity of another's sin, debt, or punishment passes to this man; even if he is not assumed in the person of God but is made as a pure man.

234
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:37,630
By the same logic, God should not have made Adam except as just, nor burdened by any debt or inconvenience.

235
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:54,095
The rational mind clearly sees that the one whom He similarly creates by His own will and strength should not be subjected to any evil, because it is very unsuitable for the goodness of the omnipotent and wise God to create a rational nature by His own will alone from material in which there is no sin.

236
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,388
Whoever does not understand this does not recognize what is unsuitable for God.

237
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:08,169
Therefore, even if God were to create a pure man in this way, it would be necessary for him to be endowed with no less justice and blessedness than Adam was when he was first made.

238
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,367
Chapter Fourteen

239
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:19,256
The reason proposed is not contradicted by the writings that say man is conceived from unclean seed and in iniquities, even if these writings refer specifically to some.

240
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:31,353
If someone does not understand what I mentioned about human seed-that it holds no sin before the rational soul but is called unclean due to future sin and iniquity-it is because, when it becomes a person, it will bear uncleanness.

241
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:38,927
They may think it is unclean at conception, as posed in the question: Who can bring a clean thing out of something conceived in an unclean seed?

242
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,716
Job Chapter 14.

243
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:44,555
And: I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me; Psalm Chapter 51.

244
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:53,128
I am not concerned here, because I do not require that which cannot be understood to be understood; rather, I ask that attention be given to what I briefly convey.

245
00:30:53,128 --> 00:31:04,804
Indeed, those who made these statements may have intended them to be understood about all human seed, or only about seed sown with the sense of pleasure, which would not exist except in brute animals if man had not sinned.

246
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:12,010
But if they felt this way about all seed, then they claimed that the seed from the Virgin alone was unclean, which is impious to believe.

247
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,429
Therefore, they did not write this about that.

248
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:21,372
If they expressed this about any human seed in this sense, they meant it only about seed conceived with the aforementioned pleasure.

249
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:28,946
This does not contradict our reasoning, which asserts that the seed taken from the Virgin is pure, even though it originates from a sinful mass.

250
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,343
Chapter Fifteen

251
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,490
How a sinful mass is not entirely sinful.

252
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:40,507
Just as blindness isn't present in every part of a person, even though we call them blind, it's only in the eye where sight should be.

253
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,235
It's not in the hand or the foot.

254
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:45,743
Similarly, deafness is only in the ear when we say someone is deaf.

255
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:50,613
In the same way, while humanity is often called a sinful mass, sin isn't in every part of it.

256
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:55,117
As mentioned, it's only in the will, which isn't known to have any seed at conception.

257
00:31:55,117 --> 00:32:13,077
Therefore, with no true or plausible reason to argue otherwise, if we consider what was said earlier, we can conclude that there's no reason, truth, or understanding that suggests anything should be attributed to the man conceived from the Virgin alone from the sin of the sinful mass, even though he was taken from it, even if he weren't God.

258
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,311
Chapter Sixteen

259
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:19,383
Why John and others conceived through a miracle are not inherently free from sin.

260
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:37,631
If John the Baptist and others born from barren women-where the ability to conceive had died due to old age-are presented as objections, suggesting they should have been born without sin because they were conceived miraculously, it's important to understand that the reasoning which exempts the virginal conception from the necessity of sin is entirely different.

261
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:45,824
There's a difference between doing something unheard of, unimaginable, and unknown to nature, and healing nature weakened by age or defect to restore its function.

262
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:56,079
If Adam had not sinned, he would not have been weakened by old age or any other cause, and the nature of procreation, created in him and under his control, wouldn't have been hindered by any circumstance.

263
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,759
Therefore, in John and others like him, nothing new is added to Adam's nature, unlike with the son of the Virgin.

264
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,926
Instead, what was weakened is understood to have been restored.

265
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:17,242
Thus, because they were generated through the natural procreation given to Adam, they cannot and should not be considered similar to him in the miraculous conception we're discussing, to suggest they could be freed from the bond of original sin.

266
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,511
Chapter Seventeen

267
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:25,220
Why God became incarnate, when He could have made sinless humans from Adam, as many as needed, but not gods.

268
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:32,778
You might wonder: If a pure human, who wasn't God, could be made from Adam without any sin, as suggested, why did God need to become incarnate?

269
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:40,389
After all, God could have redeemed sinners through a sinless person, or by creating as many such humans as needed to complete the heavenly city.

270
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:47,630
To this, I respond briefly: God became human because a mere human would not be enough to redeem others, as has been frequently discussed.

271
00:33:47,630 --> 00:34:02,747
Therefore, He didn't create as many sinless humans as needed, because if no one from natural propagation was saved, it would seem as though creating that nature in Adam was pointless, and as if it was corrected without being made; which doesn't align with supreme wisdom for any nature.

272
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:12,684
Earlier, I intended to explore how the seed from the Virgin, which was shown to be sinless, could be seen as free from the necessities that I mentioned all other humans are conceived with.

273
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:31,658
And regarding the necessity by which human nature, having abandoned justice, cannot recover it by itself;
and the one by which the corruptible body weighs down the soul, especially in infants, I was confident it could be liberated because that human was God, if the necessity of sin and the debt of Adam and the nearest parents could first be rightly removed.

274
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:43,022
So, in Book One, I began to explore how these issues could be understood concerning the necessity of sin and the debt of Adam, so that later it would be easier to find what I was seeking regarding the other matters.

275
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:46,775
And with the abundant grace of Him whose conception is being discussed.

276
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:46,828
.

277
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:46,881
.

278
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:53,418
It's clear that he was not only recognized as free from all sin and debt but also from the necessities mentioned earlier.

279
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:59,533
A person conceived in this way should be endowed with just as much justice and happiness as Adam was when he was created.

280
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,414
This holds true even if he were just a human and not God.

281
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:13,936
It seems equally unreasonable for sin or its punishment to be passed down to him from any parents through such propagation, and for God to make a naturally rational being unjust or miserable without any wrongdoing on their part.

282
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,936
Chapter Eighteen

283
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:23,281
That God was conceived by a righteous Virgin, not out of necessity, as if He could not be born from a sinner, but because it was fitting.

284
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:28,161
The Son of God was truly conceived by the purest Virgin, but this was not out of necessity.

285
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:33,362
It wasn't that a righteous child could not be born from a sinful parent through such propagation.

286
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:37,866
Rather, it was fitting for this miraculous conception to be from a most pure mother.

287
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:49,395
It was appropriate that the Virgin, whom God the Father intended to give His only Son-whom He loved as Himself, being born equal to Him from His own heart-should possess a purity that could not be greater under God.

288
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:53,738
The Son was to be naturally the common Son of both God the Father and the Virgin.

289
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:56,419
He chose this Virgin to truly make her His mother.

290
00:35:56,419 --> 00:36:02,478
From her, the Holy Spirit wished and intended to conceive and bring forth the one from whom He Himself proceeded.

291
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:12,291
How the same Virgin was cleansed through faith before her conception is explained in Book Two, Chapters Sixteen and Seventeen, where I also provided another explanation of this topic.

292
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
Chapter Nineteen

293
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,080
How this explanation and another given elsewhere agree and differ.

294
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:28,194
These two explanations each seem sufficient on their own to address the question, but together they provide a deep satisfaction for the mind seeking the power of reason and the beauty of action.

295
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:45,294
Although they aim for the same goal, they differ in this way: the explanation I presented here shows that God, even from the substance of a sinful Virgin, ought to produce a righteous offspring, indeed only a righteous one, because sin exists in human nature only through will, and there is no reason to oppose such propagation.

296
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:53,583
The other explanation proves that even if there were sin in the entire essence of the Virgin, she could still be made pure through faith for such a conception.

297
00:36:53,583 --> 00:37:03,227
Moreover, in this explanation, all necessity of death and any corruption or toil are clearly excluded from that man; while in the other, a question seems to arise about this very point.

298
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:06,877
But it is resolved with sufficient reasoning, if carefully considered.

299
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:13,967
Therefore, from both explanations, it is clear that our Lord and Redeemer endured nothing in all that he suffered except by a holy will.

300
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,550
Born of a Virgin, He possessed original righteousness instead of original sin.

301
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:29,663
As I see it, it has been clearly shown, as I intended, that original sin could not possibly be passed down from parents to someone conceived by a Virgin; rather, by nature, He had to be just and blessed.

302
00:37:29,663 --> 00:37:38,149
Therefore, since He was born just from a just Father in His divine nature, and from a just mother in His human nature, He was just from the very beginning.

303
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:46,251
It's fitting to say that instead of the original injustice that all other children of Adam have, He possessed original righteousness from the start.

304
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,336
Chapter Twenty-One

305
00:37:48,336 --> 00:37:50,577
Why He Could Not Have Personal Injustice.

306
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:55,880
It's unnecessary to discuss personal injustice in His case because it simply didn't apply to Him.

307
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,589
Human nature was never separate from the divine in Him, nor was His soul ever burdened against His will or constrained by a corruptible body.

308
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:08,564
This soul, being both the whole man and the Word of God, always existed as a single person.

309
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:13,812
He was never without perfect justice, wisdom, and power, which He possessed from Himself as God.

310
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:17,147
While in human form, He received what He had from the divine.

311
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:26,496
I do not deny that there might be another reason, higher than this one, for how God took on human form from a sinful mass without sin, like unleavened bread from leavened.

312
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:31,853
Besides the one I've presented here, and the one mentioned elsewhere in Book Two, Chapter Sixteen.

313
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:40,218
If another reason is shown to me, I will gladly accept it, and if it can be demonstrated that mine could go against the truth, I will not hold onto them.

314
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,624
Chapter Twenty-Two

315
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:44,168
On the Extent of Original Sin.

316
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:47,464
Original sin cannot be greater or less than what I've described.

317
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:53,694
Since an infant is already rational, human nature doesn't have the justice that was given to Adam and should always have.

318
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:57,916
It's not excused by the inability to have it, as discussed earlier in chapter two.

319
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:01,263
However, I don't consider it as severe as I previously indicated.

320
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:12,231
When I aimed to show that it doesn't apply to the man conceived from the Virgin, I presented it in such a way that nothing could be added, ensuring I didn't seem to downplay its importance during my investigation.

321
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:14,600
Now, I'll briefly explain my thoughts on this.

322
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:26,082
I don't believe Adam's sin is passed to infants in a way that they should be punished for it as if they personally committed it, like Adam did, even though it results in none being born without sin, leading to condemnation.

323
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:44,568
When the Apostle says that death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who didn't sin like Adam did, as stated in Romans Chapter Five, Verse Fourteen, it seems to clearly indicate that Adam's transgression isn't personally imputed to them, even though he states that all children of Adam, except the Son of the Virgin, are sinners and children of wrath.

324
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:54,351
When he says, even over those who didn't sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression, it can be understood as saying, and even over those who didn't sin as much as Adam did by transgressing.

325
00:39:54,351 --> 00:40:05,834
And when he says, but the law came in, so that the offense might abound, as mentioned in Romans Chapter Five, Verse Twenty, we understand that sin before the law, in those who didn't sin like Adam, was less than Adam's sin.

326
00:40:05,834 --> 00:40:20,457
Or if it wasn't less, sin increased in them after the law beyond Adam's sin, which I can't comprehend when I consider it, regarding the weight and satisfaction in Cur Deus Homo, which I've explained as it seemed to me, as you've already read in Book One, Chapters Nineteen and Twenty.

327
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:32,618
It's true that no one can return to the purpose for which humans were created, nor can they be rescued from the evils into which human nature has fallen, without addressing the sin that caused these evils in the first place.

328
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:39,037
Someone might ask: If individuals don't bear Adam's sin, how can you say that no one is saved without addressing Adam's sin?

329
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,194
How does a just God demand payment for a sin they don't have?

330
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:46,076
To that, I say: God doesn't demand more from any sinner than what they owe.

331
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:53,840
But since no one can repay what they owe, Christ alone repays on behalf of all who are saved and more than they owe, as I've already mentioned before.

332
00:40:54,048 --> 00:40:56,016
Chapter Twenty-Three

333
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,105
Why and How Sin Passes Down to Infants.

334
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:04,641
We need to look at why sin is less in infants than it was in Adam, even though it has descended from him to everyone else.

335
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:07,909
Through Adam, sin entered the world, and with sin came death.

336
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:12,034
Understanding why it is less requires us to understand why and how it exists.

337
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:17,821
This has been mentioned before to the extent necessary for the topic, but it's worth briefly repeating here.

338
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:24,142
It's undeniable that infants were in Adam when he sinned, but they were there in a causal or material way, like seeds.

339
00:41:24,142 --> 00:41:30,464
They are personally themselves, since in him they were the seed itself; in themselves, they are different individuals.

340
00:41:30,464 --> 00:41:35,233
In Adam, they were not distinct from him, but in themselves, they are different from him.

341
00:41:35,233 --> 00:41:38,554
So, in him, they were him; in themselves, they are themselves.

342
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:43,751
Therefore, they were in him, but not yet themselves, because they were not yet individual beings.

343
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:49,216
Some might argue that saying others were in Adam is meaningless and shouldn't be considered existence.

344
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:56,288
If so, they should also claim that Christ being in Abraham, in David, and in other ancestors, according to the seed, is meaningless.

345
00:41:56,288 --> 00:42:00,199
And that God did nothing when He created all things from seeds initially.

346
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:03,467
But if it were not true, these things we see would not exist.

347
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:09,521
If it weren't true that what nature creates from seeds was first something in them, they wouldn't come from them.

348
00:42:09,521 --> 00:42:15,682
It's foolish to deny this; therefore, it was not meaningless but true and substantial that all humans were in Adam.

349
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:25,325
God did not make something empty when He made them to be in him; as was said, in him they were not different from him, and therefore very different from how they are in themselves.

350
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:31,969
However, although it's clear they were all in him, the Son of the Virgin was in him in a very different way from the others.

351
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,523
All others were within him such that, by the nature of propagation-which was subject to his power and will-they came from him.

352
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:50,436
However, this one was not within him in a way that, by his nature or will, he would originate from him, because after Adam sinned, it was determined that he would be the source from which others would arise.

353
00:42:50,436 --> 00:43:00,401
From this individual, there was a difference; he was to be what he was meant to be, not so that he would originate from him, because it wasn't within his power to be propagated in that way.

354
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:04,566
Nor was it within his capacity to be made from another essence or from nothing.

355
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:07,097
Thus, it wasn't within him to exist in any form.

356
00:43:07,097 --> 00:43:11,209
It was neither in the power of his nature nor his will to exist in any manner.

357
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:16,692
Yet, the nature from which he was to be propagated was within him, not by his power, but by God's power.

358
00:43:16,692 --> 00:43:31,085
Even though up to the Virgin mother, both will and nature played roles in the parents' creation, bringing her forth partly through natural and voluntary means from Adam, like everyone else, neither did the creature's will produce offspring, nor did nature germinate in her.

359
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:36,621
Instead, the Holy Spirit and the power of the Most High miraculously created a man from the Virgin woman.

360
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:48,589
Therefore, he was in Adam, in that others were to come from him, but he was not in him in any way to be; just as he was not in the clay from which the first man was miraculously made, nor in the man for Eve to be made from him.

361
00:43:48,589 --> 00:44:04,248
He wasn't in any of those from Adam to Mary in such a way to be; however, he was in them because it was from them he was to be assumed, just as he was in the clay from which the first man was made, and in him from whom Eve was made, not by the creature's will or power, but by divine virtue alone.

362
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:10,416
But this one was in a much more miraculous and greater grace; while they were pure humans, this one was made God-man.

363
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:17,007
So, this one was in Adam in a very different way when he sinned than those who are procreated by voluntary and natural means.

364
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,843
In a sense, he creates those who are Adam, whom human will brings into being through the power given, and nature nurtures by birth.

365
00:44:24,843 --> 00:44:31,386
However, this one was made solely by God, though from Adam: not through Adam, but by His own power, as if from Himself.

366
00:44:31,386 --> 00:44:42,768
What could better demonstrate the greatness of God's goodness and the fullness of grace given to Adam than the fact that those under his influence were such that what he was by nature, they were through him?

367
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:49,917
Likewise, it was in his free will that, just as he was in righteousness and happiness, he could propagate these qualities to them.

368
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,511
This was thus granted to him.

369
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:58,824
Since he was placed in the heights of such great grace, he willingly abandoned the good he had received to keep for himself and them.

370
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:05,368
Consequently, the children lost what the father could have given by maintaining it, but he took away by not keeping it.

371
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:10,646
This, in my view, is a sufficient reason why Adam's sin and its consequences descend to infants.

372
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:18,455
If we set aside our biases, which often hinder our understanding of justice, and consider justice itself more carefully, this becomes clearer.

373
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:22,194
Now, I'll briefly explain how the same sin seems to descend to them.

374
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:26,648
There is sin from nature, as I mentioned in chapter one, and sin from the person.

375
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:33,136
Therefore, what is from the person can be called personal; but what is from nature is natural, also known as original.

376
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:38,250
Just as the personal influences nature, so does the natural affect the person in this manner.

377
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,824
What Adam ate was required by nature, as it was created to do so.

378
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:47,762
But eating from the forbidden tree was not natural; it was a personal choice, his own will that led to this.

379
00:45:47,762 --> 00:45:50,622
Yet what the person did was not done without nature.

380
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:58,100
For the person was Adam, and nature was man; therefore, the person caused nature to become sinful, because when Adam sinned, man sinned.

381
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:07,447
Indeed, it wasn't because he was human that he presumed to eat the forbidden fruit; rather, it was by his own will, which nature did not require but the person conceived.

382
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:10,362
Similarly, this occurs in infants, albeit in reverse.

383
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:21,112
Indeed, the absence of justice in them, which they should have, isn't because of their own will, like it was with Adam, but rather due to a natural deficiency inherited from Adam.

384
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,711
In Adam, who was the only one of his kind, justice was taken away.

385
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:32,836
This is always lacking unless supported, because nature exists in people and people cannot exist without nature, making the nature of infants sinful.

386
00:46:32,836 --> 00:46:35,453
Thus, Adam's actions deprived nature of justice.

387
00:46:35,453 --> 00:46:41,615
As a result, nature, now lacking, causes all people it produces to be sinful and unjust with the same deficiency.

388
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:47,995
In this way, Adam's personal sin is passed on to all his natural descendants, making it original or inherent in them.

389
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:58,519
Hence, it's clear there is a significant difference between Adam's sin and theirs, because he sinned by his own choice; they sin out of a natural necessity, which his own actions brought about.

390
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:13,678
However, although no one doubts that different sins don't receive equal punishment, in this aspect, the condemnation of both personal and original sin is similar, because no one is welcomed into the kingdom of God, for which humans were made, except through the death of Christ.

391
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:19,785
Without this, what is owed for Adam's sin isn't repaid, even though not everyone deserves equal torment in hell.

392
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:25,783
For after the day of judgment, there will be no angel or human except in either the kingdom of God or in hell.

393
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:34,780
Therefore, the sin of infants is less than Adam's sin; yet no one is saved without that universal satisfaction, through which both large and small sins are forgiven.

394
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:42,960
Why it must be through that death, and how salvation comes from it, I have explored and explained in the aforementioned book, as God enabled me to do.

395
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,528
Chapter Twenty-Four

396
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:49,884
That the sins of parents after Adam are not counted as original sin in their children.

397
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:54,646
I don't believe that the sins of our parents contribute to the original sin of their children.

398
00:47:54,646 --> 00:48:00,724
If Adam couldn't pass on his righteousness to his descendants, he certainly couldn't pass on his unrighteousness either.

399
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:09,690
Since no one after Adam has been able to preserve their righteousness for their children, there's no reason to think that the sins of parents affect the souls of their children.

400
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:14,097
Furthermore, it's clear that infants don't have a sense of right will for its own sake.

401
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:18,758
In this way, they are all equally unjust because they lack the justice everyone should have.

402
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:22,861
This lack of justice has been passed down from Adam, who lost it in human nature.

403
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:31,979
Even if Adam retained some justice-meaning human nature allowed him to maintain a right will in some aspects-he was deprived of the ability to pass this justice to his descendants.

404
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:34,208
So, it cannot be inherited with any justice.

405
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:40,337
Therefore, infants can't lose more than all justice and happiness, which isn't given to anyone lacking necessary justice.

406
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:45,403
It seems impossible for the injustice of parents to increase this lack in infants beyond Adam's sin.

407
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,885
Where there's no justice, none can be taken away.

408
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,620
Where no justice is absent, no injustice can be added.

409
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,990
Thus, unjust parents can't add any more injustice to their infants beyond the existing absence of justice.

410
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,549
However, where there's no justice, there's nothing stopping some justice from being added.

411
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:08,096
It seems more reasonable that if unjust parents could add injustice to their infants, then just parents might be able to give some justice to theirs.

412
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:11,693
If this happens, the children of the just have some measure of justice.

413
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:22,157
If this is true, then unbaptized babies of righteous parents are punished less than those of unrighteous parents, or if they are saved, they are chosen based on some prior merit of their own.

414
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:30,143
But the Apostle Paul denies this in Romans 5, where he uses the example of Jacob and Esau to show that no one is saved without grace coming before any merits.

415
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:38,128
Since righteous parents do not give any justice to their babies before baptism, it follows that unrighteous parents do not add any injustice to theirs either.

416
00:49:38,128 --> 00:50:48,280
If someone says, "Unrighteous parents do not add any injustice to their children," because they cannot remove any justice from them, then they must believe that the original sin they have from Adam becomes heavier in those children. But if that is true, then righteous parents should be able to make it lighter in theirs. So, if the babies of righteous parents are less unjust than those of unrighteous parents, they should be less condemned than those others. But let the one who dares to say this also try to prove it.
As for me, I do not dare say it, because I see that both the babies of righteous and unrighteous parents are sometimes chosen for baptismal grace and sometimes not. And even if someone does say this, they cannot prove it. Just as no one is more righteous than another unless they more willingly choose what is good or avoid what is evil, so too no one is more unjust than another unless they more willingly love or despise what they should not.
So, if babies cannot be shown, right when they gain a soul, to will more or less of what they should or should not, then no one can prove that one baby is born more just or more unjust than another. Therefore, it seems that righteous parents do not actually make original sin lighter in their children through their own righteousness, nor do unrighteous parents make it heavier in theirs through their own unrighteousness.

417
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:57,995
So, if unjust parents can't increase original sin in their children through their own sins, it seems to me that the sins of parents, after Adam, impact their children's good merits.

418
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:03,015
The good deeds of parents bring many significant benefits to their children's bodies and souls.

419
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:10,887
Due to the parents' sins, children and grandchildren face various hardships in life up to the third and fourth generations, and perhaps even further.

420
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:17,228
They might miss out on good things, even spiritually, that they could have achieved if their parents had been righteous.

421
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:20,398
Giving examples of this would take too long to include here.

422
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:29,063
But I believe that original sin is naturally the same for all infants conceived, just as Adam's sin, which causes them to be born into it, affects everyone equally.

423
00:51:29,328 --> 00:51:31,368
Chapter Twenty-Five

424
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:34,381
How the sins of parents can harm the souls of their children.

425
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:45,593
If the sins of parents sometimes harm the souls of their children, I believe it happens like this:
It's not that God holds the children accountable for their parents' sins or leads them into wrongdoing because of their parents.

426
00:51:45,593 --> 00:51:54,484
Rather, just as children are often saved from sins by the merits of their righteous parents, they are also sometimes left to their own devices due to the merits of their ancestors.

427
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:56,954
No one is free from sin unless God sets them free.

428
00:51:56,954 --> 00:52:03,918
When He doesn't set them free, it's said that He is leading them into sin, and when He doesn't soften their hearts, it's said to harden them.

429
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:10,982
It seems quite reasonable that God might leave a sinful soul, to whom He owes nothing but punishment, in its sins because of the parents' sins.

430
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:17,502
This allows it to be punished for its own actions, rather than burdening it with someone else's sins for which it would be tortured.

431
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:29,011
Thus, without contradiction, original sin is the same in everyone:
The son does not bear the iniquity of the father; each person carries their own burden and receives according to what they have done in the body, whether good or bad.

432
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:34,938
God repays the sins of the parents to the children to the third and fourth generation, even if this applies to the soul.

433
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:39,680
Clearly, the soul of the child does not die because of the father's sin, but because of its own.

434
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,286
No one bears the father's iniquity when left to their own, but their own.

435
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,953
They don't carry someone else's burden, but their own.

436
00:52:45,953 --> 00:52:51,584
Nor do they receive according to what the father did, but according to what they themselves have done in the body.

437
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:59,141
However, because they are not freed from their own evils due to the parents' sins, the burdens they carry are attributed to the same sins of the parents.

438
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:01,800
Chapter Twenty-Six

439
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,793
How no one bears the sin of their father, but their own.

440
00:53:04,793 --> 00:53:12,810
If someone argues that all who aren't saved through faith in Christ bear Adam's iniquity, consider that infants do not bear Adam's sin, but their own.

441
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,605
Adam's sin and the sin of infants are different; they are not the same.

442
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:22,806
Adam's sin was the cause, while the infants' sin is the effect; Adam lacked justice because he abandoned it himself.

443
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:28,257
Infants lack it not because of their own actions, but because someone else, namely Adam, abandoned it.

444
00:53:28,257 --> 00:53:30,823
So, Adam's sin and that of infants are distinct.

445
00:53:30,823 --> 00:54:13,263
When the apostle in Romans Five: Fourteen says, "Because death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression," it suggests that the sin of infants is less than Adam's.
This clearly indicates they are different.
Therefore, when an infant is condemned for original sin, it's not for Adam's sin but for their own.
If they didn't have their own sin, they wouldn't be condemned.
Thus, they bear not Adam's iniquity but their own, though it's said they bear it because Adam's sin was the cause.
This cause in Adam, which means infants are born in sin, doesn't exist in other parents because human nature lacks the same power for righteous children to be born.
Thus, infants don't have sin because of their parents' sin as they do with Adam's sin.

446
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,624
Chapter Twenty-Seven

447
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:18,766
What original sin is, and how it is equal in everyone.

448
00:54:18,766 --> 00:54:24,468
I understand original sin to be simply what exists in an infant as soon as it has a rational soul.

449
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:33,371
Whatever might have happened to the body before it was animated, like any physical corruption, or whatever happens afterward, either in the soul or body.

450
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:41,051
For these reasons, I believe it is the same in all naturally born infants, and all who die with only that sin are equally condemned.

451
00:54:41,051 --> 00:54:43,728
Indeed, any sin added beyond that is personal.

452
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:49,663
Just as a person is born a sinner by nature, the nature itself becomes more sinful through the person.

453
00:54:49,663 --> 00:54:52,223
Because when any person sins, humanity sins.

454
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:58,100
This sin, which I call original, is nothing more in those infants than the state I described earlier.

455
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:03,104
It is caused by Adam's disobedience to rightful justice, making all children of wrath.

456
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:07,294
It accuses the spontaneous nature created in Adam of abandoning justice.

457
00:55:07,294 --> 00:55:15,324
Nor does it excuse individuals, as mentioned in chapter two, from the inability to recover, which is accompanied by a lack of blessedness.

458
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:19,920
So just as they are without all justice, they are also without all blessedness.

459
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:28,474
Through these two lacks, they are exposed in this life's exile, vulnerable to sins and miseries that occur constantly and overwhelm from all sides.

460
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:31,907
Except insofar as they are protected by divine arrangement.

461
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:34,584
Chapter Twenty-Eight

462
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:37,438
Against those who think infants should not be condemned.

463
00:55:37,438 --> 00:55:41,566
Some people believe that infants who die without baptism should not be condemned.

464
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:46,662
This belief comes from the idea of injustice, as no one holds infants accountable for another's sin.

465
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:53,696
Given their age, they lack righteousness and understanding, making it seem unreasonable for God to judge them more harshly than humans do.

466
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:59,455
To these people, it's important to explain that God's expectations of infants are different from those of humans.

467
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:04,093
Humans should not demand from nature what they have not given and what is not owed to them.

468
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:10,820
It's not just for a human to blame another for being born with a fault they themselves cannot escape, except through another's help.

469
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,815
However, God has the right to demand from nature what He has given and what is justly owed to Him.

470
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:20,402
Even the judgment whereby infants are condemned is not very different from human judgment.

471
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:29,066
Imagine a scenario where a man and his wife, elevated to great dignity and status through no merit of their own but purely by grace, commit a grave and inexcusable crime.

472
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:31,666
They are justly cast down and reduced to servitude.

473
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:42,012
Who would argue that the children born to them after their condemnation should not be subject to the same servitude but should instead be freely restored to the privileges their parents justly forfeited?

474
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:49,962
This is similar to the first parents and their descendants, who, justly condemned from bliss to misery for their fault, continue to beget in the same exile.

475
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:56,231
Therefore, a similar judgment applies to similar cases, although more strictly, the more improbable their offense may seem.

476
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:58,831
Finally, every person is either saved or condemned.

477
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:04,335
Those who are saved are admitted to the kingdom of heaven, and those who are condemned are excluded from it.

478
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:09,228
Whoever is admitted is elevated to the likeness of angels, who have never sinned and never will.

479
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:12,744
This transformation cannot occur as long as any stain of sin remains.

480
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:17,586
Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to be saved while carrying any sin, no matter how minor.

481
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:29,040
So, if what I mentioned is true-that original sin is indeed a sin-then it's essential to understand that every person born with it, unless forgiven, will face condemnation.

482
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,056
Chapter Twenty-Nine

483
00:57:31,056 --> 00:57:34,717
How the inability to have righteousness excuses them after baptism.

484
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:39,853
I mentioned that the inability to have righteousness does not excuse the injustice of infants.

485
00:57:39,853 --> 00:58:02,367
Someone might then ask: if sin, which is injustice, exists in an infant before baptism, and the inability to have righteousness is not excused, as you say, and sin is only forgiven in baptism if it existed before; then how, after baptism, is the infant not unjust even though they cannot understand the righteousness they should uphold, since righteousness is the uprightness of will maintained for its own sake?

486
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:20,837
If a baptized infant dies in infancy, not immediately after baptism, and they do not yet know how to repent, since they do not have the righteousness they owe and are not excused by inability, they pass from this life unjustly, as they would before baptism, and are not admitted to the kingdom, which the Catholic Church does not believe.

487
00:58:20,837 --> 00:58:27,231
But if in baptism the sin of future infancy is forgiven for infants, why would this not apply to those in later ages?

488
00:58:27,231 --> 00:58:32,204
To this, I respond that in baptism, sins that existed before baptism are completely erased.

489
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:39,799
Therefore, the original inability to have righteousness is no longer counted as sin against those who have been baptized, as it was before.

490
00:58:39,799 --> 00:58:51,002
Just as the inability to have righteousness could not excuse the absence of righteousness before, since it was itself at fault, after baptism it completely excuses it, because it remains without any fault.

491
00:58:51,002 --> 00:58:57,341
Thus, the righteousness owed by infants before baptism is not demanded from them after baptism as if it were a debt.

492
00:58:57,341 --> 00:59:05,483
So, as long as they lack righteousness due only to original inability, they are not unjust, because the absence of owed righteousness is not in them.

493
00:59:05,483 --> 00:59:08,925
Indeed, it is not owed when it is impossible without any fault.

494
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:23,734
Therefore, if those who are not unjust die in this state, they are not condemned, but rather saved by the righteousness of Christ, who gave himself for them, and by the righteousness of the faith of the Mother Church, which believes on their behalf, as if they were just.

495
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:28,134
I've shared my thoughts on original sin based on my own understanding.

496
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:33,833
I'm not making definitive claims, just offering my perspective until God reveals something clearer to me.

497
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:38,771
If someone has a different view, I respect their opinion, as long as it can be proven true.
