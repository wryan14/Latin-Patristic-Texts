Dispute Between a Monk and a Cleric: Whether a Monk May Preach. Written by Lord Rupert, Abbot of Deutz.

The Monk speaks: You act unjustly by resisting me to my face and shutting my mouth so that I dare not open it in the midst of the Church to proclaim God's word. Tell me finally, by what authority do you think you can silence me?
The Cleric responds: I will tell you, and I will prove by reason of equity that I do not act unjustly. First, because when you profess to be a monk, you confess that you are dead. For he is not a monk who is not dead to the world. But how can a man be dead whose voice is heard outside? Therefore, he is not a monk who, by the very noise of his preaching, proves himself to be alive to the world.
The Monk replies: You have struck me forcefully and cleverly, as you think. But now I turn this very weapon you hurled at me back against you. For I say: you too are dead. Indeed, the Apostle says both to you and to me, in his letter to the Colossians, chapter three: You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. Do you think this is said only to monks?
Were all the Colossians, and others to whom he wrote, monks? Or does he say this about the death of monastic profession, and not rather about the death of baptism? For he says in his letter to the Romans, chapter six: All of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death, buried with him through baptism into death, and so on.
Either you too, being thus dead, be silent about the word of life, or allow me, dead along with you, one dead man with another, to put to death those who still live for the world.
The Cleric answers: I will not do so. I will never grant that this is permitted to you. The sacred canons forbid it, and authoritative writers deny it. For Pope Pius decrees that a monk may not dare to preach, however great his learning may be. And Jerome says that a monk does not have the office of teaching, but of mourning.
The Monk responds: Cleric, you read Scripture with open mouth but closed eyes. For if Jerome's words are taken as you understand them, it follows that Jerome himself is too greatly contradicting himself. You cast Pius himself against his own opinion, that a monk may not dare to preach regardless of his learning
when the apostolic see has admitted blessed Gregory, shining in monastic habit, and very many other men of this order, to the office of apostolic dignity, which it continues to do even to this day.
And Jerome, who says that a monk does not have the office of teaching but of mourning, is himself a monk when he says this very thing in his teaching office, and throughout his entire life, not only by teaching but also by writing lasting doctrine, he deserves to be counted among the greatest teachers.
Did you not know that Jerome, whose opinion you have as your patron, was a monk? I should not be surprised, then, that you babble so foolishly against monks, since you are so inexperienced in sacred letters that you are astonished and amazed to hear that Jerome and Gregory, and the other stars of the heavenly palace, were monks.
The Cleric asks: How then is either of them not contradicting himself, when he does what he says is foreign to the office of monks? Tell me, how then do I read Scripture with closed eyes? What else have you found in such clear statements by which you can correct my understanding, provided that you do not, by your presumption, do violence to Scripture?
The Monk says: I will do so, if you will first answer a few questions for me.
The Cleric responds: Ask as you wish.

The Monk asks: You who are a defender of clerics and such a vehement opponent of monks, who glory in your clerical status and are propped up and elevated by this profession above the monk, do you know why you are called a cleric, and what the clerical state is?

The Cleric asks: Are you asking for the etymology of this name, which is cleric?
The Monk responds: That is indeed easy to explain. For a cleric is called one chosen by lot. I want more than that. I am asking you about the reality itself that is signified by this name, which is the clerical state. Why do you hesitate? Either speak, or if you cannot, listen.
The Cleric says: I am listening.
The Monk explains: The clerical state is not your knowledge of letters, not your tonsure or your habit, but the office of the altar. And it is reckoned by this name because, when in the old law the Lord divided the land among the tribes of Israel by lot, as it says in Psalm seventy-seven, in the cord of distribution, the tribe of Levi, which was to minister in the sanctuary, received no lot other than the Lord himself, that is, the altar of the Lord
namely, that serving the altar, it should live from the altar. Therefore, clerics are whoever serve the altar, and the clerical state signifies nothing other than the office of the altar.
The Cleric says: I accept this.
The Monk continues: Therefore it must be granted that you are called or are a cleric for no other reason than that you perform the orders of the altar.
The Cleric says: I concede this.
The Monk replies: But I also perform these same orders. Indeed, with the authority of my Rule, I have performed the priesthood. And perhaps while you are still only reading the Gospel, I am already celebrating masses.
The Cleric says: I cannot deny it.
The Monk concludes: Therefore I too am a cleric.
The Cleric responds: Wait. Are you not then a monk?
The Monk answers: Nevertheless I am. To you indeed these seem opposed, namely the monastic state and the clerical state, and your eye, which does not look equally upon monks, dreams that they cannot exist together.
But they are indeed different, and therefore each can exist without the other, as in you or in that man the clerical state exists without the monastic state; likewise, in any lay convert, the monastic state exists without the clerical state.
I do not deny that you are equal to him according to the authority of the canons, which prescribe the same manner of penance for a monk who has no orders, if he falls into crime, as for a cleric who is of the Levitical order.
But I, who with the splendor of the monastic order also perform the honor of the priestly and Levitical order, do not allow you to seem in any way equal to me. For as someone very truly says: Mary was a virgin, and John was a virgin. But the proportion is greater in Mary, because John was only a virgin. But Mary was both mother and virgin
so indeed the proportion is greater in me than in you. For you are only a cleric, but I am both monk and cleric. These are different, I say, as I had begun to say, but not contrary, since they exist together in the same person.
Now you grasp what has been established, namely that I, who am a monk, am also a cleric, because I have performed the orders of the sacred altar.
The Cleric says: I cannot deny it.
The Monk continues: But you, from the fact that you are a cleric, ascribe to yourself the authority of preaching.
The Cleric says: And this is so.
The Monk concludes: Therefore you cannot take away from me this very right of preaching without doing me an injustice.
The Cleric responds: I would like to do so, but because I am trapped, unless I break the chain of this argument, I will not be able to accomplish anything.
The Monk says: Now in the meantime the proposition must be carried through.
The Cleric asks: What proposition?
The Monk answers: The one for which these things have been established.
The Cleric asks: What is that?
The Monk explains: Namely, that it may appear how Jerome the teacher, though he is a monk, is not contradicting himself when he says that a monk does not have the office of teaching, but of mourning, and so forth.
The Cleric says: Go on, argue as you wish.

The Monk begins: First, it must be known that these words were spoken against the blasphemies of Vigilantius, in defense of those who, abandoning the world and giving all their possessions to the poor, embraced the solitary life.

Concerning them, Jerome says a little earlier: Nor are monks to be deterred from their purpose by your viperous tongues and most savage bites, by which you argue and say: If everyone shuts themselves away and lives in solitude, who will celebrate in the churches, who will win secular men for Christ?
And a little later: A monk does not have the office of teacher, but of one who mourns. And these things were indeed said about the life of monks only.
However, in his letter to Nepotian, he writes about the life of monks and clerics, that is, of those who are both monks and clerics at the same time.
The Cleric objects: Wait, you are expounding this title perversely according to your own understanding.
The Monk asks: How am I perverse?
The Cleric says: It should not be taken that way.
The Monk responds: How then? Do you think that he proposes to write one rule for monks here, and another rule for clerics there? Read what follows with eyes that are not drowsy, and you will find it as I said.
For Nepotian, to whom or for whose sake he writes, is one and the same person, both monk and cleric at once. For he says to him after some remarks: I know indeed that from your uncle, blessed Heliodorus, who is now a bishop of Christ, you have learned what things are holy, and daily learn them, and that you have the pattern of his life as an example of virtues.
But also receive my offerings, whatever they may be, and join this little book to his, so that, when he has instructed you as a monk, this may teach you to be a perfect cleric. Thus beginning, he instructs in this one Nepotian how those should conduct themselves who belong to both orders, that is, the clerical and the monastic.
For example, as he says later, because of the office of the clerical state, either a widow or a virgin is visited. Therefore that letter is so titled, On the Life of Clerics or Monks, of whom, as he himself says in the same letter, both the priesthood is adorned by their purpose, and their purpose is adorned by the priesthood.
But to one who is only a monk, and who loses even that, those words of the letter which he wrote to Heliodorus are addressed.
The Cleric asks: From where do you gather this?
The Monk answers: From the words of that letter itself. For when he was reproaching him because he was in a crowd on account of affection for his parents and expectation of an inheritance, and was saying to him, What are you doing in a crowd, you who are alone?, after some remarks he adds: If the pious blandishments of the brothers incite you to the order of the clerical state, I will rejoice at your ascent, but I will fear your fall.
Indeed, when he says there: It is not permitted to me to sit before a priest, he is certainly not speaking in his own person, since he himself is a priest, but in the person of the one to whom he writes, who, since he is only a monk, has not yet deserved to attain to that order of clerics by which, as he says there, succeeding to the apostolic rank, they consecrate the body of Christ with a sacred mouth.
Likewise, that letter to Paulinus indicates that Paulinus himself was only a monk, and therefore had nothing to do in cities. For he says to him: If you wish to have the office of a priest, if the work or honor of the episcopate perhaps delights you, live in cities and towns, and make the salvation of others the profit of your soul.
Therefore Jerome is not contradicting himself, because he grants the authority of teaching not only to himself, but also to all whose priesthood is adorned by their purpose, and whose purpose is adorned by the priesthood.
Nor does the apostolic see act against its own judgment in that, while forbidding monks to preach, it nevertheless admits monks to the office of apostolic dignity. When you open your mouth to speak, first, I beg you, open your eyes to read.
The Cleric asks: Are you speaking angrily?
The Monk responds: Rather, I have been zealous with zeal for the house of the Lord. You rather, because you are defeated, are angry, and because you are running out of arguments, you burst into insults. But please, endure a little while. There is still one thing that I do not allow you to be ignorant of.
The Cleric asks: What is that?

The Monk asks: Why does the authority of the apostolic see, or the aforementioned opinion of Jerome, exclude those monks who are without the clerical state from the office of preaching?

The Cleric says: Go ahead, speak as much as you wish, since you have begun to bring forth wonderful and unexpected things.
The Monk replies: Wonderful indeed and great. Yet to whom these things seem wonderful or great is neither great nor wonderful himself, because he bears witness to himself that he has made little progress in the Scriptures.
The Cleric says: Tell me at last whatever it is.
The Monk explains: The Apostle, speaking about preachers, says in his letter to the Romans, chapter six: How shall they preach unless they are sent? Clearly a preacher should not presume the office of preaching from himself. But, as Christ says in the Gospel of John, chapter twenty: As the Father has sent me, so I send you.
The Father sends Christ, Christ sends the apostles, the apostles send archbishops, archbishops send bishops, bishops send priests, namely when they ordain them. But the monk is exempt from this sending when he has not yet performed sacred orders. How then shall he preach?
