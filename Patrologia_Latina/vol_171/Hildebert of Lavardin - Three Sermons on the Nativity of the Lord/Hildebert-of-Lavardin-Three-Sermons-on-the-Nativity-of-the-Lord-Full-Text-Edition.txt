First Sermon on the Nativity of the Lord: Concerning the Birth of the Lord

As Scripture says: Our assumption belongs to the Lord, even the Holy One of Israel, our King. This comes from Psalm eighty-eight, verse nineteen.
The Lord of lords, the King of kings, whose name is Almighty, did not spurn or disdain fellowship with human weakness. As the Apostle says in Paul's letter to the Hebrews, chapter two, verse sixteen: He took hold of the seed of Abraham, not of angels.
This dignity was not given to angelic nature, that God should be joined to it in one person. Rather, he took flesh from Abraham in order to save his children.
Hence Isaiah says in chapter sixty-five, verse nine: I will bring forth offspring from Jacob, and from Judah one who shall possess my highest mountains, and my chosen ones shall inherit it; there my servants shall dwell.
This is the promised seed of Abraham, to whom the Lord said in the book of Genesis, chapter twenty-two, verse eighteen: In your seed all nations shall be blessed.
This is Christ, called the seed of Abraham because he took hold of Abraham's seed. He did not bring flesh with him from heaven, nor did he fashion new flesh from some other source. Rather, from the common mass of human corruption, he assumed a cloud of sanctification, becoming a giant of two substances and two natures. In him is shown forth the dignity of human nature, the mercy and grace of God by which he deigned to do this, and the care he had for us.
For human nature was fleeing before him, fleeing far away—indeed, salvation is far from sinners—yet he pursued and took hold of it. Because this is great and wonderful and full of amazement, he so exalted the weakness of our flesh that it might be joined to the Word of the Father in unity of person.
This is the woman who, as the Gospel parable recounts, lit a lamp and found the coin that had been lost by sweeping the house. For when man was lost in the first father, who was the origin of perdition, and we became the offspring of that father, divine wisdom sought to find the lost coin—that is, to find man stamped with the name and image of the King. Wisdom lit the lamp, that is, placed light in an earthen vessel, because she kindled the vessel of human weakness with the light of divinity.
And when the house was swept—that is, when the world lying in wickedness was changed for the better by the right hand of the Most High—the coin was found, and that prodigal son who had perished was found returning to his father from a distant land.
The laws of nature are dissolved when God becomes human, and here man is deified, where one born of a mother is begotten without a father.
Therefore let the heavens rejoice and let the earth exult, because our nature has been joined to the Word. What is on earth and what is in heaven has been restored, and peace has been given to humanity on earth, glory has been made to God in the highest, while the losses from the angelic fall are being repaired.
Hence the angels sing, as recorded in the Gospel of Luke, chapter two, verse fourteen: Glory to God in the highest. For they glorify God for the restoration of their diminished number. They praise God for the reconciliation of nature, by which all things have been accomplished, because the kindness and humanity of God our Savior has appeared—that is, God appeared as kind and made human when he came to seek and save what was lost.
The Son of the Father alone—not the Father himself, nor the Holy Spirit—took on flesh. For God who created the world in his wisdom, according to the word in Psalm one hundred three, verse twenty-four: Lord, you have made all things in wisdom—in order that he might save what is in heaven and on earth, the Son was sent to the world, not the Father or the Holy Spirit, so that the Son would not be one person in divinity and another in humanity.
And lest the Father and Son be the same person—which would happen if God the Father were born of a human—in the great council and ineffable wisdom of God, it was not the Father who took on flesh, nor the Holy Spirit, but the Son alone. Thus he who was the Son of God in divinity would himself become the Son of Man in humanity. Born for the sake of truth, he would be born from a human as the son of man, so that the truth of his being begotten would not rest on adoption or mere designation, but that he would have the name of Son in both nativities by actually being born.
Marveling at both of his births, Isaiah, struck with awe at depths beyond what can be expressed and astonished beyond the height of the abyss, says in chapter sixty-six, verses seven and eight: Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before her pain came upon her, she delivered a male child. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen anything like this?
The mind fails, the voice falls silent. The same prophet says elsewhere in chapter fifty-three, verse eight: Who can declare his generation?
This should be understood not only of his eternal generation, but also of his temporal birth.
For even John, sanctified from the womb, than whom none greater has arisen among those born of women, showed himself weak when it came to explaining the incomparable generation, saying in the Gospel of John, chapter one, verse seventeen: One mightier than I is coming after me, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie—that is, I am not sufficient to open the binding of the mystery of the incarnation, to reveal the knot of the secret.
And rightly is the flesh called a sandal, because divinity came to us as if shod with it.
But regarding what Isaiah said—before she was in labor, she gave birth—the interpreter of truth, shaking out this covering as it were, says: Before the Virgin was in labor, God the Father gave birth, that is, begot the Son. Before her delivery came, namely Mary's, God the Father gave birth to a male child, that is, the strong Son through whom all things were made and subsist.
He is called male not because of sexual distinction, but because of the magnitude of his power, just as he is also called the arm of God, of which it is said in Psalm sixty-three, verse one: To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
Who has ever seen anything like this: that the same one was born, first from a father without a mother, and second from a mother without a father?
Do not be amazed, therefore, when we confess that even the Father gave birth, since he himself says in Isaiah chapter sixty-six, verse nine: Shall I who cause others to give birth not give birth myself?
Therefore God the Father gave birth, and the Virgin gave birth—not to two different persons, but to one and the same Son of God, of whom it is said in Isaiah chapter nine, verse six: A child is born to us, and a son is given to us.
Great and exalted is this child, whose birth is ineffable, of whom Ecclesiastes says in chapter four, verses thirteen and fourteen: Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king who does not know how to look ahead to the future; for one comes forth from prison and chains to reign, while another born in the kingdom is consumed by poverty.
This is the child chosen from thousands, of whom the Father says in Isaiah chapter forty-two, verse one, and in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twelve, verse eighteen: Behold my child whom I have chosen.
This child, though poor, has many children obedient to him, for whose sake he himself became a child. For though he was rich as God with God the Father, through whom all things were made, he became poor for our sake, so that by assuming our poverty, he might share his riches with us.
For as he impoverished himself, he enriched his members with heavenly gifts. For insofar as he is human, he was filled with the Holy Spirit, who was given to him without measure, and from his fullness we have all received.
Just as he became lowly to exalt us, and poor to give the kingdom of heaven to us who are poor in spirit, so also he became a child to make his own children, of whom Isaiah says in chapter eight, verse eighteen: Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me.
Indeed, he is often called a child in the prophets because of the privilege of purity—he who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth, who did not walk in the way of sinners, nor stand in the counsel of the wicked, nor sit in the seat of scoffers, as it says in Psalm one, verse one.
Therefore all who wish to be his disciples must become children, because, as the Gospel of Mark records in chapter nine, verse thirty-five, taking a child, he set him in their midst, saying: Whoever does not humble himself like this little child will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Hence also the first fruits of the innocent children were dedicated—those who confessed him not by speaking but by dying—so that all who wish to offer sacrifice to God might strive to be conformed to them in purity of life.
For the sake of children such as these, to free them from the hand of the destroyer, he became a child, sharing in soul and flesh, like them in suffering but not in guilt.
Hence the Apostle says in Paul's letter to the Hebrews, chapter two, verses fourteen and fifteen: Because the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise partook of the same things, so that through his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death—that is, the devil—and free those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
Indeed, another mode of our liberation was possible for God, but none was more fitting for healing our misery than this: that man who had fallen through pride should rise through humility, and that the one who had enslaved man through cunning and deceit should be conquered by man through wisdom and justice, so that just as man destroyed man, so man would free man from the hand of the devil.
For unless it were a man who conquered the devil, man who had willingly subjected himself to the devil would seem to be exalted not justly but by force. But if a mere man conquered, the devil would have destroyed man again. Therefore, for man to conquer, it is necessary that God be man, so that he cannot sin.
For if he were merely a man by himself, or an angel, he would easily sin in human form, since both natures are known to have fallen by themselves.
Therefore, because the children shared in flesh and blood—that is, humans were corruptible beings consisting of body and soul, which is understood by blood—Christ likewise partook of these same things, namely flesh and soul. And he was similar in this way, because he was capable of suffering, mortal, tested in all things according to our likeness yet without sin, as it says in Paul's letter to the Hebrews, chapter four, verse fifteen. This was so that through his death he might destroy the devil and free those who were subject to him, by blotting out the sins through which we were held captive under him.
For we had fallen into the hands of the prince of this world, who seduced Adam and made him his own, and began to possess us as though we were his household slaves.
But the Redeemer came, and the deceiver was conquered. And what did the Redeemer do to our captor? He stretched out a mousetrap for him and placed his own blood there as bait.
But the devil shed innocent blood, and then was commanded to depart from the guilty. For because he stretched out his hand against one in whom he had no rightful claim, he justly lost those over whom he seemed to have some claim.
For he held us by nothing except the chains of our own sins. These were the fetters of the captives. But the poor and wise child came and bound the strong man with the chains of his own passion.
He entered into his house—that is, into the hearts where the devil himself dwelt—and plundered his vessels, which he had filled with his own bitterness. But the child, seizing them and making them his own, poured out the bitterness and filled them with sweetness.
Therefore the child who is born is wise and good. He is certainly better than the old and foolish king.
This one is truly good, whose goodness has no measure, for whom being good and being God are not two different things, because his goodness is divine nature, and his wisdom is divine essence.
For he is the Wisdom who came forth from the mouth of the Most High, a firstborn emanation as it were of the glory of the Almighty, pure, the brightness of eternal light and the spotless mirror of the majesty of God, and the image of his goodness.
This is the child who shows not his face but his back parts, whose face shining with excessive brightness is invisible to mortal eyes, though his back parts can be seen.
Hence when Moses sought to see his face, he responded in the book of Exodus, chapter thirty-three, verse twenty and following: No one shall see my face and live. And he added: Stand in the cleft of the rock, and you shall see my back parts when I pass by.
Therefore, whoever cannot see the face of the true child, let him at least see the back parts, but in passing. The face is the brightness of divinity; the back parts are the humility of the assumption of humanity.
The face is: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, as the Gospel of John says in chapter one, verse one. The back parts are: The Word became flesh, from the same passage.
Therefore no one living in these senses of mortal flesh, however advanced—not even like Moses—can see the face of this child, that is, penetrate with the mind's intuition the mystery of the unity and Trinity.
For this is reserved for the saints in the future as glory, according to what is written in the Gospel of John, chapter seventeen, verse three: This is eternal life, that they may know you and Jesus Christ whom you have sent to be the one, only, and true God.
This is the great abundance of the sweetness of God, which he has hidden for those who fear him.
But if you cannot see the face, see the back parts by standing in the cleft of the rock when he has passed by—that is, understand the incarnation of the Word in such a way that you believe he afterward rose in glory.
For he passed through death to life, from earth to heaven, from the world to the Father.
For it is not sufficient to believe he died, which even the wicked acknowledge. Rather, one must respond to them on the path of truth by believing that he rose in power, which is what the one does who stands fixed in the cleft of the rock—that is, in faith in the passion of Christ.
For the rock was Christ, as the Apostle says in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, chapter ten, verse four. Therefore, the one who believes that God is the man who suffered stands in the cleft of the rock.
For the faith of believers regarding the passion did not consist in believing that a man suffered as it appeared, but in believing that the one who was dying was God made man.
Nor did Thomas, to whom it was said in the Gospel of John, chapter twenty, verse twenty-eight: Because you have seen me, you have believed—he did not believe what he saw. He saw a man and confessed God, saying as recorded in verse twenty-nine: My Lord and my God.
Therefore he perceived the humanity and believed the divinity. Whoever believes in this way stands in the cleft of the rock and sees the back parts of the child in his passing, from which he ascends even to the contemplation of the face.
For even though the face preceded the back parts, nevertheless one arrives not from the face to the back parts, but from the back parts to the face, so that there is progress from lesser things to higher.
These are the most ancient and the new things, which are to be eaten when the old things have been cast aside, as Moses says in Leviticus, chapter twenty-six, verse ten: You shall eat the oldest of the old, and when new comes you shall cast out the old.
There are three things here: the most ancient, the old, and the new. This child always possessed the most ancient things, began the new things, and took up the old things—that is, he sent ahead signs of the new things. The most ancient things are unchangeable, not made but making; he did the new things, he spoke the old things.
Therefore the most ancient things are the equality, co-eternity, and consubstantiality of the begotten with the begetter. The new thing is the temporal birth from the Virgin. The old things are the signs and proclamations in the Law and the Prophets of the Emmanuel who was to come.
Therefore the most ancient things are to be eaten, because those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied by understanding them, according to the verse in Psalm sixteen, verse fifteen: I shall be satisfied when your glory appears—or, your mercy.
The new things also are to be eaten, so that while we are little ones here, we may be nourished by the bread of angels—that is, converted into milk for infants.
For man ate the bread of angels, though not in the pure form in which angels enjoy it, but nevertheless in the cloud in which he chose to be seen.
Therefore when the new things arrive, the old things are to be cast aside, because when the light of truth shines forth, the signs of which are to be removed—which were like words of promise—God exists for us as promiser only until he becomes fulfiller.
When he fulfilled what was promised, he changed the word, he removed the wood. He does not say: I will give, but I have given. Nor is it said: Light will shine, but a child is born to us.
The promise ceases because the manifestation of truth occurs. The old things pass away because new things succeed them, according to what the Apostle says in Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, chapter five, verse seventeen: Therefore if anyone is a new creation in Christ, the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new for him.
For the old error has departed, because truth has sprung up from the earth. For the earth gave its fruit when Mary brought forth the good Word.
This poor and wise child is good, and certainly better than the old and foolish king who does not know how to provide for himself in the future, as Ecclesiastes says in chapter four, verse thirteen.
Who is this old and foolish king? He is understood to be the one who, by reason of his perversity, is called the prince of this world, of whom the wise child says in the Gospel of John, chapter fourteen, verse thirty: The prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on me.
And likewise in the Gospel of John, chapter twelve, verse thirty-one: Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.
He is called the prince of this world not because he was the Lord and maker of worldly creation, but because he is the prince and leader of those who love worldly things.
Therefore this king is old and foolish. He is a king because he was created in a kingdom, in the empyrean heaven—that is, the fiery heaven.
Rabanus says that heaven has its name from splendor, not from heat, because separated from the turning of the world, as soon as it was created it was filled with holy angels, among whom Lucifer was and stood out preeminently.
Hence the Lord says in the book of Job, chapter thirty-eight, verse seven: Where were you when the morning stars praised me, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
He calls the angels morning stars at the beginning of human creation.
Therefore he is rightly called both king and old. King, because as Ezekiel says in chapter twenty-eight, verse thirteen: He was full of perfection and beautiful in the delights of God, and the signet of his likeness.
Old, because as Job testifies in chapter forty, verse fourteen, he himself is the beginning of the ways of God, since he was created among the first works of God. But foolish, because he did not provide for himself in the future.
For though he was created in the eminence and sublimity of true knowledge, he became so swollen with pride in that height that he presumed he could be made equal to the Most High.
For he said in his heart, as Isaiah recounts in chapter fourteen, verses thirteen and fourteen: I will ascend to heaven—that is, to equality with God. I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven—that is, above the other angels. And I will be like the Most High.
But the more he presumed, the more he fell. Hence Isaiah says in chapter fourteen, verse twelve: How you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who rose in the morning! You have fallen to the earth, and you are dragged down even to hell, into the depths of the pit.
Truth says in the Gospel according to Luke, chapter ten, verse eighteen: I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
Therefore this king is foolish, though old, not providing for his own future, not content with what was his own but daring to usurp what belonged to another.
Therefore he was despoiled of what was his own, because though he was created more splendid than the other angels and for this reason was called Lucifer—light-bearer—by falling through his own fault he became Hesperus—the evening star.
Cast down from the empyrean into the darkness of this air, to mock him the poor and wise child went forth from prison and chains to a kingdom, while the one born in a kingdom is consumed by poverty.
Marvel at the wisdom of the poor child and the foolishness of the old king. For the one born in a kingdom is consumed by poverty; he walks through waterless and dry places seeking rest and finds none, as the Gospel of Luke records in chapter eleven, verse twenty-four, because he abandoned true rest.
As Job testifies in chapter forty, verse twenty-one: He sleeps under the shadow of the reeds and in marshy places—he who once flourished gloriously among the cedars of paradise. But the poor and wise child came from prison and chains to rest and a kingdom.
For he was unjustly captured by the Jews, captured and bound; but patiently enduring all these things according to the will of the Father, he was fastened to the cross with nails. Yet through this obedience he obtained the kingdom.
For as Isaiah says in chapter nine, verse six: His dominion was placed upon his shoulder.
For this reason, as Paul writes in his letter to the Philippians, chapter two, verse nine: God exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name.
For he who appeared weak in suffering was made known as God in rising.
Therefore let us rejoice and sing psalms wisely, because such a child is born to us, of whom the angel said to the shepherds, as recorded in the Gospel of Luke, chapter two, verses ten and eleven: Behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people, for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
That is, Bethlehem, which is interpreted as house of bread, because there was born the bread that came down from heaven and gives life to the world.
There he was laid in a manger where the ox and donkey were fed, because for this purpose he deigned to be born: to reconcile two peoples to God and refresh them with heavenly bread.
Therefore rejoice knowingly and sing psalms wisely. For blessed is the people who know the joyful shout—that is, who understand the reason and manner of rejoicing and psalm-singing.
For jubilation is ineffable joy, which can neither be expressed in words nor kept silent. A psalm is good work.
Therefore let us rejoice in mind and sing psalms in deed, preparing dwelling places in our hearts for our king, and washing our hands among the innocent, because as Psalm eighty-eight, verse nineteen says: Our assumption belongs to the Lord, even the Holy One of Israel, our King.
That is, our Lord and King took up our nature, he who sanctifies us here so that in the future he may make us Israel—that is, ones who see God. He who swiftly snatched the spoils from our plunderer; who gave health to the sick, freedom to captives, inheritance to exiles; and having destroyed our enemies, gave us peace. To him be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

Second Sermon on the Nativity of the Lord: Concerning the Birth of the Lord

Dearest brothers, as we prepare to receive with most faithful devotion the holy and venerable, glorious and singular solemnity—that is, the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ—we ought with all our strength and with his help to prepare ourselves and diligently inspect all the hidden places of our soul, lest perhaps some sin lie hidden there that would confuse our conscience and offend the eyes of the divine majesty.
For although Christ our Lord rose after his passion and ascended into heaven, nevertheless we believe that he observes and carefully attends to how each of his servants strives to prepare and compose himself—without greed and anger, without pride and lust—for celebrating his Nativity.
For according to how he sees each person in good conduct, so will he dispense to that person the grace of his mercy.
For if he sees someone clothed with the light of charity, adorned with the pearls of justice and mercy, chaste, humble, merciful, kind, and sober—if he recognizes such a person, he will dispense his body and blood to him through the ministry of his priests not for judgment but for healing.
But if he sees someone drunk, greedy, suspicious, I fear that what the Lord says in the Gospel will be said to him. As recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-two, verse twelve: Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?
And—which may the Lord avert!—let what follows happen to him, as verse thirteen records: Bind his hands and feet and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Behold what kind of sentence will be received on the day of judgment by one who, without the remedy of repentance, approaches the feast of the Lord polluted with the filth of vices.
For on the Nativity of the Lord, Christ was joined to his bride—that is, the Church—as in a spiritual wedding.
For then, as Psalm eighty-four, verse twelve says, truth sprang up from the earth, and justice looked down from heaven. Then the bridegroom came forth from his chamber—that is, the Word of God the Father from the virginal womb. For he came forth with his bride, that is the Church, when he assumed human flesh.
Therefore, invited to this most holy wedding and about to enter the banquet of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, see with what garments we ought to be adorned.
Therefore we ought, as much as we can with God's help, to prepare both our hearts and our bodies, so that the heavenly host may find nothing in us sordid, nothing foul, nothing dark, nothing unworthy in his sight.
Therefore, dearest brothers, we ought to attend to this not casually but with great trembling.
For we have been invited to the Lord's wedding, so that we ourselves, if we act well, may cling to the Bridegroom.
Let us consider to what kind of wedding, to what kind of bridegroom, to what kind of marriage we have been invited. For we have been invited to a table where the food is not the food of humans but the bread of angels.
And therefore let us take heed lest perhaps in the soul, where we ought to be adorned with the pearls of good works, we appear wrapped in old rags, and lest when chastity has made those who are good in God's eyes radiant, luxury makes those who are evil filthy.
And therefore, whenever the days of the Nativity of the Lord or other feast days approach, as I have frequently admonished, we ought to abstain not only from the unfortunate company of concubines but even from our own wives, and make ourselves free from all anger, so that past sins may be redeemed through almsgiving and penances.
Let no hatred be held in the heart against any person. What vanity used to spend through gluttony or pride, let justice begin to distribute to the poor through mercy. What luxury or gluttony squandered in the world, let piety store up in heaven.
And although it is fitting that we should always give alms, nevertheless especially on holy solemnities we ought to distribute more abundantly according to our strength. But above all, let us invite the poor more frequently to our feast.
For it is not just that on a holy solemnity, among a Christian people belonging to one God, some should get drunk while others are tormented by hunger and danger to their lives.
For both we and all the people are servants of the one God, and if we act well, we shall arrive together at one blessedness.
Therefore, brothers, as we prepare to receive the Nativity of the Lord, let us cleanse ourselves from all the dregs of conscience. Let us go out to meet him not in silk garments but in precious works.
For garments can cover naked limbs but cannot adorn the conscience. Rather, it is more shameful to walk with gleaming limbs but to go about with polluted senses.
Therefore let us first adorn the affection of the interior man, so that the garment of the exterior man may be more becoming. Let us wash away spiritual stains, so that it is not carnal garments that shine in us. But may these things which we have suggested cling to the renewed senses of your charity—things briefly spoken and which we repeat even more briefly.
For we admonish these things, dearest brothers, because the Nativity of the Lord is approaching. Therefore, as for a nuptial and heavenly marriage, free from all lust and adorned with good works, let us prepare ourselves with Christ's help. Let us distribute alms to the poor. Let us cast out anger and hatred like poison from our hearts. Let us faithfully maintain chastity.
Let us invite the poor more frequently to our banquet. Rise for the morning vigils; standing in the church, worship or sing psalms.
Do not yourselves speak idle or worldly words from your mouth, and rebuke those who wish to speak them. Keep peace with all, and call back to concord those whom you recognize as discordant.
If you faithfully wish to fulfill these things with Christ's help, both in this age you will be able to approach the Lord's altar with secure conscience, and in the future you will faithfully arrive at eternal blessedness, through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Third Sermon on the Nativity of the Lord: Concerning the Birth of the Lord

As Paul writes in his letter to Titus, chapter three, verses four and five: The kindness and love for humanity of God our Savior appeared, and he saved us not because of works of righteousness that we did, but according to his mercy.
Brothers, the human race had been acquired for himself by the cunning of diabolical fraud. He had subjected it to his dominion through the sin of the first parent.
But the Lord, the just judge, who does not wish to inflict anything unjust even on his adversary but to do all things either through mercy or through justice, chose to redeem the human race through grace in such a way that he would not seem to inflict injury on the devil.
Therefore, since Satan acted cunningly against man through deception, the Lord wished to act prudently against Satan on behalf of man through wisdom.
Therefore with such a plan the Lord acted concerning human restoration. It was necessary that one be sent to fight against the devil who would not succumb, who would act rationally, and who would handle all things with wisdom.
Adam was a mere man, and therefore from human frailty he succumbed to diabolical temptations. And for this reason a mere man was not to be sent for redemption, who either by himself or when tempted could have sinned.
Yet an angel was not to be sent in this warfare, because he could sin—and angels had previously sinned through pride.
Therefore it was necessary to send one who could not sin. But there is no rational creature who cannot sin except God alone.
Why then was the Father not sent, why was the Holy Spirit not sent, but only the Son?
Because, as was said above, it was necessary to act through wisdom against the cunning enemy. But the wisdom and prudence of the Father is the Son, through whom all things were made and foreseen.
Because he is prudence, he acted rationally; because he is wisdom, he acted wisely; and because he is God, he could not sin.
Therefore the Son was sent who, being prudence, did all things rationally; being wisdom, handled all things wisely; being God, could not sin.
But it was fitting to reason that just as man when conquered had been made captive, so man by conquering the demon would free human nature.
Therefore not a mere man was sent, but God and man—man to fight, God to sustain the fighter.
There is also another reason. Great discord existed between God and humans through the old man; concord was made through the new mediator.
But since he was a mediator, it was fitting that he have kinship with both. Therefore, since he was going to reconcile man to God, he who was between both had to be God and man.
Therefore the kindness and humanity of God our Savior appeared—that is, God and man.
Yet he saved us not because of works of righteousness that we did, but according to his mercy.
And he appeared well. For the birth of Christ was revealed in many ways. It was revealed through angels to shepherds; it was revealed through a star to kings.
For we heard in the Gospel that shepherds were in that same region keeping watch and guarding their flock during the watches of the night. And behold, an angel of the Lord stood beside them, and they feared with great fear. And the angel said to them: Do not be afraid. For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people, for to you is born today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This comes from the Gospel of Luke, chapter two, verse eight and following.
And where was he born? In the city of David—that is, Bethlehem. And this will be a sign to you: You will find an infant wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. This continues in the same passage.
Hearing this, the shepherds came to Bethlehem and saw just as had been told to them by the angel.
The angel rightly announced this, because the King of angels had been born. And it was fitting that the angel appeared with great light, because he declared that the sun of righteousness, the light shining in darkness, had risen.
It was announced to shepherds because he was born who says in the Gospel of John, chapter ten, verse eleven: I am the good shepherd.
He appeared through a star to kings because one had risen who was both King and Star. King, as it is written in Psalm two, verse six: I have been established as King by him. Star, as it is written in the book of Numbers, chapter twenty-four, verse seventeen: A star shall rise from Jacob.
Therefore he rightly appeared to shepherds and kings, because he himself was king and priest, born from royal and priestly lineage. From royal seed, because from the seed of David; from priestly lineage, because Mary was a relative of Elizabeth.
The messenger was quite commendable—an angel with a great voice, concerning whom it is read in the Gospel according to Luke, chapter one, verse five: Zacharias' wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
But hear what he brought: Behold, I bring you good news of great joy, for to you is born today a Savior. Truly great joy! We were captives in prison, we lay in sickness. A physician has been born. Behold, great joy!
There was much more joy for humans when the angels rejoiced and said: Glory to God in the highest. There was joy among the angels about the restoration of their diminished order. They praised the Lord for the restoration of humans, which led to the restoration of angels.
And there is peace for humans, because we had discord with God and with angels, but through the mediator we have been reconciled.
Because we were strangers through sin, the angels also considered us strangers from their fellowship. The angels so despised humans that they allowed themselves to be worshiped by them.
For this is why Lot and Abraham worshiped angels, and they were not forbidden before the advent of Christ.
But after the Lord was born, when John wished to worship an angel in the book of Revelation, that same angel restrained him from worshiping, saying in chapter nineteen, verse ten: See that you do not do that; I am your fellow servant and of your brothers.
Previously the angels looked down on human nature as inferior. But after they see it assumed above themselves, they fear to see it prostrate before them, nor do they disdain man as a companion—they who worship above themselves the God-man.
Peace is announced to humans, but not to all—rather, to people of good will. As if to say: Those will be reconciled who have a good will to be reconciled. And those have the will to be reconciled who devote themselves to the Creator and do not act contrary to his will.
It should be noted why he said of good will and not of action, because good will suffices if the ability to act is lacking. Thus good will sometimes avails without good action, but action never avails without good will. Therefore he preferred to say of good will, which is common to all who are saved.
Christ was born without opening the gate of the Virgin, who remained a virgin before giving birth, a virgin during birth, and a virgin after birth. Concerning this gate of the Virgin, the Lord spoke to Ezekiel, saying, "This gate that you see shall remain closed and shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it," as we read in the book of Ezekiel, chapter forty-four, verse two. The Lord God of Israel entered through it, and it will remain closed forever. What great merit, what great gift, what great grace! The handmaid gave birth to the Lord; the creature bore the Creator; the daughter bore her father; the daughter of divinity became the mother of humanity. We acknowledge two births of the Lord: one divine, the other human. The first was without a mother, the second without a father. Today, dearest brothers and sisters, we celebrate his birth in time, which he accepted for our sake. Let us rejoice because of our restoration. Today the sick person has received health, today the captive has received freedom, today the exile has recovered his inheritance. So let us today receive the King who comes. Let us prepare dwellings in our hearts for such an emperor, that he may graciously receive us into the heavenly Jerusalem, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.
