De hac porta Virginis dixit Dominus ad Ezechielem: «Porta haec quam vides, clausa erit, et non aperietur, et vir non intrabit per eam (Ezech. XLIV, 2),» quam ingressus est Dominus Deus Israel, et semper erit clausa. Magnum meritum, magnum donum, magna gratia! Ancilla peperit Dominum; creatura Creatorem, filia patrem, filia divinitatis, mater humanitatis. Duas nativitates Domini accepimus, unam divinam, alteram humanam. Illam sine matre, istam sine patre. Hodie, fratres charissimi, celebramus temporalem nativitatem propter nos acceptam. Gaudeamus propter reparationem nostram. Hodie suscepit infirmus sanitatem, hodie captivus libertatem, hodie recuperavit exsul haereditatem. Suscipiamus ergo hodie Regem venientem, praeparemus ei habitacula pectorum contra talem imperatorem, ut nos dignetur suscipere, in coelesti Jerusalem, qui vivit et regnat per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.",
      "english": "Christ was born without opening the gate of the Virgin, who remained a virgin before giving birth, a virgin during birth, and a virgin after birth. Concerning this gate of the Virgin, the Lord spoke to Ezekiel, saying, \"This gate that you see shall remain closed and shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it,\" as we read in the book of Ezekiel, chapter forty-four, verse two. The Lord God of Israel entered through it, and it will remain closed forever. What great merit, what great gift, what great grace! The handmaid gave birth to the Lord; the creature bore the Creator; the daughter bore her father; the daughter of divinity became the mother of humanity. We acknowledge two births of the Lord: one divine, the other human. The first was without a mother, the second without a father. Today, dearest brothers and sisters, we celebrate his birth in time, which he accepted for our sake. Let us rejoice because of our restoration. Today the sick person has received health, today the captive has received freedom, today the exile has recovered his inheritance. So let us today receive the King who comes. Let us prepare dwellings in our hearts for such an emperor, that he may graciously receive us into the heavenly Jerusalem, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.",
      "notes": "The sermon emphasizes Mary's perpetual virginity using the image of the closed gate from Ezekiel as a theological type. The rhetorical structure uses parallelism (hodie...hodie...hodie) for emphasis in oral delivery. The phrase 'habitacula pectorum' (dwellings of hearts) has been rendered idiomatically as 'dwellings in our hearts' for natural English flow."
