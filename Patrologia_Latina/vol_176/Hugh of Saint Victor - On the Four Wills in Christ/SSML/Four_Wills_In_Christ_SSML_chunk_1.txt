<break time="500s" />A TREATISE ON THE FOUR WILLS IN CHRIST
<break time="2s" />

<p>
You ask about the will of God and the will of humans similarly. Christ was God, and therefore the divine will was in Him. And because He was also human, similarly the human will was in Him. I do not mean the human will that guilt and vice create, but the one that the nature of humans requires. Therefore, in Christ, the divine will was present inasmuch as Christ was God; and similarly, the human will was in Him inasmuch as He was human. However, the human will is considered in three ways: according to reason, according to compassion, and according to the flesh. Therefore, in Christ, there was the will of divinity and the will of reason, the will of compassion, and the will of the flesh. The will of divinity dictated judgment through justice; the will of reason approved truth through obedience; the will of compassion sighed for the evil of others; the will of the flesh murmured through suffering in its own evil. See if all these were not in Christ. The leper who prayed for healing and confessed majesty acknowledged the power of the divine will, saying: <break time="500ms" /> Lord, if you will, you can make me clean <break time="500ms" /> (Luke 5:12). And the Lord, to show both the judgment and power of the same divine will, said regarding the judgment: <break time="500ms" /> I will, <break time="500ms" /> and regarding the power, added <break time="500ms" /> be clean <break time="500ms" /> (Luke 5:13). This is an example of the divine will in Christ. Regarding the will of reason, which was subject to the divine will through obedience, He said: <break time="500ms" /> The spirit indeed is willing <break time="500ms" /> (Matthew 26:41). Regarding the will of the flesh, which resisted the horror of suffering through weakness, He said: <break time="500ms" /> But the flesh is weak <break time="500ms" /> (Matthew 26:41). The spirit was willing through the will of reason by following the disposition of the divine will in the suffering of His flesh. But the flesh was weak, resisting suffering through the natural inclination to hate one's own evil. Therefore, according to the preceding disposition of the will of divinity, and according to the will of reason approving and following the divine disposition, Christ willed to suffer. However, according to the will of the flesh, inasmuch as He was human, He did not will to suffer because He did not hate His own flesh. Yet in this, He was not contrary to the divine will; because even this unwillingness was itself in accordance with the divine will.

<p>
There was still another will in Christ, the will of compassion or humanity. For compassion itself is called humanity, and those who are compassionate and easily sympathize with the miseries of others are called humane. It is proper to humanity to feel compassion and be moved by the suffering of others. A beast can suffer, but to feel compassion is proper to humanity. Therefore, the will of compassion is called the will of humanity because it is human to be moved by compassion. And this will is similarly found in Christ according to the nature of humanity. When He approached Jerusalem <break time="500ms" /> seeing the city, He wept over it <break time="500ms" /> (Luke 19:41). Why did He weep if He did not feel pain?<break time="500ms"/> Therefore, He did not wish for what He felt pain about. What did He feel pain about?<break time="500ms"/> Their destruction. If He felt pain about their destruction, He did not wish for their destruction. How did He not wish for it?<break time="500ms"/> According to the divine will, He willed what would be just. According to the will of reason, He consented to justice and approved justice. But according to the will of compassion, without hating justice, He felt sorrow for their misery, just as according to the will of the flesh, He did not accuse justice but rejected suffering. Each will operated what was proper to it and followed what pertained to it. The divine will followed justice, the rational will followed obedience, the will of compassion...

  <p>
    The mercy of humanity desires, <break time="200ms" /> the will of the flesh seeks its nature. <s>Neither was opposed to the other, <break time="200ms" /> but each sought what was its own, so that although it was directed towards something else, it was not contrary to the other.</s> <s>This means that although it desired something else, it did not necessarily reject something else.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as it was the divine nature to not abandon justice, <break time="200ms" /> so it was right for the flesh to preserve its nature; <break time="200ms" /> and it was also right for compassion not to love another's misery. <s>Thus, in Christ, there was the will of divinity, dictating justice; the will of reason, approving justice; the will of humanity, through which no evil was wished upon anyone; and the will of the flesh, through which it did not wish pain upon itself.</s> <s>Therefore, it was right for the flesh to not want suffering because this was according to its nature, and it was right for God to will its suffering because this was according to justice.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    For the flesh did not refuse because God willed it, <break time="200ms" /> just as God did not refuse because the flesh willed it. <s>Similarly, compassion, which mercifully refused the suffering or destruction of the miserable according to the feeling of compassion, did not justly refuse what God rightly willed; but loved mercy for its own sake and did not disapprove of justice, which was not its own.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Certainly, it should be understood that the mortal flesh is burned with fear of suffering, <break time="200ms" /> and compassion is passionately moved by the love of compassion, which is due only to the present life, in which compassion is owed to the wicked as long as they can be corrected, and suffering is not removed from the good as long as they can become better. <s>When this mortal body puts on immortality, and this perishable body puts on imperishability,</s> <break time="200ms" /> <lang xml:lang="en-US">First Corinthians 15</lang> <s>then indeed neither passion nor fear of passion will afflict the flesh, nor will the mind suffer any pain from the compassion for another's sorrow.</s> <s>There, both the flesh will have security against suffering, and the soul will have purity in compassion.</s> <s>The security of the flesh will come from its impassibility, <break time="200ms" /> the purity of the mind from its truth.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Understand what I say. <s>To suffer and to sympathize are both forms of suffering. <break time="200ms" /> Suffering is given to man for iniquity; sympathy is commanded for goodness.</s> <s>It is right and just before God that he who suffers should also sympathize, so that iniquity may be erased by suffering, and goodness may be exercised through compassion.</s> <s>Indeed, this pertains to the goodness of mortal life, that one adapts to one's own condition in others and becomes a participant in another's suffering through compassion, so that just as suffering is a necessity, compassion is a work of goodness.</s> <s>Where there will be no suffering, there will be no compassion.</s> <s>Not because there will be cruelty in another's punishment, but because there will be no torment from another's misery.</s> <s>Here, compassion is a virtue; there, not having compassion is a sign of happiness.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, you sympathize with your will, <break time="200ms" /> are moved by compassion, and feel sorrow out of goodness. <s>There, you do not sympathize because of happiness, are not moved by eternity, and do not feel sorrow because of impassibility.</s> <s>Therefore, compassion can only exist where suffering can exist, since compassion itself is a form of suffering.</s> <s>Certainly, those who suffer there do not put aside compassion, because just as they suffer corruptibly for their own iniquity, so they sympathize carnally for the misfortune of others according to the feelings of mortal life.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why the rich man placed in torment was concerned for his brothers, <break time="200ms" /> so that the accumulation of his misery would increase with the added torment of another's misery. <s>However, Abraham saw this torment and, remaining steadfast in the certainty of happiness,</s> <break time="200ms" /> <lang xml:lang="en-US">Luke 16</lang> <s>rejected him through justice, saying: “Son, you received good things in your life, and Lazarus similarly bad things.”</s> <s>This is why the Psalmist, foreseeing how in that joy of eternity the hearts of the righteous, adhering immutably to divine justice through the love of truth, will not desire or approve of anything else except what they recognize to be according to it, says: “I will enter the power of the Lord.”</s>
  </p>


  Lord, I will remember only your righteousness. <break time="500ms" /> <p> (Psalm seventy) <break time="500ms" /> In this life, where we cannot fully know or foresee the judgment of divine justice, we might wish for things that are not just according to it without being unjust ourselves. This is because our responsibility is to choose what aligns with piety when we do not know what pleases God more. However, where the judgment of divine justice is shown to be unchangeably fixed, piety no longer has a place against it. </p> <p> If anything touches us out of compassion, it is either due to a dominant vice or the weakness of our corruptible nature that cannot resist suffering. There are three kinds of compassion: one from vice, one from nature, and one from virtue. Compassion from vice is when the heart is touched by reprehensible pain, where it was first held by illicit love. Compassion from nature is when the mind empathizes with others' troubles due to an inherent affection of piety, whenever it sees nature oppressed or afflicted against the measure of piety or humanity. Compassion from virtue is when we sympathize with others' pains for God's sake, especially when we see justice oppressed or innocence afflicted. </p> <p> Compassion from vice is blameworthy; compassion from nature is blameless; compassion from virtue is praiseworthy. The first is condemned, the third is praised. The second has neither blame, because it is from nature, nor reward, because it is not from virtue. Therefore, in this life, as long as the mortal flesh can be harmed by suffering, the mutable mind can be touched by compassion. But where both will truly be impassible, there will be no suffering for the flesh or compassion for the mind. </p> <p> Now, both use their mutability well if the flesh does not abandon patience in suffering, and the mind does not exceed the measure of justice in compassion. So, if you ask for the time of compassion, we must sympathize as long as we can suffer. If you ask for the place, compassion's misery should be shown where the mercy of suffering is not yet to be despaired of. </p> <p> David, when his son was ill, shed tears; when he died, he washed his face <break time="500ms" /> (Second Samuel twelve) <break time="500ms" /> to show that the misery of compassion should be endured as long as the mercy of suffering is not to be despaired of. </p> <p> However, there is a certain affection of compassion that even follows lost nature with pity, according to which we are angry at the uncorrectable fault of our kind, just as we pity the unextinguishable nature. Now, the mortal life subjected to mutability endures a part of misery for a time; but later, transferred to incorruption, it will lay it down. </p> <p> Now, weak in both suffering in the flesh and compassion in the mind, then it will be healed in both, to be strengthened through the immortality of the flesh against suffering, and through the immutability of the mind against compassion. Just as the infirmity of the flesh is to suffer, so the infirmity of the mind is to sympathize. Therefore, God became a man, who came to take away both, tolerated both. He took on suffering in the flesh; he took on compassion in the mind. He wanted to be weak in both for us, so that he could heal us who are weak in both. </p> <p> He was weakened by suffering in his punishment; he was weakened by compassion in another's misery. He endured suffering to the point of dying for those who were to die, and he took on compassion to the point of weeping for those who were to perish. Because of misery, he gave his flesh to suffering; because of mercy, he disturbed his soul with compassion. In his flesh, he felt pain for us by suffering; in his mind, he empathized with us by sympathizing, and just as the infirmity of the flesh in him did not want its punishment according to the affection of nature, so the piety of the mind did not want another's misery according to the affection of mercy. Just as he asked for the cup of suffering to be taken from him according to the will of the flesh, which he knew would not be taken, so he prayed for the sentence of condemnation to be mitigated for others according to piety. </p>


    He endured what he foresaw unchangeably. For compassion did its part by showing mercy, and reason did its part by obeying divine order. <break time="500ms" /> Therefore, there was no contradiction. 

    If Christ, as a man, according to the feeling of compassion which he had taken on in his humanity, wanted something which, according to the divine will, he foresaw would not happen; it was because it belonged to true humanity to be moved by compassion, and it belonged to true divinity not to be moved from its order. <break time="500ms" /> Thus, in both aspects, he did what he had to do. 

    Nor was he contradictory to himself if he willed according to the compassion suitable to humanity, what he did not will according to the justice due to divinity; because he willed both to want this and not to want that. It is written: <break time="500ms" /> Jesus <break time="500ms" /> groaned deeply in spirit and troubled himself <break time="500ms" /> (John 11:33). <break time="500ms" /> 

    Pay attention here: <break time="500ms" /> He troubled himself. How did he trouble himself?<break time="500ms"/> What was this trouble by which Jesus troubled himself?<break time="500ms"/> Compassion itself, mercy itself was the trouble. <break time="500ms" /> Was it good trouble, to be troubled well by being moved by compassion?<break time="500ms"/> He troubled himself. Mercy troubled him, and he troubled himself, who willingly accepted mercy. 

    Just as he handed himself over, when Judas handed him over: so he troubled himself when mercy troubled him. This is known and proven by frequent use. It is said to a person when they suffer something: You troubled yourself; you brought this evil upon yourself. So Jesus troubled himself when mercy troubled him, which he had willingly accepted; and he handed himself over, when he granted the power to hand him over. <break time="500ms" /> 

    Thus, Jesus in the assumed humanity, as long as he willed to bear it as passible, bore both suffering in the flesh and compassion in the mind according to the property of humanity. Yet now, being transferred to immutability, he can neither suffer corruption, nor be troubled by compassion. Because we know Christ as both suffering and compassionate according to human nature <break time="500ms" /> (Second Corinthians 5:16). 

    <break time="500ms" /> My days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have dried up like burnt wood <break time="500ms" /> (Psalm 102:3). The days vanished because of suffering; the bones dried up because of compassion, the flesh died because of suffering, the soul dried up because of compassion. 

    The pain of compassion was like a kind of frying of the soul, by which he was burned by mercy, pressed by compassion, dried by despair; I say despair not because of himself, but because of those who could neither be corrected from evil nor be freed from it. In all these things, we know Christ according to the flesh when he bore true humanity and true mortality in true humanity <break time="500ms" /> (Second Corinthians 5:16). 

    But now we no longer know him according to the flesh, since <break time="500ms" /> rising from the dead, he dies no more, death no longer has dominion over him. What he lives, he lives to God <break time="500ms" /> (Romans 6:9-10).
