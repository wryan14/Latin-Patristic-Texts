On Humility and Obedience and on Overcoming Pride
by Novatus the Catholic

2
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:08,279
On Humility and Obedience and on Overcoming Pride.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,009
We speak differently to those outside the Church than we do to you.

4
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:19,357
To them, we sometimes use impressive words that lack true power, because they enjoy the sound of words rather than the power of God.

5
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:26,872
But you, in the name of Christ, do not delight in this; instead, you seek to hear the word of salvation, through which you were called.

6
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:31,883
You have donned these mournful garments in the world, expecting something better from God.

7
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:33,942
You already know and understand this.

8
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:40,455
You have spent a long time here struggling against your adversary, which is not outside but within, in your own body.

9
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:42,738
We face this opponent in our own members.

10
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:53,482
For if the flesh desires against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, so that we do not do what we want-
Galatians chapter five, verse seventeen-
you see that this adversary is within.

11
00:00:53,482 --> 00:01:03,502
However, this adversary is only defeated by humility and love:
for our Lord Jesus Christ would not have defeated the devil if he had not been humbled, not by necessity but by love.

12
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:06,453
If he had not loved, he would not have become humble.

13
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:08,513
Out of love for us, he became humble.

14
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:21,428
Therefore, if he who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them-
Psalm one hundred forty-six, verse four-
the Lord of all angels, who created everything, became humble for us, why do we refuse humility for our own sake?

15
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:24,824
The path of salvation is not open to us unless we are humble.

16
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:29,945
When you begin humility, seek it for God's sake and endure it for the sake of the community.

17
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:36,848
And within that community, even though you are equals, each one should consider the other as superior, even if they are not.

18
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:39,019
Only someone with humility can do that.

19
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:46,757
For the servants of God, no other reward is necessary, except humility:
because if humility is present in a person, it makes them obedient.

20
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:50,988
Whoever is obedient, or who follows obedience, does not obey humans but God.

21
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:58,726
For the Lord said: Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever listens to me listens to him who sent me-
Luke chapter ten, verse sixteen.

22
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:03,498
Father Abbot is here, and the following brothers are the Patriarchs.

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:12,020
Anyone among you who leads a good life, practices self-control, stays watchful, and takes care of their body is also like a Father because of their example.

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,176
Therefore, practice these virtues among yourselves, ensuring that you maintain humility-not to appear humble to others, but to God.

25
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,634
True humility is shown to God, not to people.

26
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:27,315
Humility displayed for others is mere pretense, and should be completely foreign to the servants of God.

27
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:32,778
I don't believe there are such issues among you, but I advise you to guard against them creeping in.

28
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,799
We are human, and we speak to humans.

29
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:42,009
Therefore, show humility to your brothers as an example, so that true humility is rooted in your heart according to God's standards.

30
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:48,455
When humility is established in your heart for God, He grants your brother the understanding to imitate your humility.

31
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:53,153
If humility is not genuine in your heart, God reveals to your brother that it is fake.

32
00:02:53,153 --> 00:03:00,691
The first step to salvation is this: to maintain simple humility for God, not for people; not to please others with it, but to please God.

33
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:07,137
Let obedience follow humility, and be obedient to one another, just as the parts of a body are obedient to each other.

34
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:10,743
Do the body parts obey through reasoning, or through natural love?

35
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:16,315
If the foot is hurt, the hand comes to help, preventing the whole body from being injured and falling.

36
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:41,115
As the Apostle says: "If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it," from First Corinthians chapter twelve, verse twenty-six.
Where does this come from, if not from love?
Therefore, if you love each other, there will be no disturbances.
Let no one suffer scandals; not because of food, drink, clothing, watchfulness, work, the kitchen, or service.
When you love each other, if someone makes a mistake, that love prevents you from being offended.

37
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,396
Therefore, brothers, embrace humility and obedience, which bring peace, so that you may become children of peace.

38
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:52,432
As the Apostle says, love is the bond of perfection (Colossians 3:14).

39
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,584
When you possess humility, you imitate Christ, who became humble for us.

40
00:03:56,584 --> 00:04:02,927
When you practice obedience, you follow Christ, who was obedient even to the point of death (Philippians 2:8).

41
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:07,310
When you embody love, you reflect Christ, for God is love (First John 5:16).

42
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,963
But first, strive to conquer your inner vices.

43
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:20,861
Let peace first dwell in your soul and heart with God's commandment, so that in the battle against bodily habits and weaknesses, there are two victors: God's commandment and your agreement.

44
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,610
Consider this scenario: the doctor, the patient, and the illness.

45
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,530
If the patient sides with the illness, the doctor is outnumbered, making it two against one, and the doctor is defeated.

46
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,335
But if the patient sides with the doctor, the illness is defeated.

47
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:39,660
The doctor is Christ; we are the patients; the illness is the habit of sin.

48
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,964
Now, those who have partially renounced the world while still living in it should consider to whom they should cling: the illness or the doctor.

49
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:51,251
If they do not cling to the doctor, the doctor struggles.

50
00:04:51,251 --> 00:05:00,247
That is why the Gospel calls out to us in the world, saying: "Be in agreement with your adversary quickly while you are on the way with him" (Matthew 5:25).

51
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:10,223
It doesn't teach us to agree with the adversary, the devil, but to agree with the adversary, the divine commandment, which opposes our evils, our habits, and our iniquities.

52
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:25,274
If we agree, we align ourselves with God's commandment and accept it almost like God's yoke, prompting the Lord to say: "Come to me, all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke, for it is easy, and my burden is light" (Matthew 11:28).

53
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:26,773
Consider what is so light?

54
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:32,251
Finally, think about how those who possess something in this world fear it might be taken away.

55
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,789
How they dread losing what they have gained?

56
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:39,056
In what ways are they tormented, as if under a very heavy burden of worry?

57
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,407
However, you should focus solely on what the abbot commands.

58
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:49,483
You're already under guidance, so don't worry about where you live, as that's not something you should dwell on.

59
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,033
There is someone to guide you and care for you.

60
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,940
You shouldn't be concerned with thoughts about food and clothing at all.

61
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,443
Consider what the abbot gives you as if it were given by God: that's true humility.

62
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,946
But if one person has more and another less, see it as if God intended it that way.

63
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:10,100
If someone sits at a different table and the abbot orders it, accept it as if God commanded it.

64
00:06:10,100 --> 00:07:18,028
Don't question it by thinking, "Tomorrow I'll sit there."
Avoid making it a habit to focus on those desires.
If there's nothing to give, or it seems there's nothing to give, accept it as either there's truly nothing, or it wasn't beneficial to provide it.
Brothers, if you follow these principles, you will surely attain eternal life.
Don't be swayed by negative talk.
If someone weak falls and speaks wrongly, immediately correct them: say, "Don't do that, don't, brother, you're sinning."
Because you're united under one abbot, you should be abbots to each other.
Can one person, with just two eyes and ears, see and hear everyone?
Doesn't he also need to go out and provide something?
Be abbots to each other; and just as you respected the abbot when he was present, respect him even in his absence because God is always present.
Absolutely fear and be in awe of this, for God is always with us.
If one person cares for so many, how much more should all of you care, ensuring there's no reason for him to be angry, grieved, or feel his efforts were in vain?
These teachings can benefit us if we embrace humility, obedience, and charity.
There is no path to God except through humility, obedience, and charity.
He is the way, the truth, and the life.

65
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:25,124
Some brothers become proud after enduring suffering and fasting for several days, thinking no one else can do what they do.

66
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:34,298
They believe their feats are unmatched: like walking barefoot or abstaining from even mixed water, yet these are temporary acts because they can't be sustained forever.

67
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:38,120
Instead, they should focus on humility, piety, charity, and obedience.

68
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:48,113
These practices should be embraced to weaken the body's strength and tame the flesh, much like a good athlete, but without boasting, so as not to lose the value of their achievements.

69
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:51,171
Consider the Pharisee who went up to the temple to pray.

70
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,755
Were his deeds insignificant?

71
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:59,690
They were remarkable: fasting twice a week, giving tithes of all his possessions, avoiding fraud and adultery, an endless list.

72
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,239
But because he boasted in pride, all his deeds turned into pride.

73
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,550
Luke 18:9 and following.

74
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,283
Therefore, David says: May the foot of pride not come against me, and the hand of the sinner not move me.

75
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,795
There they have fallen, all who work iniquity.

76
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:13,450
Psalm 36:12.

77
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,543
Where did they fall?

78
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:15,689
In the fall of pride.

79
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,583
For the devil fell from there; he fell through pride.

80
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,133
Therefore, pride should not be present among the servants of God.

81
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:27,648
Anyone who lives differently now and has arranged their life better should not be like that Pharisee.

82
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:36,494
The publican, however, humbled himself and didn't dare to lift his eyes to heaven, and by the Lord's judgment, he returned home justified, more than the Pharisee.

83
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:43,921
We have seen, both in the holy scriptures and among our brothers, that those who follow the path of humility progress and do not perish.
