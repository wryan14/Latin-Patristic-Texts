      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n    <p>\n        So, Combefis reflects on the passage we just recited from Sulpicius. The same Confession of Utrecht was published in 1514 by Theodorus Pulmannus from old manuscripts. His various readings at the end of his edition, which appeared in Cygneae in 1677, were dismissed by Daumius.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Above all, the diligence of Thomas Beauxamis is particularly commendable. He acquired three very ancient manuscripts, carefully compared them, and published the same book by the holy bishop of Tours. This edition, with a short commentary attached to the Life of Saint Martin by Sulpicius Severus, was released in Paris in 1571.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        We've followed this edition because it's much more refined than others and considered quite rare. It's helpful to share some insights from the same Parisian editor. While he shows the effort he put into this work, he also establishes its integrity and value. He says:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        \"Three volumes were brought to me from different libraries, and the handwriting itself indicated they were quite ancient. The characters, when compared with others used a thousand years ago, were held to be very similar by everyone's testimony. Furthermore, these three volumes contained a triple history of Severus Sulpicius.\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        \"But when I recognized the summary of our faith written by Saint Martin at the beginning of each book, I was truly astonished. Given that Severus's works were frequently published, not even a mention was made of this. I believe that, aside from the antiquity of the characters, the complexity of the subject matter deterred others. The text lacked periods, commas, or other marks, making it appear ambiguous to some, incomplete to others, and generally obscure.\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        \"Because it encompasses such a difficult matter with utmost brevity, who could have drawn anything certain from such perplexing words? Therefore, I thought it worthwhile to restrain the flowing words with punctuation, like bonds, thus easily rendering the Confession of Saint Martin.\"\n    </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Ita Combefisius, ea respiciens quae modo ex Sulpicio\nrecitavimus. Ex priscis item membranis eamdem\nConfessionem Trajecti evulgavit anno 1514 Theod. Pulmannus, cujus varias lectiones ad suae editionis\ncalcem quae Cygneae prodiit 1677 rejecit Daumius. III. Verum prae caeteris commendanda videtur\n Thomae Beauxamis solertia; qui tres vetustissimos\ncodices nactus, eorum collatione diligenter instituta,\neumdem sancti praesulis Turonensis libellum brevi\ncommentario illustratum subjectumque Vitae beati\nMartini a Sulpicio Severo conscriptae, prelo commisit\nParisiis anno 1571.

Sic igitur ille :\nTria, inquit, e diversis bibliothecis volumina mihi\nprolata sunt, quae manus ipsa, satis antiquissima\nesse contestabatur: characteres enim aliis qui ante\n mille annos in usu erant, collati, persimiles omnium\n testimonio habiti sunt.
