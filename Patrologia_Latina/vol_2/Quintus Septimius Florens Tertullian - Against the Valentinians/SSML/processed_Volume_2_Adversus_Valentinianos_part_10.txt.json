Nostrae columbae  etiam domus\nsimplex, in editis semper et apertis et ad lucem. Amat figura  Spiritus Sancti Orientem  ,\nChristi figuram. Nihil veritas erubescit, nisi solummodo\nabscondi: quia nec pudebit illum aures ei dedere,\neum Deum recognoscere, quem jam illi natura\ncommisit, quem quotidie in operibus omnibus sentit,\nhoc solo minus notum, quod unicum non putavit, quod\n in numero nominavit , quod in aliis adoravit. Alioquin a turba eorum et aliam frequentiam suadere,\na domestico principatu ad incognitum transmovere, a\nmanifesto ad occultum retorquere, de limine fidem\n offendere est. Jam si et in totam fabulam\ninitietur, nonne tale aliquid dabitur te in infantia inter\nsomni difficultates a nutricula audisse, Lamiae turres\n, et pectines solis? Sed qui ex alia conscientia\nvenerit fidei, si statim inveniat tot nomina Aeonum,\ntot conjugia, tot genimina , tot exitus, tot eventus,\nfelicitates, infelicitates, dispersae atque concisae divinitatis,\ndubitabitne ibidem pronuntiare  has esse\nfabulas et genealogias indeterminatas, quas Apostoli\nspiritus, bis jam tunc pullulantibus seminibus haereticis,\ndamnare praevenit? Merito itaque non simplices,\n merito tantummodo prudentes, qui talia neque facile\nproducunt, neque exerte defendunt, sed nec\nomnes quos edocent, perdocent; utique astute, ut pudenda:\ncaeterum inhumane, si honesta. Et tamen simplices\nnos , omnia scimus. Denique hunc primum\ncuneum congressionis armavimus, detectorem\net designatorem totius conscientiae illorum, primamque\nhanc victoriam  auspicamur: quia quod tanto\nimpendio absconditur, etiam solummodo demonstrare,\ndestruere est.",
