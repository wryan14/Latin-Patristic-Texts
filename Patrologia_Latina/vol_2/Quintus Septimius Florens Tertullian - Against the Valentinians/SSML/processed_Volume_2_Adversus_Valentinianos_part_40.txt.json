      "original_latin": " Producam denique velut epicitharisma post fabulam\ntantam, etiam illa quae ne ordini obstreperent,\net lectoris intentionem interjectione dispargerent,\nhunc malui in locum distulisse, aliter atque aliter\ncommendata ab emendatoribus Ptolomaei. Extiterunt\nenim de schola ipsius discipuli super magistrum,\nqui duplex conjugium Bytho suo adfingerent,\nCogitationem et Voluntatem. Una enim satis non\nerat Cogitatio, qua nihil producere potuisset, ex\nduabus facillimo prolatu . Primum conjugium,\nMonogenem et  Veritatem; ad imaginem quidem\nCogitationis, foeminam Veritatem; ad imaginem\n Voluntatis, marem Monogenem. Voluntatis enim vis,\nuti quae  effectum praestat Cogitationi, maris\nobtinet censum .",
