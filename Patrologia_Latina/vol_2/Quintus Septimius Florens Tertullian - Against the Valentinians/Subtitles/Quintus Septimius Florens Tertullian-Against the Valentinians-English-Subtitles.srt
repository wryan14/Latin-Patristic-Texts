1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,616
Chapter One

2
00:00:02,616 --> 00:00:08,668
The followers of Valentinus, a significant group among the heretics, have many who have strayed from the truth.

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:12,267
They are easily drawn to tales and are not deterred by discipline.

4
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:17,283
They focus on concealing their teachings, if they teach at all, because they prefer to hide.

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,010
Guarding their doctrine is a matter of conscience.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,845
They preach confusion while claiming it as religion.

7
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:28,679
Even those Eleusinian mysteries, a type of Athenian superstition, are embarrassed by what they keep secret.

8
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,860
They first test those who seek them out.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,968
Initiation is a lengthy process, taking five years at the gates, to build a reputation by withholding knowledge.

10
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:40,839
This builds up a sense of majesty through the anticipation they create.

11
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:45,474
Then comes the obligation of silence; what is discovered slowly is carefully guarded.

12
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:51,417
All the divinity is hidden in inner sanctuaries, behind many veils, with the entire secret sealed by silence.

13
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:59,105
The image of the male organ is revealed, but the venerable name of nature, cloaked in allegory, obscures the sacrilege with a guise of truth.

14
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:08,811
Therefore, those we now call heretics use sacred names, titles, and arguments of true religion to craft vain and disgraceful tales, taking advantage of many divine opportunities.

15
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:15,682
The Valentinian Eleusinian mysteries have become enticing, sacred in their great silence, and celestial only in their secrecy.

16
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:44,908
If you ask sincerely, with a serious expression and a raised eyebrow, they respond, "It is profound." If you subtly inquire, they affirm common beliefs with ambiguous language. If you show understanding, they deny what they acknowledge. If you argue closely, they confuse your straightforwardness with their cunning. They do not even share these teachings with their own disciples until they have fully indoctrinated them. They have the skill to persuade before they teach, whereas truth persuades by teaching, not the other way around.

17
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,384
Chapter Two

18
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:56,343
We are often criticized for being simple, as if that’s all we are, and not wise as well—as if wisdom must vanish when simplicity is present.

19
00:01:56,343 --> 00:03:12,015
However, the Lord combines both:
"Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves" Matthew 10:16.
If we are thought foolish because we are simple, then are they not simple because they are wise?
Those who lack simplicity can be harmful, just as those who lack wisdom can be foolish.
I would prefer to be seen as having a lesser fault, believing it is better to know less than to know incorrectly, to err rather than to deceive.
Moreover, God looks favorably upon those who seek Him with simplicity, as Wisdom itself teaches—this is not the Wisdom of Valentinus, but of Solomon.
Furthermore, children bore witness to Christ by being anointed with blood.
Do you call those who cry out for the cross children?
They were neither children nor infants, meaning they were not simple.
The Apostle also urges us to become like children in following God First Corinthians 14:20, to be innocent in evil through simplicity, and thus wise in understanding; at the same time, entering the realm of wisdom that stems from simplicity.
In summary, a dove is known to represent Christ, while a serpent is known to tempt.
The dove has always been a symbol of divine peace; the serpent, from the beginning, a thief of the divine image.
Thus, simplicity alone can more easily recognize and reveal God, while prudence alone tends to unsettle and betray.

20
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,783
Chapter Three

21
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:20,407
So, let the serpent hide itself as much as it can, twisting and turning through its concealed paths.

22
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:28,167
It lives deep, buried in darkness, weaving through winding routes, never fully revealing itself, as it is a creature that shuns the light.

23
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:32,722
Our dove's home is simple too, always in high, open places, basking in the light.

24
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:36,377
It embodies the spirit of the Holy Spirit, the essence of Christ.

25
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:47,117
The truth is only embarrassed by being hidden:
for it is never ashamed to listen to Him, to recognize Him as God, whom nature has already entrusted to it, whom it feels in all works each day.

26
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:53,809
It remains less known only because it did not see Him as unique, naming Him among others, worshipping Him among others.

27
00:03:53,809 --> 00:04:04,662
Otherwise, persuading one from the crowd and moving to another assembly, shifting from a familiar rule to an unknown, twisting from the obvious to the hidden, is to challenge faith at its core.

28
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:13,322
Now, if it were part of a complete fable, wouldn’t it remind you of stories from childhood, like those about the towers of Lamia and the combs of the sun?

29
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:33,060
But if someone comes to faith from another understanding, encountering so many names of Aeons, marriages, offspring, outcomes, events, fortunes, and misfortunes of a fragmented divinity, won't they hesitate, seeing them as fables and endless genealogies, which the spirit of the Apostles foresaw to condemn when heretical seeds were already sprouting?

30
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:46,949
Rightly, then, they are not simple, rightly only shrewd, who neither easily produce such things nor defend them openly, but do not fully teach everyone they instruct; cunningly so, if they are shameful: otherwise inhumanely, if they are honorable.

31
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,536
And yet we, the simple, understand everything.

32
00:04:49,536 --> 00:05:02,357
In short, we have armed ourselves with this first wedge of conflict, the revealer and marker of their entire conscience, and we begin this first victory:
because to simply reveal what is hidden with such effort is to destroy it.

33
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:05,639
Chapter Four

34
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,296
We know where they came from and why they're called Valentinians, even if they don't always seem to be.

35
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:17,448
They have strayed from their founder, but their origin can't be erased; any change they make only highlights it.

36
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,731
Valentinus had hoped to become a bishop, as he was both talented and eloquent.

37
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:27,498
However, he was disappointed when someone else was chosen for the position due to the honor of martyrdom.

38
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:32,111
Driven by ambition, he left the established church and aimed to challenge the truth.

39
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:35,297
He adopted an old belief and paved the way for Colarbasus.

40
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:47,270
Ptolemaeus later expanded on this, defining Aeons with names and numbers as personal entities, but set apart from God, unlike Valentinus, who integrated them into the divine nature as thoughts, feelings, and movements.

41
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,048
Heracleon, Secundus, and the magician Marcus also developed paths from this foundation.

42
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:55,288
Theotimus worked extensively on interpretations of the Law.

43
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,165
Even though Valentinus is no longer around, there are still Valentinians who trace their roots back to him.

44
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:07,151
Only in Antioch does Axionicus single-handedly uphold Valentinus' memory by strictly following his teachings.

45
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:11,929
Otherwise, this heresy is as changeable as a she-wolf that alters her appearance daily.

46
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:12,369
Why not?

47
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,774
They believe their spiritual essence is unique to each person.

48
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:23,408
When they introduce something new, they quickly call it a revelation, viewing their assumptions as gifts, celebrating diversity over unity.

49
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:36,040
This leads to noticeable divisions among them, even among those who speak sincerely, saying, "This isn't right;" "I see it differently;" or "I don't accept this."
Their beliefs constantly shift, adding layers of ignorance as well.

50
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,575
Chapter Five

51
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:47,421
For me, the distinction lies with the original teachings of the main instructors, not with the imitation leaders followed by passive students.

52
00:06:47,421 --> 00:07:01,511
We can't claim to have invented these subjects ourselves, as so many people, distinguished by holiness and excellence—not only our predecessors but also contemporaries of these heresiarchs—have both revealed and refuted them in the most informed writings.

53
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:14,992
Think of figures like Justin, the philosopher and martyr, or Miltiades, the sophist of the Churches, or Irenaeus, the most thorough investigator of all doctrines, or our Proculus, known for the dignity of virgin old age and Christian eloquence.

54
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:18,694
I aspire to follow them in every work of faith, including this one.

55
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:27,314
If heresies did not exist, as some claim those who oppose them have invented them, then the Apostle who spoke of them would be lying—First Corinthians 2:19.

56
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:31,679
Furthermore, if heresies do exist, they are precisely those being reconsidered.

57
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:37,204
No one would be idle enough with a pen to invent subjects when there are already so many to address.

58
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:40,247
Chapter Six

59
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:47,196
In this little book, where we aim to demonstrate that secret, don't be confused by names that are foreign, forced, or ambiguous.

60
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:49,639
Let me first explain how we'll be using them.

61
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:57,944
Some Greek interpretations don't easily translate into recognizable names, and some don't match in gender, while others are more commonly known in Greek.

62
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,636
So, we'll often use Greek; meanings will be provided in the margins.

63
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:08,422
Even for the Latin, Greek references will appear above the lines, especially for personal names, due to overlapping meanings.

64
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:16,456
Although I've held back from fully diving in, focusing on the narrative for now, if any unworthiness deserves criticism, it won't be a brief attack.

65
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,550
Think of it as a prelude to the real battle, dear Reader.

66
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,613
I'll show wounds but not inflict them.

67
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:28,290
If there's laughter to be found, it will come from the material itself; many things are too unworthy to be taken seriously.

68
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,461
Vanity naturally gives way to amusement.

69
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:33,990
Truth finds joy in laughter and mocks its rivals with confidence.

70
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,061
We must ensure that its laughter doesn't become laughable if it's unworthy.

71
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,830
However, when laughter is justified, it is fitting.

72
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,350
And with that, I will begin.

73
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,815
Chapter Seven

74
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:53,479
The first Roman poet, Ennius, described the vast halls of heaven, likely inspired by Jupiter feasting there as depicted in Homer.

75
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:59,360
It's fascinating how some heretics have imagined and exaggerated the grandeur of their god's abode.

76
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,974
Even for our creator, Ennius' halls resemble small houses, stacked with different levels, assigning each god as many steps as there are heresies.

77
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:10,350
The world has turned into a marketplace.

78
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,043
Imagine an island of Felicula with countless layers of heaven; who knows where.

79
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:18,666
For the God of the Valentinians resides at the highest point.

80
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:27,637
They call him ΑΙΩΝΑ ΤΕΛΕΙΟΝ in essence, and personally ΠΡΟΑΡΧΗΝ and ΤΗΝ ΑΡΧΗΝ, also Bythus, which seems unfitting for someone dwelling in such heights.

81
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:39,280
They describe him as unborn, vast, infinite, invisible, and eternal, as if defining him this way proves his existence, because we assume he must be like that to be said to exist before everything.

82
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:48,785
But I ask for proof of his existence: and notice nothing more than those found after everything are claimed to be before everything, and not by their own doing.

83
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:58,765
So let this Bythus exist in infinite past ages, in great and high calm, in much leisure, embodying a peaceful and, so to speak, stunned divinity, as Epicurus suggested.

84
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:06,963
Yet, despite their desire for him to be alone, they assign him a second presence within himself, Ennoea, also known as Charis and Silence.

85
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:13,973
They might even, in this highly praised calm, counsel him to finally bring forth the beginning of things from himself.

86
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:18,725
He places this as a seed in his Silence, akin to the generative parts of a womb.

87
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:27,101
She immediately receives it, becomes pregnant, and gives birth silently to Nous, who is very similar to and equal to the father in every way.

88
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:32,566
Ultimately, only he can comprehend the immense and incomprehensible greatness of the father.

89
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:37,556
Thus, he is also called Father, the beginning of everything, and uniquely Monogenes.

90
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:42,412
However, it's not entirely accurate, since he isn't recognized alone.

91
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:45,688
Along with him came the female, Truth, the Only Begotten.

92
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:49,825
Being born first, how much more fitting it is to call him the Firstborn!

93
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:58,617
Therefore, Depth and Silence, along with Mind and Truth, form the first chariot defended by the Valentinian faction, the source and origin of all things.

94
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:04,363
There, Mind, as soon as it began its role of expression, also emitted from itself the Word and Life.

95
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,213
Which, if they weren't present before, certainly were not in Depth.

96
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,086
And how could it be that there was no life in God!

97
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:19,591
This offspring, sent forth at the beginning of the universe and the formation of the entire Fullness, produces fruit by creating Man and the Church.

98
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:27,233
You have an Ogdoad, a double Tetrad, from the unions of males and females; the dwelling places, so to speak, of the primordial Aeons.

99
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:38,266
The fraternal marriages of the Valentinian gods; the census of all heretical sanctity and majesty; an unknown crowd of either crimes or divinities, certainly the source of remaining fertility.

100
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,495
Chapter Eight

101
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:47,510
Behold, the second Tetrad: Word and Life, Human and Church, flourishing in the glory of the Father.

102
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:55,103
Eager to offer something of their own to the Father, they bring forth additional offspring through the union of both natures.

103
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:58,384
Here, Word and Life together produce a group of Aeons.

104
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:06,767
Meanwhile, Human and Church add two more, matching their parents, as they too, along with the ten, create as many as they themselves made.

105
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:16,123
Now, let me give you the names of this group: Bythos and Mixis; Ageratos and Henosis; Autophyes and Hedone; Acinetos and Syncrasis; Nonogenes and Macaria.

106
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:26,693
In contrast, the number twelve includes: Paracletus and Pistis; Patricos and Elpis; Metricos and Agape; Ainus and Synesis; Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes; Theletus and Sophia.

107
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:30,824
Here, I'm compelled to share an example of what these names signify.

108
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:36,535
In the Carthaginian schools, there was a rather uninspired Latin rhetorician named Phosphorus.

109
00:12:36,535 --> 00:13:24,041
When he praised a brave man, he said, "I come to you, excellent citizens, from the battle, with my victory, with your happiness, expanded, glorious, fortunate, greatest, triumphant." The students immediately shouted, "The Family of Phosphorus: Alas! You heard Fortunata, and Hedone, and Acinetos, and Theletus, shout: The Family of Ptolemy, Alas."
This is that mysterious Pleroma, the fullness of the divine trinity. Let's explore the significance of these numbers: four, eight, and twelve. Meanwhile, in the thirty, all fertility ceases; the strength, power, and generative desire of the Aeons are halted. As if there were not enough remaining ideas and no other names from the school. Why aren't fifty and one hundred also created? Why aren't they called Dung and Foster-children?

110
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:27,239
Chapter Nine

111
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:36,032
This is also favoritism, where only Nus, among everyone, has the privilege of knowing the immense Father, rejoicing and exulting while others remain sorrowful.

112
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:44,824
Indeed, Nus, as much as it was within his power, both wanted and attempted to share with others his knowledge of how great and incomprehensible the Father was.

113
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,746
However, the Mother, Silence, intervened—she even commands her own heretics to be silent.

114
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:55,386
Although they claim it was by the Father's will, desiring everyone to be stirred with longing for Him.

115
00:13:55,386 --> 00:14:02,298
Therefore, while they are tormented within themselves, consumed by a silent desire to know the Father, a near-crime occurred.

116
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:14,132
Among the twelve Aeons that Man and Church produced, the youngest Aeon, forgive the solecism, named Sophia, in her lack of self-control, without her partner Philetus, impulsively sought to inquire about the Father.

117
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:25,855
She contracted a kind of fault, which had indeed begun in those around Nus, but spread to her, that is, to Sophia, much like how faults originating in one part of the body often spread their harm to another part.

118
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:31,385
But under the guise of love for the Father, jealousy overcame Nus, who alone rejoiced in the Father.

119
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:39,016
As Sophia, striving for the impossible, was frustrated and overwhelmed by difficulty, she was nearly consumed by her affection and effort.

120
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:54,610
She was about to dissolve into the remaining substance and would not have stopped except by perishing, if not for the good fortune of encountering Horon—a certain force, the foundation, the external guardian of that universe—also known as the Cross, the Redeemer, and the Harvester.

121
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:05,615
So Sophia, rescued from danger and gradually convinced, ceased her investigation of the Father and laid out all her Enthymesis, that is, her animation with the Passion that had additionally occurred.

122
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,879
Chapter Ten

123
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,642
Some envisioned Sophia's restoration differently.

124
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:22,126
After several unsuccessful attempts and the loss of hope, I believe she was marked by paleness, thinness, and neglect of her appearance, as she mourned a father not only lost but denied.

125
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:26,692
In her sorrow, she conceived alone, without any help, and gave birth to a female.

126
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,157
Are you surprised by this?

127
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,356
Even a hen can lay eggs without a mate.

128
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:34,978
It's also said that vultures only produce females, becoming mothers without males.

129
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:43,884
Initially, she grieved over the unfulfillment of her creation, then feared an end would come, puzzled over the situation, and worried about keeping it hidden.

130
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,180
There were no remedies.

131
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,606
For where were the tragedies and comedies from which she could borrow a way to reveal what was born without shame?

132
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:59,554
In her distress, she looked up and turned to the Father, but her efforts were in vain, and her strength left her, so she resorted to prayers.

133
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:02,598
Her entire family also prayed for her, especially Nus.

134
00:16:02,598 --> 00:16:03,049
Why not?

135
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,529
He was the cause of such a great misfortune.

136
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,855
However, Sophia had no way out and her struggles continued.

137
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:15,280
Indeed, at that time, the conflict reached the origin of Matter; ignorance, fear, and sorrow became her substance.

138
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:25,258
Finally, the Father was moved and, through Monogenes Nus, whom we previously mentioned as Horon, revealed in his image a female to a male, as they differ in the Father's gender.

139
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:29,767
They add that Horon is also called Metagogea, meaning the guide, and Horotheten.

140
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:41,040
They proclaim the works of this one, who restrained from illicit things, purified from evils, strengthened Sophia thereafter, and restored her to her rightful place, while she remained in the Pleroma.

141
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,368
Her thought and that appendage of Passion were banished and crucified by Horon, and made external, as they say, Evil was cast out.

142
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:58,233
Yet that spiritual substance, like a natural impulse of the Aeon, was formless and unshaped, as it had grasped nothing; therefore, it was pronounced a weak fruit and a female.

143
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:02,063
Chapter Eleven

144
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:11,495
After Enthymesis was banished and his mother Sophia was reunited with her husband, the Only-Begotten, also known as Nus, was once again free from his father’s duties and oversight.

145
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:16,316
He concentrated on strengthening and stabilizing the Pleroma to prevent further disruptions.

146
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:24,961
He created a new pairing, Christ and the Holy Spirit—an unusual duo of two males, unless the Holy Spirit is female, which would imply a male is affected by a female.

147
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,791
Their mission was to maintain harmony among the Aeons.

148
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:34,497
From this shared responsibility, two schools of thought quickly emerged, marking the beginning of Valentinus's divided doctrine.

149
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:38,008
Christ's role was to teach the Aeons about the nature of couplings.

150
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:47,230
He enabled them to recognize the Father within themselves, which they couldn’t perceive or understand otherwise, not through sight or hearing, except through the Only-Begotten.

151
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,684
Yet, I will allow them to learn about the Father so that they may not truly know him.

152
00:17:51,684 --> 00:18:03,002
I will highlight the distortion of this doctrine, which claims that the Father’s incomprehensibility is the reason for their eternity, while his comprehensibility is seen as the cause of their creation and existence.

153
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:14,634
This setup, I believe, implies that it is preferable for God not to be understood: because his incomprehensibility leads to eternity, while his comprehensibility pertains to birth and formation, for those lacking eternity.

154
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:18,406
However, they regard the Son as the comprehensible aspect of the Father.

155
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:22,022
How he is to be understood was taught by Christ when he was revealed.

156
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:29,515
The Holy Spirit’s proper role is that, through dedicated teaching, everyone might equally learn how to give thanks and be guided to true peace.

157
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,903
Chapter Twelve

158
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:40,409
In this chapter, everyone is equal in form and wisdom, each becoming their true self; no one is different because they are all alike.

159
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:44,304
They merge back into Nus, into Sermones, into Men, and into Philetos.

160
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:54,518
Women also merge into Sigas, into Zoas, into Churches, and into Fortunatas, such that if Ovid had known of a greater transformation today, he would have rewritten his Metamorphoses.

161
00:18:54,518 --> 00:19:01,573
From there, they find refreshment, are established, and enter a state of rest from truth, singing joyous hymns to the Father.

162
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:06,821
The Father is filled with joy, naturally, as his children and grandchildren sing beautifully.

163
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,756
Why wouldn't he be happy, with the Pleroma set free?

164
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:12,747
What captain doesn't rejoice, even amidst challenges?

165
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,343
We see sailors celebrating joyfully every day.

166
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:19,802
In the same way sailors celebrate with a feast, the Aeons do something similar.

167
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:30,129
All have become one, not just in thought but also in form, welcoming new brothers and teachers like Christ and the Holy Spirit, each offering something of the best and most beautiful.

168
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,105
However, I think this is pointless.

169
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:40,852
If everyone was already one due to the equality mentioned earlier, then the reason for the feast is lost, as it usually thrives on the pleasure of variety.

170
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:44,746
They all contributed one good thing, which they all essentially were.

171
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:48,527
Perhaps the focus was on the manner or form of the equality itself.

172
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:56,823
So, from their collective offering, in honor and glory of the Father, they created the most beautiful star and perfect fruit of the Pleroma: Jesus.

173
00:19:56,823 --> 00:20:01,056
They named him Savior, Christ, and Word, drawing from the paternal lineage.

174
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:10,650
Now, everything, crafted from the essence of all, became like the Daw of Aesop, Pandora of Hesiod, the Dish of Accius, the Drink of Nestor, and the Miscellany of Ptolemy.

175
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,407
How close it was to being called the All-Fruit from some Attic works, by such imaginative name-givers!

176
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:21,994
To further embellish this small statue, they bring forth angels as his attendants, similar in kind.

177
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:33,055
If this happens among themselves, it makes sense, but if they are of the same substance as the Savior (which I found ambiguously stated), what will be his distinction among these equal attendants?

178
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:37,055
Chapter Thirteen

179
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:43,880
This order, therefore, includes the initial procession of both the emerging and the marrying, as well as the generating Aeons.

180
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:59,965
Sophia's perilous fall, driven by her longing for the Father, Horus's timely help, the purification of Enthymesis and the related Passion, the guidance of Christ and the Holy Spirit, the reformation under the Aeons' protection, Soter's peacock-like adornment, and the angelic authority comparison.

181
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,865
You might wonder what's left for you to do—be well and applaud, perhaps?

182
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:06,736
Instead, I suggest you listen and let go of the rest.

183
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:13,072
These events are said to have taken place within the assembly of the Pleroma, marking the first scene of the tragedy.

184
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:25,313
But if someone else is to step forward, it happens outside the Pleroma, I say:
And yet, if such things occur under the Father's protection within Horus's domain, what might happen outside in freedom, where God was not present?

185
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,463
Chapter Fourteen

186
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:39,342
Enthymesis, or Achamoth as it's sometimes called, was expelled along with the flaw of her deep-seated Passion into regions beyond the light of the Pleroma, into the empty void described by Epicurus.

187
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:41,485
She was miserable even in her location.

188
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:45,661
She had neither form nor appearance, being a flawed and incomplete creation.

189
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:55,057
In this state, Christ, moved by higher powers, was guided by Horos to shape this unformed being with the power of his own substance, though without fully knowing its form.

190
00:21:55,057 --> 00:22:02,309
She was given some hope, momentarily infused with the essence of incorruptibility, to prepare her for the desire for greater things.

191
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,144
Having shown this mercy, accompanied by the Holy Spirit, Christ returned to the Pleroma.

192
00:22:07,144 --> 00:22:10,386
He took the opportunity to add names from acts of kindness.

193
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:22,254
Enthymesis arose from action, and the origin of Achamoth remains a matter of debate; Sophia flows from the Father; the Holy Spirit is from the angel with Christ, from whom she immediately felt desire when left alone.

194
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:28,737
She rushed to seek his light; if she had not known it invisibly, how could she have sought his unknown light with him?

195
00:22:28,737 --> 00:23:09,561
Despite her efforts, she might have succeeded if not for Horos, who had once favored her mother but now met her unfavorably, even shouting "JAO," like "Forward, citizens," or "Trust in Caesar," as found in the Scriptures.
Thus, she was driven away and could not cross the threshold, which is Horos, as she had not been prepared in any of Catullus' Laureolus.
Left to her Passion in a complex and intricate snare, she was afflicted by all kinds of emotions: sorrow for not completing her endeavor, fear of being deprived of life as she was of light, overwhelmed and ignorant.
Unlike her mother, who was an Aeon, Enthymesis was in a worse condition, which led her to turn to Christ, who had given her life, and in this turning, she was tempered.

196
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,936
Chapter Fifteen

197
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:20,817
Let the Pythagoreans learn, the Stoics acknowledge, and even Plato understand where the matter they claim is innate actually originates.

198
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:26,496
This is something that even Mercury Trismegistus, the master of all physicists, hadn't considered.

199
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:35,536
You've heard of Conversion, another kind of Passion; from this, it's said that every soul in this world was constituted, even that of the Demiurge, our God.

200
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:39,244
You've heard of sorrow and fear; from these, other things began.

201
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:42,200
From his tears, the entire nature of waters flowed.

202
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,546
Consider what outcome this led to, and how many kinds of tears it produced.

203
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:54,601
There were false ones, bitter ones, sweet ones, warm ones, cold ones, bituminous ones, rusty ones, sulfurous ones, and even poisonous ones.

204
00:23:54,601 --> 00:24:02,888
Nonacris sweated from it, which killed Alexander, Lyncestus flowed from it, making people drunk, and Salmacis dissolved from it, weakening men.

205
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:08,103
Achamoth wept celestial rains; and we even preserve foreign sorrows and tears in cisterns.

206
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:11,522
Thus, from distress and fear, physical elements were drawn.

207
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:19,113
Yet, in such solitude, in such abandonment, she laughed, remembering seeing Christ, and from that joy, the light of laughter shone.

208
00:24:19,113 --> 00:24:21,547
What benefit of providence made her laugh?

209
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:24,329
Perhaps so we wouldn't always dwell in darkness.

210
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:32,152
Don't be amazed, since her joy radiated such a splendid element to the world, just as her sorrow provided a necessary tool for the age.

211
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:33,543
O illuminating laughter!

212
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:34,644
O nourishing tears!

213
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:38,526
She could already act as a remedy against the horror of that place.

214
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:45,190
For she could dispel all its darkness whenever she wanted to laugh, or so she wouldn't need to apply her deserters.

215
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:49,104
Chapter Sixteen

216
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,726
She indeed turns to prayers in a motherly manner.

217
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:57,561
But Christ, who was already hesitant to leave the Pleroma again, appointed the Paraclete as a representative.

218
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:07,304
The Savior, granted by the Father of all Aeons the supreme power to subject them all, sends him with the duty and company of coeval angels; you might even believe with twelve groups.

219
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:15,119
There, at last, with his grand arrival, Achamoth was shaken and immediately covered herself with a veil as her first act of reverence and modesty.

220
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,528
Then she looks at him, a fruitful suggestion.

221
00:25:17,528 --> 00:26:00,620
With the strength she gained from this, she approaches him, saying, "Lord, Hail."
Presumably, he acknowledges and confirms her, cleansing her from all injuries of the Passion, not with the same negligence that had occurred in the mother's downfall.
However, he confounded the vices that had been practiced and perfected through use; and thus, solidly united, he fixed them separately in the material preparation of the body.
He transformed the innate incorporeal passion into the ability and nature by which he could soon reach rival equivalencies of bodies, arranging a dual condition of substances: from vices, the worst; from conversion, passionate.
This will be the matter that brought us into contention with Hermogenes and others who assume that God created all things from matter, not from nothing.

222
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:03,864
Chapter Seventeen

223
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:09,942
From this point, Achamoth, finally free from all troubles, begins to grow and thrive in greater works.

224
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:19,001
Overjoyed by such success arising from misfortune, and inspired by the contemplation of the angelic lights, she, in a way, absorbed them within herself.

225
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:27,225
She immediately became spiritually pregnant with the image she had seen and the joyful, eager intention she had embraced and internalized.

226
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:39,085
Eventually, she gave birth, resulting in a trinity of kinds, emerging from a trinity of causes:
one material, from passion; another animal, from conversion; and the third spiritual, from imagination.

227
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,096
Chapter Eighteen

228
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:48,834
Having three children gave her the authority and experience to manage things, leading her to create different types of beings.

229
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:53,861
However, she struggled to understand the spiritual realm because she herself wasn't spiritual.

230
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:58,567
Their nature, being nearly equal and of the same essence, didn't allow for such a union.

231
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:03,434
With this in mind, she turned to the animal kingdom, following the teachings of the Savior.

232
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:14,932
First, though it must be spoken, read, and heard with great horror for its blasphemy, she envisions God, our God and the Father of all, except the heretics, as the Creator and King of everything that came after Him.

233
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:24,558
For everything originates from Him, if indeed it does, and not rather from Achamoth herself, who, without His knowledge, set everything in motion as if guided externally by a seal.

234
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:34,238
Finally, due to this ambiguity among the people and their works, they mixed the name of Metropator, using different names for others based on their roles and positions in the works.

235
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:44,025
They refer to the father of the animal substances on the right side, and the Creator for the material substances on the left side, while commonly calling Him the King of the universe.

236
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,328
Chapter Nineteen

237
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,986
The specific meanings of names don't align with the meanings of the works from which all these names originate.

238
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:58,185
Ideally, they should be named after the one who carries out the actions, but that's not the case here.

239
00:27:58,185 --> 00:28:04,862
When they say Achamoth created images in honor of the Aeons, they actually credit this to the author Soter, who worked through her.

240
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:11,744
This means she was intended to represent the image of the invisible and unknown Father—naturally unknown and invisible to the Demiurge.

241
00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:18,421
The Demiurge would then depict the son Nun, while the Archangels would illustrate the work of the Demiurge and the remaining Aeons.

242
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:24,436
When I hear about these grand images of the three, how can I not laugh at the images created by such a twisted artist?

243
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,730
A woman, Achamoth, as an image of the Father?

244
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,891
And the Demiurge, unaware of his mother, let alone his father?

245
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:32,184
An image of Nus that's unaware of the Father?

246
00:28:32,184 --> 00:28:35,039
And angels, as servants, merely copies of their masters?

247
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,066
It's like painting a mule from a donkey and describing Ptolemy from Valentinus.

248
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:42,360
Chapter Twenty

249
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:50,136
So, the Demiurge, being outside the boundaries of the Pleroma, created a new realm in the endless void of eternal exile, which is this world.

250
00:28:50,136 --> 00:29:00,780
He organized the chaos and differentiated the dual nature of animals and materials, forming bodies from incorporeal elements: heavy, light, ascending, and descending, celestial and terrestrial.

251
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,862
He completed the sevenfold structure of the heavens with his throne above.

252
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:12,307
That's why the Sabbath is named, from the week of his seat; and Ogdoad, the mother Achamoth, from the concept of the primordial Ogdoad.

253
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:18,484
They consider the heavens to be intelligent and sometimes equate them to angels, much like the Demiurge himself.

254
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:26,922
Paradise is also seen as the fourth archangel, as it is placed above the third heaven, from whose power Adam took, residing there among clouds and trees.

255
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:32,327
Ptolemy recalled enough of the fanciful notions, like apples growing in the sea and fish on trees.

256
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,974
Thus, he assumed there were nuts in the heavens.

257
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:40,931
The Demiurge works in ignorance, which might explain why he doesn't realize trees should only grow on earth.

258
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:42,420
Of course, the mother knew.

259
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,854
Why didn't she suggest it?

260
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:45,784
She who also exerted her influence.

261
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:56,098
By elevating her son with works that portray him as father, god, and king, even before the Valentinians' ideas, why she didn't want these things to be known to her, I will question later.

262
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,688
Chapter Twenty-One

263
00:29:59,688 --> 00:30:07,149
Interestingly, they referred to Sophia as Earth and Mother, almost like she was Mother Earth, and amusingly, even the Holy Spirit.

264
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:13,290
They seemed to give every honor to a woman, and perhaps even imagined her with a beard, among other things.

265
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:21,669
On the other hand, the Demiurge wasn't really in control, as spiritual matters were becoming involved with the census of animals regarding health.

266
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:43,363
He proclaimed, "I am God, and there is no one besides me" Isaiah Forty-five verse six.
Yet, he clearly understood that he wasn't alone in the past.
Therefore, he realized that something had been created, and there was indeed a creator of the creation.
So, how could he see himself as the only one?
Even if he wasn't completely sure, he at least suspected there was some creator.

267
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:46,512
Chapter Twenty-Two

268
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:53,328
The infamy surrounding the devil is somewhat more acceptable to them, perhaps because it originates from a more degrading source.

269
00:30:53,328 --> 00:31:00,408
They believe it arises from the evil of that sorrow, which they associate with the origins of angels, demons, and all spiritual evils.

270
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:06,062
Yet, they also claim that the devil is the work of the creator, referring to him as the ruler of the world.

271
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:15,415
They argue that he possesses greater knowledge of the higher realms, being a spiritual entity by nature, more so than the creator, whom they view as possessing an animal nature.

272
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,532
He is favored by them, to whom all heresies are attributed.

273
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,720
Chapter Twenty-Three

274
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,468
They place the strongholds of unique powers within these boundaries.

275
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:30,320
At the highest peaks resides the group of thirty, with Horos marking the outer boundary.

276
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,352
Below, Achamoth marks the middle, trampling on the son.

277
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:38,700
Beneath lies the creator in his realm, and even more so, the devil in this common world we share.

278
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,433
They are mingled and embodied, as previously mentioned, originating from the significant fall of Sophia.

279
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:48,899
Without Sophia's sorrow refining it, she wouldn't even have the space to breathe.

280
00:31:48,899 --> 00:32:00,256
The delicate garment of all bodies, the indicator of all colors, the instrument of times, all depend on this refinement—like the fear of creatures and even her transformation, including the creator himself.

281
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,178
Among all these elements and bodies, fire is ignited.

282
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:09,573
The original passion of Sophia, which they have not yet revealed, I will argue, is shaken by her minor disturbances.

283
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:12,991
You might even believe she created amidst such great troubles.

284
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:16,464
Chapter Twenty-Four

285
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:20,435
What kinds of stories about God or gods are similar to those about humans!

286
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:25,694
The creator, after making the world, focuses on humans but doesn't fully understand their essence.

287
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:33,423
It's said that humans didn't originate from the dry earth we know, even though it became dry later, once the waters receded, leaving mud to dry.

288
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:39,917
Instead, humans came from an invisible form of that material, specifically philosophical, in its liquid and molten state.

289
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,942
I can't determine where this material originated because it exists nowhere.

290
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:58,110
If the molten and liquid state is characteristic of a liquid, and all liquid flowed from the tears of Sophia, then we might believe that the mud was formed from the mucus and phlegm of Sophia, which are the sediment of tears, much like mud is the residue of water.

291
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,438
The creator shapes man and brings him to life with his breath.

292
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:06,375
This makes man both earthly and living, created in the image and likeness: a fourfold being.

293
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:11,527
The image is considered earthly, meaning material, although the creator is not made of material.

294
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:14,962
The likeness, however, is living, and the creator is living too.

295
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,250
So you have two aspects.

296
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,905
Meanwhile, they say a fleshly surface was added to the earthly being later, which is the leather tunic subject to sensation.

297
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:26,544
Chapter Twenty-Five

298
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:31,060
Within Achamoth, there was a unique spiritual seed from her mother Sophia's essence.

299
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,092
Achamoth kept this hidden from her son, the creator, without his awareness.

300
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:37,619
Think about the cleverness of this secret plan.

301
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:46,382
She placed and concealed it so that when the creator gave a soul from his own breath to Adam, that spiritual seed would also be transferred into the earthly being.

302
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:52,726
It would then grow within the material body, like in a womb, becoming ready to receive the perfect Word in the future.

303
00:33:52,726 --> 00:34:04,071
So, when the creator passed his soul into Adam, the spiritual human remained hidden, inserted through the breath, and was introduced into the body as well, since the creator knew neither the seed nor the mother.

304
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:09,071
This seed is known as the Church, reflecting the heavenly Church and the essence of humanity.

305
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:17,942
Therefore, they relate it to Achamoth, just as they connect the animate being to the creator and the earthly being to the beginning's substance: the flesh to matter.

306
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:20,737
Here you have the new concept, the quadruple Geryon.

307
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,168
Chapter Twenty-Six

308
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:26,434
They also divide the outcome for each one.

309
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:32,533
For the material, which they refer to as the carnal, is called left, and they predict certain destruction for it.

310
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:40,844
But for the animal, which they call right, the outcome is uncertain, as it wavers between the material and the spiritual, going where it is most inclined.

311
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:46,781
However, they say the spiritual can join with the animal and can be educated and trained through interactions.

312
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:50,774
They claim the animal needed instruction even in the sensible disciplines.

313
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:58,924
In this, the preparation of the world was foreseen, and in this, the Savior was represented in the world as an animal, for the salvation of the animal.

314
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:05,670
In another complex composition, they wish that he would take on the properties of the substances he would bring to salvation.

315
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:11,444
That he received the spiritual from Achamoth, and the animal, which he soon took from the demiurge, Christ.

316
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:17,273
However, the bodily aspect, from the animal substance, was crafted with a marvelous and indescribable skill.

317
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:25,045
For the purpose of administration, he brought power, to be subject to engagement, and sight, and touch, and even death, though it was unwelcome.

318
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:30,819
Yet, there was nothing material in him, as he was foreign to salvation, except for those needing salvation.

319
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,702
And all of this was to separate the nature of our flesh from Christ and to remove even the hope of salvation.

320
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:40,344
Chapter Twenty-Seven

321
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:51,804
Now, let's talk about Christ: some people freely insert Jesus into this discussion, much like they infuse spiritual seed into the soul with their breath, creating a sort of blend of both men and their deities.

322
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:55,314
They claim that their Christ is the natural son of the Demiurge.

323
00:35:55,314 --> 00:36:00,304
He was eventually revealed as a living being by the Demiurge and announced by the prophets.

324
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:15,330
Christ was involved in the concept of the Prepositions, meaning he was brought forth through a virgin but not born from her, as he passed through the virgin in a manner of transmission, not generation; through her, not from her; seeing her not as a mother, but as a pathway.

325
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:21,197
They say that during the sacrament of baptism, the Savior descended upon this Christ in the form of a dove.

326
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:27,284
Moreover, Christ had a spiritual enhancement from Achamoth, to keep the rest of the mixture from deteriorating.

327
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:39,403
In the likeness of the principal Tetrad, he was surrounded by four substances: the spiritual from Achamoth, the living from the Demiurge, the indescribable bodily one, and the one from the Savior, represented by the dove.

328
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:44,119
The Savior remained within Christ, incapable of suffering, unharmed, and beyond grasp.

329
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,835
Ultimately, when it was time for his capture, he departed during Pilate's questioning.

330
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:55,470
Therefore, he did not allow the seed of the mother to suffer harm, equally resistant, and not even known to the Demiurge.

331
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:08,247
However, the living and fleshly Christ did suffer, serving as a representation of the higher Christ, who had been affixed to the Cross, that is, Horus, in a substantial form for the creation of Achamoth, not in a form of recognition.

332
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:13,292
Thus, they interpret everything into images, clearly making themselves imaginary Christians.

333
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,824
Chapter Twenty-Eight

334
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:25,240
Meanwhile, the Creator of all things remained unaware of what was happening, even though he preached through the Prophets without fully understanding his own work.

335
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,268
They also divided prophetic support among Achamoth, the seed, and the Creator.

336
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:36,704
Upon hearing about the arrival of the Savior, he eagerly and joyfully hurried over with all his forces, much like the Centurion from the Gospel.

337
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:41,919
Enlightened about everything, he even learns from the Savior about his hope of succeeding his mother.

338
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:49,665
Reassured from that moment on, he continues to manage this world, especially under the guise of protecting the Church, for as long as it is necessary.

339
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:52,872
Chapter Twenty-Nine

340
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:59,128
Let's now bring together what we've discussed to conclude our exploration of the nature of humanity as a whole.

341
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:09,782
Initially, we talked about a threefold nature, but this unity in Adam is broken down through the unique traits of his descendants, with distinctions also drawn from their moral differences.

342
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:16,377
Cain, Abel, and Seth, in a sense, represent the origins of the human race, offering insights into nature and essence.

343
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:24,155
The chaotic and lost are linked to Cain; the hopeful and intermediate to Abel; and the spiritually destined for certain salvation to Seth.

344
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:31,201
They differentiate souls further by two properties, good and bad: chaos from Cain, animal from Abel, and spiritual from Seth.

345
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:39,600
They don't attribute these outcomes to nature, but rather to indulgence, suggesting those given good souls by Achamoth fall into the animal category.

346
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,109
For those with chaotic, or bad souls, they can never perceive what's beneficial.

347
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:47,322
This nature is considered unchangeable and beyond reform.

348
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:57,637
Therefore, the small grain of spiritual seed grows through faith, as we mentioned previously:
and through this, these souls excel, such that the Demiurge, once unaware, elevated them.

349
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:08,516
From this group, he would choose kings and priests:
who, by fully understanding these concepts, naturally become spiritual and are granted certain salvation, rightfully deserved in every sense.

350
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:11,784
Chapter Thirty

351
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:17,307
They don't consider necessary tasks important for themselves, nor do they follow any duties of discipline.

352
00:39:17,307 --> 00:39:21,476
They also avoid the need for martyrdom with whatever interpretation they prefer.

353
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:30,125
They believe this rule is meant for the natural order, that we must work for salvation, which we don't have by privilege of status, but through the support of action.

354
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:39,348
For us, who are the imperfect essence, this seed is inscribed because we are seen, due to the loves of Philetus, and indeed destined for incomplete development, as their mother.

355
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:42,892
But woe to us if we have in any way exceeded the yoke of discipline.

356
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:46,018
If we have become inactive in works of holiness and justice.

357
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:52,427
If we wish to confess elsewhere, I don't know where, and not under the authorities of this age, in the courts of governors.

358
00:39:52,427 --> 00:40:01,234
They claim their nobility both from accepting life's passivity and from the diligence of sins, with Achamoth flattering them, for she herself also progressed by sinning.

359
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:10,665
For in honor of the unions of the higher realms, it is said among them that it is always a mystery to be meditated upon and celebrated by attaching to a companion, that is, a woman.

360
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:18,169
Otherwise, he is considered degenerate and not legitimate in truth, who has not loved a woman, nor joined with her while wandering in the world.

361
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:20,982
And what will the eunuchs, whom we see among them, do?

362
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,432
Chapter Thirty-One

363
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:27,788
Now, we reach the conclusion and the distribution of rewards.

364
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:40,280
When Achamoth has fully harvested her crop and begins gathering it into the barn, or when it's taken to the mills, ground into flour, and hidden in the kneading troughs until it's all leavened, then the completion will be near.

365
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:47,159
First, Achamoth herself is transferred from the middle region, from the second floor to the highest, restored to the Pleroma.

366
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,992
She is immediately received by the more compact Soter, the bridegroom, and together they form a new union.

367
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:58,110
This is what the scriptures refer to as the bridegroom and the bride, and the bridal Pleroma.

368
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:03,888
You might think that, when moving from place to place, the Julian laws also apply, as well as the supper.

369
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:12,308
Then, the Demiurge will move from the realm under heaven to higher places, into the now empty upper room of the mother, knowing and no longer seeing her.

370
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:16,270
If this were the case, he would have always preferred to remain unaware.

371
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:19,584
Chapter Thirty-Two

372
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:32,774
The human race will face this outcome: those who are marked by earthly and material things will meet total destruction, because all flesh is like grass, and the soul is mortal among them, except for those who find salvation through faith.

373
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:39,369
The souls of the righteous, which means our souls, will be sent to the receptacles of the Demiurge in the middle realm.

374
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,248
We give thanks, content to be counted with our God, to whom we ascend.

375
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:49,622
No animal nature is allowed into the palace of the Pleroma, except through the spiritual examination of Valentinus.

376
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:53,058
There, people are first stripped away, meaning the inner ones.

377
00:41:53,058 --> 00:42:00,429
To be stripped is to lay down the souls with which they were clothed and return them to their Demiurge, from whom they were diverted.

378
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:09,463
The spirits themselves will become entirely intellectual, subject neither to detention nor observation, and thus, they will be received invisibly into the Pleroma.

379
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:12,067
In secret, if it is so, then what happens next?

380
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:15,670
They will be distributed to the angels, companions of the Savior.

381
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,889
Will they become sons?

382
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:17,055
No.

383
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,607
Will they become attendants?

384
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:19,383
Not even that.

385
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:20,713
Will they become images?

386
00:42:20,713 --> 00:42:21,434
If only that.

387
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:23,983
Into what, then, if it is not shameful to say?

388
00:42:23,983 --> 00:42:24,648
Into brides.

389
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:28,971
Then they will applaud among themselves like the Sabines seized for marriages.

390
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:32,740
This will be the reward for the spiritual, the reward for believing.

391
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:49,311
Such stories are useful, like Marcus or Caius in this flesh with a beard, and all this; a stern husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, certainly masculine, in the bridal chamber of the Pleroma by an angel, I have already said by keeping silent, and perhaps you may bear some Onesimus Aeon.

392
00:42:49,311 --> 00:43:03,111
For these weddings to be rightly conducted, instead of a torch and bridal veil, then I believe that a secret fire will burst forth, consuming the entire substance; it will also end with everything turning to ashes into nothingness; and no more tale.

393
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:07,156
But indeed, I am reckless, having betrayed such a sacrament even in jest.

394
00:43:07,156 --> 00:43:15,082
I must fear lest Achamoth, who did not want to be recognized even by her son, goes mad; lest Philetus becomes angry, lest Fortune grows bitter.

395
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:29,325
And yet I am a man of the Demiurge, I have to turn there, where after departure, there is absolutely no obscuration; where I am clothed rather than stripped; where even if I am stripped of my gender, I am appointed to the angels; not an angel, not angeless.

396
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,440
No one will do anything to me,
and they'll also see him as a man then.

397
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,368
Chapter Thirty-Three

398
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:46,889
Finally, like an epilogue to this story, I'll share some insights that I chose to place here so they wouldn't disrupt the narrative or distract the reader with interruptions.

399
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:50,282
The editors of Ptolemy suggested presenting these differently.

400
00:43:50,282 --> 00:43:55,426
His students, who even surpassed him, claimed that Bythos had a dual nature: Thought and Will.

401
00:43:55,426 --> 00:44:00,296
One wasn't enough, as Thought alone couldn't create anything; but with both, it was easy.

402
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:07,683
The first union was between Only-Begotten and Truth; reflecting Thought, Truth is female, while reflecting Will, Only-Begotten is male.

403
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:11,678
The power of Will, which allows Thought to be effective, is seen as male.

404
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:14,880
Chapter Thirty-Four

405
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:25,733
Some, with a greater sense of modesty and respect for the honor of divinity, preferred not to assign any gender to Bythos, so as to avoid the disgrace of even a single marriage being associated with it.

406
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:38,898
Perhaps they use the neuter form to say "This God," rather than the masculine.
Others, however, describe it as both male and female, suggesting that the chronicler Fenestella does not believe hermaphrodites exist solely among the people of Luna.

407
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:41,928
Chapter Thirty-Five

408
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:51,977
Some people don't defend the leadership of Bythos itself, but rather something that came afterwards; they introduce the Ogdoad first, derived from the Tetrad but under different names.

409
00:44:51,977 --> 00:44:56,565
First, they propose Proarche, second Anennoeton, third Arrheton, and fourth Aoraton.

410
00:44:56,565 --> 00:45:11,639
From Proarche, they claim Archen emerged in both the first and fifth positions; from Anennoeton, Acatalepton in the second and sixth positions; from Arrheton, Anonomaston in the third and seventh positions; and from the invisible, Agenneton in the fourth and eighth positions.

411
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:19,286
As for the logic behind placing each entity in two positions, with such interruptions, I'd rather remain ignorant than try to understand it.

412
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:24,693
How can there be any correctness in these concepts when they are presented in such a distorted way?

413
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:27,888
Chapter Thirty-Six

414
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:36,033
How much better are those who have removed all this burden from the equation, not wanting any Aeon to be produced one from another in truly grim steps.

415
00:45:36,033 --> 00:46:08,562
Instead, as they say, "throwing in the towel," they brought forth this team of eight all at once from the Father and his Thought.
They carry names based on his very movement.
When, they say, he thought to bring them forth, he was called Father.
When he brought them forth, because he brought forth truth, this was called Truth.
When he wanted to test himself, he was proclaimed Man.
Those he had pre-thought and then brought forth were then called the Church.
Man uttered the Word, and this is the firstborn Son.
With the Word came Life, and the first Ogdoad was completed.
But this burden is not small.

416
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:11,616
Chapter Thirty-Seven

417
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:18,237
Here are some more ideas from Ennius Curruca, a notable teacher, who shared his thoughts with great authority.

418
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:26,363
He said that first and foremost, there is Proarche, something unimaginable, indescribable, and unnamed, which he refers to as Monoteta.

419
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:30,156
Alongside this was another power, which he also calls Henoteta.

420
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:41,232
Monotes and Henotes, meaning Solitude and Unity, when they were one, brought forth the intellectual beginning of everything, uncreated and invisible, which is referred to as the Monad.

421
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:45,024
Attached to this is a co-essential power, which he calls Union.

422
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:51,405
These powers—Solitude, Singularity, Unity, and Union—led to the creation of the other emanations of Aeons.

423
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:52,549
Oh, the difference!

424
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:59,170
Let Union and Unity, Singularity and Solitude be altered, for even though you have defined them, they are one.

425
00:46:59,592 --> 00:47:02,472
Chapter Thirty-Eight

426
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:08,584
Now more advanced, Secundus succinctly divides the Ogdoad into two Tetrads: right and left, light and darkness.

427
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:17,008
However, he chooses not to derive that leaping and failing power from any of the thirty Aeons, but rather from the fruits that come from their substance.

428
00:47:17,064 --> 00:47:19,992
Chapter Thirty-Nine

429
00:47:19,992 --> 00:47:22,903
How much disagreement exists about the Lord Jesus Himself?

430
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:29,932
Some believe He is formed from the essence of all Aeons, while others argue that He consists only of the ten brought forth by Word and Life.

431
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,744
Thus, the focus of Word and Life is directed toward Him.

432
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:36,459
Some suggest He is rather made from twelve, descended from Man and Church.

433
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,919
This is why they say He is called the Son of Man.

434
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:45,446
Others claim He was created by Christ and the Holy Spirit to establish the universe, justifiably as the heir to the Father's name.

435
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:53,227
There are those who believe the Son of Man should be understood differently, even though they assume the Father referred to humans with this profound name.

436
00:47:53,227 --> 00:47:57,445
What more can you expect from the faith of a God with whom you now compare yourself?

437
00:47:57,445 --> 00:48:00,808
Such notions thrive among them from the abundance of maternal seed.

438
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:06,532
And so, the expanding teachings of the Valentinians have now become entangled in the complexities of the Gnostics.
