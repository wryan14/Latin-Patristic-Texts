You propose that this dual nature should appear not separate, but confused. This is evident in the Letter of Potamius, which was sent from the East and the West. It claims that through the blood of Mary, the flesh and spirit of Christ were combined into one body, making God capable of suffering.

This was done to make sure no one believed Him to be impassible, which is well established.

You've created a third entity out of the Spirit of God and the flesh of man: because He is neither truly God if He ceases to be the Word (for He became flesh); nor truly man, because He was not purely flesh, as He was the Word.

And if He is neither, He, I say, distinguished both of His natures by their unique properties against this confusion.

The Spirit in Him governed virtues, works, and signs, while the flesh experienced its own passions.

He desired food when tempted by the devil:

He thirsted at the well of Samaria, even though the prophet's voice says: The eternal God neither thirsts nor hungers.

Why did He weep for Lazarus and Jerusalem out of human emotion?

Lastly, He was anxious unto death.

But what He expressed in emotion, did He not also testify with words?

For He said to Nicodemus: What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit (John 3:6); and He said, the flesh is weak, the spirit is willing (Matthew 26:41).

Therefore, the spirit does not become flesh, nor does flesh become spirit: what these teachers want is for the Lord and our God to be made capable of suffering from this mixture of substances.

They want Him to be seen as capable of suffering so that He may not be believed to be impassible.
