The objections of the heretics are resolved. However, before I establish what I promised, it is necessary to address the opposing arguments.

They say that the term 
substance
 does appear in the divine scriptures, but it does not pertain to the same nature that we assert. In those texts, the term 
substance
 signifies either power or divinity. Therefore, when we claim one substance of the Father and the Son, we are proclaiming the equal riches in both, namely, the riches of one divinity. The Apostle says: 

"God made known the riches of His glory" (Colossians 1:27), which is Christ.

And we say that the power of both is one, about which the same Apostle says: 
 "Christ is the power of God" (First Corinthians 1:24).

This power, because it needs no external help, is called substance, as we said above, whatever it is owing to itself.

Therefore, we say nothing new in this term, nothing foreign, nothing incongruous to divinity, even if it is transferred to any aspect of significance. 
 But, as I began to say, this entire question of the name is a different matter: it is not the word but the meaning of the word that displeases. 
With what ears can they hear that one substance of the Father and the Son is proclaimed, that is, the honor, dignity, clarity, power, and majesty common to both in equal truth;

those who separate the Son from the Father, and, with substances divided, propose that each one lives in his own property, rejecting the communion of divinity?

This, therefore, is the blasphemy, this is the sacrilegious pain, by which God is received as one in the Father and the Son.

For although the authors of this poison are dead, their crimes and doctrine do not die.

To those authors, I say, who so separate the Son from the Father that with sacrilegious mouth they have proclaimed that the Son of God was indeed created and established before the ages, but received life and existence from the Father: 
and that He existed before He was born;

and that He is indeed God, but not the true God.

Therefore, to the successors of this faithlessness, not faith, through whom the inheritance of evil creeps, the one substance rightly displeases, which they demand to be removed as a scandal and a divorce of unity, not knowing that only those who agree in communion of this profession are to be called Catholics.
