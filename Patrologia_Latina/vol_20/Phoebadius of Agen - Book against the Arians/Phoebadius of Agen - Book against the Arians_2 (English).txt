If I did not see the devil's cunning deceit, which has taken over almost everyone's minds, convincing them that heresy is the true faith and condemning the true faith as heresy, I would not be discussing these matters with you, dearest brothers.

It would have been enough for a small conscience to hold on to its beliefs, thinking it better to defend one's own faith than to discuss foreign and strange ideas.

But because, as we said, we must either accept heresy as Catholicism, or we cannot truly be Catholic if we do not reject heresy, we are compelled to address this issue. The devil's poison, hidden under the guise of religious devotion, must be brought to light.

By exposing the evil hidden behind simple words, we can uncover the lies and allow the truth that was blocked to be revealed.

Foreign beliefs must be destroyed so that our own beliefs can be accepted. However, unless these foreign beliefs are destroyed, I believe we should focus solely on our own.

Therefore, before I can expose the heresy blinded by the devil's deceit to the public, I must first prove myself to be Catholic. I hope to prove this first to God, then to my conscience, and also to those who are not swayed by fear or worldly ambition.
