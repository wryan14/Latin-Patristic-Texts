The heresy of Sabellius. But in this place, you will appreciate what Matthew reports, that the Son of Man, seemingly private and lesser, read in the same Matthew, 
Matthew

, is to come in the majesty of the Father. About this coming, Luke also says: When the Son of Man comes in His glory and that of the Father 
Luke

21
:

. Therefore, the Son is not said to be lesser in majesty by you, when this is said, rather God is denied. He, I say, He about whom Solomon said: He is the radiance of eternal light, and the spotless mirror of Godâ€™s majesty 
Wisdom

. Clearly a spotless mirror.

He indeed preserves the face of God; and faithfully expressing the figure, He reflected the full image of the Father. And what more about His status, in which the Lord Christ recognized Himself? The Father, He says, is greater than me. Deservedly greater, because He alone is the author without an author. Finally, the Apostle about the Son: In Him, he says, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily 
Colossians

2
:

. Therefore, as the Son is in the Father, so the Father is perfect in the Son.

Finally, our Lord, saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, added: He will take from what is mine 
John

. As if, while both are perfect, one perfect God exists in two.

The Father, He says, is greater than me 
John

14
:
28
. Deservedly greater, because He did not descend into the Virgin; which Sabellius did not want, with whom the Father and the Son are not both, that is, one person of two names; when he heard the Father's voice through Isaiah: Behold my Son whom I have chosen, I will put my Spirit upon Him 
Isaiah

42
:

; and thereafter, recognizing the Son speaking through the same prophet: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because He has anointed me 
Isaiah

Which heresy the Lord foresaw: Do you not believe, He says, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me 
John

? Certainly, He did not say: I am the Father, and I in me: but, I am in the Father and the Father is in me: by which saying He crushed two heresies, namely Sabellianism and Arianism. That the Father and the Son are not one person, as Sabellius claimed, or two substances, as Arius claimed, but (as the Catholic faith confesses) one substance and two persons.
