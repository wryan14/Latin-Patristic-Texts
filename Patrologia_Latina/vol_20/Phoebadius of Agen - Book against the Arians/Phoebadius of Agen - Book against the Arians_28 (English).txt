But why do we need arguments when the Lord Himself has made a definitive statement? "Whatever the Father does, the Son also does" 
 (John 5:19). How can they do the same things if the Son cannot aspire to the highest glory of the Father? Indeed, because He can, John rightly says: "Without Him, nothing was made" 
 (John 1:3). And the Lord Himself says: "I and the Father are one" 
 (John 10:30). One indeed by nature: because what was in the Son of Man also remained in the bosom of the Father. Finally: "And you know me, and you know where I am from: and I have not come of myself, but He who sent me is true, whom you do not know. I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent me" 
 (John 7:28-29); and: "I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me" 
 (John 8:16); and: "As the Father knows me, and I know the Father" 
 (John 10:15).

I do not know how the Son could have known the Father if the Son had a beginning. For the begotten could not know the unbegotten before he was begotten. Therefore, He does not know the Father as the Father knows Him: and it would rightfully attribute a lie to Him 
 (which should not fall upon the Lord) if His assertion is not upheld by reason. It will not stand unless He is, and who not only came from the Father, but is in the Father, and has always been. "The Father has given all things into His hand" 
 (John 3:35). How could all things be given, unless He is also of all time? But how could He be of all time if He had a beginning? For although you say He was born before all time, since you say He was born at some point, and was not before He was made, I do not know how you can defend that He received all things from the Father and is of all time.
