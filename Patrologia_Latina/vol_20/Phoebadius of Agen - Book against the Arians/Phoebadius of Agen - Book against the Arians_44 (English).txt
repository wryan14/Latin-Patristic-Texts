We must follow a path that is difficult and narrow, surrounded by dangerous cliffs that, though appearing smooth and easy due to satanic deceit, lead to ruin. If we speak of only one God, excluding the second person, we align with the heresy that claims the Father suffered. If we accept the number with division, we align with the Arians, who believe a god was made by God and that a new substance emerged from nothing.

Therefore, we must hold to the rule that professes the Son in the Father, and the Father in the Son. 
 John chapter fourteen, verse twenty states: 
 "which maintains one substance in two persons, acknowledging the order of the divinity. Thus, the Father is God, and the Son is God: because in the Father who is God, the Son is God."

If this causes scandal to anyone, let them hear from us that the Spirit is from God; because where the second person is in the Son, the third is in the Holy Spirit. 
 Finally, the Lord said: 
 "I will ask my Father and he will give you another advocate." 
 John chapter fourteen, verse sixteen.

So, the Spirit is different from the Son, just as the Son is from the Father. Thus, the third person is in the Spirit as the second is in the Son: yet one God is all, and the three are one. This we believe, this we hold, because this we received from the prophets: this the Gospels have spoken to us: this the apostles handed down: this the martyrs confessed by their suffering: in this we persist with minds of faith, against which even if an angel from heaven should preach, let them be accursed.

Galatians chapter one, verse eight.
