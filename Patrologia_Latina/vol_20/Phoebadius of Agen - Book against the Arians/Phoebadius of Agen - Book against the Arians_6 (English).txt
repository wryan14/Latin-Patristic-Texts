"There is one God," he says.

It may seem that they cannot argue against these conjectures and twist the sanctity of simple faith with malicious interpretation.

But we must consider Ursacius, Valens, and Potamius, who have often deceptively confessed the one God using the same words.

There is nothing simple in this profession of faith, which at first glance deceives the unskilled, the credulous, and the unsuspecting with heretical subtlety, just like a cup of poison sweetened with honey.

"There is one Almighty Father God," he says.

None of us deny this because we all know it: but as can be proven by their own writings, we say they do not so much profess one God here as one Almighty Father.

While they firmly do not want the Son, they still confess the Son as God.

I believe they will not deny having taken up the other; and therefore, in their treachery, not faith, they say one God the Father, rather than one God.

Even though in the whole body of their profession, they do not deny our Lord, they destroy God by calling him only by the name of Lord, a name we are also accustomed to being called.

"I said: You are gods" (Psalm 82:6).

By this name, Moses was also once honored: "I will make you a god to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1).

Therefore, let no one think that these words complete a Catholic profession if we confess one God the Father and do not deny God the Son.

Indeed, the Father God can be called one God in such a way that he is one Father, not one God.

And the Son can also be called God in such a way that he is not God.
