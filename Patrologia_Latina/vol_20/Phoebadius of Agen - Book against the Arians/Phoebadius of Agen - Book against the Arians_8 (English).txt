One God, or none. Blind heretics.

CHAPTER IV.

One God, or none. Blind heretics. We know that two gods neither can exist nor should be proclaimed. We have never spoken of two gods. For if God is not one and true, He is not God. But it should be noted what definition is used here and how deceit is woven into this matter, where common words turn into blasphemy.

They immediately state why they deny two gods: Because God Himself said, "I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God" 

John 20:17.
 By this poor interpretation, the Son is separated from the Father to such an extent and placed below the Almighty God, that the conditions of birth and the weaknesses of humanity are attributed to Him. Finally, they add that the God of all is one God, which means the Lord is not absolutely denied as God; for He is subjected to God the Father not by the name of the Son, but by the condition of being a creature.

And I believe that Apostolic authority will be vindicated here, so that Christ is called God rather than being God: because it says, "And God gave Him a name that is above every name" 

Philippians 2:9.
 Also, the Lord Himself denies being the true God when He says, "This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God" 

John 17:3;
 and "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone" 

Luke 18:19.
 You will still hear: Why do you not seek honor from the one and only God? About the day and hour no one knows, not even the Son, but only the Father 

Matthew 24:36.
 O blind guides! O deceived by worldly ambition! Not distinguishing the dual state of the Lord's power, each differing in its own property; and applying whatever is said about His humanity to God, so that God Himself is associated with human weakness.
