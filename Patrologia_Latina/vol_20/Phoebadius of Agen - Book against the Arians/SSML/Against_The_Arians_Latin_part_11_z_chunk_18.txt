    The birth of Christ is unknown. Christ is from God, in God, and with God. But how can we accept that they assert he has a beginning, yet claim his birth remains uncertain? Either both should be hidden because they are simultaneous, or both should be known. One cannot be known or unknown without the other.

    They say the Son has a beginning, but his birth is hidden. Is this fair? Who revealed anything about the birth? Why was it kept silent? How is the birth known if it is claimed to be unknown? In this case, those without hope contradict the prophet who says: "Who will declare his generation?" <break time="500ms"/> (Isaiah 53:8). They don't understand that those who ascribe a beginning to the Word of God, the Son of God, were already foreseen by the prophetic spirit.

    "Who will declare his generation?" This means: No human can. <break time="500ms"/> Only he who reveals the heart of the Father can disclose the secrets of his birth. We also read: "Who has known the mind of the Lord?" <break time="500ms"/> (Romans 11:34). "Or who has been his counselor?" <break time="500ms"/> (First Corinthians 2:16). But again we are taught: "Except the Spirit who is in him." <break time="500ms"/> "Who will declare his generation?" <break time="500ms"/> (First Corinthians 2:11).
  </p>
  <p>
    This means: No one should dare to declare what they cannot. And why can no one? Because he is not only from him and with him, but also in him who is without birth. The Begotten from the Unbegotten was born with divine glories that belong to the Unbegotten. The Father has in himself what he begot. Therefore, his birth is indescribable because through it he is unconceived, but perfectly God the Son from God the Father. As the Scriptures say of the Son, he is from him, and with him, and in him <break time="500ms"/> (Romans 11:36).
