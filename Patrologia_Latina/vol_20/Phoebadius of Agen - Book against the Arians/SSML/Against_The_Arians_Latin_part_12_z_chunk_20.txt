        <s>From the author: "With him, to the only-begotten: In him" refers to the birth of the substance.</s>
        <s>This concept is universally heard.</s>
        <s>Hold onto the mysteries of divine providence.</s>
        <s>You know enough.</s>
        <s>Who can describe the birth, he asks?</s>
        <s>For who can naturally describe a birth that defies nature?</s>
        <s>Only he is born, conscious of his own birth.</s>
        <s>He who knew for whom good things were prepared, being in the Father by nature, was born in that very condition.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Who can describe the birth, he asks?</s>
        <s>They add that no one has revealed this because it is known only to him and the Father.</s>
        <s>This means, without subtle deception: Indeed, the Father begot the Son, but no one knows from where.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Similarly, the Jews said: We know that God spoke to Moses, but this man, we do not know where he is from (John 9:29).</s>

        <s>Although they sometimes join us in the communion of words, and some things seem to be simply said to mask the infamy of heretical perversity, they almost always oppose the true faith.</s>
        <s>It is necessary to understand the fewer things according to the more; especially if something received goes against the faith, it harms the whole faith.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>No one knows, he says, how the Son was begotten, except the Father alone (John 1:18).</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>So what does that sentence mean, since the Lord did not want us to remain ignorant: "I," he says, "came forth from the Father and from the bosom of the Father" (John 16:27, 28)?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Oh pain! Why did he not want us to remain in the darkness of ignorance?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Indeed, he did not want that, so that with the author known to us, the question of his status would be removed.</s>
        <s>It was not to be questioned who, how, or what he was, since we knew from where he came.</s>
        <s>But if this sentence of the Lord himself is proposed to confirm this, saying: "No one knows the Father except the Son, nor does anyone know the Son except the Father" (Matthew 11:27), they will hear from us, lest they distort the divine definition.</s>

    <p>
        <s>For it follows: "And to whom the Son wills to reveal him."</s>
        <s>It is not entirely hidden what can be revealed.</s>
        <s>It is revealed if someone is worthy of the revelation.</s>
