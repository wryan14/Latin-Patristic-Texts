       Now, this knowledge is no longer hidden, as it is revealed for a reason. God, who punishes ignorance, is not unjust, as He would not punish if He had not given knowledge. He provided this through the Holy Spirit. Indeed, the Spirit, He says, will tell you all truth <sub alias="John sixteen thirteen">(John 16:13)</sub>. When He says all truth, certainly nothing is excluded. This is the Spirit of knowledge and truth, through whom Solomon spoke of the Lord's birth:

            No one knows what is in God except the Spirit of God: and if that Spirit dwells in us, as the Apostle confirms, we can therefore understand the secrets of God through the same Spirit.

        He is the true offspring of the Unbegotten. This means: No one knows how the Son was begotten.

        This is the perfect birth of the Word, the beginning without a beginning. This is the beginning having a beginning in birth, in a state not having a beginning. For from the unbegotten God, a begotten God came forth, one from one, true from true, full from full; and thus by being born in what always was, He did not begin to be what was born of the unbegotten, nor does He have time as He is naturally co-eternal with the timeless Father. For it is written:

            Therefore, of His nature, which consists of eternity. The Son is not imperfect, even though He is born, because He was born from the perfect: nor is He diminished who begot, because He begot from Himself. For He gave all to all, so that according to the power of the Spirit, He would be whole in the whole.
