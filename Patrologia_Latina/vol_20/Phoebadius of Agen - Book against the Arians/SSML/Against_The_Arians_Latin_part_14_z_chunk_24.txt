        <s>These teachers no longer keep the secrets of their craft to themselves.</s>
        <s>They oppose the truth, even when they claim to uphold it, appearing gentle like lambs but speaking fiercely like dragons.</s>
        <s>They aim to separate the Son from the Father and place Him below God, citing the Gospel: "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28).</s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>But how is He greater?</s>
        <s>With heretical presumption, they assert it is by honor, glory, dignity, and majesty.</s>
        <s>Yet, if this were true, why is it commanded that everyone should honor the Son just as they honor the Father?</s>
        <s>If this is so, then every day we blaspheme in our thanksgivings and sacrifices, confessing these things as common to both the Father and the Son.</s>
        <s>The Son cannot fail to possess everything that belongs to the Father, since He is wholly in the Father.</s>

    <p>
        <s>John says: "No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" (John 1:18).</s>
        <s>Thus, he says: "All that belongs to you is mine, and all that is mine is yours" (John 17:10).</s>
        <s>And: "The Son can do nothing by himself" (John 5:19).</s>
        <s>And: "I have come not to do my will, but the will of him who sent me" (John 6:38).</s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>This is not a confession of weakness, but an assertion of unity.</s>
        <s>For He also said, to counter weakness and emphasize unity: "He who sent me is with me" (John 6:29).</s>
        <s>And: "The Father dwelling in me does His works" (John 14:10).</s>
        <s>And: "The words I speak are not mine, but the Father's" (John 7:16).</s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>Therefore, whatever is detracted from the Son is also detracted from the Father.</s>
        <s>For neither does one act without the other, because one cannot exist without the other.</s>
        <s>The Son is not the Son without the Father, nor is the Father the Father without the Son.</s>
        <s>"The Father," he says, "is greater than I."</s>
        <s>But the fullness of the same divinity is in the Son.</s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>The Apostle says: "For no matter how many promises God has made, they are 'Yes' in Christ" (Second Corinthians 1:20).</s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>Do the duties of the Son dissolve the state of divinity?</s>
        <s>For everything that God is, is embodied in Christ, if majesty is perceived as belonging to another.</s>
        <s>It will belong to another if the Father is greater in majesty.</s>
        <s>But this majesty, because it is one, namely of one God, cannot be imperfect.</s>
        <s>It is imperfect if unequal; it is unequal if one is lesser than the other.</s>
