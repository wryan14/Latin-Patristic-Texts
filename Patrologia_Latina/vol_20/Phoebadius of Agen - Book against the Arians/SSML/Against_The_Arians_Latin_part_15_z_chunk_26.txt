  <p>The heresy of Sabellius. But in this place, you will appreciate what Matthew reports, that the Son of Man, seemingly private and lesser, read in the same Matthew, <w>Matthew</w> <sub alias="twenty-five">25</sub>:<sub alias="thirty-one">31</sub>, is to come in the majesty of the Father. About this coming, Luke also says: When the Son of Man comes in His glory and that of the Father <w>Luke</w> <sub alias="twenty-one">21</sub>:<sub alias="twenty-seven">27</sub>. Therefore, the Son is not said to be lesser in majesty by you, when this is said, rather God is denied. He, I say, He about whom Solomon said: He is the radiance of eternal light, and the spotless mirror of Godâ€™s majesty <w>Wisdom</w> <sub alias="seven">7</sub>:<sub alias="twenty-six">26</sub>. Clearly a spotless mirror.</p>
  
  <p>He indeed preserves the face of God; and faithfully expressing the figure, He reflected the full image of the Father. And what more about His status, in which the Lord Christ recognized Himself? The Father, He says, is greater than me. Deservedly greater, because He alone is the author without an author. Finally, the Apostle about the Son: In Him, he says, dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily <w>Colossians</w> <sub alias="two">2</sub>:<sub alias="nine">9</sub>. Therefore, as the Son is in the Father, so the Father is perfect in the Son.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, our Lord, saying that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, added: He will take from what is mine <w>John</w> <sub alias="fourteen">14</sub>:<sub alias="twenty-six">26</sub>. As John, when he had said: We announce to you eternal life which was with the Father <w>First John</w> <sub alias="one">1</sub>:<sub alias="two">2</sub>, added: This life is in His Son <w>First John</w> <sub alias="one">1</sub>:<sub alias="two">2</sub>. As if, while both are perfect, one perfect God exists in two.</p>
  
  <p>The Father, He says, is greater than me <w>John</w> <sub alias="fourteen">14</sub>:<sub alias="twenty-eight">28</sub>. Deservedly greater, because He did not descend into the Virgin; which Sabellius did not want, with whom the Father and the Son are not both, that is, one person of two names; when he heard the Father's voice through Isaiah: Behold my Son whom I have chosen, I will put my Spirit upon Him <w>Isaiah</w> <sub alias="forty-two">42</sub>:<sub alias="one">1</sub>; and thereafter, recognizing the Son speaking through the same prophet: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because He has anointed me <w>Isaiah</w> <sub alias="sixty-one">61</sub>:<sub alias="one">1</sub>.</p>
  
  <p>Which heresy the Lord foresaw: Do you not believe, He says, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me <w>John</w> <sub alias="fourteen">14</sub>:<sub alias="ten">10</sub>, <sub alias="eleven">11</sub>? Certainly, He did not say: I am the Father, and I in me: but, I am in the Father and the Father is in me: by which saying He crushed two heresies, namely Sabellianism and Arianism. That the Father and the Son are not one person, as Sabellius claimed, or two substances, as Arius claimed, but (as the Catholic faith confesses) one substance and two persons.</p>
