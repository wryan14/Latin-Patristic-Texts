        <s>To address questions from the Old Testament, they find confirmation in the New Testament.</s>
        <s>The Lord and God said, when speaking about the Father (John 1:18), that no one has seen the image of the Father.</s>
        <s>If the Son is the image of the Father, as the Apostle states (Hebrews 1:3), He denies being visible by saying that no one has seen the image of the Father.</s>
        <s>Therefore, He says, "Neither do you know me, nor my Father" (John 8:19).</s>
        <s>Here, He confirms two unknowns, yet inseparable as they are two.</s>

        <s>If they knew Him, they would know the Father too: because due to their indivisibility, neither could be known or unknown without the other.</s>
        <s>A similar reasoning applies to the mortal and passible.</s>
        <s>If the Son has no beginning, as He always has been and is in Him to whom no beginning is granted; nor is He visible, as He remains in the invisible bosom: He is neither to be considered mortal nor passible, at least in the part of His substance that is God.</s>
        <s>We know that the Spirit of God suffered nothing in His own name: because God is impassible, because God is Spirit (John 4:24).</s>

    <p>
        <s>We know that all suffering belongs to the flesh and soul, that is, to man: in which man, while suffering, the Son of God was also present, maintaining unity with the Father (from whom He came); carrying man on earth, and not being absent from heaven.</s>
        <s>Thus He is called the mediator, the intermediary of both substances.</s>
        <s>The Spirit of God is not passible, even though He suffered in His man: whom He did not abandon in suffering, so that He could grant Him the ability to suffer: which if not accepted, the rationale of our faith will not stand, attributing to Him the weakness of man whom they do not deny to be God.</s>

    <p>
        <s>If He is said to have a beginning, is taught to be visible, and is introduced as mortal; I do not see how He differs from man, in whom such passions prevail.</s>
