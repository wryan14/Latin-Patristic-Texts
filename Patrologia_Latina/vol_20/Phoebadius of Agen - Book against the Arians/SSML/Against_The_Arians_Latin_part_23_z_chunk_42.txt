  <p>This Word, although in the form of God as stated in <lang xml:lang="en-US">Philippians 2:6-8</lang>, was built with wisdom, reason, and the strength of the spirit—that is, possessing the full power of God. Yet, he did not consider equality with God the Father something to be grasped. Instead, he took on the form of a servant and humbled himself to the point of death.</p>
  
  <p>He took on what could serve and die: namely, a man whom he raised up to heaven. As the second Adam, through obedience, he restored what the first had lost through transgression.</p>
  
  <p>If anyone still questions the divine status of the Apostle—that is, the quality of his unique substance, which by nature is joined to its creator—let them hear what the Apostle himself thought when he spoke of the unsearchable ways of God the Father and the hidden mysteries from the past. "From him," he says, "and through him, and to him are all things" (<lang xml:lang="en-US">Romans 11:36</lang>).</p>
  
  <p>When it is said "through him," it signifies the Son, as I have read, "Through him all things were made" (<lang xml:lang="en-US">John 1:3</lang>). When it is announced "to him," it signifies that in him, the beginnings of all seeds were established. "From him" surely points to the Father as the author of all things.</p>
  
  <p>Considering this, how will the reasoning hold that refers all things to the one? Since there is one from whom all things come, and another through whom all things come—because one is unbegotten and the other is the only begotten—unless it is rightly said in a different condition: all things are from the Son, while in his heart is he from whom all things come; and all things through the Father, while in him always is he through whom all things come.</p>
  
  <p>The Father acts with understanding; the Son, who is the understanding in the Father, sees and accomplishes. Therefore, it should not be believed that the Apostle spoke rashly. Instead, it should be believed that he did not think the Son of God became what he was not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, he remained what he always was; because what he was always, he cannot not have been.</p>
