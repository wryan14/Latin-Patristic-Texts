    Although I know that, after discussing these matters and presenting them to the public, the name of the ancient and always faithful priest Hosius might be used against us as a sort of battering ram to refute our arguments, I have a brief response for those who use this against us: His authority cannot dictate to us because he either errs now or has always erred.

    The world knows the stance he has held until now, with what steadfastness he agreed at Sardica and in the Nicene council, condemning the Arians. But what if he now thinks differently, defending what he previously condemned and condemning what he previously defended? Again, I say, his authority does not dictate to me. If he believed wrongly for nearly 90 years, I will not believe he thinks correctly after 90 years. Or if he is correct now, what should we think of those who passed from this world holding the same faith he did? And what would be said of him if he had died before this council?

    Therefore, as we said before, the authority of a prejudged opinion is worthless because it contradicts itself. And certainly, we read: The righteousness of the righteous will not save him in the day he errs (Ezekiel 33:12). Amen.
