    Starting from the root of their treachery, which lacks true faith, and moving through their entire doctrine, we will demonstrate many deceitful actions disguised as common beliefs. These actions cannot be accepted, and some are blatantly shameless.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even the concept of one God is presented with deceit, and the denial of two gods is also not straightforward. They swear by the term "substance" to separate the Son from the Father. They claim the Son's origin is unknown, which, if it is from the Father, should be acknowledged by their own confession.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They claim the Father is greater than the Son, not just in terms of hierarchy, but in all divine attributes. If the Son is lesser in these attributes, then he cannot be considered part of the Father, as eternal beatitude includes only what is proper to it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is proper to God is full and perfect. Therefore, the Father cannot be in someone entirely if that person is not fully divine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They deny that the Father has a beginning to imply that the Son has a beginning not from the author, but from time. However, if a beginning is attributed in this way, it suggests that an end is also inevitable.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They state that the Son is subject to the Father, not as a Son to a Father, but as a servant to a Lord, citing that a servant cannot be an heir.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, they claim the Son is subject to God alongside every creature, portraying the Father as invisible and immortal, while contrasting the Son with creatures.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By refuting these claims not with human presumption but with divine authority, we uphold the Catholic faith, which accepts God as He truly should be.
