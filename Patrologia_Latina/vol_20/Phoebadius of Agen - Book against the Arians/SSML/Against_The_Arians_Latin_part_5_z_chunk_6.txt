    <s>"There is one God," he says.</s>
    <s>It may seem that they cannot argue against these conjectures and twist the sanctity of simple faith with malicious interpretation.</s>
    <s>But we must consider Ursacius, Valens, and Potamius, who have often deceptively confessed the one God using the same words.</s>
    <s>There is nothing simple in this profession of faith, which at first glance deceives the unskilled, the credulous, and the unsuspecting with heretical subtlety, just like a cup of poison sweetened with honey.</s>
    <s>"There is one Almighty Father God," he says.</s>
    <s>None of us deny this because we all know it: but as can be proven by their own writings, we say they do not so much profess one God here as one Almighty Father.</s>

    <s>While they firmly do not want the Son, they still confess the Son as God.</s>
    <s>I believe they will not deny having taken up the other; and therefore, in their treachery, not faith, they say one God the Father, rather than one God.</s>
    <s>Even though in the whole body of their profession, they do not deny our Lord, they destroy God by calling him only by the name of Lord, a name we are also accustomed to being called.</s>

    <s>"I said: You are gods" (Psalm 82:6).</s>
    <s>By this name, Moses was also once honored: "I will make you a god to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1).</s>
    <s>Therefore, let no one think that these words complete a Catholic profession if we confess one God the Father and do not deny God the Son.</s>
    <s>Indeed, the Father God can be called one God in such a way that he is one Father, not one God.</s>
    <s>And the Son can also be called God in such a way that he is not God.</s>
