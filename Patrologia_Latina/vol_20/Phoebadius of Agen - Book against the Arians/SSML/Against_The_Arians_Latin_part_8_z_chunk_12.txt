    <p>Why is it necessary to delve into deeper matters and expose inner corruption through arguments for public judgment? Sometimes, the light-fleeing serpent, winding through its twists and turns, reveals its nature and size. Accustomed to spreading its venom more than usual, it has now poured forth everything through victories.</p>
    <p>The decree from the Bishops states: No one should say there is one substance. That is, no one in the Church should preach that the Father and the Son share one power.</p>
    <p>What have you accomplished, O men of blessed memory, who gathered from all parts of the world in Nicaea? Having examined the sacred texts, you established the perfect rule of Catholic faith with careful speech. You provided a common faith for true believers and a form of belief for those who err.</p>
    <p>Behold your labor and anxious care. As much as you could at that time, you killed the seeds of emerging evil with the Catholic profession. It is forbidden to preach in the Church what you decreed should be preached to expose heresies. What you proved is taken away, and what you condemned is now introduced because a lie cannot be established unless the truth is destroyed.</p>
    <p>Indeed, that truth is not subject to destruction, and as it is always incorruptible, it will endure. However, it punished those sacrilegious hands that brought violence upon it as if it had been violated.</p>
