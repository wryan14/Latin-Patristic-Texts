        <s>The term "substance" is clarified.</s>
        <s>No one should refer to it as a single substance.</s>
        <s>What sin or crime is associated with this term, and how does it challenge the Catholic faith?</s>
        <s>Is it the sound of the word, or its interpretation that poses an issue?</s>

        <s>I'm not mistaken: the interpretation is flawless.</s>
        <s>"Substance" refers to that which exists by itself, having its own virtue; this power belongs solely to God.</s>
        <s>However, I believe those who deny this are aware that this term is commonly found in the divine texts.</s>

        <s>For instance, David says in the person of Christ: "I have sunk in deep mire, and there is no standing" (Psalms 69:2).</s>
        <s>And again: "My frame was not hidden from you" (Psalms 139:15).</s>
        <s>And: "My substance is before you always" (Psalms 38:9).</s>
        <s>And: "Surely every man walks in a vain show" (Psalms 39:6).</s>
        <s>"Let the creditor seize all that he has" (Psalms 109:11).</s>

        <s>And Jeremiah states: "If they had stood in my counsel" (Jeremiah 23:22, according to the Septuagint).</s>

        <s>Tobit also mentions: "If you have many possessions" (Tobit 4:9).</s>
        <s>And further: "Son, give alms out of your substance" (Tobit 4:7).</s>
        <s>John says: "If anyone has material possessions" (1 John 3:17).</s>

        <s>We have gathered these examples so that the unlearned are not misled, as they attest; therefore, "substance" is not preached because it is nowhere found in the divine Scriptures.</s>

        <s>If the term "substance" is not new to sacred writings, and its interpretation carries no crime, we must consider why this term is rejected.</s>
        <s>Upon reflection, we find they do not reject the name, but the power of the name.</s>
        <s>If this becomes clear, the true meaning of the name will remain with us, and the error of those who stray from the correct understanding of the Gospels will also be evident.</s>
