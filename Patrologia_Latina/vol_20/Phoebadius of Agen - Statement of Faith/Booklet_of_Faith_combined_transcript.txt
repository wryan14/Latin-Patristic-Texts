Statement of Faith
by Phoebadius of Agen
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,
and in His only-begotten Son, our Savior, and the Holy Spirit, God:
not three Gods, but one God. We confess the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit to be one God. Not as if this one God were solitary or the same being who is both Father and Son; but the true Father, who begot the true Son, as God from God, light from light, life from life, perfect from perfect, whole from whole, full from full; not created, but begotten; not from nothing, but from the Father, of the same substance with the Father: truly the Holy Spirit, God, not unbegotten, nor begotten; not created, nor made; but from the Father and the Son, always in the Father, and the Son co-eternal.
Yet we worship one God: because from one Father, everything that belongs to the Father, the Son is born; and in the Father, everything that exists, the Father fully generated the Son. The Father, generating the Son, did not diminish nor lose His fullness of deity: but everything that God the Father is, that also the Son, born from Him, we certainly hold. With the Holy Spirit, one God we devoutly confess JESUS CHRIST our Lord, the Son of God, through whom all things were made, which are in heaven and which are on earth, visible and invisible:
for our salvation, He came down from heaven; never ceasing to be in heaven: born of the Holy Spirit from the virgin Mary. The Word made flesh did not lose what He was, but began to be what He was not. Not changed but remaining truly human, not in appearance, but truly; not airy, but bodily; not imaginary, but fleshly; having bones, blood, senses, and a soul; thus we understand Him as true God and true human: thus we in no way doubt that the true man was true God.
We must confess that this same Lord JESUS CHRIST fulfilled the law and the prophets, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified according to the Scriptures, died and was buried according to the Scriptures, rose from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. We expect to be cleansed by His death and blood, and to receive forgiveness of sins; to be resurrected by Him in these bodies and in the same flesh in which we now are; just as He in the same flesh in which He was born, suffered, and died, rose again: and our souls with this flesh or our bodies from Him will receive either eternal life, the reward of good merit, or the sentence of eternal punishment for sins.
