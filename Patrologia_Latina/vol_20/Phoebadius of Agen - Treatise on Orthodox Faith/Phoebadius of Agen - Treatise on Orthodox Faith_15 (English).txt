What is God?

Can anything be compared to Him?

The Greeks have a concept called 
Λόγος
 that distinguishes between the Father and the Son.

This concept goes by many names.

For this reason, what is said about the Son is also said about the Father.

Let's consider what God is, according to our capacity, strength, and faith, and see if anything can be compared to Him.

When we speak of Him, He cannot be fully expressed; when we evaluate Him, He cannot be fully valued; when we compare Him, He cannot be matched; when we define Him, He exceeds the definition itself.

He opens the heavens with His hand and holds the entire world in His fist.

The whole of creation does not fully understand Him, yet they know Him through their reverence.

This world serves His name and power, and even the changing elements testify to it.

So, can anything be compared to the Father and the Son? The Son is like the Father: for He would not say He is one with the Father unless He knew Himself to be like the Father.

The Greeks call this concept 
Λόγος
, which distinguishes between the Father and the Son, because the Son is also called the 
Λόγος
.

This concept is known by many names: sometimes the Word, sometimes Power, sometimes Wisdom, sometimes the right hand, sometimes the arm, sometimes the pearl, sometimes the treasure, sometimes the net, sometimes the plow, sometimes the fountain, sometimes the rock, sometimes the cornerstone, sometimes the lamb, sometimes the man, sometimes the calf, sometimes the eagle, sometimes the lion, sometimes the way.

Since God is all in all, through these words we recognize the mysteries of divine arrangements, not to properly define the majesty of the Son of God.

What is the Son in relation to the Father? He is the same in essence.

For this reason, He is called the Word, because He proceeded from the very mouth of God, and the Father did nothing without Him, neither commanded nor made anything.

He is called Power, because He is truly from God and always with God, and all the power of the Father resides in Him.

He is called Wisdom, because coming from the heart of the Father, He revealed heavenly secrets to believers.

He is called the right hand, because through Him all divine works are perfected.

He is called the arm, because everything is contained by Him.

He is called the pearl, to signify that nothing is more precious than Him.

He is called the treasure, to signify that in Him all the wealth and riches of the heavenly kingdoms are stored.

He is called the net, because through Him and in Him, the diverse multitude of nations is gathered like fish from the sea of the world into the church through the water of baptism, where the distinction between good and evil is recognized.

He is called the plow, because by the sign of His cross, hard hearts are subjected to prepare for the necessary seed.

He is called the fountain of living water, because through Him, the thirsty hearts are refreshed by the grace of the heavenly water.

He is called the rock, because He provides strength to believers and hardness to unbelievers.

He is called the cornerstone, because He joined the two walls of the Old and New Testaments in Himself as the one mediator.

He is called the lamb, to demonstrate the innocence and suffering of Christ.

He is called the man, because He deigned to be born as a human for our sake.

He is called the calf, because He endured suffering for our salvation.

He is called the eagle, because after His venerable resurrection, like the king of birds, He ascended to the seat of the Father.

He is called the lion, because He is the King of kings, who destroyed death and the devil by the power of His might.

He is called the way, because through Him is the path of ascent.

He is called the truth, because He knows no falsehood.

He is called the life, because He gives life to all.

Do you see, therefore, through these words the meanings and signs of divine arrangements and works, but not the proper definition of God Himself?

Therefore, the Father is God, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, unestimable. And His Son is also God and our Lord, as great as the Father: but not from elsewhere other than from the Father: because He said, I came from the Father, that is, light from light.
