Nothing is more dangerous than those heretics who seem very similar to us. They appear to adhere to everything faithfully, but with just one word, they taint simple faith. By removing the term 
substance
, which they want to take away based on the gospel, apostolic faith, and the tradition of the fathers, they subtly introduce Arian heresy.

We are aware of many significant heresies that have emerged and, like poison, have infiltrated the core of our beliefs with their cancerous venom. These can often be easily overcome or avoided, as their intent is clear from the start. However, those who share many similarities with us can easily deceive innocent minds devoted solely to God with their fraudulent association. They defend their malicious ideas using our good teachings.

Nothing is more dangerous than these heretics, who seem to adhere faithfully to everything. With just one word, like a drop of poison, they taint the pure and simple faith of the Lord and, consequently, the apostolic tradition.

Therefore, we must be very cautious that nothing of this kind secretly infiltrates our minds or ears. For nothing leads to death more than violating faith under the guise of faith. Just as gypsum mixed with water mimics the color of milk, so too does this enemy tradition suggest itself through a seemingly plausible confession. For this reason, it is not the resemblance of the confession but the intent of the mind that must be weighed, which strengthens the confession itself.

If you pay close and careful attention to why they want to remove the term 
substance
 from the gospel, apostolic faith, and the tradition of the fathers, you will undoubtedly recognize the Arian heresy subtly introduced by removing this term.

I do not state this based on suspicion or opinion, nor do I engage in academic disputation as they do, twisting the simple meanings of words with subtlety. Instead, I aim to expose the twisted and corrupt ideas composed of subtle arguments to the light of understanding, so that the recognized and discovered iniquity may be more easily avoided by people.

What cause or reason could there be for attempting to remove what was taught and believed by all churches, what our apostolic fathers established against all heresies, especially Arianism, as a barrier of truth to block all avenues of harmful doctrine, cleansed by the Holy Spirit, and established with Catholic reasoning? Those who are committed to the stain of Arianism labor greatly to remove this, unless it is to falsely claim that the Son of God is changeable and mutable, not of the Father's own substance.

They want to teach that He had a beginning in time, origin from nothing, and a name from another, which they have always taught and for which they have often been condemned. Now, they wish to freely, securely, and unhesitatingly pass this on to the churches.
