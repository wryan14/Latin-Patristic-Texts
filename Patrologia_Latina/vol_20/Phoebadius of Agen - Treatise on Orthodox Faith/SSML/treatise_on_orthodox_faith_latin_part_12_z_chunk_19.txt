    The mystery of the Arian heresy is revealed. Why they do not want to believe that the Son is of the substance of the Father. Responses to Arian arguments. There is a great difference between things that were made and Him who made everything. How God showed Himself to the fathers in many and various forms, yet could not be seen according to His deity. Conclusion of the discussion.
  </p>
  <p>
    But to explain the entire mystery of the Arian heresy, I will briefly indicate why they do not want to believe that the Son is of the substance of the Father. They say: Since God the Father is almighty, invisible, unchangeable, immutable, perfect, always the same, eternal: but the Son is visible, because He often appeared to the fathers; and changeable and mutable, because He showed Himself in various forms: if He were of the substance of the Father, they say, it would never be possible for Him to be seen or changed before taking on flesh; rather, He would remain in the equality of the Father, from whose substance He came; because what is of the Father is believed to be neither seen, nor changed, nor converted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, when He descended into Mary and filled the womb of the Virgin; something else was born from her than what had come. Hence, they say, the corrupted substance changed its state, lost its order, and immediately had to be transformed by the incarnation from God to man, from spirit to flesh. And certainly, any transformation is the end of the original. Therefore, they say: If the Son were of the substance of the Father, the Father would seem lesser in substance either by tradition or by end: and therefore they preferred to believe that the Son is of another substance, which can be converted, changed, and seen; because this cannot be believed of the substance of the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the cause of the error, this is the origin of the Arian heresy: while they do not understand the power of God, nor recognize the arrangement of such a great sacrament, comparing God to human conditions. To which, first of all, it must be replied that the Son of God was not seen as God, but as man could comprehend God; then, in various forms, He is not changeable and convertible, but this is the power of God, that when He deems it worthy to reveal Himself to individuals as He wills, He changes the form but not the substance: nor does He lose the property of His quality, but according to the merit of the viewer, He applies a tempering of majesty: yet He remains the same as He always is, in the property of His substance, as it is written: "They will change and be changed: but You are the same, and Your years will not fail" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɑm 102:28">(Psalm 102:28)</phoneme>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For although many things in this world are seen to convert from one to another, so that they cease to be what they were, and become what they were not before; as clay when shaped into a man ceases to be clay: or fish or birds when they come out of the water are no longer water, because they are something else: like the potter's clay when solidified into pottery: like stone when dissolved and burned into lime: like sand when changed into glass, and others which are too long to recount. But there is a great difference, foolish heretic, between things that were made and Him who made everything as He willed. Things that were made serve the condition assigned to them: but He who made them is of His own will and proper right. Nor can He be changed into something else by any compulsion; but as He wills, and to whom He wills, He reveals Himself.

    For if angels were often seen in the form of men, and yet they are nothing other than what they know themselves to be, nor do they change their substance when they take the form of a human body; how much more our Lord Himself, who made everything, who granted to the angels themselves, by His institution, that they could do this?
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, we approve that the Son of God was seen by the fathers, as already said, in such a way that not all that He is as God was seen in Him: but the arrangements of future things, which were to be fulfilled in their own times, were seen in Him through an image. For who could see the Son of God before He assumed visible matter, as it pleased Him, or deigned to take on human form?
  </p>
  <p>
    For although He was seen by Abraham (Genesis 18:1), yet He was seen in the form of a human body, in which He was to appear in later times.
  </p>


  <p>
    In a human being, He was to come and be revealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jacob also saw Him sometimes as an angel and sometimes as a man Genesis 28:13. He appeared as an angel to indicate that He was the messenger of great counsel, and as a man, with whom Jacob wrestled, to illustrate the future struggle He would have with Israel when He came as a man. To make Jacob believe that he was wrestling with the Lord in human form, Jacob was given the name Israel Genesis 32:24, which means "a man seeing God." He said, "I saw God face to face, and my life was spared" Genesis 32:30. Indeed, he saw the form of a man, which God the Son had taken.
  </p>

    Moses saw Him in the burning bush as a flame of fire Exodus 3:2 to show light to believers and judgment to unbelievers; because Christ is salvation to believers and punishment to unbelievers, as the Apostle says: "To some, the fragrance of life leading to life; to others, the fragrance of death leading to death" Second Corinthians 2:16.
  </p>
  <p>
    He led the people of Israel by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire as their guide on the journey Exodus 13:21; to show the grace of baptism through the cloud, and the gift of the Holy Spirit through the fire; because the Apostle Paul writes that the fathers were baptized in the cloud First Corinthians 10:2, and the Acts of the Apostles declare the Spirit to be like fire Acts 2:3.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, you see, heretic, through all these things, the signs of the divine Scriptures were shown to the fathers to honor God; but not God Himself as He is fully revealed. For when Moses prayed to see God's face clearly, what did God immediately say to him? "You cannot see my face," He said, "for no one can see me and live" Exodus 33:20. By denying the sight, He assigned glory, which is so great that it must be believed to be invisible. Although Moses described the structure of the heavens, the orders of the world, the cycles of the elements, and the ornaments of the whole universe, and although the Lord Himself testified about him, saying, "There will never be another prophet like my servant Moses, with whom I speak face to face, mouth to mouth" Numbers 12:7-8; still he could not see God purely. Truly worthy of all prophecy, but not to the extent that he could see God as a mere man.
  </p>
  <p>
    And indeed we defend all these words as those of the Son, whom we know spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai Exodus 31:18, who came from the Father to conduct and explain matters; because from the beginning it was fitting for everything to be arranged, explained, and maintained through Him, so that the chief reason for having the Son would be established. Yet, He appeared in such a way that He was seen through the assumption of some visible form, preserving His invisibility, which His majesty, interposed between all sight, kept separate. He was not revealed to human eyes in such a way that His entire deity appeared; but like a mirror, He included the faces seen within His light as a full human figure; thus, with the glory of His majesty preceding, what was seen was an image of the truth, not God Himself properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, when He chose to take on human form, He did not diminish eternity by turning the spirit into flesh, but by assuming human form, He granted the immortality and eternity of heavenly life. For although the Apostle says He emptied Himself Philippians 2:7 by taking on the form of a servant, we do not understand this self-emptying to mean that the same Spirit became something other than what it was; but that He set aside the honor of His majesty for a time and took on a human body, so that by assuming it, He could bring salvation to the nations. Just as the sun is covered by a cloud, its brightness is dimmed but not darkened, and the light that spreads with clear brightness over the whole world is confined to the small obstacle of the cloud but is not taken away: so the man whom our Lord Jesus, our Savior, that is, God and God's Son, took on did not intercept God but concealed Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, when He briefly revealed Himself on the mountain Matthew 17:6, His brightness nearly blinded those around Him.
  </p>


    
        <p>
            The apostles, indeed, descended to the earth, risking their lives, unless the Lord had mercifully intervened by suppressing again the honor of His majesty, according to the saying: No one can see God and live. <sub alias="Exodus">Exodus</sub> 33:20.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, as the brightness of the sun does not reach our vision fully but remains intact because what is not seen is due to our weakness, whose eyes are covered by the obscurity of clouds, it proves that Christ did not hide His own glory to His detriment, but for our benefit, as I said, for which reason the Son of God endured to become the son of man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Indeed, the Virgin conceived by the Spirit of God, and what she conceived, she bore, that is, God united with man, as I have already said. As He Himself said: What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. <sub alias="John">John</sub> 3:6. Because God is spirit and was born of God. And as the Angel said to the Virgin Mary: The Spirit of God will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. <sub alias="Luke">Luke</sub> 1:35.
        </p>
        <p>
            So you see that the Spirit, that is, the Son of God, came to the virgin; and from there, the Son of God and man proceeded: however, the Son of God was not changed by the garment of flesh, but remained the same in man as He was before the world with the Father; through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made, as the Evangelist says: The world was made through Him, and the world did not recognize Him. <sub alias="John">John</sub> 1:10.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, it is foolish to believe that one could be saved by Him who was lost that He might save, who was oppressed that He might be born, who passed through death to receive immortality. But let it be far from you, heretic, that the sense of your wickedness is accepted by Catholics: for we believe in the immutable and unchangeable Word and Spirit, that is, the Son of God; who, when He took on man, did not change His state, did not lose His order, did not alter His substance but illuminated the impurities of the same body with the eternal light of His glory; so that through the path of His body, the light of the Holy Spirit and the grace of eternal life might overflow to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we believe that He suffered and was buried, it was the man whom the Son of God assumed, whom He clothed, whom He carried, who suffered. But because everything referred to the Creator, whatever that man suffered, therefore, the death and suffering of the Lord are indicated; for it is clear that what is of God is immortal, what is of man is perishable.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the third day, He rose again, not God into man, but rather man into God.
        </p>
        <p>
            He ascended into heaven, offered that man to His Father as a most pleasing gift, and sat at the right hand of the Father, as it is written: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand. <sub alias="Psalm">Psalm</sub> 110:1.
        </p>
        <p>
            He sent us the Holy Spirit from His own, and from His very own substance, as Protector, Sanctifier, and Guide into eternal life, as it is written from the voice of God: I will pour out my Spirit on my servants and handmaids. <sub alias="Joel">Joel</sub> 2:29. And again: My Spirit will come forth from me. <sub alias="Isaiah">Isaiah</sub> 57:6. And our Lord and Savior Himself said: He will take from what is mine. <sub alias="John">John</sub> 16:15; certainly from that which is the Son, because the Son is from what the Father is.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, at the appointed time, He will come to judge the living and the dead; to give rewards to the believers and punishments to the unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
            His kingdom is eternal, immortal; it has neither beginning nor end: to whom is honor and glory forever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            You who read this, I beseech you by God, do not twist the simplicity of the meaning into ambiguity or interpret it in any way other than stated; for we confess the true Father as Father, and the Son of God as the true Son of God, and believe in the Holy Spirit as truly the Holy Spirit: confessing three persons of one substance and one divinity. We condemn the sects of Sabellius, Photinus, and Arius, and any others that come against the rule of truth. We embrace with all our faith the decree of the Council of Nicaea, preserving it with all our might, for we know this decree to be opposed with invincible truth against all heresies.
