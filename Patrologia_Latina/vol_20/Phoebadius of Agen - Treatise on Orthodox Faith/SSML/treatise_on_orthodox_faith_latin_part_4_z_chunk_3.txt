    Driven by my love for the Catholic Faith, I had earlier published a small book against the Arians. When I shared it with a friend, he thought it was so good that it should be transcribed. I requested him to let educated and wise individuals read it without revealing the author, so that if anyone found something missing or excessive, it could be corrected through their advice.

    No one should arrogantly assume they have complete understanding of divine doctrine, as the Apostle Paul says: 
    <s>"If anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know" (First Corinthians 8:2);</s> 
    and, 
    <s>"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face" (First Corinthians 13:12).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    If everyone found that everything written was in accordance with true faith, he would not refuse those who wanted to read or copy it. It became clear that many people wanted to read or transcribe it because it was considered worthy of a Catholic confession and a response to heresy.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, some people, out of eagerness for doctrine or a sense of duty, scrutinized what I had written more meticulously. They suggested that some parts were either superfluous or ambiguous, which might be interpreted differently than I intended. Therefore, I have reorganized those parts in clearer language to show the simplicity of my thoughts and to remove any doubts for the readers.

    They argued that, when we mentioned the Word of God from the perspective of the Son, it might be understood as the breath of air struck, audible to the ear, as grammarians describe it. But we know the wisdom not of this world, which is temporary, but that which is from God, which introduces the Word of God as God, when it says: 
    <s>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made" (John 1:1-3).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, I am surprised that anyone could think we deny the distinct person of the Word, which is the Son.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one refers to someone by name only if they often profess that person to truly exist. How could we confess a true Son or a true Father if we did not truly maintain the distinct persons of both Father and Son?
  </p>
  <p>
    Because we mentioned the term "one God," it was thought that we denied the persons. This seemed plausible because we said, 
    <s>"We call the Father and the Son in such a way that we assign one God in these persons and names."</s>
    Although Father and Son are called by two names, they are one in reason and substance. When I establish the Father and the Son, I assign the unity of nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    These things were misunderstood as if these names were placed between Father and Son like a name and a surname of one person. But from the preceding or following statements, this suspicion should not have been admitted. If I said the Son of God was born properly from the Father, wholly from the whole, complete from the complete, perfect from the perfect, a consummate power; how could I place the Father Himself as the Son to Himself, and in this way call one person by two names? Especially since I condemned the Sabellian sect in the same book and wrote about the distinction of persons.
  </p>
  <p>
    No one can say "they are one," or the unity of nature, without assigning it to persons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Which of the Catholics does not know that the Father is truly the Father, the Son is truly the Son, and the Holy Spirit is truly the Holy Spirit? As the Lord Himself says to His apostles: 
    <s>"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the perfect Trinity, consisting in unity, which we profess to be of one substance. We do not make a division in God according to the condition of bodies, but according to the power of the divine nature, which is not material. We believe the persons of the names truly exist and testify to the unity of divinity.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not attribute any extension of a part from the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    We say the Son of God is not a word without substance, as if it were merely the sound of a voice. We believe three names and three persons are of one essence, one majesty, and one power. Therefore, we confess one God because the unity of majesty prohibits the plurality of gods from being called by that name.
  </p>
  <p>
    We name the Father and the Son in a Catholic manner, but it is neither possible nor necessary for us to say two gods. Not because the Son of God is not God—indeed, He is true God from true God—but because we know the Son of God comes from the one Father alone, thus we say one God. The prophets, the apostles, and the Lord Himself taught this when He says: <break time="500ms"/> "I and the Father are one" <break time="500ms"/> (John 10:30). <break time="500ms"/> "One" refers to the unity of divinity, as I said; "we are," however, assigns to persons. The apostle also says: <break time="500ms"/> "There is one God, the Father, from whom are all things; and we in Him: and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things; and we through Him. But not all possess this knowledge" <break time="500ms"/> (First Corinthians 8:6).
  </p>
  <p>
    Having explained these words which caused confusion, not for me, who knows what I have said, but for others, I believe the occasion for misinterpretation has been removed. The confession of faith is clear, the person is established with terms, and one divinity is assigned.
  </p>
  <p>
    If something still seems ambiguous in the words to the readers, the words should be referred to the sense. It is not the simplicity of the words, but the obstinacy of a bad understanding that reeks of error. Since our meaning agrees with the truth, the words should align with the most sincere reasoning. Hence, let the academic disputant depart from Christian simplicity.
