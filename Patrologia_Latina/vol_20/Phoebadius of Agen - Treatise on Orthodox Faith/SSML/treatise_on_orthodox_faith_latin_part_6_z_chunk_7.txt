    They claim the Son of God as made from God, not born from God. They remove the term 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoˈuːsion">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme> 
    (of the same substance) and replace it with 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoiˈuːsion">ὁμοιούσιον</phoneme> 
    (of similar substance). They understand the wisdom that is the Son of God as a creature.
  </p>
  <p>
    You see, therefore, all their arguments are placed not with evangelical faith but with deceitful malice to seduce the simple. It should no longer seem suspicious but clear to everyone that they claim God from God as Arius used to teach, that He was made from God, not born from God. 
  </p>
  <p>
    If He is born, He is of one substance; if made, He is not a true Son; and if He is not a true Son, neither is He a true God. Or if He is a true God and not from the Father, then there are two gods, each with their own will and different commands. Or if they are one only in agreement and companionship, then they are not of the same substance, and as I said, He is not a true God.
  </p>
  <p>
    He will be God, as Moses was to Pharaoh 
    <sub alias="Exodus seven one">Exodus 7:1</sub>, 
    by power, not by nature. The Son should also be believed as it was said to the people through Isaiah: 
    <sub alias="Isaiah one two">Isaiah 1:2</sub>, and elsewhere: 
    <sub alias="Psalm eighty-two six">Psalm 82:6</sub>. 
    And the firstborn will be regarded just as Israel was called the firstborn son of God 
    <sub alias="Exodus four twenty-two">Exodus 4:22</sub>. 
    And the firstborn of all creation will be considered as the first in the order of creation, to assign a certain series to the things created in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, by removing 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoˈuːsion">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>, 
    that is, the term of one substance, they placed 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoiˈuːsion">ὁμοιούσιον</phoneme>, 
    that is, similar to their Creator; while likeness is one thing, truth is another. For man was made in the image and likeness of God 
    <sub alias="Genesis one twenty-six">Genesis 1:26</sub>, 
    yet he is not God; nor should it be believed that God became man. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, they want the Son of God to be similar, saying He is similar from elsewhere, not from the one holy and blessed substance of the Father. If He is not from the Father's substance, He is 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛks oʊk ɒnˌtoʊn">ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων</phoneme>, 
    that is, from nothing existing, as Arius also taught: for if the Father is removed, wherever the Son comes from, He must have a beginning from nothing and an origin from time; for nothing without a beginning exists except God alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, the Son, as the Lord Himself said: 
    <sub alias="John ten thirty">John 10:30</sub>. 
    He said this to show the terms of the two persons in the majesty of one deity, as the prophet also says from the voice of God: 
    <sub alias="Psalm forty-five one">Psalm 45:1</sub>. 
    You see, therefore, this good Word is the Son of God, whom we believe was born not from elsewhere but from the Father's own heart, and so to speak, from the womb of God's heart. Therefore, He calls Him king because He is the King of kings: the Lord God, to whom all divine works submit, who said: 
    <sub alias="John sixteen fifteen">John 16:15</sub>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of this, the Evangelist also says: 
    <sub alias="John one one to three">John 1:1-3</sub>. 
    Therefore, what was in the beginning must be believed to have always existed; yet not from elsewhere, but from Him who has no beginning, that is, from the heart of the Father; because 
    <sub alias="Psalm forty-five one">Psalm 45:1</sub>. 
    For He did not say: "In the beginning, the Word was made," but "In the beginning was the Word." Whatever beginning you wish to assign to the Word, you will find it prejudged because it says, "In the beginning was."
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not say there are two beginnings from the diversity of things, but because the Word, the Son, is always with the Father and is born from the Father. Therefore, whose origin has no beginning must be believed to be eternal with the Father; because the Father can never be named without the Son, nor the Son without the Father: thus, always the Son because always the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    And the Word was God. What is God, always is; if He were not always, He could not be a true God, as even in the name of Wisdom, because according to the Apostle, He is the Wisdom of the Father 
    <sub alias="First Corinthians one twenty-four">First Corinthians 1:24</sub>. 
    "I have come forth from the mouth of the Most High" 
    <sub alias="Ecclesiasticus twenty-four five">Ecclesiasticus 24:5</sub>. 
    Therefore, not from elsewhere but from the Father, because always with...
  </p>


    <p>
        Father. And therefore, the Wisdom of God is called so, to ensure that the Father is never believed to have been without Wisdom, that is, without His Son. This is the ineffable Wisdom described in the beginning of God's ways by Solomon <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈprɑːvərbz">Proverbs</phoneme> 8:22, either established, begotten, or created.
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <p>
        However, it is described as being established in such a way that it always existed with God. For what beginning can you attribute to God that you can also assign to His Wisdom? God did not create His Wisdom as if He were ever without it. When He says the beginning of His ways, He refers to the start of some action or creation. This means that the Wisdom of God has this beginning: it proceeded from God to create all things, both heavenly and earthly, not that it began to exist in God.
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <p>
        Thus, Wisdom was created, or rather begotten, not for itself, as it always existed, but for those things that were to be made by it. Since its magnitude and quality could not be known, its power and strength are recognized through the effects of its works. Therefore, we should fear it more when we marvel at its creations.
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <p>
        However, if you say that Wisdom is created in a way that makes the Son of God a creature, the Apostle addresses this by condemning those who worship the creature, saying: "Therefore God gave them up to the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈrəʊmənz">Romans</phoneme> 1:24-25.
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <p>
        This, I say, is the Wisdom of God, which says: "I came out of the mouth of the Most High" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛˌklɛsiˈæstɪkəs">Ecclesiasticus</phoneme> 24:25, the creator and maker of the universe, that is, the Son of God through whom all things are made and in whom all things exist. As the Apostle said: "For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="kəˈlɒsiənz">Colossians</phoneme> 1:16-17.
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    <p>
        Hence, Solomon also says: "Although she is but one, she can do all things, and while remaining in herself, she renews all things, and in every generation, she passes into holy souls" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈwɪzdəm">Wisdom</phoneme> 7:27. The Apostle confirms this by saying <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɪˈfiːʒənz">Ephesians</phoneme> 3:16 that Christ dwells in the inner person, so that through Him who made all things from the beginning, all things might be saved in the end.
