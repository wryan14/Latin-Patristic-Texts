        The argument the Arians use to claim that God is not substance, and how to refute it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even now, they could use the term ὁμοούσιον just like other words, if they could twist it to a deceitful meaning. But since they found themselves trapped by this word, they wanted to avoid it entirely. They feared that by professing it, they might believe it, or by believing it, they might seem to profess it. They excused themselves by saying it wasn't written, or that God shouldn't be described as substance, to avoid implying He is corporeal.
    </p>
    <p>
        They argue that God causes substance to exist but should not be considered substance Himself, because every substance can receive something opposite. Since God can admit nothing different, they say He should not be called substance.

        I would pardon you if you said this simply, as a novice, if you hadn't always asserted either a different substance or nothing at all about the Son of God. But since you have been convicted, confessed, denied, and condemned repeatedly, you continue to agitate and disturb everything with force, ambition, and power. How can I forgive you for frequently retracting the same things? But to address this opposition briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
        You prohibit the naming of substance in God, as if all substances are of one kind. Do you not know that heavenly things are different from earthly things? Even among heavenly and worldly things, there is a great difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        The angels have their own substances different from other heavenly beings, as the Apostle says: <break time="500ms"/> The glory of the sun is one, the glory of the moon another, and the glory of the stars another <break time="500ms"/> (First Corinthians 15:41). In this world, there are different kinds of things, and different bodies of living beings, each with its own substance, as the Apostle says: <break time="500ms"/> Not all flesh is the same flesh <break time="500ms"/> (First Corinthians 15:39).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the things made by God have different qualities of their substances, do you think that God's substance can receive opposites?
    </p>
    <p>
        By no means. The substance of God is what God is: simple, singular, pure, unmixed with any admixture, clear, good, perfect, blessed, whole, entirely holy. Do you think that what God is, is something empty and void? It is blasphemy to say so. He, by whom all things stand, who brought forth all things by the Word, composed them with reason, perfected them with power, by whose will and command all things are governed and all things serve, is not empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        You read it written of God: <break time="500ms"/> I am who I am <break time="500ms"/> (Exodus 3:14); and: <break time="500ms"/> He who is sent me <break time="500ms"/> (Exodus 3:14). The Savior Himself says: <break time="500ms"/> This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent <break time="500ms"/> (John 17:3). In His substance, God is in His essence, whose knowledge is eternal life, who is so great that He cannot be spoken of. He is worthily esteemed when He is called inestimable, whether you agree or not.
    </p>

        That which is itself, is the substance of what is defended as existing. It has been said how great and how it is; neither can it be conceived by the mind, nor estimated by sense, nor defined by the soul. It is clear that it is what is believed to be. From that very essence of God, the Son exists, so that He is the true Son, and the true Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father. This is ὁμοούσιος, of one substance with the Father, as the Lord says: <break time="500ms"/> I am in the Father and the Father is in me <break time="500ms"/> (John 14:10); and: <break time="500ms"/> I and the Father are one <break time="500ms"/> (John 10:30); and: <break time="500ms"/> I came forth from the Father <break time="500ms"/> (John 16:28); and: <break time="500ms"/> Whoever has seen me has seen the Father <break time="500ms"/> (John 14:9).
    </p>
    <p>
        Not without reason, because the Son of God is born of God the Father. From the unity of substance and the majesty of divinity, they are one, as Jeremiah prophesied: <break time="500ms"/> Who has stood in the substance of the Lord, and seen the Word of the Lord <break time="500ms"/> (Jeremiah 23:18, according to the Septuagint)? And again: <break time="500ms"/> If they had stood in my substance.
