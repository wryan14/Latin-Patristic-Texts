    With the unity of substance in the Father and the Son being confirmed not only by prophetic but also by evangelical authority, it cannot be said that <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoʊˈusios">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme> is not found in the sacred scriptures. This is the reasoning behind the name. Furthermore, if an Arian wants to establish a comparison in God to some similarity, they cannot define it more precisely unless they say, "light from light."
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, since you recognize this unity of substance in the Father and the Son by not only prophetic but also evangelical authority, how can you say that <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoʊˈusios">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme> is not found in the divine Scriptures, as if <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="homoʊˈusios">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme> were something other than what it states: "I came forth from God the Father" <break time="250ms"/> (John 16:28), and "I and the Father are one" <break time="250ms"/> (John 10:30); or what the prophets clearly indicated about the substance of God?
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the reasoning behind the name, so that you may believe in the unity of substance in the Father and the Son, even though you cannot define the very thing that is indescribable: whether you say light from light, word from word, spirit from spirit, or Lord from Lord, whatever you say about Him, believe that the Father and the Son are of one essence, and understand the Son from that very essence which is the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    For if you make any comparison from the things that are visible, you will not show the reasoning through the dissimilarity of things, but will introduce quarrelsome disputes, as it is written: "To whom will you liken me?" <break time="250ms"/> (Isaiah 46:5). Therefore, God, to whom nothing can be likened, is sufficient to be believed as He is perceived, whom He wished to be believed, not to be described.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, if from this very thing which you profess with me, you want to compare to some similarity in God, I do not know if you can define more precisely what you have compared: for example, when you say light from light, if you are compelled by a meticulous explanation to clarify it, I ask how you believe light from light? Is it like a lamp from a lamp, or like a sun from a sun, so that you may introduce either two lamps or two suns, as if two gods under this example? Or do you indicate the brightness of the same lamp’s light or the clarity of the sun shining from the same sun, as light from light, so that you may liken the form of the Father's light to the matrix, and show the Son in the brightness of the clarity; as the prophet said about Him: "With you is the fountain of life, and in your light we see light" <break time="250ms"/> (Psalm 36:9); or Solomon, when he says: "He is the brightness of eternal light, and the spotless mirror of God's majesty, and the image of His goodness" <break time="250ms"/> (Wisdom 7:26); or the Apostle here <break time="250ms"/> (Colossians 1:15) proclaimed that our Savior is the image of the invisible God, because the image of the sun is its light, which proceeds from the same sun.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it is lengthy to say how many responses can generate disputes, which the Apostle forbids <break time="250ms"/> (Second Timothy 2:24), since it is clear that the light which is God cannot be estimated, comprehended, or defined: nor can anything truly in this world be compared to the divine majesty; because none of all these things that are seen or spoken can be estimated with a worthy similarity according to what God is, since He is greater than intellects and senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, He warned that you should believe in the divinity of substance, and recognize the true Son from the true Father: but you should not inquire about the quality of the thing; because you cannot know what or how great it is. This is what the prophets and the apostles preached.
