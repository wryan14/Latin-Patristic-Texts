This action isn't praised or excused by any allegory but is considered pure history. It's believed that he did this in reality, and it's known that it greatly displeased God.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        We also read that the prophet Hosea took a wife of prostitution. Whether this happened literally, or as some think should be understood spiritually, doesn't matter much, as long as we understand that he did it not out of a weakness for lust, but because he was bound by the duty of obedience. In this marriage, he followed the divine command and undoubtedly symbolized Christ. However, the actions of Solomon, who was recorded as having been unfaithful to God, and who, after receiving so many gifts from God, turned to foreign women and worshipped their gods, can't be compared to this.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It's also mentioned to David as if referring to Solomon, which clearly doesn't fit Solomon: \"When your days are complete and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever\" <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈtuː ˈsæm.ju.əl\">Second Samuel</phoneme> 7. If anyone carefully considers this promise to David, where his offspring is promised to be raised up-not before his death but after-they will see Solomon isn't referred to here, as he was undoubtedly raised up before David's death. Indeed, Divine Wisdom wisely arranged that Solomon was both born and reigned before his father's death, unlike any other king, so that this prophecy wouldn't be fulfilled in him, as it states: \"When you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring.\"\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Quod factum nulla commendat vel excusat\n allegoria, sed pura tenetur historia. ut et hoc\nrealiter fecisse credatur, et in hoc, Deo non mediocriter\ndisplicuisse sciatur.

Hoc siquidem divina\nSapientia prudenter ordinavit, quod Salomon ante\nmortem patris, et natus est, et regnavit, quod de\nnullo regum alio legitur, ut in illo haec prophetia\nnon inveniret effectum, quia dicitur: Cum dormieris\ncum patribus tuis, suscitabo semen tuum."

      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    It's not specifically mentioned that any of these kings were appointed before their father's death or named king by anyone. Although King Uzziah was still alive, he was afflicted with leprosy and lived separately because of it. His son Jotham, as it's written, managed the palace and judged the people of the land. Jotham isn't called king, nor does the divine Scripture say he reigned until it's declared that his father Uzziah passed away. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Indeed, Jotham could lead by managing the palace and judging the people without being king, because not everyone tasked with judging is immediately given the royal anointing and title. Solomon, however, was anointed king in Gihon while David was still alive, with the people shouting, \"Long live King Solomon\" (First Kings 1). From then on, he is consistently called king, freely taking the throne of the kingdom. This fulfilled the divine promise that his seed would be raised after David's death, which is understood in Christ. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Therefore, beyond the literal sense, this is fulfilled in Christ in a spiritual understanding, who was to be born from David's lineage long after David and reign eternally with his saints. \"I will establish his kingdom,\" he says; \"He shall build a house for my name.\" To clarify it doesn't refer to Solomon, who built a material house for God, it adds, \"And I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.\" Since it's well-known that Solomon's kingdom wasn't everlasting, it's certain that Christ reigns eternally, so it's clear this prophecy foretold him, even though it seems to allude to Solomon. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Furthermore, the addition of: \"If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, but I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before me,\" also truthfully refers to Christ, according to the distinctive nature of his members, from whose voice it is said in the Psalm: \"Far from my salvation are the words of my transgressions\" (Psalm 22).\n  </p>\n</speak>",

They insist on understanding them through their own perspective, and without careful consideration of their words, they defend their errors with bold verbosity instead of truth. Believing themselves clever and quick to speak, they refuse to learn from their elders. Impatient to leave the nest, they attempt to discuss before they are ready. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        As a result, different people have varied opinions about Solomon, and many disagree with the canonical Scripture, whose authority is established, because they don't fully align with those who have understood and explained it.

After the death of the young son Bathsheba bore to King David from adultery, it's said that David comforted Bathsheba, his wife. He went to her, and she gave birth to a son named Solomon, whom the Lord loved. The Lord sent a message through Nathan the prophet and named him \"Beloved of the Lord\" because the Lord loved him. In Hebrew, as they say, it's written: He called his name Jedidiah, which means \"beloved for the sake of the Lord.\"\n    </p>\n</speak>",

While they appear straightforward, they are definitely worthy of serious reflection.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Through these passages, we are reminded of the need to lament human suffering and to remember and fear only God's justice. Our own sense of justice is either insignificant or nearly so, as it cannot initiate or complete itself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This is why the prophet, as if lacking or disregarding justice, said, \"Lord, I will remember only Your righteousness\" <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈsɑːlm\">Psalm</phoneme> 70.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Who wouldn't praise Solomon, supported by such incredible blessings-wisdom, power, wealth, and glory, all generously given by the divine?

Who wouldn't fear the stringent test of divine justice?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It's important to understand that anyone who boasts should do so not in themselves, but in the Lord.

That's why, according to the seventy interpreters, the prophet Amos saw the Lord standing over a diamond wall, holding a diamond in His hand. A diamond is a precious stone, known for its resilience against hammers, anvils, files, fire, and the passage of time. Yet, despite all this, it cannot withstand the warmth of goat's blood; if touched by it, all its strength dissolves.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Absit vero ut talis esset Matthaeus\ncum Evangelium scriberet et se in illo publicanum\nnominaret, sed talis procul dubio fuerat quando ad\nteloneum residebat? Caeterum Christi vocatione et\ninspiratione commonitus, tam teloneum quam caetera\nquae male vel agebat vel habebat, dimisit, et re ipsa\nvocabuli relegata, rei tamen vocabulum non amisit. Apud eumdem Matthaeum dicit Dominus: Pharisaei,\npublicani et peccatores praecedunt vos in regno\nDei (Matth XXI). Quomodo, quaeso, in regno Dei\npublicani Pharisaeos praecedunt, qui, nisi publicani\nesse desierint, ad illud nunquam accedunt? Eos igitur\npublicanos appellat qui publicani fuerunt et\nquando ad regnum Dei vel non accedentes, vel tardius\naccedentes praecedunt, publicani esse procul\n dubio destiterunt. Marcus Evangelista (cap II), cum\nde ejusdem Matthaei vocatione loqueretur: Vidit,\ninquit, Levi sedentem ad teloneum et ait illi: Sequere\nme. Et surgens secutus est eum."

This is why Jerome, urged by Sophronius, translated the Psalms of David according to the Hebrew truth. When Sophronius debated with a Hebrew individual and presented some testimonies from the Psalms according to the Septuagint translators, the Hebrew mocked him for not knowing Hebrew letters, claiming that either the words didn't exist in Hebrew where they were found or were found where they weren't. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In the following pages, it is mentioned: The words of Solomon after he voluntarily lost the kingdom, writing Ecclesiasticus: Solomon ruled during peaceful times, and God subdued all his enemies so he could build a house in His name, and the rest follows in the same chapter. Solomon didn't write Ecclesiasticus, as Augustine stated in the seventeenth book of The City of God, and before Augustine, Jerome mentioned in many places. Jerome noted he found this book in Hebrew, not called Ecclesiasticus as among the Latins, but titled Proverbs.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Revertendum est itaque ad eos tantum\n reges, quos in libro suo Jesus nominavit. Cum enim\nillic poneret patriarchas, prophetas, judices, sacerdotes,\nqui, ut superius dixi, in populo Dei fuerunt;\ninterposuit etiam non omnes, sed quosdam ejusdem\npopuli reges, videlicet David, Salomonem, Roboam,\nJeroboam, Ezechiam, Josiam. Post Josiam vero cum\nnullum regem vellet deinceps nominare, dixit quod\nsaepe dictum est: Praeter David, et Ezechiam et Josiam,\nomnes peccatum commiserunt. Omnes scilicet\nreges quos nominavit, id est Salomonem, Roboam,\nJeroboam. Nunc videndum est cujusmodi peccatum\nsit, quod isti commiserunt, a quo David et\nEzechias et Josias immunes exstiterunt. Neque\nenim omne, sed quoddam peccatum vult intelligi,\nsicut Dominus in Evangelio cum de Judaeis loqueretur:\n Si non venissem, inquit, peccatum non haberent\n(Joan XV); non omne, sed quoddam peccatum\nvolens intelligi quod scilicet ante adventum\nejus non habebant, eo autem praesente habuerunt. Hoc autem peccatum quod Salomon et Roboam et\nJeroboam commiserunt, quantum aestimo, idololatria\nest, qua relictis patriis legibus ad ritum gentium\ntranseuntes aedificaverunt excelsa, idola fabricaverunt,\nadoraverunt daemonia. Quod ibidem videtur\ninnui cum additur: Nam reliquerunt legem potentem\nreges Juda. Lex potens est colere Deum, adorare\nDeum, juxta illud mandatum: Dominum\nDeum tuum adorabis."
