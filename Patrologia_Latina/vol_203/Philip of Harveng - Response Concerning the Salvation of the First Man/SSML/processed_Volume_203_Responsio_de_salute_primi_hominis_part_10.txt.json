      "original_latin": "Quod si ad Novum Testamentum venire libuerit,\ninvenietur et ibi Christi vocatio non esse otiosa,\nimo incomparabiliter fructuosa, dum nihil aliud videtur\nejus esse vocatio, quam quaedam gratiae spiritalis\ninfusio. Unde Matthaeus evangelista cum de\n Jacobo et Joanne loqueretur: Procedens, inquit,\nJesus, vidit alios duos fratres, Jacobum Zebedaei et\nJoannem fratrem ejus, reficientes retia sua, et vocavit\neos (Matth IV). Quid autem in hoc quod ait, vocavit\neos, intelligi voluerit, id est cujus gratiae\nhaec vocatio fuerit, manifestat cum subjungit: At\nilli, relictis retibus et patre, secuti sunt eum (ibid). Sicut enim paulo ante Petrus et Andreas audito:\nVenite post me, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum,\ncontinuo relictis retibus secuti sunt eum\n(ibid ), sic nimirum Jacobus et Joannes, relictis\nretibus et patre, secuti sunt eum, cum tamen talibus\nverbis non legantur fuisse invitati, sed tantummodo\nvocati. Hoc idem Marcus (cap III) et Lucas (cap V)\ntestati sunt, qui de eorum vocatione locuti sunt.",
