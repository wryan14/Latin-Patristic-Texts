      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    When Mark the Evangelist described the list of apostles, he said, \"Jesus went up the mountain and called to himself those he wanted, and he made it so there were twelve with him, giving them the power to heal illnesses and cast out demons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Listing them one by one, he ended with Judas Iscariot. If anyone wonders what grace Judas received from this calling, since it's known that while others were chosen, he was rejected, they should understand that he was given significant grace, as he received the power to heal illnesses and cast out demons along with the others. However, the saving grace, which I believe is given to those specifically called by God, seems not to apply to Judas as the twelfth, but rather to the number twelve itself. It is understood that the one truly called, and who pleased the caller, was another.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If I am not mistaken, the evangelist himself hints at this subtly, if one pays more than superficial attention to his words. When he said, \"He called to himself those he wanted,\" he then added, \"And he made it so there were twelve with him.\" Since the number twelve of the apostles was full of great mystery, it is without a doubt that this number was called and chosen. It was not diminished by Judas's fall, as another was substituted for him. He said, \"He made it so there were twelve with him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Indeed, Matthias was already with him, chosen by him in the secret of his counsel, more so than Judas Iscariot, who only appeared to walk with him for a short time. Christ wanted there to be twelve with him so much that even Judas could not reduce the number to eleven. Even as Judas fell to destruction, the perfection of the number twelve was maintained. The number eleven is accused of transgression, while the number twelve is fortified by the power of perfection. So, to ensure the saving mystery of the number was preserved, not just eleven, but twelve remained in the ministry.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Marcus evangelista cum catalogum apostolorum\ndescriberet: Ascendens, inquit, in montem Jesus,\nvocavit ad se quos voluit ipse, et fecit ut essent\nduodecim cum illo et dedit illis potestatem curandi\ninfirmitates, et ejiciendi daemonia (ibid). Et enumerans\nsingillatim eos quos Christus vocavit, ad\nJudam Iscarioth numerum terminavit. Si quis autem\nquaerat quid gratiae in hac vocatione idem Judas\nconsecutus sit, cum certum sit quod aliis electis\nipse reprobatus sit, sciat quod et ei non mediocris\ndata est gratia, cum accepit potestatem cum caeteris\ncurandi infirmitates et ejiciendi daemonia. Illa vero\ngratia salutaris, quam his qui a Deo specialiter vocantur,\naestimo conferri, ut mihi videtur, non ad\n Judam duodecimum, sed ad duodenarium numerum\ndebet referri, ut ille intelligatur vocatus fuisse, ille\nvocanti placuisse. Quod, ni fallor, et ipse evangelista\nvidetur latenter innuere si quis velit non perfunctorio\nverba ejus attendere. Cum enim dixisset: Vocavit\nad se quos voluit, ipse subjunxit: Et fecit ut\nessent duodecim cum illo. Quia enim duodenarius\napostolorum numerus magni sacramenti plenus fuit,\nille procul dubio vocatus, ille electus fuit, nec est\nJuda cadente imminutus, cum pro eo alius sit substitutus. Fecit, inquit, ut essent duodecim cum\nillo. Magis quippe Mathias jam tunc erat cum illo,\nqui in secreto consilii sui jam electus erat ab illo;\nquam Judas Iscarioth, qui tantum ad oculum aliquantisper\nambulavit cum illo. Adeo autem Christus\n secum voluit esse duodecim, ut nec Judas posset\nefficere, ut tantum essent undecim; sed eo ruente in\npraecipitium, sua tamen perfectio servavit duodenarium. Undenarius quippe transgressionis arguitur,\nduodenarius vero virtute perfectionis munitur, et\nideo ne salubri numerus privaretur mysterio, non\nundecim tantum, sed duodecim permanserunt in\nministerio.",

      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n    <p>\n        If someone suggests that the term \"called,\" as used in Mark, should be seen as \"summoned\" because of a linguistic figure called apheresis-which involves removing a syllable from the beginning of a word-then there would be no specific issue with Judas. Instead, it would apply to him just like it does to the others, meaning a gathering or assembly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The terms \"to summon\" and \"to call\" don't seem to mean the same thing. Whether you interpret it this way or another, the simple term seems to shift its meaning slightly. When Christ ascends the mountain, he is said to summon, or gather, the twelve disciples, as clearly stated by other evangelists like Matthew and Luke.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Matthew says in chapter fifteen, \"He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out.\" And Luke, in chapter nine, states, \"He called the twelve together and gave them power over all demons and to cure diseases.\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Christ is found to summon not only Judas but also the blasphemous Jews, where no benefit to them is apparent. In the same chapter of Mark that I briefly mentioned, when the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, \"He has Beelzebub, and by the ruler of the demons, he drives out demons,\" he says, having called them, he spoke to them in parables: \"How can Satan drive out Satan?\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In this gathering, no benefit to the blasphemers is shown, unless perhaps it is implied, as is sometimes read in John: \"And many in the crowd believed in him\" (John 2).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Undoubtedly, there is a different calling and a different effect of calling, as mentioned by the evangelist John when Martha says to Mary, \"The Teacher is here and is calling for you\" (John 11). And later in the same book of John: \"He called Lazarus and raised him from the dead\" (John 11).\n    </p><break time=\"500ms\"/>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Si autem quod apud Marcum ponitur,\nVocavit improprie positum intelligi debere quis\ndixerit, pro eo videlicet quod est, convocavit, ut\nper figuram quae apheresis appellatur, diminutionem\nsyllabicam verbum istud in capite pariatur, nulla\njam quaestio de Juda remanebit, sed ad eum, quemadmodum\nad caeteros convocatio, id est adunatio,\n pertinebit. Neque enim ejusdem sensum habere\nvidetur, convocare et vocare, sed sive hoc modo,\nsive quolibet alio istud simplex componatur, nisi\nfallor, significatio aliquantulum immutatur. Ascendens\nChristus in montem duodecim discipulos\nconvocare, id est adunare dicitur, quod apud alios\nevangelistas, Matthaeum videlicet et Lucam, evidenter\nexprimitur. Convocatis, ait Matthaeus (cap XV), duodecim discipulis suis, dedit illis potestatem\nspirituum immundorum, ut ejicerent eos. Et\nLucas (cap IX): Convocatis, inquit, duodecim apodedit\n350 illis virtutem super omnia daemonia, et\nstolis, ut languores curarent. Non solum autem\nJudam, verum etiam blasphemos Judaeos convocare\nChristus invenitur, ubi tamen nulla eorum utilitas\n reperitur. Marcus in eodem capitulo de quo aliquantisper\nlocutus sum, cum Scribae qui a Jerosolymis\ndescenderant, dicerent: Quoniam Beelzebub\nhabet, et quia in principe daemoniorum ejicit daemonia,\nconvocatis, inquit, eis, in parabolis dicebat\nillis: Quomodo potest Satanas Satanam ejicere? (Marc III) Et caetera. In qua convocatione nulla\nblasphemorum utilitas declaratur, nisi forte subintelligatur\nquod apud Joannem aliquando legitur: Et\nmulti de turba crediderunt in eum (Joan II). Alia\nprocul dubio est illa vocatio, alius vocationis effectus,\nde qua apud Joannem evangelistam dicit Martha ad\nMariam: Magister adest, et vocat te (Joan XI). Et infra idem Joannes: Vocavit, inquit, Lazarum,\net suscitavit eum a mortuis (ibid ).",
