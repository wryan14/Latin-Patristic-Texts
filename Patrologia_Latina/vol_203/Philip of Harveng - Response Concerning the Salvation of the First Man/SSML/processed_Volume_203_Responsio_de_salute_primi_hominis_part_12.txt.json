Paulus, inquit, servus Jesu Christi, vocatus\napostolus (Rom I). A quo autem vocatus sit, Galatis\nscribens evidenter intimavit Paulus, inquiens,\napostolus non ab hominibus, neque per hominem,\nsed per Jesum Christum et Deum Patrem, qui suscitavit\neum a mortuis (Galat I) Quanta gratia vel\nquo fructu vocatus sit, paulo post in eadem epistola\ndeclaravit: Cum autem placuit ei qui me segregavit\nde utero matris mae, et vocavit per gratiam\nsuam ut revelaret in me Filium suum, ut evangelizarem\n illum in gentibus (ibid). Ne autem haec\ngratia perfunctoria et inutilis putaretur, quia eo\nipso Apostolo teste multi Christum per occasionem\nannuntiant et non caste, Timotheo scribens: Collabora,\ninquit, Evangelio secundum virtutem Dei,\nqui nos liberavit et vocavit vocatione sua sancta,\nnon secundum opera nostra, sed secundum propositum\nsuum, et gratiam quae data est nobis in Christo\nJesu ante tempora saecularia (II Tim I). Dicturus\nnimirum et vocavit praemisit, liberavit, ut\nplane innotesceret quam sancta, quam salutaris haec\nesset vocatio, quam praecedit liberatio. Totam quippe\nmassam humani generis primus Adam naevo transgressionnis\ninvolvit, unde quosdam praedestinatio\n Dei ea bonitate quae sua est, absolvit; quos ab illo\ninvolucro absolutos, et in secreto consilii sui jam\nliberatos, postmodum vocavit vocatione sua sancta,\nhoc est, inspiravit, illuminavit cognitione sua, ut\nde eadem massa de qua secundum meritum fiebant\nvasa in contumeliam, fierent vasa in honorem natura\nnon ablata, sed purgata per gratiam. Cujus divitias\ngratuitae liberationis, et fructuosae vocationis, ad\nRomanos loquens ita denuntiat: Ut ostenderet divitias\ngloriae suae in vasa misericordiae quae praeparavit\nin gloriam, quos et vocavit, nos non solum ex\nJudaeis, sed etiam ex gentibus (Rom IX).",
