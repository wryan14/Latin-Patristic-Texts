      "original_latin": "Per totum corpus Epistolarum suarum de hac vocatione\nApostolus saepenumero loquitur, nusquam\ntamen evidentius et brevius quam paulo ante ad\nRomanos, ubi quatuor divinorum beneficiorum gradus\nita complectitur. Nam quos praescivit et praedestinavit\nconformes fieri imaginis Filii sui, ut sit\nipse primogenitus in multis fratribus. Quos autem\npraedestinavit, hos et vocavit; et quos vocavit, hos\net justificavit; quos autem justificavit, illos et glorificavit\n(Rom VIII). Vides quia primum erga nos\n Dei beneficium est praedestinatio, qua nos ad vitam\npraeordinamur aeternam; secundum, vocatio qua\ninvitamur et inspiramur ut vitam appetamus aeternam;\ntertium, justificatio, qua peccatis remissis, vitam\nbene operando meremur aeternam; quartum, glorificatio,\nquando justitia conversa in judicium, pacem\net vitam possidemus aeternam. Primum quidem\napud ipsum fit, non in nobis; secundum ab ipso in\nnobis; tertium ab ipso, cooperantibus nobis;\nquartum ab ipso, jam emeritis nobis. Primum nos\neligit antequam simus; secundum, admonet ut boni\nsimus; tertium, efficit ut justi simus; quartum, ut\ngloriosi et immortales simus. Primum nihil est aliud\nquam divinae veritas praescientiae; secundum, infusio\ngratiae; tertium, operatio justitiae; quartum, retributio\n gloriae. Primum, praenoscit longe post futuros;\nsecundum, vocat immeritos; tertium, peccata remittens,\nmerita donat; quartum, jam bene meritos\nsine fine coronat. Sicut igitur non glorificantur nisi\njustificati, nec justificantur nisi vocati, sic procul\ndubio non vocantur nisi praedestinati. Haec est illa\nspecialis vocatio Dei quae nulli attribuitur nisi ei;\nqua non vocantur nisi qui futuri sunt sancti, qui\njuxta Apostolum (Rom VIII), secundum propositum\nvocati sunt sancti. Non quidem secundum meritum\nsuum, sed secundum propositum 351 Dei, quia\nsine poenitentia sunt dona et vocatio Dei (Rom XI).",
