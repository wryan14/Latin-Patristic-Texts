      "original_latin": "Vocavit, inquit, Deus Adam, et dixit: Adam,\nubi es? (Gen III) Magna dignatio Creatoris, quod\nplasma suum requirit, nec sustinet ut remaneat in\nlatibulo iniquitatis, sed vult ut prodeat et redeat\nad lucem veritatis. Hac incude, hoc malleo hujus\ninquisitionis, jam tunc sacramentum cudebatur nostrae\nreputationis, dum ille qui peccaverat vitio iniquae\nconsensionis, invitatur ad medelam dignae confessionis,\nut eodem ore quo contra salutem facta\nest injusta comestio, jam fieret ad salutem vera confessio. Adam, inquit, ubi es? Ac si dicat: Non expedit\ntibi ut diutius lateas, exi foras, progredere,\n confitere, dic tu iniquitates tuas ut justificeris. Et\nille: Audivi, inquit, vocem tuam, et timui, eo quod\nnudus essem, et abscondi me (ibid). Satis superque\nhomo ante peccatum poterat gloriari, satis superque\nfelix poterat judicari, cui tam innumera beneficia\nDeus contulerat gratis, cui se tanto astrinxerat\nvinculo charitatis. Ut enim caetera omittam\nquae superius dicta superfluum est hic replicari, magna\nerat ei felicitas inter angelos conversari, magna\ndenique gloria Deum visibiliter contemplari, qui\ncum sit invisibilis per naturam, visibilis erat ei per\nassumptam visibilem creaturam. Eo quidem modo\nDeum in paradiso positus homo videbat, quo postmodum\npatriarchae veteresque justi cum adhuc in\ncarne viverent, eum videre potuerunt, quem assumpta\n visibili specie tanquam angelum vel hominem\nsibi apparentem, Deum esse procul dubio cognoverunt. Unde et de Jacob scriptum est: Ecce vir luctabatur\ncum eo usque mane (Gen XXXII). Et paulo\npost idem Jacob: Vidi, inquit, Deum facie ad faciem,\net salva facta est anima mea (ibid). Et Josue\ncum esset in agro Jericho: Vidit, inquit, virum\nstantem contra se, et evaginatum tenentem gladium,\nperrexitque ad eum, et ait: Noster es an adversariorum? (Josue V) Et paulo post subditur: Dixitque\nDominus ad Josue. Haud dubium quin is cui\nidem Josue loquebatur.",

This demonstrates that when God appeared in the form of a man or angel, people recognized it as an encounter with God. Although God is naturally invisible, He chose to appear visibly to those He wished, in the manner He desired.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Indeed, three men are said to have appeared to Abraham, and two angels to Lot, where nothing less than God was understood to be present \n        <s>(Genesis 18, 19).</s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This is why the first humans, upon realizing their nakedness after sinning-not because they lost any clothes, as they had none before, but because they lost the holiness in which they were created-felt ashamed and feared being seen by God. They used to see God in the way previously mentioned, and so they hid among the trees of paradise, covering their now shameful parts with fig leaves, which were perhaps the first things they found as they fled in distress.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, even if by sinning and fleeing they could avoid seeing God, they could not hide from Him. \n        <s>The eyes of the Lord observe the good and the evil</s> \n        <s>(Proverbs 15);</s> \n        <s>and the face of the Lord is against those who do evil</s> \n        <s>(Psalms 33).</s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        He sees even those who do not see Him and follows them no matter how much they flee.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Gedeon quoque cum excuteret,\ninquit, et purgaret frumentum in torculari,\nut fugeret Madian; apparuit ei angelus Domini, et\n ait: Dominus tecum virorum fortissime (Judic VI). Et paucis interpositis subjungitur: Vidensque Gedeon\nquod esset angelus Domini, ait: Heu mihi! Domine Deus, quia vidi angelum Domini facie ad\nfaciem. Dixitque ei Dominus: Pax tecum; ne timeas;\nnon morieris (ibid). Manue nihilominus appatuit\nangelus, de quo Scriptura: Intellexit, inquit, Manue\nangelum esse Domini, et dixit ad uxorem suam:\nMorte moriemur, quia vidimus Dominum. Cui mulier\nrespondit: Si Dominus nos vellet occidere, de\nmanibus nostris holocausta et libamenta non suscepisset\n(Judic XIII). Videtis quia quem Scriptura\nvirum dicit vel angelum, eumdem appellat et Deum,\nut ostenderet quia in viro vel angelo quoquomodo\nsibi apparente, homines intelligebant Deum, qui\n cum sit, ut dictum est, natura invisibilis, quibus\ntamen volebat, quomodo volebat, apparebat visibilis. Denique et Abrahae tres viri, Lot vero duo angeli\nleguntur apparuisse, in quibus nihil aliud quam Deus\nintelligitur fuisse (Gen XVIII XIX). Hinc est quod\nilli primi homines, cum post peccatum se nudos\ncognoscerent, non ablatis vestibus quas antea non\nhabebant, sed perdita sanctitate in qua creati erant,\nerubuerunt quidem, et a Deo videri timuerunt,\nquem, eo quo praedictum est modo, videre solebant,\net ob id inter ligna paradisi ut absconderentur fugerunt,\nvelantes ea quae jam pudenda erant ficulneis\nfrondibus, quae perturbatis et fugientibus forte primitus\n occurrerunt. Si enim peccando et fugiendo\npotuerunt quidem efficere ut Deum non viderent,\nsed non potuerunt efficere ut laterent. Oculi enim\nDomini contemplantur bonos et malos (Prov XV);\net Vultus Domini super facientes mala (Psal XXXIII). Videt quippe ille etiam non videntes, consequitur\nquantumvis fugientes."
