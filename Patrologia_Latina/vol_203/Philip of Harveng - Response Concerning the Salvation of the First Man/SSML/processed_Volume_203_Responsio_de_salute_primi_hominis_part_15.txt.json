      "original_latin": " Hoc intelligens Adam cum audiret se requiri, noluit\ntacendo diutius latere, sed confitendo apparere. Et ait: Audivi, Domine, vocem tuam, et timul,\n eo quod nudus essem, et abscondi me (Gen III);\nac si diceret: Scio quia cum intra fines meos obedientia\nversaretur, induebar stola immortalitatis,\ninnocentiae, sanctitatis; nec formidabam faciem\ntuam, cum in sancto apparerem tibi ad videndam\nvirtutem tuam et gloriam tuam. Cum autem ruptis\nrepagulis continentiae corrui in praecipitium inobedientiae,\nnudatus sum et confusus; et ut pudori meo\ninvenirem qualecunque remedium, male doctus quaesivi\nlatibulum. Et in hoc peccavi, et in hoc peccasse\nme confiteor. Confiteor, inquam, me peccasse, non\nsolum comedendo, verum etiam abscondendo. Quo\nibo a spiritu tuo, et quo 352 a facie tua fugiam? (Psal CXXXVIII) Fugiendum quidem fuit post peccatum,\n sed ad te, non ad me. Ad meipsum enim\nturbata est anima mea, propterea deinceps memor\nero tui (Psal XLI). Et Dominus ad cumulum debitae\nconfusionis et instrumentum emendationis, replicat\nmiseriam et causam miseriae, ut audiens homo\nquid fecerit et quid meruerit, amplius affligatur, et\nafflictus purgari mereatur. Quis, ait, indicavit tibi\nquod nudus esses, nisi quia de ligno quod praecepi\ntibi ne comederes, comedisti? (Gen III) Hoc est\ndicere: Quis incussit tibi nuditatis hujus notitiam,\nnisi quia non servasti obedientiam? Quia non permansisti\nin eo quod acceperas, sentis malum, et cognoscis\nquod ante non noveras. Et ille: Mulier,\ninquit, quam dedisti mihi sociam, dedit mihi, et\ncomedi (ibid). Tanta, inquit, fuit perversitas meae\n voluntatis, ut eam ad peccandum suasio perfacilis\ninclinaret, et animum virilem feminea mollities enervaret. Dedisti mihi mulierem sociam quidem ad convivendum,\nnon praeviam ad peccandum, ut quae conditione\nerat posterior, esset etiam dignitate inferior,\net mihi imperanti obtemperans subderetur, et me\ntibi subditum sequeretur.",

      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    In a reversed and unexpected way, I followed the one who came before me. I listened to the persuader, accepted the offer, and failed to guide the misled; instead, I destroyed myself-not because of error, but because of love. What she, in her misplaced trust, convinced me to do, I completed out of misguided duty as a husband, choosing not to upset her, but in doing so, I upset my God. My sin was not any less because it was committed knowingly and deliberately.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    She gave to me, and I ate. I, who should have stopped her from eating and corrected her mistake, not only failed to prevent her but also partook myself, bound-or rather conquered-by affection, losing the strength I should have had as a husband.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If what he said, \"The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate,\" seems to some like not a humble confession but an excuse, suggesting he tried to share the blame for disobedience with the woman, I can't disagree. Many saints have shared this view and expressed it in their writings.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    He might have been mistaken here, not realizing how displeasing it would be to God as he blamed the woman in his response. He didn't see how serious it was to make excuses, even though he spoke the truth. So, he wasn't misled by eating, but he was misled in making excuses. He knowingly offended God by eating, but unknowingly by making excuses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To God, the ultimate justice, even truthful excuses for sin are not pleasing. He desires not an incautious defense that worsens the fault, but a pure and simple confession to wash it away. Therefore, without excuses, the sinner should say to Him: \"I have sinned, Lord, have mercy on me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But indeed, this unprepared soul had no guidance in this matter, no example to learn from. Although he knew it was wrong to disobey God's command, he didn't understand that even truth could displease eternal truth. He knew the fallen angel disobeyed and fell, but he didn't grasp that speaking the truth could also lead to offense.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

Quod enim illa male credula\npersuasit, ego male uxorius consummavi, et ne illam\ncontristarem, Deum meum contristavi; nec ideo\n minus peccavi quod sciens prudensque peccavi. Dedit\nmihi, et comedi. Ego, inquam, ego qui etiam\ncomedentem debui prohibere, et jure potestatis a\nculpa revocare, non solum non prohibui, verum et\ncomedi, adeo vinctus imo victus amore sociali, ut\nme illi enerviter substernerem privatus rigore maritali. Si autem quod ait: Mulier quam dedisti mihi,\ndedit mihi et comedi, aliquibus videatur non humilis\nfuisse confessio, sed quaedam excusatio, ut\nquod divinae jussioni contempsit obedire, non sibi\ntotum, sed mulieri pariter conaretur ascribere; non\naudeo refragari, praesertim cum plerique sanctorum\nita senserint, et in opusculis suis scriptum reliquerint. Potuit quidem in hoc falli, quia Deo tantopere\ndisplicere non putavit, quod in responsione sua mulierem\n accusavit, non aestimans sibi tam graviter\nimputari, quod, quamvis verum diceret, conatus est\nexcusari. Qui igitur non est seductus in comestione,\nseductus est in excusatione, dum in illa Deum offendit\nnon inscius, in ista vero nescius. Deo quippe, qui\nsumma est aequitas, in excusatione peccati, nec ipsa\nplacet veritas, nec vult ut culpam augeat incauta\ndefensio, sed pura et simplex abstergat confessio. Restat igitur ut omni excusatione ablegata peccator\ndicat ei: Peccavi, Domine, miserere mei. Sed enim\nrudis iste athleta nullum super hoc documentum\nacceperat, nullius praecedentis exemplo instructus\nfuerat, et qui sciebat malum esse non obedire divinae\njussioni, nesciebat displicere quod verum est aeternae\nveritati. Noverat quippe apostatam angelum, quia\n non obedivit, corruisse, sed eum non intellexerat vera\ndicendo offensam incurrisse.",
