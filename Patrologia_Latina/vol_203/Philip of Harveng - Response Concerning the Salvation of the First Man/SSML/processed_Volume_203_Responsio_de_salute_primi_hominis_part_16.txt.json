      "original_latin": " Et dixit, inquit, Dominus ad mulierem: Quare\nhoc fecisti? Quae respondit: Serpens decepit me, et\ncomedi (Gen III). Et hoc quidem veraciter, etsi\nnon sapienter, dictum est. Est enim decepta a serpente. Verumtamen nec transgredi per deceptionem,\nnec transgressioni superaddere debuit excusationem. Nec moveat quemquam si post vocationem qua dixi\na Domino Adam fuisse vocatum, invenitur commisisse\npeccatum, cum non dixerim hoc illi vocationem\nconferre, ne omnino ulterius peccaret, sed ne in\npeccatis pertinaciter permaneret. Quis enim se tam\nparvo sensu induerit, ut dicat quod ille, postquam a\nDeo vocatus est, nullum peccatum commiserit, cum\ntanto postea tempore vixerit; qui illum per inobedientiam\njam perdiderat statum, in quo si permansisset,\nnullum omnino sensisset peccatum? Quia vero\nillum perdidit, in hanc miseriam et miserandam decidit\nvitam, in qua jam non vivitur sine peccato;\nsed liberatur ab eo qui hac vocatione commendabili\nvocatur a Deo. Nostis profecto Moysen (Num XX)\npost gratiam divinae vocationis irritasse Deum ad\n aquas contradictionis, et ob id non intrasse terram\npromissionis, nec tamen exclusum a finibus aeternae\nbenedictionis.",
