      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n    <p>\"You will crawl on your belly,\" it says in Genesis 3. Since he started speaking to the serpent, he keeps the metaphor going, showing how it applies spiritually to the devil. The chest is indeed where the heart and thoughts reside. So, calling the chest a dwelling for every twisted person where the devil roams freely isn't inappropriate. It's as if he walks over him, constantly oppressing him, forcing him to focus on earthly things and not allowing him to rise to heavenly ones.</p>\n    <p>The perverted person, always clinging to the earth, is no longer just called earthly but is emphatically called earth itself. This is given as food to the serpent, allowing it to absorb him completely into its belly of malice, hiding him from the light of justice and wrapping him in the shroud of eternal damnation. This is what is added: \"You will eat dust all the days of your life\" Genesis 3.</p>\n    <p>The days of his life are rightly seen as the entire period in which he is allowed to rage, until in the end, all his followers will be gathered and fall together into hell to face eternal death. However, so he won't boast about this temporary license or rejoice for long about deceiving the woman, the punishment is mentioned by which he is also punished now. He will always burn with the desire to harm but will sometimes lack the ability: \"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers\" Genesis 3.</p>\n    <p>The offspring of the devil is evil suggestion, whose fruit is eternal damnation. The offspring of the woman is the fear of God, whose ultimate benefit is the vision of God. \"She,\" it says, \"will crush your head, and you will lie in wait for her heel\" Genesis 3. She will crush the scheming of your suggestions with the battering ram of divine fear, weakening your deceptions with the wisdom of her counsel, turning back the malice you gave. So, you're deceived by the one you deceived, struck down by the one you struck, and although you may lie in wait for her heel, you cannot claim victory.</p>\n    <p>After the devil is doomed to eternal damnation, humans do not receive the same curse, but instead, they endure temporary afflictions.</p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Super pectus, inquit, tuum gradieris (Gen III). Quoniam quasi serpenti loqui coeperat, metaphoram\nservat, et quid diabolo conveniat spiritaliter, in isto\nostendit litteraliter. Pectus quidem domicilium cordis\nest et cogitationum. Pectoris igitur nomine non\n inconvenienter omnis perversus designatur, in quo\ndiabolus libere volutatur. Et quasi super eum graditur,\ndum premens eum et opprimens, cogit semper\nterrenis incumbere, nec ad coelestia permittit assurgere. Qui nimirum perversus, quia terrae semper\ninhaeret, non jam terrenus, sed terra emphatice\nappellatur, quae praedicto serpenti in escam conceditur,\nut eam intra ventrem malitiae suae penitus\nabsorbeat, et a luce justitiae abscondens, involucro\naeternae damnationis involvat; hoc est quod subditur:\nTerram comedes cunctis diebus vitae tuae\n(ibid). Dies vitae suae, omne hoc tempus recte\nintelligitur, in quo accepit licentiam saeviendi, donec\nin finem collectis omnibus qui ex parte ejus sunt,\nruent simul in tartarum aeterna morte puniendi. Ne\n autem de hac interim licentia gloriaretur, vel de eo\nquod mulierem deceperat, diutius laetaretur; subjungitur\npoena qua etiam inpraesentiarum puniretur,\ndum nocendi semper aestuaret affectu, et tamen\nquandoque careret effectu: Inimicitias, inquit,\nponam inter te et mulierem, et semen tuum, et semen\nillius (Gen III). Semen diaboli est mala suggestio,\ncujus fructus aeterna est damnatio, semen\nmulieris timor Dei, cujus finalis utilitas visio Dei. Ipsa, inquit, conteret caput tuum, et tu insidiaberis\ncalcaneo illius (ibid). Ipsa machinamenta\ntuae suggestionis conteret ariete divini timoris,\nenervans fraudes tuas consilio prudentiae suae, reddens\nvicem malitiae tuae; ut a seducta seducaris, a\nprostrata prosternaris, et a fronte repercussus,\n calcaneo illius solummodo valeas insidiari, non\npraevalendo gloriari. Postquam diabolus aeternae\nmaledictioni addicitur, utrique homini non eadem,\nut videtur, maledictio, sed afflictio temporalis infligitur.",
