      "original_latin": "Et dixit Deus mulieri: Multiplicabo aerumnas\ntuas et conceptus tuos. In dolore paries filios, et\nsub viri potestate eris, et ipse dominabitur tui (Gen.\nIII). Haec verba, si remoto sensu historico spiritaliter\nsolummodo accipiantur, cuilibet sanctae animae,\nvel universali Ecclesiae recte assignantur, cujus\n aerumnae et conceptus multiplicantur, quae parit filios\nin dolore, id est fructus bonorum operum cum\nlabore, et sub viri, id est Christi, potestate famulatur,\net ille huic justo ordine dominatur. Si autem\nhistorialiter intelligantur, non est absonum si Evae\nspecialiter convenire dicantur. Nam si haec sententia\ngeneralis esse putatur, ut quod dictum est Evae,\nomni mulieri convenire asseratur, huic opinioni, ut\ncaetera taceam, obviabit partus Virginis Mariae, quae,\netsi peperit, peperit tamen sine dolore. Quae igitur\ndicta sunt Evae, sive litteraliter, sive spiritaliter intelligantur,\nnon omni mulieri conveniunt omnia,\nsed alii et alii, alia et alia. Quaecunque autem, vel\nad ipsam mulierem, vel de ipsa muliere ad serpentem\n a Domino dicta sunt, eidem Evae posse convenire\ncredenda sunt, ut sicut ei dictum legimus:\nIn dolore paries filios, et hoc verum esse non\ndubitamus, sic etiam quod dictum est ad serpentem:\nInimicitias ponam inter te et mulierem, et ipsa\nconteret caput tuum, de eadem dictum esse remota\ndubitatione credamus. Quae igitur divina puniente\njustitia peperit filios in dolore, quae est sententia\npoenalis, eadem visitante gratia caput serpentis\ncontrivit, quae est victoria spiritalis. Et notandum,\nquia quod dictum est mulieri: Multiplicabo\naerumnas tuas et conceptus tuos in dolore\nparies filios et sub viri potestate eris, sensum recipit\n tam spiritalem quam 354 litteralem, ut haec\nomnia mulier credatur et pertulisse realiter et complesse\nspiritaliter.",

Quae enim esset\nutilitas, si caput serpentis materialiter contereretur,\ncum ex hoc nullus animae profectus haberetur? Illam ergo aestimo dici contritionem, de qua\nPaulus ad Romanos: Deus conterat Satanam sub\npedibus vestris velociter (Rom XVI). Unde est quod\neadem mulier in sequentibus appellatur mater vivorum,\nid est bonorum operum, quibus contraria\n sunt peccata, quae in Scripturis divinis plerumque\ndesignantur. Unde Apostolus ad Corinthios loquens:\nQuid facient, inquit, qui baptizantur pro mortuis,\nid est pro peccatis? (II Cor XV) Et ad Hebraeos:\nFundamentum, ait, poenitentiae ab operibus mortuis\n(Hebr VI). Denique idem Apostolus, cum ad\nTimotheum de eadem muliere loqueretur: Adam,\ninquit, seductus non est, mulier autem seducta in\npraevaricatione fuit; salvabitur autem per filiorum\ngenerationem, si permanserint in fide et dilectione\n(I Tim II). Quam dixit seductam in praevaricatione,\neamdem videtur dicere salvari per generationem\nfiliorum, id est per exercitium bonorum operum,\nquae intelliguntur nomine filiorum. Unde Psalmista:\nRespice, inquit, in servos tuos et dirige\n filios eorum (Psal LXXXIX). Quod autem subjungit\nApostolus (I Tim II), de filiis, si permanserint in\nfide et dilectione, non est credendum quod hoc dixerit\ncum dubitatione. Causalis quippe conjunctio,\nquae est (si) sicut aliquot in locis invenitur posita\ndubitative, sic in Scripturis tam divinis quam saecularibus\nfrequenter ponitur affirmative, etsi frequentius\nquando indicativo, tamen aliquoties quando\nadjungitur conjunctivo. Per Malachiam prophetam\ndicit Deus: Si pater ego sum, ubi est honor\nmeus? Si Dominus ego sum, ubi est timor meus? (Malac I)"
