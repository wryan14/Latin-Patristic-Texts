A woman was created not from elsewhere but from his rib while he slept, so she would be lovingly joined to him by natural affection and provide companionship.</s>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <s>He was placed in paradise, filled with various kinds of trees, so he could enjoy their fruit and beauty.</s>\n    <s>Among these trees were two with significant names: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, named for their effects.</s>\n    <s>Adam was permitted to eat from the trees in paradise to avoid hunger and from the tree of life to avoid death and aging.</s>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <s>To prevent him from becoming prideful like the Angel once did in glory, a command was given to him to follow obediently.

      "original_latin": "Quaeritis, fratres, utrum primus Adam salvus habeatur,\ncum eum damnabiliter peccasse Genesis\nliquido fateatur; poenituisse vero eum ibidem aperte\nnon legatur. Illum quidem peccasse, omnes nos, non\nsolum legendo, verum et experiendo scimus, cum et\nin hac vita misere vivendo, et de hac vita miserrime\nrecedendo, peccati illius poenam sentimus. Qui\nqualis fuerit ante peccatum formatus, et post peccatum\nqualiter deformatus, non est superfluum\ndicere, quamvis sciatur, cum ad id quod intendo,\nnecessarium videatur. In eo quippe statu ille factus\nest homo, in quo nullus post eum factus est homo. Factus est enim mortalis et immortalis, mortalis\nquidem, ut posset mori, immortalis vero, ut posset\n non mori. Data est ei libera facultas peccandi et\nnon peccandi, et utriusque rei apposita merces,\nmoriendi et non moriendi; ut videlicet si peccaret,\nmors sequeretur, si non peccaret, nunquam moreretur. Quia vero, ut postea scriptum est, Omne\nanimal diligit simile sibi (Eccli XIII); datum est\nei adjutorium simile sibi (Eccli XVII); et aedificata\nest mulier, non aliunde quam de costa illius dormientis,\nut ei naturali quodam affectu amabiliter\nsociaretur, et tali solatio frueretur. Positus est in\nparadiso, quae diversi generis arboribus consita erat,\nut earum et fructu vesceretur, et amoenitate delectaretur. Ubi et duo ligna inter caetera posita erant,\nquae nominibus suis manifestare videntur quod erant;\n quorum unum lignum vitae, alterum lignum scientiae\nboni et mali appellabatur, ab effectu eo, scilicet\nquod talia operabatur. Concessum est igitur Adae,\nut de ligno paradisi comedens, famis molestias declinaret,\nde ligno vitae, mortem et senium devitaret. Et ne in tanta gloria constitutus, sicut Angelus\nantea, temere superbiret, impositum est ei mandatum,\ncui salubriter obediret, ut qui caeteris in terra\nanimantibus dignitate praeesset, obedientiae tamen\njugo depressus, soli Deo subditus esset.",

      "original_latin": "Dictum est\nigitur ei quia de omni ligno paradisi comedens, solo\nfructu scientiae boni et mali non vesceretur, quod\nsi faceret, morte moreretur. Illud profecto lignum\nmalum non erat, quod a bono Deo creatum erat;\nsed bonum erat homini creato obedire Creatori, ut\n in gymnasio obedientiae quodammodo exerceretur,\net sic per meritum suum coelestem gloriam consequeretur. Si enim in eo quod injunctum est ei, humiliter\nparmaneret, procul dubio post emeritam\nvitam cum Deo congruum videretur, sine interventu\nmortis in angelorum consortium transferretur; et\ndesinens esse mortalis, quod erat, fieret immortalis\naliter quam erat. Erat enim immortalis, ut tantummodo\nposset non mori; fieret autem immortalis, ut\nnullo modo posset mori. Quae impossibilitas non\nesset languor aut vitium infirmitatis, sed vigor aut\nfastigium perfectionis. Jure igitur tali et tanto Creatori,\ntot et tantorum bonorum largitori, homo sic\nconditus debuit obedire, et patientia bona diligens,\nmajora quae promittebantur ambire. Quis autem\n digne possit vel exprimere verbis, vel mente cogitare,\nquantum ille peccavit, cum ab his omnibus\ndeclinavit, et deserto mandato Creatoris, deceptae\nvocem audivit uxoris? Huic enim tantae gloriae, qua\nille in praesentiarum laetabatur, et spe futurae amplius\ngloriabatur, diabolus invidit, qui sicut scriptum\nest (Joan VIII), ab initio homicida fuit, ex quo scilicet\nhomo conditus fuit. Et quia veram, quae Deus\nest, perdiderat vitam, huic eamdem voluit auferre,\nne unde lapsus erat vitio superbiae, illuc homo\nascenderet merito obedientiae. Quaerens igitur gradus\ncongruos ad illum dejiciendum, indutus est serpentem\ncallidum, et in eo latens, primitus adiit mulierem,\nquam quia sexu noverat infirmiorem, ad\n peccandum speravit esse faciliorem. Ad quam\nveniens satis callide renovat memoriam divinae\njussionis, ne, cum illa postmodum argueretur transgressionis,\npatrocinio defenderetur oblivionis.",
