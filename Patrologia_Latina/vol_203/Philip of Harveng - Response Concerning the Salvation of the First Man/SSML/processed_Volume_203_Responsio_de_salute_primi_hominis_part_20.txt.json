      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n<p>You have heard what was said to the woman. Now listen, if you wish, to what sentence was later passed on the man. Genesis continues: To Adam he said, Because you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you. Thorns and thistles it will bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat your bread, until you return to the ground from which you were taken, for you are dust, and to dust you shall return. This is in Genesis chapter 3.</p>\n<p>This word curse, as it seems to me, generally refers to all sin. Specific sins are implied under this general name, so that each one can be understood by its particular name. This is exactly what the prophet Hosea seems to do in chapter 4, where after naming the general category, he goes on to list several specific types. He says, Cursing, lying, theft, murder, and adultery overflow, and blood touches blood.</p>\n<p>So, when man sinned, he committed a curse worthy act. And because sin brings a curse, a punishment must follow, so that man would not boast about going unpunished. Therefore, it was imposed on him that his earth, that is, his mortal flesh, would be cursed, meaning it would suffer the penalty of the curse and be subjected to toil and hardship.</p>\n<p>Using this kind of language, even Christ is said to be cursed, or rather a curse, because he bore the pains of our mortality, the pains that came from the curse placed on the first man. The Apostle writes to the Galatians, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, becoming a curse for us. And to show that what he said is true, he adds a prophetic quote, For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree. That is from Deuteronomy chapter 21.</p>\n<p>You see, then, that Christ hanging on the cross is called a curse or cursed, which simply means he was afflicted with the punishments that come from the curse. In a similar metaphorical expression, the same Apostle calls him sin in the letter to the Corinthians: He made him who knew no sin to be sin for us. That is from Second Corinthians chapter 5.</p>\n</speak>\n",

Sequitur in Genesi:\nAdae vero dixit: Quia audisti vocem uxoris\ntuae, et comedisti de ligno, de quo praeceperam tibi\nne comederes, maledicta terra in opere tuo. Spinas\n et tribulos germinabit tibi, et comedes herbas terrae. In sudore vultus tui vesceris pane tuo, donec revertaris\nin terram de qua sumptus es, quia pulvis\nes, et in pulverem reverteris (Gen III). Maledictum,\nut mihi videtur, omne peccatum designat\nnomine generali, quod in specie subauditur, ut\nunumquodque censeatur nomine speciali. Quod nimirum\nOsee propheta (cap IV) videtur invenire, qui\npraemisso genere subsequenter aliquot ejus species\ncuravit annectere. Maledictum, inquit, et mendacium,\net furtum, et homicidium, et adulterium\ninundaverunt, et sanguis sanguinem tetigit.

Incutitur ergo ei, ut terra ejus, id est caro\n mortalis sit maledicta, id est poenas maledicti luens,\nlaboribus et aerumnis sit addicta. Hac locutione\nipse etiam Christus dicitur maledictus, imo et maledictum,\npro eo scilicet quod mortalitatis nostrae\nmolestias pertulit, quas primi hominis intulit maledictum. Ad Galatas scribens Apostolus: Christus,\ninquit, nos redemit de maledicto legis, factus\npro nobis maledictum (Galat III). Et ut quod\ndixerat probaret veridicum, testimonium subjungit\npropheticum: Quia scriptum est, inquit: Maledictus\nomnis qui pendet in ligno (Deut XXI). Videtis\nquia Christus pendens in ligno, dicitur maledictum,\nvel maledictus, quod nihil est aliud quam poenis\nquae de maledicto veniunt, est afflictus, Simili tropo\nlocutionis eumdem in Epistola ad Corinthios idem\n Apostolus peccatum dicit: Eum, inquiens, qui\nnon noverat peccatum, pro nobis peccatum fecit\n(II Cor V).",

      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n<p>Back then, the earth of man could rightly be called blessed in its work, because his work involved no trouble, no suffering, no resistance, since there was no sin and no punishment for sin found in his work.</p>\n<p>But now, on the contrary, it is rightly called cursed in its work, because either sin rules in it if a person lives badly, or the punishment for sin weighs it down, even if a person lives well. Life is no longer lived without misery, though by God's mercy, this misery can now become useful for some people.</p>\n<p>For the wicked, misery is only harmful and a form of punishment. But for the good, it is fruitful and healing, because God transforms what is evil into good, as the Apostle says, For those who love God, all things work together for good. That is in Romans chapter 8.</p>\n<p>If then, in this life of misery we live well, not loving it as a comfortable bedroom but enduring it like a stable, not grumbling against God's judgment, and longing for our eternal homeland, then without a doubt, this very misery is turned into merit, and man, originally well made, is restored to something even better.</p>\n<p>That is why the Psalmist says, You shape suffering into a commandment. That is in Psalm 94. God, in fact, shapes our suffering into a command for us, when he wants us not only to endure the hardships of this life but to endure them patiently. And he counts this patience as a reward worthy act of obedience.</p>\n<p>That is why, after it was said, Cursed is the ground because of you, it was also added, In toil you shall eat of it, meaning, you will get its fruit only through hard labor. As another Psalm says, My tears have been my bread, which is in Psalm 42, and again, You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands, you shall be blessed. That is Psalm 128.</p>\n<p>The earth then will no longer be fruitful if it tries to be delightful without labor. As the Apostle puts it figuratively, The widow who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. That is in First Timothy chapter 5.</p>\n<p>Our flesh can fittingly be called a widow when it is not ruled rightly by the spirit as by a husband. Instead, it breaks free from the law of the spirit and gives itself over to the brothel of its own pleasures. So, it is alive to itself but dead to God. The opposite is also said, You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. That is from Colossians chapter 3.</p>\n</speak>\n",
      "original_latin": "Tunc igitur\nterra hominis recte dici potuit benedicta in\nopere suo, cum nihil molestiae, nihil afflictionis,\nnihil contradictionis sentiret in opere suo: quia nec\npeccatum, nec poena peccati inveniebatur in opere\nsuo. Nunc autem e regione merito dicitur in opere\nsuo maledicta, cum in ea vel peccatum regnet si\n male vixerit, vel eam peccati poena aggravet, etiamsi\nbene vixerit. Jam enim non vivitur sine miseria,\nsed Deo miserante quibusdam fit jam utilis ista\nmiseria. Malis quidem tantummodo noxia est et\npoenalis, bonis vero fructuosa est et medicinalis,\nDeo commutante quod malum est in bonum, dicente\nApostolo quia diligentibus Deum omnia\ncooperantur in bonum (Rom VIII). Si enim in hac\nmiseria bene vivatur ut non tanquam cubiculum\ndiligatur sed tanquam stabulum sufferatur, si non\ncontra Dei sententiam murmuratur, si ad aeternam\npatriam suspiratur, procul dubio ipsa nostra miseria\nin meritum commutatur, et homo bene conditus\nin melius reparatur. Inde est quod Propheta dicit:\nQui fingis laborem in praecepto (Psal XCIII). Laborem quippe nostrum Deus format nobis in\npraecepto, cum mala quae in hac vita vult ut sustineamus,\nvult etiam ut patienter sustineamus; et\nhujus bonum patientiae pro merito computat obedientiae. Eapropter cum dictum esset: Maledicta\nterra in opere tuo, adjunctum est: In laboribus\ncomedes eam, hoc est in laboribus capies fructum\nex ea. Fuerunt, inquit, mihi lacrymae meae panes\n(Psal XLI); Et: Labores manuum tuarum quia\nmanducabis, beatus es (Psal CXXVII). Terra, inquit,\ntua non erit deinceps fructuosa si labore contempto\nesse voluerit deliciosa. Quod Apostolus figuraliter\ndicit: Vidua quae in deliciis est, vivens\nmortua est (I Tim V). Vidua quidem caro nostra\n non incongrue dicitur, cum a spiritu tanquam marito\nlegitime non regitur, sed male libera a lege\nspiritali in voluptatum suarum prostituitur lupanari. Vivens igitur sibi mortua est Deo, sicut econtra\ndicitur: Mortui estis, et vita vestra abscondita\nest cum Christo in Deo (Col III).",
