      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    Consider this perspective: <s>\"Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.\"</s> Thorns and thistles symbolize the trials and temptations of sin that arise from the earth, or our flesh, and attack the very flesh they originate from. Just like a worm that emerges from a garment or wood and consumes it, so do the suggestions of sin come from the flesh, often pricking and consuming it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <s>When these temptations stir the desire to sin within us, if they fail to achieve their goal because the spirit resists valiantly, they may indeed prick us but cannot overwhelm us, as long as our prudence, aided by grace, devours and crushes them like plants.</s> We find these to be heavy and burdensome through our consent and negligence. That's why it is said: <s>\"And you shall eat the plants of the field.\"</s> Our land indeed produces the bitter and harsh plants of sin, namely temptations, which we are advised to consume, so they do not grow into large thorns.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    What does it mean to consume them? Through fasting and prayer. For anyone who does not strive to resist the demands of appetite and lust through prayer and fasting weakly submits to them. The fact that our enemies are weakened by such means is elegantly illustrated by Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, in the Book of Numbers. When he saw the people of Israel entering Moab's borders, recalling how they had defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, he was terrified and said to the elders of Midian: <s>\"This people will wipe out all those who dwell in our borders as an ox licks up the grass to the very roots.\"</s> <break time=\"500ms\"/> <s>Because the ox was often sacrificed, it fittingly represents the one who says, \"I discipline my body and bring it into subjection\" (First Corinthians 9).</s> This relates to fasting.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Potest et aliter intelligi quod dictum est: Spinas\net tribulos germinabit tibi, et comedes herbas terrae. Spinae et tribuli, tribulationes et suggestiones sunt\n peccati; quae de terra, id est de carne nostra pullulant,\net eam de qua nascuntur, impugnant. Sicut\nenim de veste vel ligno vermiculus nascitur, per\nquem ipsa vestis vel lignum consumitur, sic de carne,\nsuggestiones nascuntur peccati, per quas compungitur\net plerumque consumitur ipsa caro peccati. Quae cum\nin nobis peccandi movent affectum, si resistente\nviriliter spiritu non pervenerint ad effectum; pungere\nquidem nos possunt, obruere non possunt, dum eas\ntanquam herbas devorat et atterit nostra prudentia\nadjuta per gratiam; quas nimirum trabes prementes\net opprimentes invenimus per consensum et negligentiam. Ideo dictum est: Et comedes herbas\nterrae. Herbas quippe amaras et asperas peccati,\nvidelicet illecebras profert terra nostra, quas ne\n proficiant, et de tribulis, ligna trabalia fiant, admonemur\ncomedere, hoc est, ore consumere. Quid est\nore? Jejunio et oratione. Qui enim contra exactiones\nventris et gutturis, contra incentiva libidinis\norationem et jejunium non studet opponere, seipsum\nillis enerviter convincitur supponere. Quod autem\nhujusmodi armis nostri subnerventur inimici, Balac\nfilius Sephor rex Moabitarum eleganter signavit in\nlibro Numeri. Qui cum videret Israeliticum populum\nintrare fines Moab, recolens quomodo ille\nSeon regem Amorrhaeorum, et Og regem Basan vicerat,\net omnes reliquos per quos transierat, perterritus\ndixit majoribus natu Madian: Ita delebit\nhic populus omnes qui commorantur in finibus\nnostris quomodo solet bos herbas usque ad radices\n carpere (Num XXII). Quia bos mactari solebat in\nsacrificio, non incongrue bos ille est, qui dicit:\nCastigo corpus meum et servituti subjicio (I Cor IX). Quod convenire videtur jejunio.",

He was aware that when the Israelites left the desert of Sin and camped in Rephidim, Amalek attacked them. Moses, with the rod of God in his hand, went up to the top of the hill, and with Aaron and Hur supporting his hands, he continued praying until sunset. As written in the Book of Exodus, chapter 17, Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Understanding the reason for this victory, Balak wisely attributed it to merits, not physical strength; to prayer and fasting, not to spear and sword. He remembered hearing that when Moses lifted his hands in prayer, Israel prevailed, but when he lowered them slightly, Amalek gained the upper hand. Indeed, he knew that the Israelites, though fewer in number, had overcome other peoples who were numerous, well-armed, and strongly fortified.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The Gospel seems to support this idea: \"This kind,\" it says, \"is not cast out except by prayer and fasting\" (Matthew, chapter 17). Similarly, before his passion, Christ said, \"Pray that you may not enter into temptation\" (Luke, chapter 22). For those laboring and sweating in the struggle of fasting and prayer, a refreshing meal is necessary, so they are not overwhelmed by continuous effort. Strengthened by inner refreshment and inspired with hope for heavenly things, they are also better equipped to endure temporary troubles.\n    </p><break time=\"500ms\"/>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Herbas autem\nusque ad radices carpit, cum vir sanctus motus\ncarnis suae et impetus juventutis, ne luxurientur,\noratione consumit; ut et si non potest non esse,\nnon tamen regnet peccatum in suo mortali corpore. Bos igitur est, et herbas carpit, qui jejunando et\norando insurgentia vitia reprimit, ne de radice lutulentae\ncarnalitatis, pullulet et silvescat arbuscula\npravitatis. Merito timuit Balac posse vinci populum\nsuum, Madianitas videlicet et Moabitas quomodo\nvictos fuisse noverat Amalecitas. Non enim\nlatebat eum, quia cum egressus de deserto Sin populus\n Israel castrametaretur in Raphin et occurreret\nei Amalech, Moyses habens virgam Dei in manu,\nascendit in verticem collis, et elevans manus, sustentatibus\neas Aaron et Hur, non cessavit orare\nusque ad occasum diei, donec, sicut scriptum est\n(Exod XVII), fugaret Josue, Amalech et populum\nejus in ore gladii. Hujus autem effectum victoriae\nBalac prudenter intelligens, meritis assignabat,\nnon viribus ori: non manibus, orationi et jejunio,\nnon hastae et gladio, memoriter tenens quod praedicari\naudierat, quia cum levaret Moyses manus in\noratione, vincebat Israel, sin autem paululum remisisset,\npraevalebat Amalech. Denique in alios populos\ninnumerabiles prae multitudine licet instructos\n armis, multoque vallatos munimine, noverat\nIsraeli succubuisse, cum ille, etsi non merito, tamen\nnumero longe inferior videretur fuisse. Tale\nquid commendare videtur Evangelium: Hoc genus,\ninquiens, non ejicitur, nisi per orationem et jejunium\n(Matth XVII). Ideo et Christus iturus ad\npassionem: Orate, inquit, ne intretis in tentationem\n(Luc XXII). Laborantibus autem et sudantibus\nin agone jejunii et orationis, grata debetur panis\nrefectio, ne laboris continui opprimantur fastidio. Interna enim refectione confortati dum ad sperandum\ncoelestia dulcius animantur, ad perferendas\ntemporales molestias fortius roborantur.",
