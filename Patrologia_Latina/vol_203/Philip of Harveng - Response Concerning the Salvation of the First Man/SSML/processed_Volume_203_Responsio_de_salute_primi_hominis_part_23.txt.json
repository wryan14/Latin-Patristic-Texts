This bread is understood, through antonomasia, to be the bread mentioned elsewhere in a mystical sense: <s>\"He gave them bread from heaven to eat\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (John, Chapter 6).</s> This bread is undoubtedly a spiritual nourishment that renews, progresses, and invigorates our inner self, while our outer self decays and is constantly afflicted by temporal miseries. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This is the bread we refer to in the Lord's Prayer: <s>\"Give us today our daily bread\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Matthew, Chapter 6).</s> which is needed every day, and without it, one cannot live well or spiritually. However, those who do not live spiritually, even if they seem to live, do not truly live. This bread is the taste of divine sweetness, about which the Prophet says, <s>\"Taste and see that the Lord is good\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Psalm 34).</s> The sweetness of this delight can indeed be felt, but it cannot be expressed in words. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Remarkably, while the mind often struggles to understand, it seems unable to explain, lacking the ability to discuss it, even though the grace to feel it is present. However, one cannot reach this ineffable sweetness without effort, nor receive the fruit of such sweetness without sweating and laboring in the struggle for holiness. This labor includes fasting, vigil, reading, prayer, meditation, compunction, and weeping, which we must undertake in this land of the dead if we wish to eat and be nourished by the bread of angels. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But when we reach the land of the living, we will indeed eat this bread without labor and sweat, because this nourishment has a laborious beginning in this life, but a glorious completion in the next. Therefore, it is said: <s>\"You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground from which you were taken.\"</s> This means you must labor to eat this bread until you return to the ground from which you were taken, that is, until, with the approach of death, you become lifeless earth, just as you were initially lifeless earth before the spirit came to you.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Ideo sequitur: In sudore vultus tui vesceris\n pane (Gen III). Non additur: Quo pane, sed tantum\nin sudore vultus tui vesceris pane. Ille ergo\npanis per antonomasiam intelligitur, de quo alibi\nmystice legitur: Panem de coelo dedit eis manducare\n(Joan VI). Iste nimirum panis, infusio vel\nrefectio est spiritualis, qua homo noster interior\nrenovatur, proficit, vegetatur, cum iste exterior\ncorrumpatur, et temporalibus assidue miseriis affligatur. Iste est panis de quo in oratione Dominica\ndicimus: Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis\nhodie (Matth VI), qui omni die est necessarius,\nsine quo nullo die, nullo tempore vivitur, si tamen\nbene et spiritaliter vivitur. Qui autem spiritaliter\nnon vivit, etsi vivere videtur, non vivit. Iste panis\ndivinae suavitatis est gustus, de quo Propheta:\n Gustate, ait, et videte, quoniam suavis est Dominus\n(Psal XXXIII). Cujus suavitatis dulcedo quanta\nsit, 357 sentiri quidem potest, sed dici non\npotest. Et mirum in modum cum mens ad capiendum\nsit plerumque diffusa, ad enarrandum sibiipsi\nvidetur conclusa, nec datur facultas disserendi, cum\ntamen adsit gratia sentiendi. Ad hunc vero ineffabilem\ndulcorem non venitur nisi per laborem, nec\npercipit fructum tantae suavitatis qui non sudat et\nlaborat in agone sanctitatis. Labor iste jejunium est,\nvigiliae, lectio, oratio, meditatio, compunctio, ploratio,\nin quibus laborare nos convenit in hac regione\nmortuorum, si vesci et refici pane volumus angelorum. Cum autem venerimus in regionem vivorum,\nvescemur quidem eo pane, sed jam sine labore et\n sudore, quia ista refectio in hac vita laboriosam\nhabet inchoationem, in illa vero gloriosam consummationem. Ideo dictum est: In sudore vultus tui\nvesceris pane, donec revertaris in terram de qua\nsumptus es. Hoc est dicere: Tam diu laborandum\nest tibi, ut isto pane vescaris, donec in terram, de\nqua sumptus es, revertaris, id est donec morte\naccedente fias terra inanimata, sicut spiritu nondum\naccedente fuisti primitus terra inanimata.",
