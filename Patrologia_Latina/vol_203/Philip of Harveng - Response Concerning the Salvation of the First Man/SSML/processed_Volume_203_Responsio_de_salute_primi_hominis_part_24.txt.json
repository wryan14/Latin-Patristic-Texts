      "original_latin": " Et fecit Deus Adae et uxori ejus tunicas pelliceas\net induit eos, et ait: Ecce Adam factus est quasi\nunus ex nobis sciens bonum et malum (Gen III). Quia pelles mortuis pecoribus detrahuntur, non incongrue\nin tunicis pelliceis mortalitas corporis designatur,\nquae illis incussa est, cum merito inobedientiae\nstola immortalitatis nudarentur. Ipso igitur\nhabitu corporis poena signata est ipsius corporis,\ndum qui mortales vel potius morituri jam erant,\nmortuorum pellibus vestiuntur, qui nudi eatenus\nfuerant, et tamen vestibus non egebant. Sic nimirum\nhujusmodi vestimentum factum est illis non solum\nnovae turpitudinis necessarium tegumentum, verum\netiam infirmitatis suae medicinale monimentum,\ndum hoc intuentes, unde et quo venerint admonentur,\n et hac admonitione ne iterum superbiant, reprimuntur. Eapropter, ut arbitror, et Joannes Baptista\nzonam pelliceam circa lumbos legitur habuisse\n(Matth III), ut scilicet ex traduce peccati se venisse\nmortalem recoleret, et de eo quod Christus\nputabatur minime superbiret. Ut autem tumori\nnoxio mordacius epithema medicus coelestis apponeret,\ncum induisset illos vestimentis pelliceis, adjungit:\nEcce Adam factus est quasi unus ex nobis,\nsciens bonum et malum. In eo quod dicitur ex\nnobis Trinitas intelligitur in qua est numerus\npluralis, in qua et Pater est Deus, et Filius Deus, et\nSpiritus sanctus Deus, quamvis simul non tres dii,\nsed unus sit Deus. Factus igitur tanquam unus ex\nnobis, hoc est dicere: Factus est Deus quod est\n singulus quisque ex nobis. In quo dicto videtur quodammodo\ninsultare superbiae peccatoris, insuper et\ntimorem incutere peccaturis, ostendens quia homo\nnon solum non est adeptus quod male concupivit,\nsed nec illud quod bene acceperat, custodivit.",
