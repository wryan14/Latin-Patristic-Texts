      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    To prevent him from reaching out, taking from the tree of life, eating, and living forever, the Lord God sent him out from the paradise of pleasure to work the ground from which he was taken. He placed cherubim and a flaming sword that turned in all directions in front of the paradise to guard the way to the tree of life. Genesis Chapter Three.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    As I mentioned before, through the tree of life, Adam initially avoided death and aging. But now, by sinning, he had earned the penalty of death. To keep him from accessing the tree again, he was expelled from paradise, distancing him both physically and morally from his original state of immortality.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In my view, this can be seen as the divine mercy of God, who intended to nullify human sin with this punishment. Through the death of the body, man could be purified and return to life, avoiding the misery of living and sinning forever after sin. If, after sinning, man had remained physically immortal without death to abolish his sin, he would be like the devil, who lived immortally after sinning and never revived from the death of sin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Therefore, it is beneficial that man is temporarily excluded from the tree of life. A cherub, representing the fullness of knowledge, and a flaming sword, symbolizing the troubles of tribulations, are placed in between. Through this knowledge, which signifies love, and through the pains of death, one can return to the tree of life, which is Christ.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The sword is not described as fixed and immovable; although it is flaming, it is still movable, indicating that returning to life is difficult but possible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    You have heard, brothers, what is read in Genesis first: the punishment justly inflicted for sin, and who is granted the return to life. I wanted to remind you of this so that your love may notice that the words of Scripture do not imply his eternal destruction. While they clearly show his sin and death, they also hint at repentance and life, albeit subtly, yet not without some indication.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Nunc ergo ne forte mittat manum suam, et sumat\netiam de ligno vitae, et comedat et vivat in aeternum,\nemisit eum Dominus Deus de paradiso voluptatis, ut\noperaretur terram de qua sumptus est, et collocavit\nante paradisum cherubim et flammeum gladium atque\nversatilem ad custodiendam viam ligni vitae (Gen.\nIII). Quia per lignum vitae, sicut superius dixisse\nme recolo, Adam prius mortem vitabat et senium,\nnunc vero peccando mortis incurrerat meritum, ne\ntangat ut antea idem lignum, ejicitur de paradiso\nvoluptatis, ut tam loco quam merito elongaret a\nstatu pristino immortalitatis. Quod ut mihi videtur\ndivinae potest misericordiae assignari, quod peccatum\n hominis Deus hac poena voluerit annullari, ut per\nmortem corporis homo purgatus rediret ad vitam,\nne post peccatum semper vivens et semper peccans,\nsemper miseram duceret vitam. Si enim post peccatum,\nhomo corporaliter immortalis maneret, et\nnulla ejus peccatum mors interveniens aboleret, similis\nesset diabolo, qui post peccatum immortaliter\nvixit, et a morte peccati nunquam revixit. Utiliter\nergo homo ad horam excluditur a ligno vitae, et interponitur\ncherubim, quod est, plenitudo scientiae et\nflammeus gladius, id est tribulationum angustiae, ut\nper plenitudinem scientiae, per quam charitas designatur,\net per mortis angustias, ad lignum vitae, qui\nChristus est, redeatur. Ideo nimirum et ipse gladius\n dicitur non fixus et immobilis, sed licet flammeus,\ntamen versatilis: ut redire ad vitam sit quidem difficile,\nsed tamen possibile. Audistis, fratres, quid in\nGenesi primo legatur, quae poena peccati merito infligatur,\nquis ad vitam reditus concedatur. Quod\nideo volui commemorare, ut attendat dilectio vestra\nquia Scripturae verba aeternum ejus interitum non\nvidentur sonare: sed sicut peccatum ejus et mortem\nsine aliqua ostendunt dubitatione, sic poenitentiam\net vitam, etsi occulta, non tamen nulla insinuant\nattestatione.",
