Quae verba\nnulli melius quam ipsi Adae convenire beatus Augustinus\nvidetur asserere, ubi ad Evodium scribens\nepistolae suae eadem verba voluit inserere. De illo,\n inquit, primo homine patre generis humani, quod\neum Christus de inferno solverit tota fere Ecclesia\nconsentit, quod eam non inaniter credidisse credendum\nest, undecunque hoc traditum sit, etiamsi canonicarum\nScripturarum hinc expressa non proferatur\nauctoritas.

Nec moveat quemquam si in tertio\ndecimo libro de civitate Dei, vel forte alibi legerit\nquod idem Augustinus dicit factum esse Adam inobedientem\n usque ad mortem, tanquam per hoc intelligi\nvoluerit quod ille nunquam resipuerit, sed\npermanserit et pertinax fuerit in sua inobedientia\nusque ad mortem. Quod si ita esset aeternam procul\ndubio nunquam evaderet mortem. Qui enim non resipiscit\nante mortem nihil aliud quam aeternum\nsupplicium invenit post mortem.

Nam cum omnis inobedientia mala sit,\ncertum est tamen quod alia multo pejor, alia multo\npessima sit. Ubi enim res facilis imperatur, et transgredienti\nmortem imperans, comminatur; si tamen\nservus mandatum contemnat, mortale procul dubio\npeccatum incurrit, et tanto graviores poenas debet\nsubire, quanto facilius potuit obedire. Merito ergo\nAdam, quia leve mandatum et grave supplicium\ncontempsit, dicitur factus inobediens usque ad mortem,\nnon permanendo impoenitens usquequo moreretur,\nsed in tantum peccando, ut mori mereretur. Peccare enim usque ad mortem, hoc est peccando\nmereri mortem. Si quis ergo nunc etiam vel homicidium,\nvel adulterium, vel quodlibet aliud grave\npeccatum commiserit, recte usque ad mortem peccare\n dicitur, nec tamen per hoc a peccante excluditur\npoenitudo, sed ipsius peccati exprimitur magnitudo. Simili modo per contrarium et Christus\nlegitur factus obediens usque ad mortem (Philip II), hoc est tantam obedientiam Patri exhibuisse,\nut eum judicarent Judaei mortem meruisse. Unde\ncum fixus maneret et constans in faciendo mandatum\nPatris, clamaverunt: Reus est mortis (Matth XXVI). Et cum Pilatus parcere vellet ei, responderunt:\nNos legem habemus, et secundum legem\ndebet mori (Joan XIX). Qua autem morte dignus\nesset, non tacuerunt clamantes: Crucifige, crucifige\n(Luc XXIII). Hoc est quod Apostolus dicit: Factus\nest obediens usque ad mortem, mortem autem crucis\n(Philip II)."
