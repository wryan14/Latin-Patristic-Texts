Won't the soul also praise after death? In fact, even more so after death. \n        So, when the prophet encourages us and says: \n        <s>\"Praise the Lord, my soul\" </s><break time=\"500ms\"/> (Psalm 145), \n        it elegantly responds: \n        <s>\"I will praise the Lord in my life,\"</s> \n        meaning: As long as I am in this mortal life, which might be called death rather than life (where any praise given to God is insignificant compared to future praise), I cannot fully praise Him, as it is written: \n        <s>\"He is the God of the living, not of the dead\" </s><break time=\"500ms\"/> (Matthew 22), \n        but I will praise Him in the land of the living, where I will truly live, because I will live without misery.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        So, when that Wise One says: \n        <s>\"My soul will praise the Lord until death,\"</s> \n        he means not a long but a strong praise, and for that, even if it can't last, he is ready to face even the dangers of death. \n        In contrast, Adam is said to have been disobedient until death, although he repented before death by God's mercy. Saint Augustine also notes in some writings that Adam accepted the judgment of damnation, not understanding it as eternal damnation, but as temporary suffering. \n        Damnation isn't always eternal, as mentioned in: \n        <s>\"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire\" </s><break time=\"500ms\"/> (Matthew 25), \n        but often refers to physical death or any temporal affliction. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thus, in the Second Book of Maccabees: \n        <s>\"Menelaus, guilty of all evil, was acquitted, but the unfortunate ones, who would have been judged innocent even among the Scythians, were condemned to death\" </s><break time=\"500ms\"/> (Second Maccabees 4). \n        And Origen, in his fifth homily on Luke, mentions that Zachariah, the father of John, was condemned to silence because he did not believe the angel.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Fortitudinem vero, quam dixi huic vitae necessariam,\nalibi quidam Sapiens commendare videtur,\nqui fiducialiter pollicetur: Laudabit, inquiens,\nusque ad mortem anima mea Dominum (Eccli LI). Quid est laudabit usque ad mortem? Nunquid\nnon laudabit et post mortem? Imo multo magis et\npost mortem. Unde prophetae commonenti et dicenti:\nLauda, anima mea, Dominum (Psal CXLV) eleganter illa respondit: Laudabo\n Dominum in vita mea (ibid ), hoc est dicere:\nQuandiu sum in hac mortali vita, quae mors potius\ndicenda est quam vita, (ubi quidquid Deo laudis\nimpenditur, in comparatione futurae laudis pro nihili\nducitur) eum, qui sicut scriptum est: Deus est\nvivorum et non mortuorum (Matth XXII), non\npossum laudare, sed laudabo in regione vivorum, ubi\nvivam et vere vivam, quia sine miseria vivam. Quod\nergo dicit Sapiens ille: Laudabit usque ad mortem\nanima mea Dominum, non longam, sed fortem\nlaudem voluit designare, pro qua, et si non toleret,\nparatus est tamen ipsa mortis pericula tolerare. E\nregione Adam dicitur factus inobediens usque ad\nmortem, licet Deo miserante resipuerit ante mortem. Dicit etiam beatus Augustinus quibusdam in\n locis ipsum Adam excepisse sententiam damnationis,\nnon quod intelligat illum aeternaliter damnatum,\nsed temporaliter cruciatum. Damnatio quippe non\nsemper illa aeterna, de qua dictum est: Ite, maledicti,\nin ignem aeternum (Matth XXV), sed plerumque\nvel ipsa mors corporalis, vel quaelibet intelligitur\nafflictio temporalis. Unde in libro Machabaeorum\nsecundo: Menelaum, inquit, universae\nmalitiae reum criminibus absolvit, miseros autem,\nqui etiamsi apud Scythas causam dixissent innocentes\njudicarentur, morte damnavit (II Mach IV). Et Origenes in quinta homilia super Lucam: Zachariam\npatrem Joannis quia non credidit angelo,\ndicit esse damnatum silentio.",
