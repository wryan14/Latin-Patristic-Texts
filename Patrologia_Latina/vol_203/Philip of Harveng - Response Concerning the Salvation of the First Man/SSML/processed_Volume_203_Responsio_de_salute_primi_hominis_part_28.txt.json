Quam parabolam cum super ipso Adam quidam\nsapiens interpretaretur; Jerusalem dixit esse\nparadisum, Jericho mundum, latrones contrarias potestates,\nvulnera inobedientiam, sacerdotem legem,\nleviten prophetas, Samaritanum Christum, jumentum\ncorpus Christi, stabulum Ecclesiam, stabularium\nEcclesiae praesidem, duos denarios Patrem et\n Filium; reditum Samaritani, secundum Christi adventum. Quae omnia Origenes in trigesima tertia\nhomelia super Lucam dicit pulchre et rationabiliter\ndicta esse, et ea non omni homini, sed huic specialiter\nconvenire. Et notandum quod illum non mortuum,\nsed seminecem latrones reliquerunt, qui, etsi\ndelictorum vulnera crudeliter inflixerunt, non tamen\nspem sanandi eidem abstulerunt. Item Origenes\nin decima sexta homelia in Genesim, quod dicit:\nRevocabo te inde in finem, hoc esse arbitror,\nquod in finem saeculorum unigenitus Filius suus pro\nsalute mundi usque ad inferna descendit, et inde\nprotoplastum revocavit. In hoc ergo verius quam\n in Jacob adimplebitur quod dictum est: Quia revocabo\nte inde in finem. Augustinus in libro De\nbaptismo parvulorum: Sicut illi primi homines postea\njuste vivendo merito creduntur per Domini\nsanguinem liberati ab aeterno supplicio. Gregorius\npapa, cum in Registro de Adam loqueretur, ait:\nNon est ejus anima ita mortua ut non esset, sed\nita mortua, ut beata non esset, qui tamen Adam\npost per poenitentiam rediit. Quis de Adae poenitentia\naudeat dubitare, cum eam tam aperte Augustinus\net Gregorius audeant affirmare? Joannes\nquoque episcopus, in sermone qui de lapsu primi\nhominis titulatur, salutem ejusdem hominis attestatur. Ait enim: Dominus Deus et saevitiam exsecratus\nest hostis, et casum miseratus est hominis, deceptum\n hominem paterna pietate condoluit.",

The Lord indeed shows that sins can be cleansed through kindness and that forgiveness can be easily obtained through confession and humility in appearance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        These are the words of John Chrysostom about Adam. Therefore, what the church teaches, indeed what the entire Church, as Augustine says, believes about this, we should also believe, since there is no authority from the Scriptures that disagrees.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Finally, the Encratites, also known as the Tatiani of heretical depravity, as Augustine testifies, are accused of contradicting the salvation of the first man among other things they perversely think and say.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        To be truthful, I have spoken longer than I intended while discussing the necessary points about Adam. Even if not perfectly, yet as best as I could, it is now time to conclude my response, since what has been said should be sufficient for the brothers' inquiry.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thus, let this response come to an end: I will move on to another, taking a brief pause in silence.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Et subjungit:\nAccipiunt vestimenta pellicea, ut qui confessi\ndelictum jam fuerant, veniam cultus humilitate perciperent.

Quod ergo\ndoctores ecclesiastici, imo tota, ut ait Augustinus,\nEcclesia de illo sentit, debemus et nos sentire, unde\nnulla Scripturarum invenitur auctoritas dissentire. Denique Enchratitae, qui et Tatiani dicti sunt haereticae\npravitatis, teste Augustino, arguuntur, pro\neo quod inter caetera quae perverse et sentiunt et\ndicunt, saluti primi hominis contradicunt. Quia\nvero, ut verum fateor, 361 diutius quam proposueram,\nsum locutus, dum quae dicenda sunt de\nAdam, etsi non ut debui, sum tamen ut potui prosecutus,\njam tempus est ut calcem ponam huic meae\nresponsioni, cum ea quae dicta sunt, fratrum possint\nsufficere inquisitioni.
