God knows that on the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.\" \n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        <s>God, who can be like you?

But not wanting to sin alone, she went to the man and, with feminine persuasion, convinced him to eat the forbidden fruit to become like God, as the serpent claimed. \n        However, he knew this claim was false and that God was undoubtedly truthful in everything He said. Yet, he chose to comply with his wife rather than upset her by obeying the Creator. He couldn't bear to see her, whom he had taken as a partner by marital law, saddened, hoping he could reconcile with God through repentance. \n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        This is what the Apostle later wrote: \"Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression\" First Timothy 2. \n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n        She was indeed deceived when she believed what God had said wasn't true; he was not deceived in that he knew the serpent's suggestion was false. Both were miserable. What could be more detestable than considering God a liar? Likewise, what could be more wicked than succumbing to feminine flattery, ignoring the one whom man knew to be the truthful God? Both sinned and ate the forbidden fruit without hesitation, and as the serpent said, their eyes were opened. \n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        What does this mean? Did they not see before? Is it not written: \"The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom, and she took some of its fruit and ate it, and gave some to her husband.\" \n        Genesis 3.\n        <s>And it is immediately added: \"He ate, and the eyes of both were opened\" (Genesis 3).</s>\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Scit quippe Deus quia quocunque\ndie comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi\nvestri, et eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum\n(Gen III). Deus, quis similis erit tibi? Quis in nubibus aequabitur\n Domino, aut quis similis erit Deo in filiis Dei? Credidit mulier deceptori, putans falsum esse quod\ndixerat Deus, verum autem quod asserebat hostis iniquus. Sed ne sola peccaret, accessit ad virum, et importunitate\n346 feminea suasit ut ille fructu vetito\nvesceretur, et juxta serpentis vocem, sicut Deus\nefficeretur.

Quid enim detestabilius\nquam Deum mendacem aestimare? Item quid\nscelestius, quam contempto eo quem Deum veracem\nhomo noverat, in blanditias muliebres declinare? Peccant utrique, et fructu vetito sine retractione vescuntur,\net sicut serpens dixerat, oculi eorum\naperiuntur. Quid est hoc? Nunquid antea non videbant? Nonne scriptum est: Vidit mulier quod\nbonum esset lignum ad vescendum, et pulchrum\noculis, aspectuque delectabile, et tulit de fructu\nillius et comedit, deditque viro suo?
