      "original_latin": "Adam, inquit, ubi es? Et ille: Timui eo quod\nnudus essem, et abscondi me. Et Dominus: Quis\nindicavit tibi quod nudus esses, nisi quia de\nligno vetito comedisti? Et ille: Mulier, inquit,\nquam dedisti mihi sociam, dedit mihi, et comedi\n(Gen III). Miser homo, cum suam solius culpam\ndebuisset humiliter profiteri, et confitendo\nveniam promereri, nisus est eam retorquere in mulierem,\net illa in serpentem, cum nullius ad peccandum\nsuasio alterius sufficiens sit excusatio. Vir\ndixit se persuasum esse a muliere, mulier vero se\ndeceptam a serpente. Et hoc quidem verum fuit, sed\nexcusandum non fuit, ne peccatum quod pura et\nsimplici posset ablui confessione, superflua duplicaretur\n excusatione. Eapropter sententiam poenalem\npariter exceperunt, vir nimirum ut panem suum\ncomedat in sudore, mulier ut pariat cum dolore. Dein de paradiso ejecti sunt, et a ligno vitae exclusi,\net ne illuc facilis reditus concedatur, angelus habens\nflammeum gladium ante fores paradisi collocatur. Verumtamen ne spes redeundi omnino auferatur,\nidem gladius versatilis appellatur. Post haec in eodem\nGenesis libro (cap IV) nihil de Adam legitur, nisi\nquia cognovit Evam uxorem suam, et genuit Cain, et\nAbel, et Seth, et filios et filias, et vixit annis nongentis\ntriginta, et mortuus est. Nunc igitur quaerendum\net diligentius perscrutandum est, si tamen\nadjuvet spiritus Dei qui omnia scrutatur etiam profunda\nDei (I Cor II), si forte ex ipsius ejusdem libri\n verbis aliquid nobis poterit intimari, unde illius hominis\nsalus debeat aestimari. Quod posse fieri nequaquam\nasserere praesumpsissem, nisi ex aliis\nScripturae locis admonitus fuissem, ubi apertius dicta\nintelliguntur, quae hic involucro litterae conteguntur.
