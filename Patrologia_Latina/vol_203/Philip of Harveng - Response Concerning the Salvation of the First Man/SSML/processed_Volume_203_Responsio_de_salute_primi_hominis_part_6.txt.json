Haec autem huic vocationi specialis praerogativa\nassignatur, ut raro infructuosa inveniatur, imo (ut\nvidetur) de illa propheta Joel per antonomasiam\ndixerit: In monte Sion et in Jerusalem erit salvatio,\net in residuis quos Dominus vocaverit (Joel II). Tantam quippe intelligi voluit hujus esse excellentiam\nvocationis, ut eam sequatur utilitas salvationis,\net nihil sit aliud sic nos a Deo vocari, quam ad\nsalutem efficaciter provocari. Unde, ut mihi videtur,\ndivinae scriptor historiae id quod dictum est: Vocavit\nDeus Adam (Gen III), non perfunctorie attendi\nvoluit, sed in eo pium vocantis affectum, magnum\nvocati profectum intelligi debere commonuit. Quod\nsi voluero vel potuero divinas Scripturas revolvere,\net omnia loca in quibus Deus per se, sive aperte,\nsive occulte vocare legitur, ad medium ducere, et\nquanta sit hujus vocationis utilitas exponere; quantum\naestimo, haec adunatio tantae erit magnitudinis,\nut congruum excedat modum voluminis. Verumtamen\nne videar loquaciter affirmare quod non possim\n aliquantisper demonstrare, quaedam eorum\nquae occurrunt memoriae, ducam ad medium, ut\nsciat dilectio vestra in hac vocatione Dei non mediocre\ncontineri beneficium.",
            "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    God's final call is a unique and special one, where He reaches out directly to people without any human messenger. Sometimes, this happens openly, like when He called Moses from the burning bush; but often, it occurs in secret, as it has with thousands throughout history. This special call is rarely unfruitful. In fact, it seems that the prophet Joel referred to this type of call when he said: <s>\"On Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be salvation, and among those whom the Lord has called.\"</s> <break time=\"500ms\"/> <s>This is from Joel, Chapter 2.</s>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    He wanted us to grasp the great significance of this call, as it leads to the gift of salvation. Being called by God in this way is essentially an invitation to salvation. Therefore, it seems to me that when the divine author of history wrote, <s>\"God called Adam\"</s> <break time=\"500ms\"/> <s>from Genesis, Chapter 3,</s> it was not meant to be taken lightly. Instead, it serves as a reminder of the loving intent of the caller and the significant journey of the one being called.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If I were to go through the divine Scriptures and highlight all the instances where God is recorded as calling directly, either openly or secretly, and discuss the importance of this call, I believe the collection would be so extensive that it would exceed the size of a typical volume. However, to ensure I'm not making claims without some evidence, I will share a few examples that come to mind, so that you can understand that this call of God holds a considerable blessing.\n  </p>\n</speak>"
