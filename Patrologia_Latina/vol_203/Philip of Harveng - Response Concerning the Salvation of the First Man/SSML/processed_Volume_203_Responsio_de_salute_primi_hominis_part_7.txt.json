      "original_latin": "In Exodo legitur quia, cum pasceret Moyses\noves Jethro soceri sui, et minaret gregem ad interiora\ndeserti, apparuit ei Dominus in flamma ignis\nde medio rubi; et videns ille rubum ardere, et non\ncomburi: Vadam, inquit, et videbo visionem hanc\nmagnam, quare non comburatur rubus. Cernens\nautem Dominus quod pergeret ad videndum, vocavit,\ninquit, eum de medio rubi, et ait: Moyses,\nMoyses? Qui respondit: Adsum. At ille: Ne appropies,\ninquit, huc; solve calceamentum de pedibus\n tuis, locus enim in quo stas terra sancta est. Et ait:\nEgo sum Deus patris tui, Deus Abraham, et Deus\nIsaac, et Deus Jacob (Exod III). Vides in hac\nvocatione qua Deus vocat Moysen, magnam gratiam\ndesignari, cum ille qui de Aegypto venerat, jubetur\ndiscalceari. Quia enim calceamenta de mortuorum\npellibus animalium efficiuntur, per ea non incongrue\nmortua opera, id est peccata, designantur, quae\nprocul dubio in Aegypto, hoc est in tenebris perpetrantur:\nQui enim male agit, odit lucem (Joan III). Volens igitur Moyses ire et videre visum, merito\nprohibetur, et quo ordine id fieri debeat divinitus\nedocetur, ut videlicet exuvias veteres, quas vivendo\nin Aegypto contraxerat, festinet deponere, et sic\nmerebitur visionem divinam, vel potius ipsum Deum\n cognoscere. Unde illi quasi jam discalceato, vel potius\nad discalceandum jam parato, quaedam Dei\ncognitio confertur, cum subito subinfertur: Ego\nsum Deus patris tui, Deus Abraham, et Deus Isaac,\net Deus Jacob (Exod III).",
