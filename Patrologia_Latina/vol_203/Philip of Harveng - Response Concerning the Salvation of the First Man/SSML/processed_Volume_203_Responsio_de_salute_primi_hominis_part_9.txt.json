      "original_latin": "In libro Regum primo, cum de mutando veteri\nsacerdotio tractaretur, et novum figuraliter ad medium\nduceretur, reprobato Heli, vetusto sacerdote,\npuer Samuel eligitur, et in hac electione divina vocatio\nnon tacetur. Dormiebat, inquit, Samuel in\ntemplo 349 Domini, ubi erat arca Dei; et vocavit\nDominus Samuelem: Samuel, Samuel? Et ait Samuel:\nLoquere, Domine, quia audit servus tuus\n(I Reg III). Videtis hanc vocationem plenam esse\ncoelesti gratia, quam tam velox sequitur obedientia. Sicut enim nihil perversius quam nolle audire, sic\nnihil perfectius quam cito obedire. In Isaia cum introduceretur\npater loquens ad filium, praenuntians\nquod erat futurum tanquam praeteritum esset:\nEgo, inquit Dominus, vocavi te in justitia, et apprehendi\nmanum tuam, et servavi te, et dedi te in\nfoedus populi (Isa XLII). Paulo post, cum ad\npopulum ex omnibus gentibus crediturum, ipse filius\nprophetice loqueretur, et eum vocando ad meliora\nmisericorditer hortaretur: Noli, inquit, timere,\nquia redemi te, et vocavi te nomine tuo: Meus es\ntu. Cum ambulaveris in ignem, non combureris, et\nflamma non ardebit in te, quia ego Dominus Deus\ntuus sanctus Israel salvator tuus (Isa XLIII). Et\npaulo inferius: Audi me, Jacob et Israel, quem ego\n voco (Isa XLVIII). Et in sequenti capitulo ipse\nChristus: Audite, inquit, insulae, et attendite populi\nde longe, Dominus ab utero vocavit me\n(Isa XLIX). Et in Joel quod superius dictum est:\nIn monte Sion erit salvatio, sicut dixit Dominus,\net in residuis quod Dominus vocaverit (Joel II). Et Zacharias: Et vocavit me, et locutus est ad me\n(Zach VI).",
