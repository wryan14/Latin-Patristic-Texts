1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,032
Book One

2
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,496
Prologue

3
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:12,156
As Solomon says, it's a person's job to prepare their mind, and the Lord's to guide their tongue, because all human ways are visible to His eyes, and the Lord weighs the spirits.

4
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:12,807
Proverbs 16.

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:16,661
But that's not the case, my friend, not with those who create scandals.

6
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:24,639
They use the tools of hatred and envy, or favor and flattery, to craft deceitful scales, weighing one against the other without caring for balance.

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:30,554
They judge wickedly and flatter improperly, being slaves to error, knowingly calling evil good and good evil.

8
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:33,539
Truly, hatred knows no reason, and envy lacks fairness.

9
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:43,688
I foolishly noticed this in a close companion who loved some people deeply, thinking they were friends because of their loyalty, only to find out they were enemies through their betrayal.

10
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:57,039
While he served his brothers with effort, loyalty, and a troubled spirit, as known by the Lord of Hosts, who judges calmly and arranges us with great reverence, this poor man's brothers hated him for no reason, and even friends withdrew from him.

11
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,552
He became a spectacle to many, as he couldn't detect the hidden malice of those who say or do nothing without prompting.

12
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:07,134
Therefore, it's more reliable to trust in the Lord than in humans.

13
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:12,073
Indeed, trust is fickle in many, and the friendship of some often suffers a sudden eclipse.

14
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:15,329
Why do you complain as if these things are unusual, brother?

15
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:28,680
The hatred and envy of brothers couldn't have been calmed unless Joseph was sold to the Ishmaelites or Potiphar after being thrown into the cistern; nor would the persecution of the envious have ended unless Daniel was thrown into the lions' den.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,176
Malice constantly wages war against innocence.

17
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,890
However, the vices of a senseless mind are wounds.

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,255
The more the vice is fulfilled, the greater the trouble grows.

19
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,891
Therefore, the malevolent person harms themselves more than others.

20
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,795
You strongly advised me against attacking those who look down on foolishness.

21
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:52,923
Instead, you urged me to frequently and urgently offer counsel, so I might recognize and understand the limitations of my own intellect.

22
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:57,693
So, let our rivals savor their own bitterness, while patience brings its own rewards to us.

23
00:01:57,693 --> 00:02:00,995
It's human to get angry, but it's devilish to hold onto malice.

24
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:06,236
The things I have written so far-why, when, and with what intention-are things the pen will explore.

25
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:12,945
Even though this might provoke envy towards me rather than be beneficial to you, it does no harm to anyone with good intentions.

26
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:23,061
It seems fitting to first acknowledge the valuable writings by the brothers of our Church, especially those skilled in literature, because it's wiser to praise the works of others than our own.

27
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,007
Chapter One

28
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,830
About Lambert, the Second Abbot.

29
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,589
Lambert, our second abbot, was incredibly useful in many respects.

30
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:36,739
He authored the Life of Saint Heribert, the Archbishop of Cologne, and meticulously documented his miracles.

31
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,637
He also composed music about him, drawing on his remarkable talent for writing verses.

32
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,512
Chapter Two

33
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,189
About Stephen, the First Abbot.

34
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:50,223
Stephen was the successor who, despite leaving no written records, deserves to be remembered.

35
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:56,664
He was well-known for his knowledge, but even more so for his exemplary conduct, proving himself to be a worthy leader.

36
00:02:56,664 --> 00:03:03,051
The resources of the young Church were still limited, so he made every effort to acquire land and construct buildings.

37
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:06,785
By living modestly, he sacrificed his own comforts to benefit others.

38
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,520
He managed his expenses according to the limited resources available.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,904
It was better to have a little with righteousness than an abundance from sinners.

40
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:22,319
He would sometimes joke with his companions about Vitellius, the most gluttonous Roman emperor, who would feast four or five times a day.

41
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:31,737
If the Republic hadn't ended his life in time, he would have depleted the air of birds, the sea of fish, the land of animals, the granaries of grain, and the cellars of wine.

42
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:40,776
Indeed, it's said that at one feast, besides other expenses, he consumed two thousand fish and seven thousand birds, making him as gluttonous as Belshazzar of Babylon.

43
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:49,761
For that very indulgent guest, each night twelve bushels of fine flour, forty sheep, and six amphorae of wine were provided to satisfy his seemingly endless appetite.

44
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:56,256
But Stephen, through his actions and teachings, after fighting the good fight, received the crown he had sought by name.

45
00:03:56,256 --> 00:04:04,321
He was a man worthy of divine revelations, especially when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a vision as he grieved over his brothers' poverty.

46
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:14,496
The angel, with a radiant face and noble robe, told him that Saints Lawrence and Wolbodo had placed this site under Christ's protection, and its foundations were set in the holy mountains.

47
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:20,667
Moreover, the inhabitants, if they first sought the kingdom of God, would have all necessary things added to them.

48
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:31,492
This is a truth he experienced then, and we continue to experience now, thanks to the generosity of Christ, the wisdom of God, with whom there are riches and glory, abundant wealth, and righteousness.

49
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:34,007
Chapter Three

50
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,965
About Saint Wolbodo, Bishop of Liege.

51
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:40,569
Since there is no one who lacks glory everywhere, I will briefly share who Wolbodo was.

52
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:47,712
He came from Flemish origins, and his noble and wealthy parents were made even more distinguished by his remarkable life and knowledge.

53
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:52,898
He began as a canon and schoolmaster at the church in Utrecht before becoming the bishop of Liege.

54
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:56,019
Some of our elders have written about his life as a bishop.

55
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:05,597
It's important to note his deep devotion to Saint Lawrence the martyr, as he dedicated his care and resources to our place during his life and was laid to rest here after his death.

56
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:19,301
Indeed, he was buried in our crypt of the Holy Mother of God, in a carefully crafted tomb, which includes this epitaph in gilded letters:
Great is the honor of the flesh, but greater is the grace of character,
Placing you in the office and seat of the bishop.

57
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:24,963
The rich and poor alike felt your presence in all things,
From you comes salvation to some, food to others.

58
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:29,249
Hence, the same flesh is present to all of us,
And we honor the life-giving tomb.

59
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:40,731
Thus, the small garden of our Church flourishes with the dual beauty of the rose and lily, as both the martyr with part of his relics and the confessor with his whole body, enhance it with their protection and merits.

60
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,863
Chapter Four

61
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:45,529
About Everard the Third, Abbot of Saint Laurence.

62
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:50,098
The third pastor chosen by Stephen was Everard, a monk from the Church of Florennes.

63
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:54,178
He was a man rich in experience, whose virtues created a peaceful presence.

64
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:58,040
He tended the Lord's flock with a pure heart and guided it with wisdom.

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,564
However, his time was short.

66
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:02,066
He passed away before even a year had gone by.

67
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:07,614
Yet, the bright intentions and care he displayed were already taking root and should not be forgotten.

68
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:10,769
So, let him be remembered as if he had served a full year.

69
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:16,916
And with the righteous, may he inherit a place where life is long and fulfilling, where there is light and peace.

70
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:19,055
Chapter Five

71
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,530
Concerning the elder monk and Deacon Louis.

72
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:28,319
The elder Louis, fondly remembered, had previously documented the journey of Saint Lawrence's relics from Rome to us.

73
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,024
Chapter Six

74
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,278
About Falchalino, a student of Ludovicus.

75
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:37,338
Falchalinus, who was also a master of schools, had become well-established in his teachings.

76
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:44,818
He worked with Franconius, the scholar of Saint Lambert, on projects about the squaring of the circle and the fasts of the Four Seasons.

77
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,680
Chapter Seven

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,153
About Heribrand, the fifth abbot, a follower of Louis the Second.

79
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:53,253
Heribrand, our fifth abbot, was a devoted follower of his.

80
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:56,674
In him, the wisdom of his mind matched the grayness of his hair.

81
00:06:56,674 --> 00:07:07,363
Ecclesiastes chapter nine suggests that his clothes were always white, representing chastity girding his loins, and the lamp in his hands symbolized his love for God and his neighbor burning brightly.

82
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:12,761
He was highly skilled at composing both prose and poetry, well-versed in divine and human literature.

83
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:16,502
He wrote the Life of Theodoric the Younger, the abbot of Saint Hubert.

84
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:24,252
He didn't hide his wealth of knowledge but willingly taught those who were uninformed, always maintaining a calm demeanor in both mind and voice.

85
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:28,046
What is said gently by the teacher is better understood by the learner.

86
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,772
Minds should be engaged by skill rather than force.

87
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,903
Chapter Eight

88
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:39,451
About David the Monk
David was a diligent worker who carried the light and easy burden of Christ's yoke into his old age.

89
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:42,265
He dedicated himself to church duties day and night.

90
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:48,488
He spent his time praying, reading, and writing the works of learned men for his brothers to read and reflect upon.

91
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:54,278
These are the defenses of David's tower, adorned with a thousand shields, the complete armor of the mighty.

92
00:07:54,278 --> 00:08:07,373
Despite the fierceness of Phalaris's brazen, fiery bulls, the envy of the Sicilian tyrant found no greater torment than what our Methuselah endured, as he earnestly admonished the negligent and guided the youth to avoid the bread of idleness.

93
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:17,006
Though bent with age, David remained unwavering in kindness; his tireless efforts bore fruit, and he wrote the Passion of Saint Blaise and the Life of Saint Eucherius of Orleans.

94
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:21,443
Even if his work wasn't finely crafted, it began with a coarser, hemp-like thread.

95
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,471
Chapter Nine

96
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:24,856
About the Monk Engelbert.

97
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:31,113
Engelbert, a diligent examiner and follower of calculations, compiled several useful theorems for mathematicians.

98
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:39,862
Much like Bootes in the celestial sphere, while constantly engaged in this art, he keeps the chariot of memory continuously revolving without letting it rest.

99
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:43,019
Through this dedication, he gained significant knowledge.

100
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:53,152
Thus, I honor him with these verses from Virgil:
He who knows the numbers and paths of the sky, who understands the stars, the various eclipses of the sun, and the phases of the moon.

101
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:59,299
Why the earth trembles, by what force the deep seas swell when barriers are broken, and then settle back again.

102
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,947
Why the suns in winter rush so eagerly to plunge into the ocean, or what delay causes the long nights.

103
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,983
Chapter Ten

104
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,828
About Berenger, the fourth abbot.

105
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:19,446
During this time, scholarly pursuits were thriving among the monks and clerics of our city, flourishing just as much as religious devotion, perfectly complementing the state of the churches.

106
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:30,288
"How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, and your tabernacles, Israel, like wooded valleys, like gardens by the rivers, like tabernacles set up by the Lord, like cedars by the waters" (Numbers 24).

107
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:33,139
Liege was rich in virtues, disciplines, and wealth.

108
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,498
However, being well-educated was considered more admirable than being wealthy.

109
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:48,899
And since blessed is the land whose king is noble, our Church at that time aspired to the studies of true happiness, with Berenger, the fourth abbot, who was more noble in spirit than in flesh, presiding.

110
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:59,238
Although he was of humble birth, as a wise person once said, the eye of God looked upon him favorably; He lifted him from his humility and exalted his head, and many were amazed by him.

111
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:05,553
Indeed, he was renowned for his wisdom, like a lamp on a candlestick, notable in both the kingdom and the Church.

112
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:17,624
Nevertheless, the brothers who lived under him could be compared to lilies by the water, as many of them possessed both the purity of religion and the fragrance of a good reputation, enriched with literary knowledge.

113
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,823
Chapter Eleven

114
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:24,704
This chapter is about Robert, also known as Rupert, who later became the abbot of Tuitium.

115
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:29,206
Among these individuals, Robert stood out like a golden earring or a shining pearl.

116
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:35,551
He was a man who paid attention to wisdom, listened to prudence, sought it like money, and dug for it like treasures.

117
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:43,794
Raised from childhood in our monastery, he grew in virtues as he aged, and as his memory strengthened, so did his intellect, adding knowledge and labor.

118
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:51,874
Everything he absorbed through reading, he shared through teaching, remaining diligent in prayer and contemplation, especially during morning vigils.

119
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:56,050
The more privately he engaged in these practices, the more devoted he became.

120
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,630
His heart warmed within him, and during meditation, a fire burned.

121
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:07,710
Tears were present; he offered them as a sweet fragrance to the Lord, for whom nothing is sweeter than a contrite spirit and a broken, humbled heart.

122
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,187
As a result, he frequently experienced divine illumination, and clear understanding blossomed in him.

123
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,387
As it is written, he who seeks goodness rises well at dawn.

124
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:23,275
The Wisdom of God opened his mind to understand the Scriptures, allowing him to discuss them with great ability and usefulness.

125
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:26,691
His works clearly reflect this, untouched by envy or ignorance.

126
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:34,067
While still young, he wrote a book in verse praising the Holy Spirit, progressing more by inspiration than by any teacher's instruction.

127
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:40,629
He also wrote another on various Scripture teachings, and a third in heroic verse concerning the Incarnation of the Lord.

128
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:51,692
Additionally, he discussed the condition of our Church in one book, detailing by whom it was established and what good or evil it received from the Lord, from Euraclus, bishop of the Leodians, to Obertus.

129
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:55,271
He also crafted another work on the same subject in Sapphic meter.

130
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:00,640
Finally, he enhanced the lives of Saint Augustine and Saint Odilia the virgin with a radiant style.

131
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,630
He composed songs about the saints Theodard the martyr, and Goar and Severus the confessors.

132
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:13,709
After becoming a priest, he truly delved into the deepest matters of the heart, focusing all his intention and mind towards the true south.

133
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:19,322
He wrote twelve booklets about the divine offices or sacraments celebrated in the Church throughout the year.

134
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,257
Then he composed fourteen booklets on the Gospel of John.

135
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:31,474
He authored forty-two books on the Holy Trinity and its works, where you can find all the fruits of the Scriptures, both new and old, which the Church treasures for its followers.

136
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:40,124
At the request of Frederick, the Archbishop of Cologne, he thoroughly explained the Apocalypse in twelve books and also covered the twelve Prophets in thirty-one books.

137
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:45,377
He wrote thirteen books on the victory of the Word of God and thirteen books on the Gospel of Matthew.

138
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:52,122
In his second-to-last book, he describes how wonderfully and gloriously he received the grace of writing from the Father of lights.

139
00:12:52,122 --> 00:13:00,309
Cuno, the abbot of Siegburg, insisted he document this, having urged him-despite his initial reluctance-by invoking the awe-inspiring name of the Holy Trinity.

140
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:05,407
He took great joy in this divine gift, which a kind-hearted overseer encouraged him to use eagerly.

141
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,711
He often found delight in his conversations or writings about the Scriptures as if they were treasures.

142
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:18,280
His devotion to the study of holy readings was matched by excellent morals and piety, leading to his later appointment as the bishop of Regensburg.

143
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:24,047
Moreover, Robert himself had already become the prelate of the Church, having succeeded the late abbot of Thuit.

144
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:31,720
Though busy with that ministry and, like Martha, occasionally troubled by many concerns, he diligently focused on the one thing necessary, like Mary.

145
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,332
He sat at the Lord's feet, listening to His word, while engaging in holy meditation and the study of writing.

146
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:48,455
He maintained such a commendable habit that if he ever felt a lesser grace upon him-since the body's burdens can weigh down the soul, and earthly concerns can press on the mind, especially with external distractions.

147
00:13:49,175 --> 00:14:02,621
As he humbled himself before the crucified Lord, he sought guidance from the holy and true one, who holds the key of David, who opens doors that no one can shut and shuts doors that no one can open (Revelation 3:7), to open what was closed.

148
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:06,991
To the one who humbly sought and faithfully knocked, the door was soon opened.

149
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:12,817
Light wondrously illuminated his understanding, allowing him to hear what the Lord God spoke within him.

150
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:18,811
His tongue was like the pen of a swift writer, and those who came to learn from him received his teachings.

151
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:27,439
He enriched himself so diligently and filled his heart's treasury so greatly that two or three writers could barely manage to transcribe what he dictated.

152
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:33,657
This was not surprising, as he had once seen in a night vision the Wisdom of God, the Word of God, kissing him.

153
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:40,492
His entire body seemed to be made of the purest gold, with numerous pipes pouring forth living waters into him with force.

154
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:54,329
As the Psalmist says, "The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple" (Psalm 119:130), meaning the humble, who are enriched with the knowledge of high secrets, meant only for friends, and are abundantly nourished.

155
00:14:54,329 --> 00:15:19,763
Just as Wisdom itself says: "I poured out rivers, I am like a water channel of immense waters from a river; I am like the river Dorix, and like a water conduit I came out of paradise. I said, I will water my garden of plantations, and I will drench the fruit of my birth, and my channel became abundant, and my river approached the sea, for I illuminate my teaching like the dawn for everyone, and I will proclaim it to distant places" (Sirach 24:30-33).

156
00:15:19,763 --> 00:15:29,903
Thus, Robert also wrote seven books on the Song of Songs, fifteen books on Samuel or David, and nine books on the glorification of the Trinity and the procession of the Holy Spirit.

157
00:15:30,407 --> 00:17:15,983
He also wrote a five-book series titled "Ring," which features a debate on faith between a Christian and a Jew.
Additionally, he published four books on certain chapters of the Rule of Saint Benedict. In the first book, he describes the many attacks from envious people and the troubles he faced from those who falsely accused him of heresy and misinterpreting the Holy Scriptures.
When he was young, he wrote an apologetic book on the will of God addressed to Anselm of Laon, a scholar, and William of Chalons, a renowned bishop in France at the time. In this book, he argued against those who, following the Colitiani heresy, claimed that God willed evil to be done-not the evil of affliction, which is sometimes necessary for correcting sinners, but any evil that contradicts goodness and virtue.
He also published several writings against his accusers or some irreligious people. One was a priest, or rather a concubinary, who claimed with pamphlets that priests could freely use concubines, even when they were menstruating. Another was a cleric who had become a monk, or rather a raven turned from a dove, who defended his error with wicked arguments and preferred to drift and be in danger in the world rather than find rest and salvation in Christ, the true Noah, within the ark of the monastery.
Moreover, a severe fire engulfed and consumed the surrounding workshops of the Abbey of Tuit. Flames raged fiercely, and the abbey itself would have been in danger if divine mercy had not intervened. As some witnessed, a person of celestial brightness stood above, fanning away the rising fireballs with the edge of their garment as if with a fan. The flames retreated, and the house emerged unscathed, undoubtedly fulfilling what the prophet says to the Lord: "In your wrath, you will remember mercy" from the book of Habakkuk, chapter three.
However, the parish church was consumed by the fire. Yet there, too, the right hand of Christ was gloriously magnified.

158
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:25,068
During a massive fire that was so intense it melted the church bells, the wooden cabinet housing the Lord's body, sealed in a box, remained untouched by the flames.

159
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:32,935
The Holy of Holies protected His sacred body, whose flesh rested in hope and whose soul was not left in hell, ensuring it would not see decay.

160
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:39,194
Additionally, the altar cloth, which one of the brothers had extended on a long pole, fell right into the flames.

161
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:47,060
Yet, when it seemed it would burn, it miraculously sprang back, hovered in the air, moved away from the fire, and landed on the ground intact.

162
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:59,469
This miracle was akin to when the three young men were in the Babylonian furnace, unharmed by the tyrant, as not a hair on their heads was singed, nor were their clothes altered, and the smell of fire did not pass over them.

163
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:23,345
Robert recorded these events for perpetual memory in a book filled with gold and deep reflection, titled "On the Fire," which also included a section "On the Meditation of Death."
After completing part of it, that celestial philosopher, oh, that divine partner of eloquence, passed away full of days, just as had been revealed to him earlier, as it is written in the Book of Job: "You will come to the grave in full vigor" (Job 5).

164
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:28,773
A fruitful olive tree in the house of God, oh, he withered suddenly in the fever's scorching heat.

165
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:48,716
Robert, equal in knowledge and virtues to the greatest teachers, was placed among the saints, where he may enjoy the ever-flourishing oil of true peace and joy, and the light of the divine, as it is written: "Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever" (Daniel 12:5).

166
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,855
Chapter Twelve

167
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:54,833
About Wazelin, or Waselin the Second, the seventh abbot of Saint Laurence.

168
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:03,327
Our abbot, Wazelin the Seventh, was taught by such an illustrious figure that, having absorbed the seeds of knowledge well, he produced good fruits of virtue.

169
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:06,015
He was gentle like a dove but wise like a serpent.

170
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:10,262
As a result, he earned grace and discipline in the eyes of both God and people.

171
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:17,304
While he adorned his knowledge with the gold of religion, he became renowned, like incense spreading fragrance on warm summer days.

172
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:27,356
His mastery is evident in the book he wrote, On the Harmony of the Gospels and Their Interpretation, a work both notable and useful, which any diligent reader regrets was left unfinished.

173
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:39,290
This mastery is also reflected in the paintings or curtains of certain churches, where one can see and understand the clear and unique harmony of allegorical subjects from both the Old and New Testament as arranged by him.

174
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,935
He devoted himself to Saint Nicholas, revising and refining some old writings about his life or miracles.

175
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:51,278
He composed solemn chants on the Transfiguration of the Lord, the saints of Agaunum, and Saint Apollinaris the martyr.

176
00:19:51,278 --> 00:20:06,276
Moreover, through his efforts, the oratory of Saint George the martyr was built by us with such devotion and care, with such piety and appropriateness, that it deserved to become a place of marvelous worship, transitioning through the patronage of the saints to the house of God.

177
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:19,070
Placed over the Lord's household, he provided them with a measure of wheat at the right time, for he was endowed with discernment and was eloquent and gentle, making him well-suited to either advise or correct both publicly and privately.

178
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,348
By this time, he had grown old.

179
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:26,176
His long service to Christ had taken its toll, and illness had worn him down at times.

180
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:37,516
Yet, with unwavering dedication to reading, prayers, and contemplation, and with his soul's eyes fixed on the true sun, he was, in a remarkable way, rejuvenating with a newness like that of the phoenix.

181
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:43,074
The story goes that the phoenix, after living more than 500 years, builds a nest of aromatic twigs.

182
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:47,790
With the flapping of its wings and the fiery ray of the sun, it sets itself on fire.

183
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:53,909
But after three days, it rises from its own ashes, once again a youthful bird, a unique and singular example.

184
00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:33,263
This is why it is fittingly called phoenice in the language of the Arabs, meaning "unique," because of its rare color or because it is singular in the whole world.
Although these qualities might somewhat apply to Wazelin, they most fittingly apply to you, O Jesus Christ, the unique and singular phoenix. These qualities, I say, are particularly ascribed to you, O Isaac, the only begotten, who are the joy and love of the saints. Anointed with the aromas of all grace, you offered yourself to God on the wood of the cross through the love of the Holy Spirit. Yet, with a unique newness and unparalleled youthfulness, you blossomed again immortally from the tomb after three days, now alive once more.

185
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,519
Chapter Thirteen

186
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,807
Wazelinus the First, abbot of Saint Lawrence by this name.

187
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,697
Another Wazelinus had come before him at the abbey.

188
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:48,555
Although simple by nature, he diligently performed his church duties from youth to old age with a true zeal for religion.

189
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:56,262
Sometimes he read, other times he sang psalms, and often he prayed, like a strong ox tirelessly threshing on the Lord's threshing floor.

190
00:21:56,262 --> 00:22:05,557
He was gentle and approachable, much like the holy Moses, in contrast to Nabal the Carmelite, who was as stubborn as a camel, never speaking directly or peacefully.

191
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,164
Let those who are diligent remember Wazelinus.

192
00:22:08,164 --> 00:22:10,828
Wazelinus cared for the diligent like a father.

193
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:17,459
Free from the bitterness of envy, he would often sweetly say:
"Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house" Psalm 26.

194
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,727
Chapter Fourteen

195
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:23,043
About the Monk Lambert. Lambert explained the fables of Aesop.

196
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:28,016
He skillfully used these stories to influence human behavior as the original author intended.

197
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:38,390
However, our commentator ignored the moral lessons and focused unwisely on allegory, trying to make something sacred out of them, as if one could gather figs from thorns or grapes from brambles.

198
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:44,539
So, on the first of March, that book was read in the mouse senate, debated, rejected, and received harsh criticism.

199
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:51,758
Then mice rushed in from the fields and the Palestinian villages, attacked with fierce teeth, gnawed, and scattered the written points.

200
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:53,790
But what hope did we have of recovery?

201
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:00,688
We lacked the famous treasures of the Philistines, who could offer golden mice for their vows, and we didn't even have parchment.

202
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:07,158
Pergamum, the first to give its name to parchments in both use and abundance, was too hard and difficult for us to reach.

203
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,244
Thus, that Aesopian sacrament was lost.

204
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,039
Chapter Fifteen

205
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,416
About Gislebert the Monk.

206
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:19,630
Gislebert honed his sharp and clear mind through continuous practice, always keeping himself engaged by either thinking or writing.

207
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:27,945
He crafted the Story of Joseph in heroic verse, compiling it into a single book, and divided the Deeds of David into twelve parts using the same meter.

208
00:23:27,945 --> 00:24:15,962
His writing style is straightforward and easy to understand, yet praiseworthy because, as he said in his own verses, achieving simplicity is often a difficult task:
"I composed poems and completed them with joyful effort, setting a challenging rule for myself: to carefully render word for word. Indeed, it is a task worthy of much praise, an excellent endeavor to move from plain speech, from humble prose to lively verse, and to follow a broad path, so that anyone might aspire to do the same, sweat a lot, and work in vain."
His works possess a unique charm, especially when he embellishes historical narratives with the mystical elements of allegory. Although he excelled in various arts, he was particularly adept at creating sweet melodies in music, as demonstrated in the songs he composed about Saint George the martyr, Saint Ragenufla the virgin, and Saint Begga.

209
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:18,047
Chapter Sixteen

210
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,395
About John the monk, brother of Gislebert.

211
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:26,096
John, both spiritually and physically a brother to Gislebert, was a scholar in both learning and duty.

212
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:31,405
As a boy, I often felt his discipline, much like no one ever wielded the club of Hercules more.

213
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:39,118
Oh, how many times, while he examined or critiqued our small works, did he look at the tablets in his hooked hands with a sidelong glance!

214
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:44,987
Oh, how many times I felt as though I had run into him as if he were the one-eyed Polyphemus from Virgil!

215
00:24:44,987 --> 00:24:51,190
When he was once ill, in a rather miraculous way, he seemed to transcend himself and saw many memorable things.

216
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,326
He documented these experiences in writing for the purpose of edification.

217
00:24:55,326 --> 00:25:01,251
He also composed two songs, one about Saint Christopher the martyr, and another about Saint Mary of Egypt.

218
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:10,472
He went through the story of Tobit and the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen, the first martyr, in heroic meter, and sang parts of the Song of Songs in an antiphonal style.

219
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,887
Chapter Seventeen

220
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,002
About the Monk Nizon.

221
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:18,674
Let's not forget about Nizon, who became a persistent example of the nature of learning.

222
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:29,716
Although he had a slow and almost turtle-like mind, he sharpened it through practice, and with constant meditation and reading, he reached the heights of polished advancement, almost as if he had grown wings.

223
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:40,918
He composed notable melodies about the holy martyrs John and Paul, Saints Nazarius and Celsus, and Lord Frederick, the Bishop of Liege, about whom he also wrote a booklet detailing his deeds, death, or miracles.

224
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:45,218
He was a simple man who could be deceived but did not know how to deceive others.

225
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:54,190
As a result, when we were young boys learning from him, we could easily provoke him and avoid his anger, almost as if dodging the strikes of someone who was off balance.

226
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:56,303
Chapter Eighteen

227
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:58,109
About Others Not Named Specifically.

228
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,171
We have specifically mentioned those brothers we found to have written something.

229
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:08,190
There were also many others commendable for both their knowledge and their faith, whose memory is both sweet and useful.

230
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,099
However, we have not written more about them at this time.

231
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:33,567
We earnestly wish for, and implore you, O Christ, who counts the multitude of stars and calls them all by name, who is the most knowledgeable of the saints, that you may write upon them the name of your God, and the name of the city of New Jerusalem, which descends from heaven from your God, and your new name, so that you may give them, I say, a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except the one who receives it.

232
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,303
Book Two

233
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:36,935
Chapter One

234
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,338
About Reiner's Early Works.

235
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:48,002
Just as I've briefly mentioned the studies or works of those who have long since passed, I wanted, dear brother, to recount the talents or writings of our brothers who are still with us.

236
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:58,237
However, I'm held back by two concerns: that I might be accused of envy if I don't sufficiently praise what deserves praise, or that I might be seen as flattering if I give deserving commendations.

237
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:07,692
Therefore, they will naturally become better known on their own and shine more brightly through their own merits, as others do not take offense at what rightfully earns appreciation.

238
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:13,407
For this reason, I'll satisfy your request, or rather your insistence, and reveal to you alone my foolishness.

239
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:23,798
As a young man, I wrote some laments in verse and rhythm about the troubles of the Church, driven by a desire to learn, and I tried, though I was a modest poet, to imitate the great poets in some way.

240
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:28,838
From this, I created a small work about the New and Old Testaments and divided it into two books.

241
00:27:28,838 --> 00:28:11,804
I also called this work "Panther" because it was distinguished by a mix of prose and verse.
Moreover, I composed some writings about calculations at that time.
Finally, I wrote a prose booklet about the hanging of a certain thief.
I also wrote about the martyrdom of the seven Maccabean brothers in heroic verse.
Then, I expanded on that chapter about the Apostle: "Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?" from First Corinthians Chapter 9 in a broader Asclepiadean meter.
However, some writings I now recall were secretly taken by a certain acquaintance of ours.
I didn't have copies, and what I feared happened-I was deprived of the first fruits of my labors.
For he went to another region for the sake of his conversion and took these spoils with him as a token of mutual love.

242
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,871
Chapter Two

243
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:16,373
The same melody about the saints and its fate.

244
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:24,528
While I was being trained in the art of music, I composed a melody about the saints Sixtus, Felicissimus, and Agapitus to make my study more fruitful.

245
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:34,695
Truly, talent grows through diligent practice, and the remarkable power of art is evident, as it often brings deep emotion and reflection to those with pious hearts through its sweetness.

246
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:41,002
However, some people barely noticed this when I was diligently practicing, attributing it to frivolity and mischief.

247
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:50,409
One of these individuals, who was supported by the authorities of a second priory, seized the tablets where I had inscribed my modest thoughts and examined them for a while.

248
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:56,716
Meanwhile, I was filled with fear, as the stern face and raised eyebrows of the man hinted at future trouble for me.

249
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,999
Oh, a judge harsher than Minos or Athamas!

250
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:08,949
He read, fumed, and sang from one part to another: then suddenly, as if deeply offended, he began to destroy the innocent tablets and obliterated what was written with a rival's nail.

251
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:09,819
What could I do?

252
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:11,994
Should I resist, shout, or hurl insults?

253
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:21,400
The birch rods in the chapter house, along with many accusers, reminded me greatly of the uproar of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which once put Paul in peril in the council.

254
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,922
Would a muttered curse help?

255
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:25,804
A curse clenched between my teeth would be of no use.

256
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:26,511
So what then?

257
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:33,253
I lowered my ears like a donkey carrying a heavy load, and with the patience of hypocrites, I became accustomed to disaster.

258
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:35,917
Should I commit my thoughts to the tablets again?

259
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:37,657
That fierce nail would threaten.

260
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:39,505
Should I mend them with parchment?

261
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:47,661
I pondered the altar and coals of King Jehoiakim and the knife of Judas the scribe, realizing I am neither Jeremiah nor do I have Baruch as my notary.

262
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,346
Thus, I gave up on my endeavor.

263
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:55,164
After a long time had passed, I began to reconsider if any remnants of the same song remained in my memory.

264
00:29:55,164 --> 00:30:01,960
It was recovered so quickly, as if it had been noted down before my eyes, that I felt God does not disregard sincere prayers.

265
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,331
So, I committed to parchment what had been restored to memory.

266
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:12,503
I wasn't seeking idleness, which is the enemy of the soul, because staying busy felt much more rewarding.

267
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:21,608
In fact, I was inspired by that saying of Solomon:
"Do not love sleep, lest you become poor; open your eyes and you will be satisfied with bread"
(Proverbs 20).

268
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:39,990
I was also moved by this line from Horace:
"You do not wake up to preserve yourself; and yet, if you do not want to be healthy, you will run around like someone with dropsy: unless you ask for a book with light before dawn, if you do not focus your mind on studies and honest matters, you will be tortured by envy or love."

269
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:41,807
Chapter Three

270
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,124
Other Works of Reinerius.

271
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:47,865
I've described the conversion of Saint Pelagia in two books, titled: Mirror of Repentance.

272
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:53,870
Then, I detailed the Passion of the Virgin Mary of Cappadocia in another two books, calling them Virginal Triumph.

273
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:59,769
After that, I put together the Life of Theobald the Hermit in two books, which I named the Flower of the Desert.

274
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:08,408
Previously, these works were written in a rough style of dictation, but I refined them as best I could with some knowledge, following the advice of certain friends.

275
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,463
It's important to follow friends who offer pious guidance.

276
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:17,678
The deeds of the saints are seen as common material, and those engaged in pious studies shouldn't be noted for vanity.

277
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:25,527
Lastly, I composed a piece titled: A Little Book of Funeral Verses on the Death of a Friend, to which I added a quatrain to be inscribed on the tomb.

278
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:27,551
Chapter Four

279
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:30,879
Severe Illness of Reiner and Recovery by Divine Intervention.

280
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:33,824
Following this, a severe illness struck our community.

281
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:40,533
The intense fevers from the scorching summer confined many brothers to their beds, and some were even sent to their graves.

282
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:45,933
Our group was engulfed in mourning as we either fell ill or passed away, overcome by fear or grief.

283
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:52,915
Yet, to you, O vigilant and holy one, who neither slumbers nor sleeps, who guards Israel, to you, O kind Jesus, we are precious.

284
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:56,679
You watch over us and our actions every day, from morning to evening.

285
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:05,406
This was clearly shown to one of the brothers who, while participating in nighttime psalm singing and dozing off, was approached by a figure of heavenly beauty.

286
00:32:05,406 --> 00:33:18,770
The figure gently tapped him and said:
"Why are you sleeping? Watch and pray, as written in the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 22: God has promised a crown to those who are vigilant."
He stayed awake and noticed that the figure, standing in the middle of the choir, indicated with a certain nod those who would soon pass away.
Then the figure ascended the steps of the sanctuary and disappeared.
I, a vessel of misery and weakness, mere clay and lowly mud, felt the rod of God's wrath watching over me, striking me down and reducing me almost to nothing.
Indeed, I fell ill to the point of death, and the Lord turned my entire bed in my sickness, filled me with bitterness, and made me drunk with wormwood.
The hope of living was driven away by signs of impending death.
For a week, without food or sleep, and with my brain nearly dried up by the burning fever, I was in danger, driven by hallucinations and speaking incoherently.
But the compassionate and diligent care of the brothers brought me to the knees of divine mercy and entrusted my lowly mortal remains to the one who holds the keys of death and the underworld, who was dead and did not see decay but now lives forever and ever.
Therefore, I was brought to the crypt of the holy Mother of God at the tomb of Bishop Wolbodon, whom I mentioned earlier.
There I lay down until nearly midnight.

287
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:25,927
The illness that had overtaken my small body was now reaching into the depths of my soul, locking my senses in a fatal grip.

288
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:36,146
Suddenly, I saw a holy figure, radiant with pure white hair and dressed in festive priestly attire, standing at the right side of my bed, making the sign of the cross over me three times.

289
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:42,430
I immediately felt the power of the blessing: sweat broke out across my limbs, and my tired eyes found sweet sleep.

290
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,364
My stomach, which had been rejecting food, now craved it after the fast.

291
00:33:46,364 --> 00:34:02,921
Through the boundless compassion of the blessed Mother of God, with her remarkable grace, she presented the child hanging on the cross to be adored and kissed by the most unworthy; and through the intervention of the holy confessor, who blessed me to live, I was pulled back from the very jaws of death.

292
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:06,527
But what cries will my soul release, what tears will my eyes shed?

293
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:11,008
I tremble and fear that the delay of death might mean less correction for my life.

294
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:17,237
I know, Lord, that a person's path is not their own, nor do they have the strength to walk and direct their steps.

295
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:22,538
Therefore, correct me, but not in judgment, and not in your anger, lest you reduce me to nothing.

296
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:26,964
Knowing my frailty, strengthen me as you can, for without you, nothing is strong.

297
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:29,159
Chapter Five

298
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,370
Grateful Heart of Reiner Towards Heavenly Healers
A Vision of Divine Judgment.

299
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:39,903
After I regained my strength, I offered what little gifts I could, like a humble prayer to the merciful mother of spirit.

300
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:45,463
This prayer was rhythmically expressed and elaborated into a divine melody about the confessor himself.

301
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:51,348
Finally, I don't think it's pointless to share what one brother witnessed about another brother at that time.

302
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,939
One was dying, and the other was lying very ill.

303
00:34:53,939 --> 00:35:00,256
Early one morning, while awake, he clearly saw in the same house a person of judicial authority seated at a tribunal.

304
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:06,950
Certain worthy men were advocating for the dying man, responding to accusations or objections from demons clamoring outside.

305
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,567
By some divine power, these demons were prevented from breaking in.

306
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:18,017
Their appearance was nothing short of hideous, and their envy and malice were revealed through their eyes with an almost sulfurous horror.

307
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,123
They surrounded the place like a siege.

308
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:27,951
As the soul finally departed and the judge withdrew with the blessed spirits, the demons followed with unbearable commotion and chaotic shouting.

309
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:31,568
It seemed as if the entire air was struggling with terrible storms.

310
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:32,864
Oh, what a tearful hour!

311
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,375
Oh, what a terrifying trial!

312
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,697
Oh, what a dreadfully compelling necessity!

313
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:40,638
How blessed is the one whose good conscience keeps him safe at that time!

314
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,152
Chapter Six

315
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:44,596
Various Works of Reinerius.

316
00:35:44,596 --> 00:35:51,764
For a while, I stopped writing because I either enjoyed reading more or focused my efforts on teaching my brothers as best as I could.

317
00:35:51,764 --> 00:35:57,648
However, when a friend needed something, I wrote a more extensive piece, which I called the Reminder of Piety.

318
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:09,845
To prevent the tablet from gathering dust and the stylus from rusting away on the wall, I wrote a short work for a friend about the notable features of the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, organized into two small books in verse.

319
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:20,864
For another person, I wrote two small books: the first about the conflict between two leaders and the remarkable revelation of souls; the second about a captured soldier who was freed by a saving sacrifice.

320
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:26,428
Indeed, people tend to pursue more eagerly the art they have gained through both knowledge and practice.

321
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:42,957
So, since I had acquired some skill in writing from my efforts, I took on a project that I knew would exceed my modest abilities, certainly a bold departure from Horace's advice:
Choose a subject equal to your strength, you who write,
and consider carefully what your shoulders can bear, and what they cannot.

322
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:47,451
If the subject is chosen wisely, neither eloquence nor clear order will abandon you.

323
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:59,273
Thus, I compiled a history in fourteen small books, detailing how holy Jerusalem and many other cities or regions in the East were reclaimed by Western Christians in our time, titled: The Laurel of the Jerusalem Pilgrims.

324
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:01,894
Afterwards, a serious illness confined me to bed.

325
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,128
Chapter Seven

326
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,407
The second illness of Reiner, driven away from the heavens.

327
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:15,632
My skin clung to my bones as my flesh was consumed, for the Lord had aged my skin and flesh, in line with the prophet's words, and crushed my bones.

328
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:20,801
I lost all appetite for food, and my veins, deprived of nourishment, refused to let me sleep.

329
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:25,748
So, my soul cried out to God, for His wrath overwhelmed me, and His terrors disturbed me.

330
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:35,752
Indeed, my soul was drenched in its own tears, broken and filled with an indescribable feeling, stirring the deepest parts of the Spirit of the Comforter, deserving of consolation.

331
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:43,033
One of the brothers visited and advised me to have the names of the seven sleeping saints written on paper and tied around my head.

332
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:46,645
This remedy of devout faith sometimes restored sleep to the sick.

333
00:37:46,645 --> 00:37:53,982
I took his advice to heart, did as instructed, and inwardly heard a voice: "Your faith will heal you" (Gospel of Mark, Chapter Ten).

334
00:37:53,982 --> 00:38:07,043
Suddenly, in a mental rapture, I found myself in a palace filled with unimaginable light and incredible fragrance, where the lamp, the glory, the exultation, was the majesty of the true, uniquely desirable, blessed, and adored Trinity.

335
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:13,212
Yet, it's important to restrain an intemperate and impudent mouth, so as not to burden my unfortunate miseries.

336
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:22,827
Suffice it to say, in thanksgiving, that among the choirs of those clad in purple and white, I recognized the saints, gloriously marked with golden crowns and scarlet robes.

337
00:38:22,827 --> 00:38:36,555
There, the sweetest new songs resonated, and angelic instruments played the response: "These are the saints who gave up their bodies for the covenant of God and washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb" (Book of Revelation, Chapter Twenty-Two).

338
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:41,557
But when I returned to myself, I looked around, astonished, almost unaware of where I was.

339
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:53,229
Meanwhile, a familiar brother sat beside my bed, and as he eagerly asked why I was looking around so intently, trusting in his proven friendship, I recounted the vision, which I soon realized was not frivolous.

340
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:01,602
My limbs were weakened by illness and bound by pain, as if by chains, so for seven days, I couldn't rise or stand without someone else's help.

341
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:11,301
However, when I saw that strong and merciful one, who, through the blood of his covenant, released his prisoners from the pit where there is no water, I was freed and strengthened.

342
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:19,060
I was able to rise without any support when I went with the aforementioned brother to the place of prayer, pouring out thanks with all my heart.

343
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:27,788
Restored from my weakness, I offered the holy sleepers a gift of praise and thanksgiving, though it was a simple and entirely inadequate melody composed for them.

344
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:35,601
If anyone is troubled or considers it boastful that I write such things, would they forbid a wretched person from remembering the Lord's mercies?

345
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,834
No well-meaning person accuses a simple and pious intention.

346
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:43,952
It's good to hide the king's secret, but it's honorable to reveal and confess the works of God.

347
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:52,573
A reverent mind is not characterized by lofty thoughts, but by agreeing with the humble, as divine revelations to the pious are instruments of virtue, not vice.

348
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:57,961
But what benefit is there for the wicked, like Balaam or Nebuchadnezzar, to have seen divine things?

349
00:39:57,961 --> 00:40:00,386
The sun dazzles the eyes of those who squint.

350
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:03,565
It is not a holy vision that merits God, but a holy action.

351
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:05,808
Chapter Eight

352
00:40:05,808 --> 00:40:06,990
Other works of Reiner.

353
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,579
I also wrote a small book in verse about the arrival of the relics of Saint Lawrence in Liege from Rome.

354
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:19,459
Additionally, I composed many prayers at the request of the brothers, to be said to the martyr himself and various other saints.

355
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:24,457
I also published a little book for certain priests about showing reverence for sacred places.

356
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:31,659
In it, I sharply criticized the practices near cemeteries or around the bodies of the deceased before they were brought to the church.

357
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:36,979
In particular, girls' choruses and other inappropriate activities were allowed during night vigils.

358
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:44,987
A sophist, aiming to elevate his own works and diminish ours, challenged me with obscure questions and barbaric expressions compiled from everywhere.

359
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:49,340
I felt as though I had stumbled into Daedalus's labyrinth and faced the Minotaur.

360
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,362
How would I escape?

361
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:51,813
What guidance could I find?

362
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:54,177
I lacked the delicate threads of cleverness.

363
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:55,575
How would I defend myself?

364
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:57,080
I had no sword of eloquence.

365
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:51,093
Nevertheless, I unraveled those complexities, escaped the dreadful beast, and this little book was titled: "He who speaks sophistically is detestable."
Since it's known that variety brings refreshment and change erases weariness, I sometimes varied my study with prose, sometimes with verse, and occasionally with music. For this reason, I began twin songs about the holy confessors Antony and Jerome, as I wished to offer my humble services to such great patrons.
Oh, what a trivial little man I am! Oh, soul focused on earthly things and empty of the heavenly! Yet sometimes I dared to lift the face of my mind, and, lifted by both my heart and tongue like twin wings, I burst into the angelic mysteries.
Indeed, I composed three small books in verse about the victory of the archangel Michael, covering both his triumph over the ancient dragon and his angels with his own angels, and his glorious battle for Christians against pagans, when he established and dedicated a new sanctuary on Mount Gargano.

366
00:41:51,792 --> 00:42:02,315
There are no costs for that structure of metals, marbles, and precious cedar piles, because the rock with its rough hollow expands the arch of its space, offering more reverence than craftsmanship.

367
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:09,473
For you, O glorious defender, to you, I say, O magnificent one according to your name, admirer of the glorified and admirable Trinity!

368
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:10,755
Indeed, who is like God?

369
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:16,364
Human hearts enriched with faith, hope, and love are more pleasing than the rich material of such things.

370
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:21,652
Additionally, I composed music about Saint Servatius and Saint Begga when some canons requested it.

371
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:28,062
My brother asked me to create seven hymns about the Holy Spirit, for which I owe love, so that I might fulfill devotion.

372
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:36,022
Specifically, while he often encouraged me with familiar conversation, he revealed something among other things that is venerable, that is memorable.

373
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:52,314
Sometimes, when he had devoted himself to vigils and the invocation of the same Holy Spirit, he fell into a trance at dusk and saw himself being carried into a church by someone of complete brightness and admirable sweetness, who was clothed in white, shining brighter than snow, and adorned with flowers.

374
00:42:52,314 --> 00:43:05,829
This person embraced him with the sweetest affection, with both hands placed on his heart, just as a loving mother presses her breasts to a sweet nursing infant, but hid their face as the brother frequently turned to look at them and longed to see them.

375
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:18,863
He understood that it was the Holy Spirit, yet for a little while, he saw that face, about which it is better to remain silent, for it is safer to be moved by it than to speak of it; it is safer to venerate mysteries than to dispute about them.

376
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:25,905
Finally, the brother of the most merciful Creator, the most worthy Redeemer, lifted his right hand from his chest.

377
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:32,697
With his own hands, he made the sign of the cross over his heart, loins, and kidneys as a protective seal three times.

378
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:37,590
This was to protect and strengthen him against troubling thoughts or fleshly desires.

379
00:43:37,590 --> 00:44:07,867
The choir of the chosen ones present sang in melodious voices:
"Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice; seek the Lord and be strengthened; seek His face always."
Psalm 104:3-4.
The brother realized that the vision was significant. He affirmed with tearful contrition that he felt infused with a certain light, and the attacks of his mind and carnal impulses were greatly diminished.
Blessed indeed is the one whom You instruct, Lord, and teach from Your law, to give him relief from days of trouble.
Psalm 94:12-13.

380
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,744
Chapter Nine

381
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:12,030
Other intellectual works left by Reiner.

382
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:20,602
I wrote five small books about how, in our time, the Church of Liege, with divine help, reclaimed the castle of Bouillon after defeating the invaders.

383
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,545
I titled it: The Bouillon Triumph.

384
00:44:22,545 --> 00:44:24,203
And I also added music to it.

385
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:30,947
In addition, I composed two songs about the holy martyrs Evermarus and Urbanus at the request of the devoted brothers.

386
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:33,347
I wrote many epitaphs and letters as well.

387
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:42,091
With such tasks and similar trivialities, I spent my difficult life, burdened by monastic duties, and in turn, placed these burdens on our little donkey.

388
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,692
However, I did not expect the sharp arrows of some critics, which might pierce my humble writings.

389
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:53,922
I consider that nothing I have written or will write has any value, but is rather unlearned and even foolish.

390
00:44:53,922 --> 00:45:04,552
Nevertheless, I prefer to create my own work, however poorly, rather than take someone else's, using my own anvil rather than a foreign one, and I do not mend poor Latin with good Latin.

391
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:08,552
Whoever you are, praiseworthy craftsman, strive to be a new Tubalcain.

392
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:11,696
Practice admirable skills as an example from old times.

393
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:14,782
Let your own fire, your own tools, declare your worth.

394
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:22,555
For it is the sign of a lazy craftsman to always covet others' hammers and bellows, constantly begging at a foreign forge without glory.

395
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:26,841
A spring is not considered a true source unless it flows from its own vein.

396
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:29,070
What is poured from outside is foreign.

397
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:46,101
Therefore, I must be cautious; I must especially heed Horace's advice to a friend: To seek personal wealth and avoid tampering with the writings preserved by Apollo:
Lest, if one day the flock of birds comes to claim their feathers, the crow, stripped of its stolen colors, becomes a laughingstock.

398
00:45:47,016 --> 00:45:48,336
Book Three

399
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:49,968
Chapter One

400
00:45:49,968 --> 00:45:52,431
This little book introduces a topic of interest.

401
00:45:52,431 --> 00:45:55,561
My own mistakes seem as if they're marked with a black stone.

402
00:45:55,561 --> 00:46:07,209
Sometimes I yearn for little pieces of Parian marble, sometimes for precious pearls with a milky hue, so that these cherished items can clearly reflect the topics that a close group of friends recently suggested for discussion.

403
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:12,956
These are worthy of exploration and beneficial to understand, as one person rightly seeks what can benefit many.

404
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:53,698
Specifically, he asked: Why, before the Lord's Birth, are the nine antiphons that start with "O" sung over nine days with the Gospel hymn at the evening church service?
Additionally, why is the passion of Saint Stephen, the first martyr, commemorated on the second day of the Lord's Birth, and the assumption of Saint John the Evangelist on the third, when traditionally one passed on August 3 and the other on June 26, attaining eternal life through death, but being celebrated more promptly?
Why is the fourth day designated for the Innocents, when it's not clearly established that their passion occurred then?
First, I'll discuss these topics and then address the other questions he raised, covering them more extensively as requested, even though I would have preferred to be more concise.

405
00:46:53,904 --> 00:46:55,608
Chapter Two

406
00:46:55,608 --> 00:48:18,820
Why are nine antiphons beginning with the letter "O" sung at vespers for nine days before the Nativity of the Lord?
It is believed in the heart for righteousness and confessed with the mouth for salvation that the Only Begotten of God was incarnated by the Holy Spirit and made man through the Virgin Mary.
Therefore, since wisdom, by the will of the Father, was building a house for itself and carving out the seven columns of grace, that miraculous incarnation took shape and was celebrated within the womb for nine months.
We likewise commemorate it with praise over nine glorious days.
Indeed, we substitute a day for a month.
Since we must attend to other duties of times or solemnities and because other sacraments also need to be celebrated, it would be less appropriate or reasonable to focus on just one thing continuously.
Human nature tires of constancy; what is encountered less often is more appreciated.
The fact that these proclamations are made towards the end of the day, at sunset, mystically signifies that He, who was born of the Father before all ages, God from God, Light from Light, begotten, not made, when the fullness of time came, was made and born of a woman when the rising from on high visited us to give light to those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death.
For He Himself speaks in the Apocalypse: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end (Revelation Twenty-Two), since all things were made through Him and in Him; all things were restored or perfected through Him and by Him.

407
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:26,483
The earlier letters suggest this: Alpha, the first of the Greek alphabet, and Omega, the last, yet you should notice a clearer mystery beneath.

408
00:48:26,483 --> 00:48:37,788
Indeed, Greek letters not only form words but also represent numbers: and just as each one follows in order, so does its character denote a larger number, Alpha thus signifies one, Omega signifies eight hundred.

409
00:48:37,896 --> 00:48:46,206
Truly, with mercy and grace, the only Son of the Father, in the end times, wished to bring the children of God to Himself-not by nature, but by adoption.

410
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:52,453
This is symbolized by the number eight hundred, meaning countless, and generously endowed with the eight blessings.

411
00:48:52,453 --> 00:49:00,275
Therefore, the work of compassion and the mystery of mercy, which even amazes the nine orders of angels, is something we marvel at in every way.

412
00:49:00,275 --> 00:50:03,557
Although we cannot match such great blessings with the gratitude in our hearts or words, as the Wise One says:
"Glorify the Lord as much as you can, His magnificence is still greater and more wonderful; bless the Lord and exalt Him as much as you can: for He is greater than praise; by exalting Him, you are filled with strength so that you do not tire, for you will not reach Him."
Yet it would be ungrateful and impious not to give thanks. Therefore, we offer our glorification, blessing, and exaltation of our gratitude to God. Through nine antiphons, we present a manifold prayer, but a harmonious harmony to the eternal Sun, which is about to illuminate the world with the fullness of light.
Indeed, in Christ dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily. He, like a bridegroom emerging from the chamber of a virginal life, presented Himself infused and drenched with the delightful sweetness of all virtues, and the wondrous fragrance of all graces.
Thus, while the antiphons composed in praise of the thrice-holy Trinity are made up of three sets of three blessings, it is desirable for us to discuss the harmony of either of them, if it is granted from above.

413
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,424
Chapter Three

414
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:08,826
The mystery of the first antiphon is explained:
O wisdom, etc.

415
00:50:08,826 --> 00:50:11,514
The appearance of Wisdom to someone is recounted.

416
00:50:11,514 --> 00:50:17,276
The first of the gifts that the Apostle mentions in his letter to the Ephesians is the message of wisdom.

417
00:50:17,276 --> 00:52:04,275
This corresponds to the first of the antiphons, "O wisdom, who came forth from the mouth of the Most High," even in its literal wording.
God made everything in wisdom, the universe through the Word that came out of His mouth, created by the Most High, because He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it was created.
Psalm thirty-two.
This wisdom reaches from one end of the earth to the other with strength.
Wisdom eight.
While He wishes to have His delights with the children of men, He inclined Himself from divinity, beyond which there is nothing, to humanity, which is the last in created things.
Therefore, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God, completed the work given to Him by the Father to do, as beneficially as powerfully, and ascended to where He had descended, since His going forth is from the highest heaven, and His journey to its highest point.
Psalm eighteen.
He had proceeded from God and came adorned with the golden crown of love and mercy and upheld by the fullness of grace, so that even the element that the Church calls upon in its invocation, "O," is shown to signify the complete form of its roundness.
Indeed, I learned that this was revealed from heaven to a certain faithful person.
However, some tend to belittle and mock it, quoting the wise saying: Dreams elevate the foolish, like someone who grasps a shadow and chases the wind; so too is one who pays attention to deceitful visions.
Ecclesiasticus thirty-four.
In response to them, it is said, as the same passage shortly after adds: The dreams of evildoers are vanity, and just as a pregnant woman's heart suffers fantasies, unless a visitation has been sent from the Most High.
Both canonical and other Scriptures provide many examples that not every vision, not every dream is false or erroneous, and sometimes not dreams but revelations are sent from the Most High to devout people, especially those who, like Daniel, are men of great desires.

418
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:16,585
Indeed, it is also mentioned in the Book of Job:
"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they lie on their beds, then He opens the ears of men and instructs them with wisdom" (Job 33).

419
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:21,154
Aside from a more mysterious meaning, this can quite fittingly be taken literally.

420
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:28,843
Thus, the Wisdom of God appeared to be seated on a golden throne, with a golden crown on her head, adorned with the fresh grace of jewels.

421
00:52:28,843 --> 00:52:34,748
Her face shone with an unfading whiteness, and her eyes sparkled with a wondrous strength of hidden light.

422
00:52:34,748 --> 00:52:45,446
She was dressed in very bright linen garments and draped in a cloak of gold, much like the Ark of the Covenant, which shone with the purest gold inside and out and had a golden crown above it.

423
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:53,301
For to the Son of God, as the head, it serves as a diadem or ornament, which He, by grace, desired and by power, was able to assume as a man.

424
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:57,981
A wonderful fragrance filled the air, like the scent of a field blessed by the Lord.

425
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:07,397
Men of notable appearance and attire sat around her, blooming like lilies with a kind of youthful freshness, illuminated by rays of wisdom emanating from her everywhere.

426
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:41,049
They held harps in their hands, made of snowy ivory and intricately inlaid with gold, with which they played the sweetest music, those verses from the Psalms:
"The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, giving light to the eyes; the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and altogether righteous, more desirable than gold, even much fine gold, and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb" (Psalm 19).

427
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:48,626
Moreover, an inscription, as if arranged in a sapphire color, read:
"I, Wisdom, dwell in counsel, and I am present in learned thoughts."

428
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:57,595
On that very night, the faithful man poured out his soul, reflecting on the works of the Lord and His judgments that have existed since ancient times.

429
00:53:57,595 --> 00:54:02,958
He was deeply afflicted and humbled by his own miserable condition, soaking his bed with tears.

430
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:06,797
Out of abundant compassion, he received this vision for consolation.

431
00:54:06,797 --> 00:54:11,256
Indeed, experiencing heavenly revelations brings comfort and inspires devotion.

432
00:54:11,256 --> 00:54:13,966
So, O wisdom, you who gently arrange all things!

433
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:18,256
You are truly kind to everyone, and your mercies extend over all your works.

434
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:32,877
Come, teach us the path of wisdom, as described by the mighty angel that John writes about, who descended from heaven, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow on his head, a face like the sun, and feet like pillars of fire, holding an open little book in his hand.

435
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:38,748
Teach us the mysteries of this book, I say, so that your justifications may be our songs on our journey.

436
00:54:39,144 --> 00:54:40,848
Chapter Six

437
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:43,312
Mysteries of the Second Antiphon - O Adonai.

438
00:54:43,312 --> 00:54:49,528
The second gift of grace is the word of knowledge, to which the second antiphon, O Adonai, clearly corresponds.

439
00:54:49,528 --> 00:55:00,897
For the Lord, interpreted as Adonai, demonstrated how He was a leader in His mercy to the people He redeemed, guiding, teaching, and protecting them as the apple of His eye, as we find in the Scriptures.

440
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:13,218
It's said that He revealed His name to Moses, which He had not revealed to the fathers:
"I am the Lord who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name Adonai I was not known to them" (Exodus 6).

441
00:55:13,218 --> 00:55:18,986
This suggests He was going to reveal it to you, either by performing signs or by speaking face to face.

442
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:22,178
He also appeared to Moses earlier in the flame of a bush.

443
00:55:22,178 --> 00:55:34,107
When Moses said, "I will go over and see this strange sight-why the bush does not burn up," He said, "Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground" (Exodus 3).

444
00:55:34,107 --> 00:55:45,028
Therefore, as we approach such a revered sight, the footwear of mortal flesh must be removed, so that walking in the spirit of humility, we may be worthy to enjoy the living and life-giving fire.

445
00:55:45,028 --> 00:55:50,852
That bush symbolized blessed Mary, who stands out as remarkable in the purple blush of modest virginity.

446
00:55:50,852 --> 00:56:02,277
The bush was on fire but not consumed, because when the Holy Spirit came upon her and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, the virgin was set ablaze with an indescribable love, yet was not burned.

447
00:56:02,277 --> 00:56:11,014
She conceived God, the Word of God, in her mind and gave birth to Him made flesh, remaining inviolate and entirely free from carnal desire after childbirth.

448
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,134
O fire of sweetness!

449
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:13,198
O flame of delight!

450
00:56:13,198 --> 00:56:22,662
O unique blaze, where the material not only did not wither in the most chaste flesh but even bloomed like a special rose, by which heaven and earth are tinted in purple!

451
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:30,223
That fiery splendor marked the zeal and splendid wonders that the Lord was soon to perform in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.

452
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:36,887
However, it was most especially marked by the humanity of Jesus Christ, burning with charity and shining with miracles.

453
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:49,893
Here is what John the Baptist said: "Among those born of women, no one has risen greater. He is the one who is coming after me, who was before me, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal." (John, Chapter One).

454
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:54,415
Indeed, the sandal of Christ is his humanity, with which his divinity is surrounded.

455
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:59,528
The strap of the sandal is a perplexing mystery to our understanding due to its great subtlety.

456
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:02,381
Therefore, I refrain, and like Moses, I hide my face.

457
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:07,872
I do not dare to look upon God, but I fall to the ground because I am dust, and I will return to dust.

458
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:18,853
With all the longing of my soul, with all the depths of my senses, I proclaim the true praise of the true Virgin: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb." (Luke, Chapter One).

459
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:24,828
Furthermore, on the fiftieth day after the departure of Israel from Egypt, the law of Moses was given on Sinai.

460
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:31,557
When the Lord descended upon it in fire, smoke rose from it like from a furnace, and the blast of the trumpet sounded louder.

461
00:57:31,557 --> 00:57:38,124
Thunder was heard, lightning flashed, and a very thick cloud covered the mountain, and the people in the camp were afraid.

462
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:40,600
All these things happened to them as a symbol.

463
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,637
Indeed, they were a foreshadowing of what occurred on the day of Pentecost.

464
00:57:44,637 --> 00:58:01,593
After the true Moses, that is, Christ, had led his holy people out of the infernal Egypt, and had brought them through the Red Sea of his passion, and had been glorified by his resurrection and ascension from the waters of suffering and mortality, suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind.

465
00:58:01,593 --> 00:58:08,591
It filled the whole house where the apostles were sitting, and tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.

466
00:58:08,591 --> 00:58:15,266
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Holy Spirit enabled them to speak.

467
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:16,343
(Acts, Chapter Two).

468
00:58:16,343 --> 00:58:26,624
Then, as the trumpet of such loud preaching resounded, a multitude gathered and was confused in mind, because each one heard them speaking in their own language about the mighty works of God.

469
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:49,161
Imagine this: thunder roared and lightning flashed, as miracles shone brightly and divine judgments from the Scriptures were delivered, like this one:
"The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your brothers, like me. You will listen to him in everything I have spoken to you. And it will be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet will be cut off from the people" (Deuteronomy 18).

470
00:58:49,161 --> 00:59:09,575
Or consider this passage from Joel:
"And indeed on my servants and on my handmaids in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. I will show wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth below; blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood before the great and terrible and manifest day of the Lord comes" (Joel 2).

471
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:22,045
Indeed, when from the pierced side of Jesus of Nazareth, fixed to the cross by the hands of the wicked, after he had already given up his spirit, blood and water flowed out beyond the nature of dead bodies, the Lord gave blood as a sign.

472
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:33,567
That blood was a sign of death leading to death for some and life leading to life for others, just as the blood of the lamb once was, when signs and wonders were performed in Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.

473
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:38,040
A bunch of hyssop was dipped in it, and both doorposts and the lintel were sprinkled.

474
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:46,984
When the Lord passed, striking down the Egyptians, he saw the blood, marked the doors, passed over them, and did not allow the destroyer to enter the houses or harm them.

475
00:59:46,984 --> 01:00:13,028
Similarly, now, those who mark both the doorposts-meaning the soul and body-or the lintel, meaning their reason, with the faith of the cross, so as not to be scandalized by the passion of Christ, which is symbolized by the hyssop-a plant that is humble, bitter, but healing-they believe sincerely, truly confess, and worthily receive the holy Eucharist, will not fall into the hand of the striking devil, because they will be marked with the name of the Holy Trinity, protected by the sacrament.

476
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:16,985
The fire was given as a sign because of its bright and burning nature.

477
01:00:16,985 --> 01:00:22,967
This signifies that the Holy Spirit would ignite Christ's apostles with zeal and enlighten them with understanding.

478
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:27,025
Additionally, the forms of divided tongues symbolized the divisions of graces.

479
01:00:27,025 --> 01:01:27,731
The smoke vapor was a sign when many were touched deeply by the apostles' preaching and tearfully sought guidance for their salvation, asking:
"What shall we do, brothers?"
Acts chapter two.
To smoke means to be pierced and to weep over sins.
Indeed, at the first baptism of the Church, three thousand gathered, a miracle in itself, with divine grace foreshadowing that believers from all over the world would come to the faith of the Trinity.
Just as we understand illumination or the fervor of the faithful through fire, the vapor of smoke allows us to understand the blindness of the Jews and the remorse of the penitent, or the obscurity of the unrepentant.
The sun was a sign because, when it darkened during the Lord's Passion, it foreshadowed the blindness of Israel, which began then and continues even now.
Though the moon didn't visibly turn into blood, it became bloodied for them during their Passover celebration, when they ate the lamb on the fourteenth day at evening according to the lunar cycle by the law's command.
By killing Christ, they stained themselves with blood.
The synagogue covered its eyes with a cloth stained by such a monstrous crime.
