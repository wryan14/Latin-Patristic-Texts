They shine like stars in the darkness when, through active life, they manage earthly matters for our needs. They shine brightly like the sun during the day when they elevate our minds to contemplate the homeland of inner brightness. They sparkle like stars at night because even when dealing with earthly matters, they guide our work with the example of their righteousness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, when the preachers were driven out, there was no one to show either the brightness of contemplation or the light of active life to the Jewish people, who remained in the night of their disbelief. The truth, which left them due to this rejection, rightfully blinded them to their wickedness by removing the light of preaching. Thus, it is rightly said: \"He commands the sun not to rise, and seals up the stars.\" Indeed, He did not allow the sun to rise for those from whom He turned away the minds of the preachers. And He sealed up the stars as if under a signet; because by keeping His preachers silent, He hid the heavenly light from the blind senses of the wicked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It's worth considering that we seal something up so it can be revealed when the time is right. From sacred testimony, we learn that Judea, now abandoned, will be gathered back to the embrace of faith in the end. Thus, it is said through Isaiah: \"Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Isaiah 10). And Paul says: \"Until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, and so all Israel will be saved\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Romans 9).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, He who now takes the preachers away from Judea's eyes will later reveal them again, as if sealing up the stars, so that even though hidden at first, with the shining rays of spiritual stars, they will not see the night of their disbelief now when rejected, but will understand when enlightened later. This is why two eminent preachers were taken away with their deaths delayed, so they may be called back for preaching at the end: they are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the Lord of the earth <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Revelation).\n    </p>\n</speak>",

It's fitting that the holy teachers are marked by the name of the Hyades. In Greek, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈhiːɛtəs\">hyetos</phoneme> means rain, and the Hyades are named for the rains because, without a doubt, they bring showers when they rise.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The name of the Hyades aptly describes those who, as if descending from the heavens, shower the rain of evangelical teaching over the dry land of the human heart for the well-being of the universal Church. If the sermon of holy preaching weren't like rain, Moses wouldn't have said: <break time=\"500ms\"/> \"Let my speech be awaited like the rain\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Deuteronomy, chapter thirty-two).

As celestial knowledge is revealed more each day through them, it's as if the springtime of our inner light opens to us, allowing a new warmth to shine in our minds, and by their words, known to us, it sparkles brighter every day.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Indeed, as the end of the world approaches, heavenly knowledge advances and grows more abundantly over time.

When the Hyades rise, they bring about rain, which is why the Romans also called them Suculae. As Virgil mentioned, \"Arcturus and the rainy Hyades.\" There are seven stars on the forehead of Taurus, which rise in the springtime.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With the teachings of the blessed Isidore in mind, let's return to what we previously left behind. Saint Job, reflecting on the order of our redemption and considering the various roles of teachers, apostles, evangelists, martyrs, and confessors, marvels and exclaims: \"He who stretches out the heavens alone, who makes Arcturus, Orion, and the Hyades.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Gregory states: \"Indeed, with the heavens stretched out, the Lord formed Arcturus, as he guided the apostles with honor, establishing the Church in heavenly conversation. After forming Arcturus, he made Orion, because with the universal Church's faith strengthened, he brought forth martyrs against the world's storms. After bringing forth Orions, he produced the Hyades, as the martyrs grew stronger against adversities. He bestowed the teaching of masters to pour into the dryness of human hearts. These are the spiritual stars, which, while shining with the highest virtues, always shine from above. After these things, what remains except for the holy Church to receive the fruit of its labor and arrive at viewing the inner parts of the heavenly homeland? Hence, it is fitting that he said: 'Who makes Arcturus, Orion, and the Hyades;' immediately adding: 'and the inner parts of the south.'\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Here, what does the name of the south indicate except the fervor of the Holy Spirit? When anyone is filled with this, they ignite with love for the spiritual homeland. Hence, it is said in the voice of the bridegroom in the Song of Songs: \"Awake, north wind, and come, south wind, blow upon my garden, and let its spices flow out\" (Song of Solomon 4). When the south wind comes, the north wind rises and retreats, as the ancient enemy is expelled with the coming of the Holy Spirit, leaving the mind it had bound in lethargy.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

He is eager to describe its order, starting from the preaching of the apostles.</p>\n\n<p>The apostles were careful to preach simple and understandable truths to new believers, not high and difficult teachings. If they had poured out all the holy knowledge (represented by the water) from their hearts into their speech, as they received it through the Holy Spirit, they would have overwhelmed their listeners rather than nourished them.</p>\n\n<p>So the knowledge was kept inside, held back, so that it wouldn't burst forth all at once. Instead, the cloud; the apostle; nurtured his listeners with a gentle drizzle of words. He said, \"I could not speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to those who are worldly. As to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not solid food\" (1 Corinthians 3).</p>\n\n</speak>\n",
