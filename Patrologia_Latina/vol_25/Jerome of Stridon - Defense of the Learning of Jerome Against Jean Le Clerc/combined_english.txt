Warning. As the distinguished orator notes, the defense of innocence often finds a way to breathe again, despite being obstructed by the wickedness of many. Truth holds little power among most people when it is rejected everywhere by force and favor, unable to find a place to stand. I have not feared these challenges as I now prepare to speak on behalf of the greatest teacher against Jean Le Clerc. He is an open enemy of the Catholic Church, a scorner of the holy Fathers, a hidden enemy of Christ, and hostile to all learned individuals. What learned and faithful person is not moved by the insults in the Questions on Jerome? In this work, an utterly unskilled man, swollen with heretical error, attacked that holy and immortal mind. How can we endure any longer that a supreme man is harmed without consequence by a lowly cleric? And that the interpreter of the sacred Bible, complete in every way, is contemptuously disregarded by a shameless and verbose sophist? This is something that neither the mind of Cato nor the temper of Cicero could tolerate. I hold nothing more important than ensuring Jerome's name remains in the highest honor. It should not be tarnished by the ignorance of someone who foolishly attempts to teach wisdom. Therefore, with great eagerness and the expectation of many fellow scholars and all good people, I take on this cause. It is not to increase the hatred already directed by everyone's opinion towards a heretical writer already condemned in life and books. But to support the praise and reputation of Jerome, which that talkative critic has attempted to violate and corrupt from all sides. Indeed, to speak for myself, although many slanders and plots have been made against me by Jean Le Clerc, I can never be as troubled by the anticipation of my accusation and the judgment of the learned. His vile complaints, quarrels, slanders, and plots, he tries to launch simultaneously against Jerome and the new edition of his works. But it is quite convenient for us that his incredible audacity is paired with singular stupidity.

Just as he openly criticized the reputations of great men-like Origen and Jerome-he also made it clear to everyone that he aimed to perform a miracle of his own and gain admiration. Not satisfied with dismissing the studies and learning of the ancients, he boldly appoints himself as the champion of public freedom in the literary world. "I believe," he says, "that I am speaking not just for myself, or for others who are directly targeted, but for a significant and respectable portion of humanity. The rights of human nature are at stake here; the common freedom of the entire literary world is at risk; these rights are violated and oppressed by those who have, for centuries, insisted that what the consensus and authority of past ages have established cannot be questioned by those devoted to letters." Therefore, to reveal the boastfulness and arrogance of this so-called defender of liberty, I present his lies and ignorance. Even if he never regrets his mindset, I will at least dismantle his reasoning and the false notion of scholarship that the abundance of published books has created for him among many uninformed people. Once the name of wise and learned has been affirmed for Jerome, I will confront our critic again to show that he completely lacked judgment, trustworthiness, diligence, and knowledge in opposing our Paris edition of the works of the holy doctor.

If you translate my little work into Greek (as you promise) and wish to make even the most learned witnesses to my ignorance, I will say to you that Horatian phrase: Do not carry wood into the forest

Our Note. In this section, older manuscripts include some Greek words that I couldn't find any meaning for: Antiphōnikōn Tobaia Syrousin. Unless it can be interpreted as, "Instead of palms, they bring palm branches," suggesting that if you translate my little work into Greek and want to showcase my ignorance to the most learned men, you're doing the same as those who bring small branches before trees. This leads me to rightly quote the Horatian phrase: "Do not carry wood into the forest." While these words might seem coherent, they don't appeal to me much; primarily because the sentence makes sense without these Greek words, and there are manuscripts where such words are missing, like the Sorbonne manuscript and Vatican manuscript number three hundred forty-four. Moreover, neither Erasmus nor Marianus mentioned this Greek proverb in their editions; I am unsure if they were deterred by the complexity of the matter or perhaps by the absence of older manuscript copies, which we have in abundance, clearly enough by divine intent. I would like to ask the fair and prudent reader to assess my words according to the principles of criticism and determine whether our Cleric is a subtle and clever judge of both the ancients and the moderns. Indeed, I will confidently state, and I will reference all the laws of the Grammarians and all Greek lexicons, to support my translation, "Instead of palms, they bring palm branches," because anti in Greek or anta in Latin means in front of, against, opposite, or facing. Thus, anti phoinikōn translates in Latin to opposite, in front of, against, face to face. Ta baia, the branches of palms, as the Gospel also teaches. Finally, Syrousi, according to all Grammarians, is the third person plural of the verb syrō, to draw; it can also be the third dative case, syrousi they draw and for those drawing. So where is the ignorance of the Greek language that the Cleric accused me of? If we consider the meaning of Jerome's context, what aligns more with that Horatian "Do not carry wood into the forest" than this "Instead of palms, do not bring small branches"?

Now, it's time for me to address our critic. People often assume others are just like them. A fool walking down the road thinks everyone else is foolish and ignorant. On page 460, he critiques our edition by saying, "The second letter is to the monk Evangelus, not the Gospel; it's not called Evangelius but Evangelus, as both analogy and usage dictate." However, Martianaeus, known for his sharpness and grammatical expertise, chose the uncommon over the common, against analogy, in the title of this letter, since both versions were present in the manuscripts. In this case, he made an error, as the choice was at his discretion, similar to those who create Greek names contrary to the language's analogy. Regarding the interpretation of the word philengklemon, which Jerome uses at the start of this letter, he is equally mistaken. He translates it as "lover of complaints" or "complainer," because it implies grounds for complaints and controversy, as engkalein means to accuse, and philengklemon is said to mean "lover of accusations." Indeed, Jerome refers to the treatise, which he considers dangerous, as philengklemon rather harshly, since the term is typically used for someone obsessed with criticism, suggesting a question whose solution easily leads to accusations of error. In this matter, even if we don't have the exact analogy of the word and name of the Cleric, we still maintain its likeness and sudden image from him. In essence, he is truly philengklemon, a lover of accusations, and indeed false ones, as evidenced by the current chapter. When he should have shown gratitude for the new edition restoring the original word and name of Evangelii or Evangeli, and removing the name Evagrius from old editions, he instead forgot the favor and launched into insults and accusations against me, as if I chose the unusual name Evangelius over the common Evangelus. This accusation is countered by our later preface in volume two of the new edition, where these writings state: "He gave the letter to Evangelus, or the Gospel, the same holy Doctor, etc."

At the same time, Jerome was writing a letter to Evangelus. In the margin, it also has this title: "Letter to Evangelus." Finally, in the chronological order of the letters in the second volume, I listed this letter as number 17: "Letter to Evangelus, about Melchizedek." Is this to prefer the unusual name Evangelius to the usual name Evangelus? Here, the Cleric also complained! Our philenglemons complains that I interpreted his name as querulous or a lover of complaints. He prefers the meaning "lover of accusations" due to his own nature and his lack of understanding of the Greek language, which he must check in Scapula's Lexicon, page 730: philenglemons, lover of complaints, querulous; also informer, accuser. Let me ineptly interpret Greek words with such lexicographers: Let the Cleric alone be wise and seem the most learned. But enough about Greek questions; let's move on to Hebrew ones. Fourth, it is necessary for the editor and commentator of Jerome to be skilled in the Hebrew language, which requires a twofold effort. The first is an accurate understanding of modern grammar and the way both the Rabbis and more recent interpreters usually explain the Old Testament. The second involves examining the same language in comparison with the languages of neighboring Syrians, Chaldeans, Arabs, and even the more distant Ethiopians; from this comparison, clear light shines on many passages of the Holy Scriptures. Without this dual effort, we cannot judge the old translations, including Jerome's, accurately. Erasmus was indeed deprived of both aids, and he didn't even consider the latter, as none of his contemporaries did. He frankly admitted in his letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury that he supplemented the former with the work of others.

He mentions that the Greek parts, which were either left out or wrongly added, have been restored, just like we've done with the Hebrew texts. However, in this area where we couldn't rely solely on our own efforts, we benefited from the help of others, especially the Amerbach brothers, whose assistance I gladly used because I had just started to understand Hebrew letters, rather than having fully learned them. Thanks to their efforts, everything was corrected to match the reading practices of the Masoretes and was written in Hebrew characters, unlike how Jerome had written them in Latin, as if anything different from the Masoretic reading was incorrect. This mistake was rightly noticed and corrected everywhere by Martianaeus, which I willingly acknowledge, just as I point out the things that seem less accurately done by him. However, he has such a strong grasp of Hebrew grammar that he is led into hardly forgivable errors by Jerome's less precise expressions. For example, when he claims that Hebrew words start with vowels and diphthongs, it's based on a misinterpretation of a passage in Jerome's "On Hebrew Names" (column 40). He also repeatedly criticizes, in his Commentary on the same book, those who believe that the meanings of Hebrew words are now unknown to us and therefore do not blame ancient translators for interpreting words differently than we do now. This is nevertheless so true and has been so well demonstrated by learned men that it can no longer be questioned by someone skilled in these letters. For example, for the Philistines, the Seventy translators often used αλλοφυλους, which is also found in the Greek lexicon of Hebrew Names. Those who translated the Hebrew names, whether they were earlier than Jerome or Jerome himself, did not understand the reason for this translation and resorted to some other forced and twisted etymologies. They translated falling, or the ruin of a cup, or falling from a drink, or two fell, as if it should be derived from naphal, meaning "fell," and schathah, meaning "drank," or schthajim, meaning "two." But we have shown elsewhere that the reasoning for the translation should be sought from the Ethiopian language.

We'll provide more examples of this issue later. Here, as in other places, Clericus is caught up in various errors. He believes that a deep understanding of modern Hebrew grammar is crucial for restoring Hebrew words that Jerome often included. Yet, he soon admits that the Hebrew words in Jerome's works have been extensively corrupted because the Amerbach brothers, along with others whose work Erasmus used, carelessly adapted everything to the Masoretes' reading method-that is, to a precise grasp of modern Hebrew grammar, which relies entirely on vowel points, the shifting of these points, and the critical notes from the same Masoretes. So, let the attentive reader decide how much faith to put in a critic so inconsistent with himself that he contradicts what he tries to establish in the same observation. He admits that Martianaeo frequently noted and corrected the errors in Erasmus's edition, when he should have said always and everywhere: for there isn't a Hebrew word in all of Saint Jerome's works that I haven't corrected and restored according to the trust of many very ancient manuscripts; and although the critics' threats loomed over this part, I nevertheless persisted and endured. Therefore, I credit myself for achieving such a restoration in Saint Jerome's works, despite the thanks of my rivals and many uninformed people. Our Clericus criticizes the unforgivable errors that I am led into by Jerome's less precise expressions; that is, when I mistakenly think Hebrew words begin with vowels and diphthongs due to a misunderstanding of Jerome's work, column 40, volume 2. This has already been discussed above, where we explored Jerome's Hebrew knowledge. But I am surprised that our critic is still unaware of both the rules of ancient and modern grammarians, which clearly show that many Hebrew words start with vowels. For among the ancient Hebrew grammarians, these are found in Jerome's book.

Regarding the Hebrew name Gomorrah, it's important to note that the Hebrew language doesn't have the letter G. Instead, it uses the vowel "ayin." Therefore, this name starts with a vowel, not a consonant, and is pronounced as "Omorrha." There is considerable agreement among the Greeks and Jerome about the names Hiram, Histob, Hiras, and Hisboseth. Jerome mentions that these names are aspirated because both the Greeks and the Hebrews spell them with a diphthong. However, don't more recent grammarians often use "vav scourec," which is the vowel or diphthong "u" or "ou"? For instance, in Genesis 1:10, "oulmicveh," meaning "and the gathering of waters," is referred to as seas. To learn various grammatical rules of the present-day Cleric, refer to Thomas Dufour, chapter 2, on Reading, page 14. Here, (scheva) is pronounced after a significant movement, except initially, where it is silent, as in "ouvno," a two-syllable word, etc. Thus, "vav" is the initial sound, a vowel, or a significant movement. Many pronounce it as "ou," treating it like a diphthong, while others pronounce it as a simple "u" vowel. According to the same grammatical rules, the final syllables in the words Eloah, Jeschonah, Maschiahh, which are trisyllabic, begin with the vowel "a," or "patahh." Skilled grammarians call it "usurped" because its sound is heard before the consonant letters above. Similarly, the proper name of God, which should never be read as written and has different vowel points, is often pronounced in the sacred Hebrew context as Elohe, Elohim, and Adonai. However, some unskilled clerics read it as Jehove, Jehovi, Jehova. Finally, the proper names of people, cities, and mountains often begin with a vowel letter. They are read as such in the Septuagint and Jerome, like Adam, Eve, Abel, Abraham, Ada, Our, or Ur, etc. This strongly highlights the ignorance of our Cleric, but the accurate knowledge of current Grammar in Martianay's edition of Jerome.

In his shameless lie, Clericus claims that I have attacked those who believe there are meanings in Hebrew words that are now unknown to us, citing my Commentary on the Book of Hebrew Names. To refute this slander, I think it's enough to point out what's written in volume two of our edition, columns three hundred eleven and three hundred twelve. I wrote this five or six years ago. Today's critics, influenced by Hebrew, and their companions, raise many objections to Jerome, even though they lack skills and knowledge of Hebrew. Louis Ferrand, a distinguished man who has greatly contributed to sacred literature and Jerome's works, has gathered these arguments. He took on the task of defending Jerome's Hebrew scholarship, earnestly addressing all the arguments against the saint's expertise. He began his defense in chapter three, section four of the Prolegomena of the Biblical Summary, challenging those who constantly find fault with Jerome's etymologies or interpretations. However, many are reluctant to rely heavily on his responses to the greatest Interpreter of Scripture, as they accept only a fraction of his answers. They ask, "Who can patiently endure such vague and trivial responses in defense of Jerome, like those on page one hundred forty of the Biblical Summary?" The interpretations of the sixth objection can easily be defended or excused by referring to unknown meanings, blaming careless writers, or considering the variety of readings, which might have led the Ancients to offer interpretations that seem foreign to us. The similarity in sound between the names Hereb and Cades might have misled Jerome, who was focused on deeper matters and perhaps in a hurry, just as the most learned people err daily in such matters. Certainly, the matter is resolved if we present no further defenses of Jerome's Hebrew scholarship.

Whether due to haste or a focus on deeper issues, if the holy Doctor made mistakes, scholars generally agree that Jerome frequently erred in his interpretations and the etymologies of names. Moreover, no mistake is so obvious, no form of corruption so blatant, that it can't be defended by claiming ignorance, such as the unknown meanings of Hebrew names or the careless mistakes of ancient writers. So, it's better to offer new, specific responses rather than stick to these broad claims, which even those with moderate education seem dissatisfied with, in my opinion. These, dear reader, are the thoughts I've penned and now share with full confidence regarding the meanings of Hebrew words that are now forgotten. It's up to you to assess my sincerity and avoid unfair criticism of the Cleric or to keep such a distinguished figure from being ousted from the literary community. That figure, a false champion of public freedom, has boldly insulted us in his Hebrew Questions, partly due to overconfidence, partly out of the sting of disgrace, accusing us of ignorance and envy, with which he harshly attacks everyone. However, to avoid any deception, I believe that many, if not most, meanings were unknown to our Cleric, who, with a limited grasp of Greek and Hebrew literature, dismisses the most learned ancient writers and continually sets traps for their editors. Fifthly, he claims, anyone who aims to publish Jerome's works must have thoroughly studied the Septuagint and other fragments, comparing them with the Hebrew text to accurately assess their differences, which Jerome frequently did. This expertise isn't gained by simply reading the Breviary or by turning to Concordances and Lexicons, but through long and careful study of the Hebrew text and ancient interpreters. Since Joannes Martianay lacked this, he admitted many errors, as will become evident later.

I'm not sure what the Breviary did to John the Clerk, but he seems to be bothered by the fact that I, being diligent and religious, carry out this task. Yet how can he boldly claim that I didn't have the opportunity for daily reading of the Hebrew text and the ancient interpreters? There's hardly a page in the three volumes of Saint Jerome's works that are now published where his shameless claims could not be challenged. If he weren't so eager for glory, I would remind the diligent reader of the entire little work in Volume Two, which includes a significant part of Origen's Hexapla. I couldn't have collected, copied by hand, and arranged so many fragments of the Hebrew text and the ancient Greek interpreters without careful, daily reading of all these. Therefore, it's either no one or this foolish Clerk who slanders without seeing or understanding my work against his claims. Let's get to the cause of our Clerk's distress, which troubled him so much it took away his sleep and made him dream of Martianay and Bonfrerius. He defends his ignorance by saying that John the Clerk couldn't foresee what Martianay would dream, nor is it recorded anywhere that the word Elon is translated by the Seventy interpreters as Aulon, not just in Numbers and Deuteronomy but nowhere in the entire Old Testament. It seems Martianay was misled by a less attentive reading of Jacob Bonfrerius's notes on the Book of Places, where he guessed that Aulōn was altered from it, which our person misunderstood as if this had been done by the Seventy interpreters, which was a serious mistake. The Seventy interpreters either took that word in an attributive sense, for the name of a tree, or they translated it as Hēlōn, as in Judges Chapter Nine, Verse Thirty-Seven, etc. Martianay should have noticed these things before accusing me of ignorance.

In passing, he should have republished the book on Hebrew Places with greater accuracy. Instead of repeatedly pointing out the errors in the Bonfrerian edition, as he does here, since both versions incorrectly use Aulōn instead of Aulōn, and Epimēkos instead of Epimēkēs, which anyone with a basic understanding of Greek would easily recognize. Our discussion centers around the words Aulōn or Aulōn, and Epimēkos versus Epimēkēs. I can clearly show that Aulōn is a Hebrew name, not a Greek one as some thought during Saint Jerome's time, using evidence from both the Septuagint translators and from Eusebius and Jerome. In Deuteronomy chapter 1, verse 1, it says: These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness towards the West near the Red Sea, between Pharan, Tophel, and Laban, and Aulon, and the gold mines. Here, the name Aulon is placed as a proper noun by the Septuagint translators, just like Pharan, Tophel, and Laban, among the places where Moses spoke to all the people of Israel in the wilderness. Just as it would be unreasonable to deny that Pharan, Tophel, Laban, and Haseroth are proper Hebrew names and place names, it would be equally unreasonable to deny Jerome's assertion that Aulon, as used for Haseroth by the Septuagint, is not the proper name of this place and a Hebrew name. This can also be proven from the book on Hebrew Places, as Eusebius's intention is to explain the proper names of places, specifically Hebrew names, not Greek or common names. From this, it follows that Aulōn in the book of Hebrew Places is indeed a proper name and purely Hebrew. Furthermore, Eusebius explains this with these words: Aulōn, a large extended valley, is still called this today, etc. Aulon, a grand valley, stretches and is still known by this name.

Jerome translates this as the Great Valley, stretching immensely across the plain. It is flanked by mountains on both sides, which connect from Lebanon all the way to the desert of Paran. Within this valley, known as the Plain Valley, there are notable cities like Scythopolis, Tiberias, and Jericho, along with a nearby lake. Based on these facts, it's easy to see why our cleric argues that Αυλων is a Greek name, descriptive of its surrounding mountains. This name also includes prominent cities and regions where the Jordan River flows through the center. Since only someone out of touch would claim otherwise, we must acknowledge that Aulon is the proper name of a specific place, a Hebrew name detailed by Eusebius in his book on Hebrew Locations. I've already covered Jerome's works extensively, referring to volume two, columns 342, 344, 345, and 394 in the notes. Anyone interested can look them up, but I won't repeat what's already documented. Now, regarding the editions by Bonfrerius and Martianaeus, who write Αυλων with a circumflex accent and use επιμηκος instead of επιμηκης: It should be noted that for those familiar with Greek, this distinction is accurate, as Αυλων in ancient texts differentiates the Hebrew proper name from the Greek descriptive name αυλων. Additionally, among Greek writers, some adjectives end in os and es, like ομβρηρος and ομβρηρης, meaning rainy, or επιμηκος and επιμηκης, meaning extended in length. It's no wonder our critical cleric overlooks this, since he also ignores that Aulon is recognized as a proper name in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. Aulon refers to a fountain, valley, and mountain in Phrygia; a town in Great Greece; a city on the Macedonian coast, and so on. Lastly, the same cleric mentions that the editor and interpreter of Jerome should be well-versed in handling manuscripts.

Manuscripts and fulfilling all the duties of a skilled critic-yet, we don't clearly see these skills in Martianus, even though he talks extensively about manuscripts. Later, he offers a single example to challenge my restoration of the preface to all the books of the Old Testament, which describes anointing the Lord's head at the table with precious faith as the work of an unskilled and unfortunate critic. He argues, against even Erasmus' view, that Jerome should not have referred to the woman who poured an alabaster jar of precious ointment on the Lord's head at the table, but rather to the women who brought myrrh to the tomb. His explanation is so intriguing that it deserves to be remembered. So, I present it as it was placed after Erasmus' annotation: If we carefully read Jerome's words, we'll see that he more directly, so to speak, refers to the women who brought myrrh to Christ's tomb, rather than to those who poured ointment on the head of the one reclining. He seems to be saying: You are not seeking the Savior in the tomb to anoint Him with myrrh as the Gospel women did; but with your myrrh, you are anointing the head of the living one. Well done, Cleric, Jerome's restoration concerns you: all the manuscripts are eager to thank you; you alone, as a writer of the Art of Criticism, can exchange the most precious ointment of faith for the myrrh of a shabby man. One thing you should greatly fear is the preface of Jerome placed before the reader's eyes; for if it appears, you will be considered not a skilled critic, but a delirious paraphraser.

So, I urge you to protect the freedom of the editor, who stands up for the freedom of thought in the world of literature. Take a moment to reread what you might not have understood, or perhaps didn't want to understand, in Jerome's preface. I also appeal to you, followers of Christ, who honor the Lord by anointing His head with the precious myrrh of faith, and who do not seek the Savior in the tomb, for you know that Christ has ascended to the Father. Raise the shields of your prayers against those who viciously attack me, thinking they are wise by belittling others. I, in my humility, will always keep in mind the saying: I said, I will guard my ways, etc. How could anyone reading Jerome's words carefully think that Jerome is more directly referring to the women who brought myrrh to Christ's tomb than to the sinful woman in the Gospel who anointed the Lord's head with precious ointment? Jerome, with carefully chosen words, teaches that Paula and Eustochium anointed the Lord's head at the dining table because they often served Christ's followers, the poor, and filled the entire Church with the fragrance of virtues, as the Gospel says: And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. Then, the holy Doctor asserts that these same servants of Christ no longer seek Him in the tomb to anoint Him with myrrh, for Christ has already ascended to the Father for them. What Jerome affirms, John the Cleric denies; and what Jerome denies, the same Cleric affirms. Therefore, Jerome alludes to the woman who poured the alabaster jar of precious ointment on the Lord's head; and, enchanted by the Gospel words, he preferred to use "myrrh" instead of "ointment." This is Jerome, and his editor Erasmus, whom I gladly support.

In concluding my defense of Jerome, and referring to the Cleric in my usual manner, I mention that Jerome seemed to address the author of the Jerome Questions more directly than those he criticized. He used these words: Against the barking dogs who rage against me with rabid mouths and believe they are learned by slandering others, etc.

Chapter One

On the profound knowledge of Jerome, and the notable ignorance of John Clericus. It's crucial to affirm through every means possible the learning of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew by Saint Jerome. It seems that this validation is offered to us now, not by human design, but almost divinely. A harmful opinion has taken root in the Church of God among some simple Catholics and those unskilled and ignorant of Oriental languages, that Jerome himself did not know Greek or Hebrew well enough, but always relied heavily on Greek and Jewish interpreters. With their help, he learned these languages and endeavored to share this knowledge in his commentaries for his friends and future generations. I have tried to dispel this uninformed opinion and unfair suspicion from people's minds with numerous annotations and a unique commentary on the Book of Hebrew Names. However, John Clericus, a man both unpleasant in speech and lacking restraint, has somehow intensified my challenge. He has undermined our discussion's appeal and hoped to weaken it by boldly denying that Jerome had perfect mastery of the languages. Thus, I present the man with his Hieronymian questions, where I aim to restore Jerome's reputation if it has been lost, regain favor with learned friends, and satisfy both critics and supporters. If wise readers judge this matter carefully and sincerely, the authority of absolute learning, which should remain with Jerome, will endure. However, the arguments and evidence of ignorance will remain perpetually associated with our Clericus.

On the Greek Learning of Saint Jerome. John Clericus criticizes Jerome's knowledge of Greek based on some words in the Chronicle and the Book of Eusebius's Places, which, although not obscure, Jerome distorts rather than translating them accurately into Latin. If we consider the complaints of the clergy and Joseph Scaliger, who harshly criticizes other writers, let's examine the arguments these prominent figures use to claim Jerome's Greek knowledge was mediocre or nonexistent. Clericus states that, so those who are skeptical might find our claims credible, we will present a few examples here, as it would be too lengthy to list them all. We will choose examples that clearly show Jerome should not be blindly trusted when translating Greek. Scaliger argues that if someone today were to translate Greek like Jerome did, they wouldn't just face criticism from outsiders but would be fiercely attacked by their own peers, much like Actaeon by his own dogs. We will show some passages from the introduction of the Eusebian Chronicle Canon, comparing Scaliger's translation with Jerome's: "Moses, a Hebrew by race, was the first among all prophets concerning our Savior... concerning the knowledge of God acquired by the nations through him, delivered prophecies and divine sayings in writing, etc." This is Scaliger's translation: "Moses, a Hebrew by race, was the first of all prophets to write about our Savior, about Christ, I say, and about the knowledge of God that the nations gained through him, with prophecies and divine oracles in writing, etc." Now let's hear Jerome: "Moses of the Hebrew race, who was the first of all prophets, before the coming of the Lord Savior, explained the divine laws in sacred writings. It is said by the most learned men that he lived during the time of Inachus, etc." There was no reason for Jerome to alter the meaning of the words "concerning," etc.

He handed down, although he didn't fully understand it, because Eusebius had a much clearer sense of it, which could have been elegantly expressed in Latin. This leaves no room for Jerome's excuse, which was based on the differences between languages. It isn't a paraphrase of Eusebius's words but rather a different meaning, which, as I mentioned, doesn't quite compare to Eusebius's. That's what John Clericus says. Questions 3, page 52 and following. What John Clericus notes in this objection, after Scaliger, both critics inadvertently applied to themselves. Like Actaeon being torn apart by his own dogs, Jerome is harshly criticized by those he calls his unjust critics, referring to them as his dogs: "Therefore, let them listen," he says, "my dogs." Preface to Job. And in the preface to his Latin translation of Eusebius's Chronicles: "Nor do I ignore that there will be many who, with their usual desire to criticize everyone, which can only be avoided by those who have written nothing at all, will sink their genuine tooth into this volume," and so on. Thus, Scaliger and Clericus accuse Jerome, the interpreter of Eusebius's preface to the Chronicle Canon, and criticize his translation. They don't realize that in this instance, Eusebius's context was altered for better clarity, and any contradiction or ambiguity in the Greek words was removed, which would be clear and evident to us if the Latin translation had been purely literal. Eusebius states that Moses was the first of all prophets to deliver divine oracles about Christ and the calling of the nations. This statement seems to contradict what is said about Abraham and Patriarch Jacob in both the earlier and later books of Chronicles. For we read that it is written about Abraham: "To him, first of all the prophets, the word of God appeared in human form, promising the calling of the nations, which in our time the word of Christ brought to completion through the Evangelical proclamation to all nations." Regarding Jacob, Eusebius says the same: "Jacob died in the 147th year of his life, prophesying about Christ and the calling of the nations."

If Abraham was the first prophet and Jacob prophesied before Moses, giving divine oracles about Christ the Lord and the calling of nations through him, how can Eusebius be consistent when he claims that Moses was the first prophet to deliver oracles and prophecies about the Savior and the Gospel? We might excuse Eusebius by noting that he said these were written by Moses; however, a simple reader, unaware of this nuance, may find many contradictions in the testimonies cited that don't quite align. Therefore, it was more fitting for Jerome to alter the passage, not as an interpreter, but as a writer, to refer to Moses, the Jewish lawgiver, with his proper title, stating: "Moses of the Hebrew nation, who was the first of all prophets before the coming of the Lord Savior, explained the divine laws in sacred writings, and was said to be of the times of Inachus by the most learned men." John Clericus should have considered these matters with judgment, not from a desire for rivalry or out of hatred, lest it be said to him: "Where I thought I was doing well by my Latin writings and encouraging our minds to learn, I am called to account." To address the core of the response, it was crucial for Jerome to change the meaning of the words "about," etc., which he fully understood and chose not to translate into Latin. Therefore, there's no basis for the criticism sought by Clericus regarding the difference between the Greek words of Eusebius and the Latin of Jerome, because a prudent reader understands that the Greek was modified to find a more convenient and clearer meaning in the Latin translation, which was considered obscure and ambiguous in the original Greek. These points continue in Eusebius, as John Clericus notes: "In the present work, with the times brought together and the numbers of the years of each nation compared, I have compiled the work of the Chronicle's Canon."

Let's take a look at Jerome, who interprets these words in a much more obscure and less Latin way, without even conveying their meaning. In the current style, I have arranged the same periods against each other and counted the years of each nation, so that what was contemporary for each is organized in a meticulous order. It seems he believed that Syntaxin means order, when it is the same as Syntagma and signifies this work; he would never have chosen to say meticulous order as a title if he had understood the Greek words. But certainly, as Scaliger notes here, he did not understand. Our critic could not have more clearly revealed his ignorance than when he added it as an accompaniment to Scaliger's work. They claim Jerome did not understand Eusebius because they themselves did not bother to understand the Greek of Eusebius or the Latin of Jerome. For what else could the Canon Chronicus of Eusebius be among learned and diligent readers than a series of times set against each other and a meticulous order of kingdoms compared to one another, so that what was contemporary for each can be perceived at a glance? Jerome, therefore, interprets perfectly and expresses the Greek words of Eusebius in pure Latin, saying: In the current style, I have arranged the same periods against each other... in a meticulous order. He calls the Canon Chronicum a style because this book is arranged in styles, that is, columns, and is joined together in a meticulous order or described with an appropriate arrangement of times. Therefore, he did not intend to use meticulous order as the title of the Canon Chronicus, as the slanderer Clericus falsely claims, but interprets the syntax of the Chronici Canonis as the series and meticulous order of times set against each other through columns. Therefore, let the follower of Scaliger be ashamed of both his own and borrowed ignorance, who allowed himself to be persuaded that Syntaxin and Syntagma do not mean a series of things compared together, order, composition, or even distribution into categories. Which is as if I were to say Canon, as those who know Greek and Latin will readily concede to me.

To cover all points raised by Clericus, I need to mention a question found in section six on page fifty-four. Why did he translate the words But I, who value truth above all, to Given these circumstances, I decided it was necessary to pursue the truth more diligently"? It's incorrect to say that Eusebius agreed with Porphyry on this point, etc. Had he waited for an explanation from a diligent reader of Jerome, our Cleric wouldn't have made the mistake of believing that the Latin Eusebius agreed with Porphyry, thinking Semiramis lived after Moses, and that Moses should be considered nearly eight hundred and fifty years older than the Trojan War. The phrase Given these circumstances, should not be linked to Porphyry's opinion, but rather to the differing views of Christians and pagans on the age and antiquity of Moses. Meaning: given these circumstances, and since their views differ, I decided it was necessary to pursue the truth more diligently, or to investigate the matter more thoroughly. Eusebius conveys this meaning both in his writings and in Jerome's translation; however, it is completely inappropriate and absurd in the works of Jerome's critical detractors like Scaliger and Clericus. Clericus also argues that the following words are equally distorted: When, among the Hebrews, I observed different versions of the timelines, one being excessive and the other deficient, I followed this one. Nevertheless, even in this way, I found that Israel, the progenitor of the Hebrews, from whom the twelve tribes of the Jewish people are named, was contemporaneous with Inachus, whom the Greeks say was the first to reign in Argos. But Jerome's interpretation, which deviates from Eusebius's intention and lacks clarity, elegance, or even accuracy, is: Nor did it escape my notice that in Hebrew texts, differing years of ages are found, with more or less, depending on how it seemed to the translators; and it is better to follow what a multitude of copies has established as credible.

However, if anyone does the math, they'll find that during the time of Inachus, considered the first ruler of Argos, Israel, the patriarch after whom the twelve tribes of the Jews were named, was also around. Scaliger rightly observed that nothing like this was written by Eusebius, nor was it his intention. In fact, the bishop of Caesarea intended to convey that in the sacred Jewish texts, there are two different counts of years: a longer one from the LXX interpreters and a shorter one from the Hebrew texts of his time. Eusebius could learn particularly from Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. Yet, he opted for the shorter count; still, from this calculation, Inachus is not older than Israel. Scaliger pointed out this fallacy, but Jerome's reasoning seems even weaker, as he insists that no matter which calculation we use, the outcome is the same, and everything else is trivial. I see no flaw in Eusebius's reasoning, nor can I understand how Jerome's reasoning is worse. Eusebius aimed to show that the sacred Hebrew texts present different age counts: a longer one in the LXX and a shorter one in the Hebrew source; he chose the shorter total. Yet, even with this shorter calculation, Inachus isn't older than Israel, from whom the twelve Jewish tribes were named. I can't see anything in Jerome's Latin words that contradicts Eusebius's intent. Although Jerome didn't translate the Greek word for word and added some of his own thoughts, he didn't write anything against Eusebius's intention; he acknowledges the different totals and numbers of years in the sacred Hebrew texts. Nor does he dismiss the shorter calculation that Eusebius followed; instead, he aligns Jacob, the patriarch, with Inachus. Our Cleric could have easily noticed this if he hadn't been hindered by dullness and hadn't wanted to heap slanders upon slanders.

Verse 5: Critics take issue with Jerome's Prologue, arguing that he mistakenly claimed Semiramis and Abraham were contemporaries. They try to support their argument by stating: it's incorrect to assert something is clear when no one before Eusebius had reported or believed it, as it hadn't been proven or accepted. It's as if things that everyone accepts don't need proof, and as if many historical facts aren't self-evident, gaining credibility just by being read. However, it was evident, when comparing various historical records, both Hebrew and from other nations, that Semiramis and Abraham, both from Chaldean origin, lived and were well-known in the same era. Verse 6: The Cleric notes these points would suffice if we were dealing with people who judged the long-dead as harshly as they unfairly judge the living. Yet, for their benefit, we'll add another passage from the Chronicle, at number 1,250, where Jerome's translation is rightly criticized by two notable critics regarding the Poet who no longer exists: Arctinus, who wrote the Aethiopis and the Iliupersis. In Greek, it's Iliou Persin, meaning the fall of Troy, as Joseph Scaliger demonstrates. It should have been translated this way, but Jerome misunderstood the less common word Persin. Refer to Claudius Salmasius, page 600 of the Plinian Exercises, Utrecht Edition. What else is it to slander and act foolishly if not this? The Cleric claims Jerome's translation, Iliupersis, was rightly criticized by the esteemed critic Joseph Scaliger at number 1,250. Upon reviewing the passage, I find only this from Scaliger: And Iliupersis. Iliou Persis is the same as Iliou Alōsis. In the rest, which is mentioned at number 1,250, there's complete silence about Jerome and his translation. Thus, we catch the slanderer Clericus in a blatant lie and in triple ignorance, which indeed doesn't deserve forgiveness, even from those who would most want to spare him.

First, he imagined that the word Persis, meaning destruction and overthrow, was an uncommon term. This is despite the fact that it's clearly listed in the well-known Lexicon of Scapula, a book familiar to students. Secondly, our scholar didn't realize that ancient writers often used Greek words in the titles of their works, much like Varro did in the second book of Rerum Rusticarum: "But don't worry," he said, "I will satisfy you just as much as the one who wrote Bugonia." The learned Varro certainly knew that Bougonous and Bougeneis were poetic names for bees. However, he didn't translate Bugonia into Latin because, among educated people, Greek names were more commonly used in book titles than their Latin translations. Following this tradition, Jerome used Greek names in the titles of Greek works, like Ilii Persin, On the Principles by Origen, On the Vision of Quadrupeds, and hundreds of similar works that no one, except our scholar, could ignore or criticize. Finally, a third sign of our scholar's ignorance is found in the same preface by Eusebius, from which John Clericus began his critique. It is clear and obvious to us that Jerome understood the Greek word Persis and provided an appropriate Latin translation, as he explained in the prologue of Eusebius's Chronicle Canon: "After these came the fall of the city of Troy, which Homer follows at a long interval." Here, he interprets Iliou to mean the destruction or overthrow of Troy, just as he previously translated Persis up to the capture of Troy into our language. Therefore, any supporter or admirer of our critic Clericus should be embarrassed not to have noticed such ignorance in him and not to have boldly defended Doctor Jerome's position against the same heretic. Aside from what has already been mentioned and refuted, Clericus could not present anything else from the two books of Eusebius's Chronicles to show that Jerome was ignorant of the Greek language.

From this, we can infer that the esteemed Doctor achieved a high level of proficiency in this language, as even his critics couldn't find any errors in his work. Furthermore, everything from page 59 to page 63, consisting merely of slanders from a verbose Cleric, we find laughable, especially when he states on page 62: "There are those who might suspect that he, with a clever excuse, wanted to attribute the errors of inexperience to haste." Certainly, if we want to speak truthfully, such skill is not unlike Jerome's character, which was entirely inclined towards boasting and deception. While this is written aggressively and insolently by the Cleric, some may find it unworthy, while others might find it ridiculous. Ridiculous to those who believed his Criticism was focused on upholding truth, on the credibility of testimonies, and on highlighting difficulties, not on constant slander; unworthy to those who understand more deeply and do not doubt that the Hieronymian Questions aim to undermine the faith of the Church. But let us proceed with the remaining points, which the Cleric chose to address on his own. However, if anyone thinks that Jerome may have faltered due to haste while translating that book, they should compare the Latin translation of another work by the same Eusebius, "On the Places and Names of Hebrew Places," with the Greek version, and they will see that the Bethlehem Hermit did not exhibit greater skill or diligence in this work. First, regarding the word "Ararat," Eusebius said that remnants of the ark are still shown on the mountains of Armenia, Deiknysthai Leipsana tēs Kibōtou, which means remnants of the wood, as is clear from the middle and last words of the paragraph. So why did Jerome translate it as "traces," an awkward and obscure word? Why later as "monuments," and finally simply as "wood"? What was the reason for using obscure language when a clear word was available? Second, Martianaeus himself noted that Syneuōcheisthai was poorly translated shortly after as "to rejoice," when it actually means "to feast with someone."

Jerome had an interpretation of the etymology from Eu and Echein, meaning "to be well," which is quite misleading and not particularly skillful. Thirdly, the term Apobatērion, which means exit or departure, is wrongly translated as if it were Apobasis. However, it actually refers to a place where one disembarks, or a disembarkation point. Otherwise, Apobatēria is the ladder of a ship, as Hesychius explains, meaning the ladder used to disembark from a ship. Fourthly, in the writings of Nicolaus of Damascus, regarding Mount Baris, why is the word Mega, which comes before Oros, omitted when it's necessary? This is due to negligence, not a lack of skill. Fifthly, after Nicolaus mentions that many fled to Mount Baris during the flood, he adds: a certain man, carried by the ark, reached the summit, and the remains of the wood were preserved for a long time. This likely refers to Noah, who, although mentioned alone, does not exclude his family. However, Jerome, misunderstanding this, presents Nicolaus speaking in the plural: others indeed floating in the hold of the ark, etc. If we answer every question the Cleric asks in detail, the debate drags on: thus, I will address the matter and questions briefly. Firstly, he asks why Jerome translated the Greek word Leipsana into Latin as vestiges and monuments, instead of the remains of the ark. This doubt arises from his own ignorance. He should consult Marius Nizolius in his notes on Cicero, column 1652, where he will learn that vestiges, monuments, and remains share the same meaning among the Latins: vestigium, remains, sign, mark, monument.

Second, the Cleric creates a falsehood, for I never thought of it. He dined with his family; it was wrongly translated. He celebrated with his children. Jerome did not consider the etymology from Eu (well) and Echein (to have), but he elegantly conveyed the meaning of the words, rejoicing with his children. Because Noah, having left the ark with his family and offering sacrifices to God, could not feast in holiness unless he was joyous with his household. Third, this should be said to the unlearned Cleric: What bothers you so much? He wants to signify Apobatērion as the place where one disembarks or descends; yet he denies that Jerome translated exit or egress elegantly, as if Apobasis were the same as Apobasis. According to our critic, there is a significant difference between disembarking from a ship and exiting it. But let's teach him what Apobasis means, so he learns not to criticize a translation he doesn't understand: Apobasis, as the most learned in Greek say, means exit, egress, descent. Pliny refers to it as dismounting; Plautus, as outcome; Thucydides, Apobasis tēs gēs, landing on land; Livy, disembarkation onto land from ships. Thus, the Armenians called Noah's place Apobasis, which in French we would call la descente, le débarquement. Fourth, it would have been unnecessary for Jerome to translate the Greek name Mega into Latin, when he later adds about Mount Baris: to which many are said to have fled during the flood and been saved there. For those who were saved on the mountain during the flood could only have fled to the highest mountain, as Nicholas of Damascus reports. Fifth, the Cleric foolishly criticizes Jerome's translation, unwilling to accept the use of the plural, "But others floating in the hold of the ark," etc. Even though he admits that Noah himself (whom only Eusebius mentions) does not exclude his family. Therefore, Jerome interprets better with the plural than if he, out of envy, had named only Noah.

In the voice of Astaroth Carnaim, above Sodom, which translates to "on the brow of the Sodomites," there's a claim that can't hold unless a mountain named Sodom existed where the city was founded. Everyone knows that's not true. Isn't it fascinating, wise reader, to witness such a learned observation and the keen insight of our Cleric? He argues that there couldn't be a place "on the brow of the Sodomites" without a mountain called Sodom, but this could be possible if he knew "brow" means a higher and more prominent place. Here, "on the brow of the Sodomites" reflects a higher region, like the voice saying "Save," above the Sodom area. Let's consider both areas as elevated parts belonging to the Sodomites, and we might find the Cleric's argument amusing. In Arbo, or rather Arbee, it is mentioned that Hebron was David's royal residence, a dwelling, the royal seat of David, which is wrongly translated as kingdom. It's like saying about Versailles, where Louis the Fourteenth's royal residence is, that Versailles is the basileion of the King of the Celts, and then someone else translates it as the kingdom of the king of the Celts. Imagine someone writing in Greek and Latin, but what would you say if I called him unskilled and foolish? Certainly unskilled if he didn't know that basileion in the Sacred Scriptures means kingdom, as seen in Proverbs Chapter Eighteen, Verse Nineteen, "it prevails as a well-founded kingdom." This meaning is recognized by the Epitome of the Greek Language Thesaurus by Henri Estienne, so it's puzzling that a Critic wouldn't know what's also read among Grammarians. Moreover, it's foolish to call Louis the Great the King of the Celts, as if he ruled only the Celts and not the people of France or the entire nation of the French. I've discussed this misunderstanding in more detail at the end of the book on the Canon of the Sacred Volumes written in French, so I'll skip over this difficulty now. After ignorantly refuting Jerome John.

Cleric: Quickly turning to criticize Bonfrerius and Martianaeus, he says: We have remarkable examples of this matter in this book about Hebrew places. Neither Jacob Bonfrerius nor John Martianaeus remembered that in Greek manuscripts, Η and Ι are often mixed up. They mistakenly left the word Astaroth as Sodomite, instead of Sodoma. So, you might ask, why prove something known to children? Because Bonfrerius and Martianaeus made mistakes in it. If we rely on their editions, Jerome himself was misled by the faulty Greek Scripture. Eusebius speaks about the Amalekite: Amalekite, a region in the desert. But it was published as Amalakite, which is a pure error, and similarly in Jerome: Amalekite, a region in the desert, etc. Those who have never read Bonfrerius and Martianaeus but have carefully examined both editions of the book of Places might think the Cleric is very confident in this paragraph, while critics can hardly tolerate the errors, ignorance, and inconsistency. The learned Bonfrerius noted that in the word Astaroth Carnaim and in Lasan, instead of Sodomy, it should be read as Sodoma or Sodome. In the word Save and Seboim, he published Eusebius's correct reading, namely Sodomite, and not Sodomy. For the word Amalekite, instead of Amalekites: Amalekite is rather a patronymic name from the region than the name of the region itself. The region and the people are called Amalek. Thus says Jacob Bonfrerius. But the Cleric unjustly attacks him, as if the skilled editor of Eusebius wrote none of this. As for myself, I did not doubt taking an example from the learned and prudent Bonfrerius, from which I was eager to inform the reader about the observations of the same man, saying at the word Lasan: Bonfrerius believes it should be read as Sodoma; and it is more correct than what is read about Sidon in Jerome. Earlier, at the word Bethsaida in the Greek context, I read Gennesaret; but in the Notes, with Bonfrerius, Gennesaret, adding at the time: We allow such readings to the judgment of the learned.

Moreover, to highlight the clear mistake of the Cleric, let's remember that I wrote the following in the Notes on the third Greek Fragment, column five hundred sixty: There are errors and corruptions of names in the Greek manuscript of the writer. I often correct obvious and acknowledged mistakes without notes, while carefully transcribing the rest as they appear in the Greek codex. Who would believe, after such a clearly worded annotation, that a Critical Cleric would accuse me of not remembering that Η and Ι are frequently mixed up in Greek manuscripts? If this issue were being discussed with someone inexperienced in this field and in reading both Greek and Latin manuscripts, I would challenge them to compare and contest the Greek manuscript I used. They would have to admit that I changed Ι to Η hundreds of times in the new edition because I knew that unskilled scribes had written iota for eta in very old copies. But I believe you'll get away with it, O Cleric, who was thrilled to have found a mere grammatical error in the word Amalecites? Reread what you intended to teach from Cassiodorus' Questions of Jerome, page sixty-six, and then pages three hundred seventy-eight and onward. Notice how inconsistent your accusation is regarding the reading of Amalecites instead of Amalecitis, while also pointing out that the ancients often wrote omnis for omnes, and omnes for omnis, using accusative plurals interchangeably ending in ES, EIS, and IS. Thus, learn that Amalecites and Amalecitis were used interchangeably by the Ancients, just like Joannis for Joannes in the nominative case. Since this is the case, I call you as a witness to your own lack of skill and inconsistency, which you should have concealed if possible through your usual desire to criticize and that critical art of yours by which you are not ashamed to consider yourself superior to all other writers. Eleven. Against the Greek learning of Jerome, our Cleric objects in the last part: I will add something trivial here, indeed, but it will show that nothing is truer than what I said.

Eusebius wrote: Ituraea and also Trachonitis. So why did Jerome translate it as: Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis? You might think these are names of two regions that were part of Philip's tetrarchy. You might say I'm being overly meticulous by focusing on this detail. However, it's actually careless not to translate it more accurately. I'm not sure if Jerome thought the word η should be removed because he thought it meant 'or.' This suspicion arises because he similarly misinterpreted 'Trachonitis,' saying 'the region of Trachonitis, also Ituraea,' which implies 'the region of Trachonitis, also called Ituraea.' Yet, he translated it as 'the region of Trachonitis, or Ituraea.' If I had translated it that way, Martianaeus would never have forgiven me, even if I claimed it was a new work. He would have accused me of using a trick to conceal my ignorance, to avoid criticism for a poor translation, and so on. As long as our Cleric continues to eagerly criticize Jerome, he will reveal himself as foolish and imprudent. Someone who doesn't recognize what the situation requires, who speaks excessively, shows off, disregards the importance of the matters being discussed, or acts awkwardly or excessively, is considered foolish. Martianaeus would exclaim, he says, if I translated like Jerome: 'the region of Trachonitis, or Ituraea.' Instead, Martianaeus would praise you if you were skilled in criticism and didn't openly display ignorance. Who wouldn't be amazed at such childish, boastful comments, which, even if true, no wise person would dare write against a great man? Since these comments are both ignorant and false, there's nothing in them for which we can forgive the Cleric. First, the Cleric foolishly criticizes Jerome, not realizing that the holy Doctor was imitating the style of Luke the Evangelist, who in chapter 3, verse 1, stated that Philip was tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis.

Let the holy evangelist be accused, not Jerome, for omitting the word Hē (which), which has led readers to suspect that Ituraea and Trachonitis are names of two districts in the region that was the tetrarchy of Philip. Therefore, Jerome did not omit the Greek word out of ignorance or negligence; he chose to follow the evangelist's example rather than complicate things with a cumbersome interpretation. Secondly, very learned men like Strabo, Andrichomius, and Bonfrerius suspect that Ituraea and Trachonitis are different regions, and a critical writer discussing geographical matters should not completely ignore their opinions. Thirdly, Clericus seems unaware of what is common knowledge, even to children: that Jerome's interpretation of Ituraea or Trachonitis is the same as Clericus's interpretation. Ituraea also means Trachonitis, and both phrases refer to one region, called either Ituraea or Trachonitis. Fourthly, our critic cannot be trusted, as he ignored that Jerome had excellently expressed the Greek word Hē hundreds of times using the relative pronoun "quae" in the book of Places. For example: column one hundred forty-one: Aman, Hē nyn Philadelphia, Aman, which is now Philadelphia; column one hundred sixty-three: Babel, Hē Babylon, Babel, which is also Babylon; column one hundred eighty-five: Kariathiareim, Hē kai Kariathbaal, Cariathiarim, which is also Cariatbaal; column two hundred three: Eglom, Hē kai Odollam, Eglom, which is also Odollam. Likewise, columns two hundred sixty-eight and two hundred seventy-five: Sopheira, Hē kai Sophir, Sophera, which is also Sophir. Now, let learned and prudent readers decide how much value should be placed on the criticism of John Clericus, where there is no judgment, no faith, no learning—yet these are the duties and responsibilities of authors in this type of writing.

On the Hebrew Learning of Saint Jerome. Having already addressed the Greek challenges presented by Jean Le Clerc, which he used to pave the way for a bolder and freer judgment on Jerome's Hebrew expertise, we'll now show through several notable examples from Jerome's Questions that the author of these questions lacks understanding of the Hebrew language and is a poor critic in his criticisms of the holy Doctor, whose virtue and knowledge shine in the Church of God like a brilliant light. Just as a coin is lost in the wealth of Croesus, so is all of Le Clerc's knowledge and daring judgment overshadowed by false accusations. On the advice of my friends-especially the distinguished Lord de Camgrand, archdeacon of the Church of the Saints, and Lord Bellet, a very studious and learned canon-I ignore the trivial and absurd claims of Le Clerc's Questions of Jerome, as they see them as worthy of laughter and ridicule, not a response from me. Furthermore, the wisest leaders of our Congregation and many of my dear colleagues advise me to focus my time and effort on publishing the works of Saint Jerome, rather than refuting a heretic who endlessly speaks and publishes books. Therefore, I will provide fewer examples, from which a learned and intelligent evaluator can judge the ignorance found in the omitted Questions. Our Critic attempted to prove through these arguments that Jerome lacked expertise in grammar: "These things," he says, "are clearer than the midday sun, and it should have been learned from this that our Benedictine monk could expect nothing exceptional from Jerome in Hebrew grammar. He presents this passage and similar ones to us, so that we may receive from Jerome that which we do not know." It is worth listening to the man reveal the great secret and what has eluded all previous Hebrew grammarians: "The four names listed here by Jerome or Philo," he says, "are read among the Hebrews as written with a diphthong, in this manner: Hiram, Histob, Hira, Hisboseth."

The letters aleph, heth, and ain were not used as consonants by the ancient Hebrews, but as vowels. This is clearly stated in the current annotation by Jerome, which establishes that aleph, heth, and ain form a diphthong with the following jod in the four aforementioned names. Thus, the opinions of some present-day grammarians, who have thought that any diphthong is absent from the Hebrew language and that Hebrew words always begin with a consonant letter, not a vowel, fade away. Firstly, not just some, but all Hebrew grammarians, both ancient and recent, have agreed that no word begins with a vowel, except for a few who are not worth mentioning by name. Secondly, most have also believed that diphthongs exist, except especially among German Jews. For this, see John Buxtorf's "Thesaurus" chapters three and four, and other grammarians. Thirdly, the grammarians' opinion that a Hebrew syllable does not start with a vowel is not just an opinion, but a most certain truth. No one would challenge this unless they were dozing, like Jerome here, and his echo, Martianus. The matter is demonstrated in three words. Every vowel has a certain sound, like A, E, I, O, U, and is not pronounced with those five sounds interchangeably, as aleph, heth, and ain are. This is clearly evident from the proper names in which they appear. Since they are pronounced by the ancient translators in this way, no one should think we rely solely on the authority of the Masoretes. The first list of names that comes to hand will demonstrate the matter, but it will become clear even from the four names mentioned. I ask, if alpha is a vowel, which of the five vowels is it? Undoubtedly A. Therefore, it should be read as Aistob and Aisboseth, not Histob and Hisboseth, without a diphthong, or Eistob and Eisboseth. Then, what vowels were Hheth and Hain? Was the former the Greek eta and the latter O? How do they form a diphthong for us here if we believe Jerome, like the Greek EI? It should have been written as Ηιραμ and Οιρα, which neither the Septuagint translators, who knew the pronunciation of those names well, nor even Jerome himself did.

Do three vowels joined with a J create a single diphthong? It's hard to believe anyone would think so. What can we conclude from this? Neither the Bethlehemite nor the Parisian Monk, whom I wouldn't compare, should mislead Martianaeus. They haven't paid enough attention to their words. If they had written more carefully, they wouldn't have been more inclined to claim that Aleph, Heth, and Hain are vowels forming diphthongs among the Hebrews than to say that H is a vowel in Latin. I almost forgot about Martianaeus, who, to support this idea about vowels starting words among the Hebrews, uses an example from the Arabs. They pronounce Vau, which begins many words, as W, which the French express as ou, like ouaheb, which Arabs pronounce as Waheb, while modern Hebrew grammarians write it as vaheb. But he should have known that no Arab considers Vau a consonant, just like the European peoples who use the letter W, since that letter alone has no sound and must be paired with a vowel in both European languages and Arabic. If Martianaeus still chooses to impulsively favor the ideas put forth by the drowsy Jerome over the clear usage and certain analogy of the Hebrew language, that's his decision. Let him indulge in his dreams and continue to admire Jerome, who greatly depends on our tolerance. We will never feel ashamed for not pleasing such a person. Question 4, page 85 and following. I apologize to all the scholars for detailing so many foolish and overused grammatical arguments of our quibbler; I was compelled by necessity to do this, to respond to a fool according to his folly, lest he should appear wise in his own eyes. Nor let John Clericus, son of Apollo, parent of the Muses, avenger of literary freedom, laugh at us as if we were asleep, yawning, dreaming, or hoarse. But let's now revisit the entire passage of Jerome and the untouched integrity of our annotation here, so it's clearer than daylight, the incompetence, wickedness, and perversity of Clericus's opinions, who aims to tarnish a pure vessel in all respects.

Here's the context of Jerome for us: Hiram, living on high. Histob, a good man. Hiras, watchful. Ishbosheth, a man of confusion.

Therefore, We Have Placed These Names with Aspiration: Because Among the Greeks and Among the Hebrews They Are Written with a Diphthong

Our commentary: The four names listed here by Jerome or Philo are pronounced among the Hebrews with a diphthong: Hiram, Histob, Hira, and Hisboseth. However, the letters Aleph, Heth, and Ain were not used as consonants by the ancient Hebrews but as vowels, as Jerome's current annotation clearly indicates. This shows that Aleph, Heth, and Ain form a diphthong with the following Jod in the four Hebrew names mentioned. This counters the views of certain modern grammarians who believed that diphthongs were absent from the Hebrew language and that Hebrew words always started with a consonant, not a vowel. Now, regarding the Greek diphthongs of the four names listed above, it's not easy to see this, as Jerome attests, except perhaps in the name Hiram, which is read among the Greeks as Cheiram. The other names are read in Greek without diphthongs: Iebosthe, Istōb, Iras. However, upon careful examination of the Septuagint interpreters, we find that the name Hisboseth was written with a diphthong in the Alexandrian manuscript of Second Samuel 2:10, Eiebosthai. From this, it's clear enough that the other Hebrew names were similarly written with the diphthong Ei in ancient Greek; this is further confirmed by the name Jabes, which is generally written Iabis, and in the same manuscript, it is written with the diphthong Eiabeis. Finally, it is known to scholars that the vowel I and the diphthong Ei were used interchangeably among both the Greeks and the Latins; thus, Istōb and Eistōb, Iras and Eiras were written interchangeably. All this was mumbled by a yawning and drowsy Jerome, and his echo, Martianaeus, whose muttered words are seen as dreams by Clericus, whom we can hardly doubt engaged in a contest with Apollo regarding the Tripod, if we believe him who boasts and displays himself magnificently. But indeed, I catch him dreaming when he claims he brings an example from the Arabs to support what he calls my fiction from the initial Vau.

He refers to my notes on the diphthongs mentioned by Jerome in Hebrew, and if I happen to bring up the letter vau, I admit it might seem like I'm dreaming. Otherwise, let's understand and explore that our Cleric fills his mind with illusions and insults. Let's cautiously and gradually discuss everything, revisiting the challenging parts one by one, so we can closely examine the one who snores in deep slumber. Not just a few, he claims, but nearly all, except for a few, Hebrew grammarians, both ancient and recent, have believed that no word starts with a vowel. Certainly, there are a few exceptions, but only some remain-not many, nor all. Still, the number of grammarians is small, not endless, unlike that of fools and critics; so I rightly and fittingly pointed out when I referred to some. Moreover, I've read few Hebrew grammarians, and among the books of this kind I've reviewed, I should mention some, lest with the Cleric, I pretend to know what I do not know at all. Not most, but all believed that diphthongs exist, since our Latin authors of Hebrew grammatical works don't teach us about diphthongs. See Bellarmine, Mair, our Thomas Dufour, Pagninus, and others. The opinion of grammarians about syllables not starting with a vowel is so far from the truth that the opposite is more evident and true among all rational people, not swayed by Rabbinic frenzy. Our Hieronymian opinion is clearly shown by the proper names of men, regions, and mountains in the Septuagint, as followed by Origen and other Greek writers in the Lexicons of Hebrew Names. The first ancient index of names will show the Cleric is mistaken, believing that the vowel Aleph should always be read as A, when it is often read as I, E, O, or U. How Aleph, Heth, and Ain formed a diphthong among the Ancients is sufficiently explained in our notes, which no one has disputed except a sleeping and snoring critical Cleric.

It becomes clear from this that our esteemed soldier is open to criticism when he compares himself to Jerome in Hebrew grammar. Now, let's consider, as the critic suggests, the construction of nouns, which follows two main rules: the adjective must agree with the noun in gender, and it typically follows the noun. It's also commonly accepted that ordinal numeral names form the feminine with "ith", except for the first. For example, from "hhamesch", meaning five, we get "hhamischi", fifth, and "hhamischith", fifth (feminine). If Martianaeus is unaware of this, he should consult John Buxtorf's Thesaurus, book 2, chapter 1, and Thomas Erpenius's Grammar, book 3, chapter 7. This matter is so well-established that attempting to prove it now would be redundant. However, according to Martianaeus's manuscripts, Jerome believed the fifth generation could be expressed in Hebrew as "hhamischa dor", when "vos" is masculine, and it should be "dor hhamischi", as the concordances will show if needed. Jerome writes in his letter to Damasus: If it were the fifth generation, it would be said in their language as "AMESA DOR". The editor noted in the margin "hhamischa dor". This is akin to saying "fifth year" in Latin, or something even less accurate. The Amerbach brothers, who included Hebrew characters in Erasmus' editions, published this passage according to Hebrew grammar rules. But Martianaeus criticizes them, stating: This passage is corrupted in previously published books; instead of "amesa dor", as Jerome wrote, they altered the gender and order, reading "dor amisi" in the masculine gender, contrary to all manuscript copies of the letter to Damasus. They tried to align with Jerome's interpretation, which Martianaeus rashly reveals; had he properly examined the manuscripts, it would show that Jerome allowed a triple error, which, if made by students in a Latin class, would not go unpunished. However, I believe the manuscripts...

The books here contain what Jerome intended to be written, and they are cited in good faith as testimony by Martianay. This is supported by a similar error that comes before it. When discussing the word "hhamuschim," which appears in Exodus 13:18, he says: In the rest of the interpretations, there is no disagreement; the entire debate is about the word "AMUSIM," written with these letters: heth, men, sin, jod, mem, whether it means "five" or "armed." Indeed, we cannot deny that it is said to mean "five" in this language, not "fifth," as they interpreted it. But we strongly deny that it signifies "five": and everyone familiar with the basics of the Hebrew language knows that "hhamesch" indeed means "five," but "hhamischim" means either "fifths" or "fifty." To briefly address the arrogance of our scholar, we advise all present and future students that this adversary of Jerome was so unskilled that, even as an old man, he was ignorant of things that children and infants could have taught him. He criticizes and harshly rebukes Jerome, as if Jerome did not know the construction of names and the gender of the Hebrew word "dor," because he himself did not yet know that the Hebrew name "Amesa" is masculine and not feminine. He writes here with the words expressed and strives to teach against Jerome and our edition, in which I put "AMESA DOR," which is the same with Doctor Cleric as if I were to say in Latin "fifth year," or something worse. Therefore, let this ugliness of barbarism and solecism be far from Jerome, and may it all stick to Cleric, who is ignorant of the construction and the gender of Hebrew names. The second unforgivable error by the same writer, if committed by children in school, would be immense ignorance, where he believes that numerals, called ordinals, always form the feminine with "ith," except for "rischona," meaning "first." All other ordinal feminine names from first to tenth have two forms at the end, "ith," and "iia" or "ija": for example, "scheni," meaning "second," has "schenith" and "schenijach."

If the cleric still doesn't understand, he should read Pagnini's Thesaurus under "schena" and Dufour's grammatical work on page 191. Or, if he needs the authority of the Prophets in grammar, he should read Isaiah, chapter 15, verse 5, and chapter 19, verse 24, where the feminine word "schelischia," meaning third or third year, tertian, is used. This same usage is found in Jeremiah, chapter 48, verse 34. It's surprising to me that a critical writer, with so many books, ignores grammar rules; and that a new interpreter of the Holy Scriptures considers the prophetic style a grammatical error. We find a third example of the Cleric's ignorance in the order of the words "Amesa dor," or as he reads it, "hhamischa dor," which he wanted in the wrong order, unaware that in sacred texts, "ames" and "amesa," or "hhamesch," and "hhamischa" precede the noun. For instance, in Genesis, chapter 5, verse 6, "And Seth lived for five years," and Genesis chapter 47, verse 2, "He took five men." He should learn that ordinal names of masculine form in "I" follow their noun, like "jom hhamischi," meaning the fifth day; while other masculine numerals with a feminine ending precede their noun. For example, Leviticus chapter 23, verse 6, "and on the fifteenth day." See also Numbers, chapter 28, verse 17, and chapter 29, verse 12. These are clear errors of ignorance, which don't allow the teacher Cleric to escape criticism. But what can I say about the same dishonest praiser and supporter of the false editors of Jerome? He praises the Amerbachs for setting "dor hhamischi" according to Hebrew grammar rules and removing Jerome's words "Amesa dor," to protect the reputation of the holy Doctor. Yet, he calls Martianaeum imprudent for faithfully restoring the genuine words in the letter to Damasus.

Although falsehoods bring no rewards and have little strength, why does he glorify deceivers and give so much power to unjust corruption, yet not uniquely appreciate a true editor? Want to know why? He doesn't praise the honest faith in writings because he himself is not sincere; instead, his heart is entirely made up of deceit and falsehood. He is a false Christian, a false interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, a false writer of critical art, a false advocate for the freedom of minds, a false editor of many volumes. He's nothing but a sycophant critic and an extremely ignorant cleric. I can prove this from his own subsequent words: Yet, I believe, and so on, he denies by his own insistence that Amusim signifies five, because he quotes a mutilated and distorted sentence of Jerome like this: And indeed we cannot deny that five is said in this speech, not fifth, as they interpreted it, singular. Jerome did not say this; nor is such a thing published by us. The true sentence of Jerome is this: And indeed we cannot deny that five is said in this speech: truly in the plural number, not fifth, as they interpreted it singularly. Therefore, AMUSIM, whatever points it is affected by, signifies five in the plural number, meaning groups of five, fives, fifths, and fifty, as the imprudent Cleric admits, affirming what he previously denied, teaching what he had corrupted. After our Cleric has twisted his own weapons of ignorance, he seeks help from others against Jerome with this preface: Lest I appear to be the only one to think this way about Jerome's grammatical learning, I will bring forth some relevant things from the Biblical Exercises of John Morin; which he indeed wrote with another purpose, but they no less confirm our opinion, although we do not approve of everything he has.

Morinus presents seven or even eight observations in succession. He rejects two of them as false, and he explains why he discards the first one in this way: "Morinus explains this at length, but he is mistaken because the word hic, which the Amerbachs wrongly inserted, should have been replaced with Eloe, which Jerome read, as John Drusius correctly observed and was later noted by John Martianaeus." At the end of all Morinus' observations, John Clericus adds: "These points, stated by a most learned man, are known to be absolutely true by those who have read Jerome's works or have carefully compared his translation with the Hebrew text. Yet, Martianaeus did not even attempt to refute them, just as he ignored similar arguments." But Clericus, you are a man with an exceptionally generous sense of humor! I did not want to provoke laughter among the learned by attempting to refute Morinus' observations. After all, who could keep a straight face upon hearing that Morinus accused Jerome of failing to distinguish between the absolute and construct state of Hebrew nouns? He claims that in Micah 5:4, Jerome translated nasiche adam as "the chief men" instead of "the chiefs of men." But how could the holy Doctor have read nasiche adam or nesiche adam without distinguishing between the absolute and construct forms? Let Clericus answer whether he thinks nesiche is an absolute form. If he admits it is construct, then Jerome clearly distinguished the construct form from the absolute form nesichim. And if the Latin translation does not strictly preserve the construct form; rendering it as "the chief men" instead of "the chiefs of men" Morinus and Clericus should not blame Jerome for this but rather recognize that Latin preserves its own euphony in translation. Let them then accuse Aquila as well and declare him ignorant of Hebrew grammar, since he, like Jerome, did not distinguish between the absolute and construct form, translating it as "appointed men" instead of "appointed of men." Observations like these are trivial and unworthy of a truly learned man. Clericus would have ignored them, just as I did, if he were not consumed by envy and hatred, always seeking to diminish Jerome’s works in every way possible.

If he's not embarrassed by his own ignorance due to Morinus's grammatical quibbles, which slightly undermine Jerome's scholarship, he should at least feel ashamed when hearing the most learned among his own writers, particularly the heterodox, praising Jerome's scholarship. They had access to modern dictionaries and numerous Hebrew grammars, yet they weren't so foolish as to consider themselves superior to Jerome in matters of Hebrew. Those learned Protestant teachers understood that every generation inherits knowledge from its ancestors, and whatever is found in dictionaries or grammars has been received and borrowed from ancient Jews and interpreters, not invented and spread by modern writers. Now, let's listen to those who commend Jerome as a translator. From the critical notes of Louis Cappel on the Book of Esther, page 570, new edition: Since it's certain that the titles belong to Jerome, for what purpose or intention would excerpts from another translation be placed under them? Thirdly, if you compare the Latin translation of these excerpts with the Greek, you'll find Jerome's judgment, talent, scholarship, and his learned and honest freedom in translating. Thus, the purity, elegance, and style of expression are consistent with the rest of the book. These excerpts weren't translated barbarously or crudely word for word from the Greek. Instead, Jerome faithfully conveyed the sense of the Greek text, as much as possible, while maintaining the phrasing, elegance, and purity of the Latin language. From the Prolegomena 10 by Brian Walton: We therefore conclude that the authority of the Vulgate is no different from other versions that faithfully render the original texts, and what the more celebrated Roman Church scholars have written about it and its authority can be applied to other versions as well.

Although we might not see it as divine, it should still be highly respected and not hastily criticized. This is due to its antiquity and its widespread use throughout the West for a thousand years, as well as the scholarship and faithfulness of its translator, Jerome. Many Protestant scholars openly acknowledge that he has served the Church well. A learned man once remarked that he never doubted the Christian Church owes much to its author for making the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, originally written in a foreign language, accessible to Latin speakers. In fact, Theodore Beza, in the Preface to the New Testament in 1559, claims it should be preferred over all other Latin versions and criticizes Erasmus for rejecting the old translator just because it differed from modern Greek manuscripts, arguing it followed a more accurate example. Thus, Beza defends the Vulgate against Erasmus, while the very learned John Boys defends Erasmus against Beza's often unfair criticisms with a comprehensive volume. Paul Fagius, in chapter four of his Latin version of the Chaldean Paraphrase, discusses those who dismiss, condemn, and reject the Vulgate because it doesn't align word for word with the Hebrew text in all respects. They overlook whose guidance or example the Vulgate author followed, as it almost always seems to align with the Septuagint, the Chaldean paraphrase, or one of the Rabbis when it differs from the Hebrew text. Therefore, the Vulgate edition did not come about by chance, as some uninformed and imprudent people foolishly claim. Ludovicus de Dieu, noted for his knowledge of languages, in his notes on the Gospels, where he compares the Syriac, Arabic, and other versions with the Vulgate and Erasmus, but especially with Beza's versions, writes in the preface about the Author of the Vulgate: If I were to claim that the Vulgate translator, whoever he may have been, was a learned, indeed a most learned man, I would not consider myself mistaken; I acknowledge it has its flaws and roughness, but I cannot deny my admiration for its faith and judgment throughout, even where it seems awkward.

From this point, there's a preference for the Vulgate over other readings, often defending it against critics like Beza. In the preface to his annotations on the Old Testament, the renowned Grotius explains why he bases his notes on the Vulgate, almost treating it as the primary text. He mentions that he has always held the Vulgate interpreter in high regard, not just because it contains no harmful doctrines, but also because it is rich in learning, despite its somewhat rough style of expression. These testimonies clearly show that the most learned Protestants, although they don't give the Vulgate the highest authority or claim it's free from all error, do not look down on it. Instead, they honor it for the reasons we've already discussed. Up to this point, this includes Brian Walton, known for being a knowledgeable and prudent man. So, let the Cleric, along with the unskilled and shallow, continue to foolishly and imprudently criticize and reject the Vulgate interpreter, Jerome, and his translation. For me, it's enough to admire, praise, and defend the judgment, faith, talent, and learning of Jerome alongside the most learned writers from all ages.

Chapter Two

On the Sincerity and Usefulness of the New Edition of the Works of Saint Jerome, and on the Ignorance and Malevolence in the Jerome Questions by Jean Le Clerc. Recently, several works by Jean Le Clerc, both critical and miscellaneous, have come to light. These works often contain discussions that are insulting to scholars and burdensome to wise readers. Early in this century, the same author's Jerome Questions were published. In these, he unleashed all his malice, anger, and hatred against us and our new edition of Saint Jerome. Unlike other critics, Clerc did not just want to criticize the specifics or letters of our edition. Instead, he aimed to completely overthrow it and, if possible, erase the memory of the author from history. The extent to which he sought to trouble the Martian with his works is evident from the warning prefixed to the Jerome Questions. In this, he hoped to incite the envy of all scholars, even stirring singular hatred among my dearest colleagues against me. He even went so far as to flatter, invoking the wisdom and authority of my superiors, so that I might ultimately be prohibited from working on the Jerome edition. If Clerc had gained their assent, I would have been the most miserable of editors and writers of this time. As I ponder the cause of such intense anger, I suspect it is simply my defense of Jerome and the tribute I have paid to his learning. This is not a wild guess, as Clerc himself agrees with me, beginning his Question 7 by saying: "We have already said that we would have had no controversy with Martian if he had given moderate praise to Jerome." Therefore, the root of this is that I have exalted Jerome with praises and defended his works against Clerc's reproaches. But let's hear the accuser himself present the arguments of my supposed crime.

Hello to the reader, this is John Clericus. The diligence and scholarship of the Benedictine monks from the Congregation of Saint Maur have been widely praised for their excellent editions of several Latin and Greek Church Fathers in France. People have hoped they would continue to enrich our libraries with their beautiful work. Everyone appreciated that these Fathers were presented with prefaces and notes that were respectful to modern scholars. This was the case until John Martianaeus, who did not follow the fairness and wisdom of his peers, began publishing Jerome, and in his introductions and notes, he attacked the reputation of respected scholars dedicated to the Roman Church, not even sparing his fellow Benedictines and those who had left the Church. Then, almost everyone, both experts and laypeople, criticized the harshness unjustly aimed at learned individuals. He was so pleased by this reaction that he restored the insulting words cut from the first volume's prolegomena, apparently by the order of the learned society's leaders, a few years later in the second volume, with his anger still unappeased. I've heard this displeased them greatly. As for me, who was specifically and sharply targeted in multiple instances, I began to consider what new insights this edition offered and realized that he did not think about his limitations. In this small work, I wanted to warn both the literary community and the Benedictine order to protect their reputation from being tarnished by allowing such a person to defile Jerome's writings with insulting and poorly informed assumptions. In the same effort, I discussed many aspects of Jerome himself, making it clear that those who dismiss modern critics compared to him are making a mistake. If this helps to boost interest in good and sacred literature, it will give me great joy. I certainly wrote with that intention. If not, at least I will never regret having this mindset. Farewell.

Our cleric did not want to dive into his critique of Martianus without a preparatory prayer. He deeply regrets that the editor was Jerome, who was notoriously harsh with heretics and often clashed with the most holy doctor. Setting aside matters irrelevant to the cleric or the literary community, which he mentions without malice but to highlight pressure on his constraints, let's delve deeper into his personal grievances. He states, "I, who was sharply named in criticism, admit, Cleric, I did not intend to be more considerate than you were when you criticized Jerome in multiple instances." "Your critique of my harsh words is ironic because I drew them from your Mosaic Pentateuch, as noted in my annotations, which you dismiss as poorly learned because they reveal your lack of skill." "Therefore, refer to my commentary on the Book of Hebrew Names, volume 2 of our edition, where similar remarks about you are recorded." "This clearly shows, I argue, how different Jerome's diligence, intellect, and commitment to sacred matters were compared to current critics." "However, when I state this, critics label me envious or tarnish my reputation as a harsh writer, as if the fault changes depending on the person; what is allowed for the Cleric against Jerome seems not allowed for me in defense of Jerome against the Cleric, who supports new ideas and doctrines." In response to this accusation, if it ever arises, I have nothing to counter in this defense except the words of the holy doctor, for whom I undertook this: 'Truth,' he says, 'is bitter, with a stern face, and it offends those corrected.' 'Let truth and sincerity be in us, and bitterness will follow.' 'So he states in book 1 against the Pelagians.' Thus arise my supposedly insulting and poorly learned notes and assumptions, which you claim have tarnished Jerome's writings; hence the harshness that the Cleric and his followers complain about. But if truth is so bitter for those corrected, how much more will it be in the lies and insults of John the Cleric?

Falsehood has always been more bitter to me than gall itself, and more intolerable than any bitterness. Yet, this is often prevalent in our critic, and I don't know any other writer who delights in so many and such great lies. He says, 'I began to examine what new things this edition brought, and I noticed that the man had not considered what his shoulders could bear or refuse.' But how can you claim to have examined my edition when you haven't even read the preface of volume one? Or if you did read it while examining, why do you pretend that I didn't consider what my shoulders could bear or refuse? So, take a closer look and weigh the words of my preface: 'For us, who undertook to make available the divine library of Saint Jerome, previously unpublished, for public benefit, there are so many and great moments of utmost importance pressing upon us that the weight of the work imposes such a burden that we must fall under it before we can lift it. For who would not be afraid, etc.' Now, see how many lies are present right at the start of your Hieronymian Questions, since it's clear I considered what my shoulders could bear. Yet, you neither noticed this nor examined it, even though you don't hesitate to falsely impose this on the reader. But now, indeed, consider what I said, not about you, but about the wise and fair reader: 'But we hold this great hope with the fair reader; namely, that forgiveness will be more readily granted to us if, in matters naturally more obscure and not yet attempted by anyone, we have not entirely satisfied his desire; or certainly if something slipped by us while writing that would not have escaped the more observant and diligent.' Provoked primarily by this expectation, we release certain Prolegomena, etc. I prefaced these and similar things for the sake of fairness and goodness, hoping you might forgive my faults, if I could have obtained anything fair or good from John Clericus. Indeed, I had no hope of obtaining pardon from the unskilled, because I had long heard that you were too irritable with critics and fierce against every adversary.

Let's continue, as mentioned in the latter part of our introduction, to demonstrate that the critic of the new edition is deceitful and ignorant. When examining what this edition offers, aside from my own recklessness and uneducated assumptions, he found nothing noteworthy to alert the entire literary community and the Benedictine order. But first, let's revisit our introduction with a reminder from John Clericus: because the antidote should come before the poison. We are indeed aware of what our edition presents, and we generally inform both the literary community and the Benedictine order with these words: Driven by this expectation, we release the Prolegomena to illuminate this divine Library of Saint Jerome, which, having been closed and unknown until our time, will reveal many insights. It will correct errors in writings and books and enrich the Church of Christ with the sacred volumes translated into Latin by Eusebius Jerome from both Greek and Hebrew. Our Clericus considers such gifts worthless because he can only focus on my recklessness and the bitterness directed at him. However, despite the many insults he has leveled at me, ultimately overwhelmed by the truth, he was compelled to write this in Question Nine, page 291: "I cannot but praise the plan of Martianaeus for publishing the versions of Jerome as they appear in the oldest books, without the changes made later, and in the order in which they are found in those same books, not omitting the ancient distinctions seen in them." For we seem to witness these versions as they came from Jerome's hand, or at least as unchanged as possible. Here we have a confessing defendant, who must be addressed so that he may finally be exiled from the sacred literary community and even become distasteful to his own work, the ignorant book of Jerome's Questions.

Unique. On the notable lack of knowledge in John Clericus's first question. John Clericus wraps up the entire first question about Jerome by criticizing my scholarship. He claims that Martianaeus lacked the necessary proficiency in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew to successfully edit Jerome. The following responses will reveal how far he strayed from his goal. He couldn't back up his claims with arguments. Instead, he proved himself unfit to judge our new edition, yet quite capable of displaying his own bitterness and ignorance. He returns insults instead of gratitude for good deeds, mistranslating what I have accurately explained in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew to ridicule me. He introduces the first question with this kind of title and heading: "What is required of someone who undertakes to publish and elucidate Jerome?" To which he adds: "To address this question, above all, two types of assistance must be distinguished, which anyone who wishes to publish and elucidate Jerome commendably must possess." The first should be called external, consisting of an abundance of manuscript books, with which older editions are compared and examined. John Martianaeus, who began publishing the Works of Jerome in Paris, with the first volume appearing in 1693, claims everywhere that he was excellently equipped in this regard. In this matter, I don't wish to question his credibility. However, I don't intend to discuss this type of assistance here, as I cannot visit the libraries where those manuscript books of Jerome are kept.

There are six key points to consider regarding the internal support required for this task. Firstly, the editor of these works should be someone who loves the truth, not just a fan of Jerome. Secondly, they should be well-versed in Latin and experienced in reading ancient texts to fully understand the author. Thirdly, they need to know Greek, so they can comprehend the Greek elements in Jerome's works and compare them with the original Greek texts if needed. Fourthly, they should be familiar with Hebrew, as this knowledge is crucial to accurately assess Jerome's numerous references to it. Fifthly, they must diligently compare his translations, the Septuagint, and other Greek fragments with the Hebrew text. Lastly, they should be experienced in handling manuscripts and be skilled in the duties of a seasoned critic through extensive practice. If an editor of Jerome's works is a Benedictine monk with these six qualities and uses them effectively, future readers will have plenty of reason to be grateful for the republication of his works. However, if they lack these qualities, not even the entire Benedictine order, despite having many learned members, can stop scholars from lamenting the presence of so many manuscripts with someone who doesn't know how to use them properly. Criticism will be directed at the order's leaders for not assigning the task of editing Jerome to someone more skilled. Clerics unanimously agree on the necessity of these six qualities for an editor of Saint Jerome's works. The critic of a new edition should possess these qualities just as much as the editor. If our critic lacks these aids, it will be clear to all scholars that the editor was not Martianay, but rather an inexperienced cleric critiquing his edition. These points don't require extensive discussion, as a few examples will suffice for each section.

The Cleric is so caught up and inexperienced in acting as an expert critic that he can't distinguish between external and internal help in this situation. He mistakenly refers to external help when he should be talking about the main and internal support in editing the works of Saint Jerome, specifically the abundance of manuscript codices, which a skilled editor must compare with published books or older editions. Who doesn't know that for restoring ancient books and documents, the primary and almost inherent help comes from the authority and reliability of the oldest manuscript codices? The editor's expertise is needed but is an external and less critical aid. I want to persuade our Cleric that true restoration of old books can often only be achieved by comparing manuscript codices with published books, something that the entire group of critics couldn't accomplish through conjecture without such fundamental help. Therefore, the Cleric should learn from Jerome's editor what is internal and what is external help for restoring the ancient Writer. It's a common flaw, says the Critic, for those who try to publish ancient writers to praise them excessively, so that they convince the reader they've undertaken a highly valuable task and thus deserve gratitude. He later acknowledges that not only ordinary people but even the distinguished Desiderius Erasmus preceded the Benedictine monk in giving excessive praise to Jerome. If it's common among editors who don't care for truth and fairness to overpraise the writers they publish, it's even more common among rivals and slanderers to detract from the praises of writers whose wisdom they do not appreciate. But this is a flawed and unclear argument from the Cleric, whom I've shown elsewhere to have heaped excessive insults on Jerome, while I haven't yet added praises equal to his virtues.

But let's return to the specific points and hear what John Clericus has to say about Martianay. He notes that one of the merits of the editor of Jerome's works, if one looks for it in Martianay's style, is his expert knowledge of the Latin language. It's easy to see that Martianay was not very experienced in reading the works of ancient writers; his speech, full of barbarisms, clearly shows a lack of appreciation for the finer aspects of the Latin language. He doesn't even imitate Jerome effectively, except in aspects that should be avoided, much like how students often imitate their teachers' faults rather than their virtues. These issues are so evident that they become immediately apparent to anyone who reads Martianay's Prolegomena, Commentaries, and Notes, provided they have some familiarity with the Latin language. However, one might argue that writings of this nature don't require elegance or purity of speech by the standards of the Augustan age. I don't deny this, but no one would claim that barbarism is acceptable or appealing, especially when the topics discussed can only be expressed in ecclesiastical terms. Moreover, you can't say that Martianay has rejected a more elegant style in favor of clarity; as soon as you read any page, it's clear that he tries hard to imitate, if not Cicero, then at least Jerome, but without success. What you read resembles the style of the Breviary, with Jerome's expressions awkwardly inserted into the text, yet in that structure, there's much more clay than marble. Additionally, you notice the unfortunate critic throughout, which isn't necessary for understanding the Latin language. Completing an entire chapter of critical discussion without any arguments or examples isn't the work of an expert critic, but rather of a rambling and foolish scold. A general and vague discussion about my lack of knowledge of the Latin language is clever gossip for the spiteful, not a demonstration of barbaric speech or Breviary style.

I could have exercised my rights and completely ignored these baseless accusations from a traitorous spirit, which only seem plausible through loud assertions. However, let's consider the Cleric among those who are not skilled in Latin, and let's highlight some examples of his speech filled with errors. The foolish Critic mocks us in question ten, on pages three hundred and fifty and three hundred and fifty-one, trying to ridicule my use of Latin with these words: "Who wouldn't want to support that excellent Scholar who silences such people? For I don't know what it means to silence the tongue unless, perhaps, our Benedictine, when he speaks, is accustomed to letting his tongue out of his mouth and then retracting it within his lips when he is silent." But, leaving aside the joke, which doesn't fit the seriousness of the situation, let's hear the rest: The clownish humor of our proud soldier shows a great ignorance of the Latin language. He doesn't understand what it means to silence the tongue; and while he makes much ado about nothing, he admits he hasn't read Plautus, whose words in "The Braggart Soldier," act three, scene ten, are: "Certainly, if your enemies discover your plan, They silence your tongue and bind your hands with your own plan, And they do to you what you wanted to do to them." This is my speech filled with errors, this is the style of my Plautine Breviary, oh Cleric, who has stumbled into a malicious joke while providing an opportunity to highlight your ignorance and my refined diligence in Latin. For if the Muses spoke Latin, they would speak in the language of Plautus. Therefore, whether you like it or not, it is now clear that Martianaeus, your esteemed figure, is more versed in the reading of ancient writers than the Cleric, who is both the enemy and critic of Martianaeus. He provides another example of his ignorance in the same question ten, page three hundred and eighty, when he says: "Chapter eleven, verse twenty-eight, of Numbers, thus the Latin Interpreter, after narrating the inspiration of Eldad and Medad, introduces Joshua speaking: 'My lord, Moses, forbid them.' An anonymous Scholar has in the margin: 'Expel them.' About which note Martianaeus comments: In Hebrew, 'chelaem,' which the Chaldean translates as 'esarinun,' etc."

Therefore, there's nothing stopping us from concluding that this Scholion is genuinely by Jerome. The word recludere, meaning "to close," should have indicated to our monk that the Scholion isn't by Jerome. Jerome didn't speak so crudely and knew that recludere, for those speaking more precisely, meant "to open." However, when translating Scripture, Jerome used that word in this way because he didn't correct the crudeness of the older version everywhere. But he wouldn't have used it like that in a Scholion, especially since it more often means "to prohibit" than "to close." I mentioned that this chapter gives us another argument for the cleric's ignorance. By this, I mean an argument that covers many instances and signs of ignorance. Indeed, the ignorance is evident in every sentence of this complex issue. It's clear from what he says that only the word recludere, meaning "to close," should have taught his monk that the Scholion isn't by Jerome. This is because the word recludere, in this sense, is truly Jerome's and particularly his own. This can be proven by examples from older Latin versions and other translations. It clearly shows that our critic lacks judgment when he claims that Jerome would have spoken more precisely in a particular Scholion and note than in the Latin translation of the divine Scriptures. I now make these three types of falsehoods and ignorance evident from the facts themselves. The fact that Jerome used the word recludere, meaning "to close," not only in the translation of Scripture but also in his prefaces and commentaries, is proven by the following testimonies. In the preface to the translation of the Prophet Daniel from Hebrew, Jerome writes: "Finally, even I as a young man, after reading Quintilian and Cicero and rhetorical flowers, when I had confined myself in the mill of this language with much sweat, etc." In the sixth book of his commentaries, in chapter 29 of Jeremiah: "Whose duty is to discern between the prophets, who speak by the Holy Spirit, and who by the contrary: and be ordered to be confined in prison, to pay the penalty for his lies; and to cease deceiving the people further."

And once more, after a brief time: Why did the prophet dare to write the truth, wishing to be confined so he couldn't speak? Then, in chapter 32, it says he was not supposed to be imprisoned, but rather kept at the entrance of the prison. Also, in Book 1 of the Commentary on the prophet Habakkuk, chapter 1: Many nations were weary when Vespasian and Titus surrounded the city with armies. Those coming for the Passover festival were trapped in the city like prisoners and faced death from hunger and deprivation. Let our Cleric now consider whether the phrase 'shut in' should have shown me that the earlier note wasn't from Jerome. If he can feel any scholarly embarrassment, he should be ashamed of his ignorance, being so unskilled in reading ancient texts that he didn't know 'shut in' was also used by Justin in Book 1. Orthanes, he said, sends messengers to his daughter, among the royal concubines, to ask if the son of King Cyrus was the king. But she neither knew nor could find out from others, as they were all kept separately. Due to ignorance, there is a significant and reckless falsehood in the Cleric's claim that Jerome, in his Scripture version, used 'shut in' to mean enclosing, because he didn't correct the barbarisms of the older version throughout. Yet, how does our Critic dare to claim that the supposed barbarism of 'shut in' was left uncorrected in the ancient Latin version from another older translation, when he had no copy of this older version to reference? What I have stated is minor; he was so deceitful and unskilled that he never bothered to compare Jerome's Hebrew version with the older Latin one from the Septuagint. Anyone who has read even just chapter 13 of Leviticus. (Which isn't a strenuous task nor requires much diligence) will quickly realize that 'shut in' is not from the Anonymous Latin Translator, but from St. Jerome's Hebrew translation.

In our version, we use the word *recludet*, while the Septuagint uses the Greek word *aphoriei*, which means "will separate." This occurs in verse four of the chapter just recited, as well as in verses five, eleven, twenty-one, twenty-six, thirty-one, fifty, and fifty-four. The Greek word *aphoriei* cannot be translated into Latin as *recludet* and wasn't used in the older Latin version that Jerome corrected from Greek. Many Latin translators, including Pagninus, Arias Montanus, the Latin Chaldean translator, and sometimes the Latin Syrian, use the word *recludere* with Jerome to mean "closing." If Clericus wants to label all of these people as ignorant of the Latin language, it wouldn't surprise me, as he often refers to the Hebrew Canon's commentator as clumsy and barbarous. Regarding the supposedly barbaric word *recludere*, according to Clericus, it was actually common and used by historian Justin, Jerome, and other interpreters who spoke purely. We can see a third example of this critic's ignorance from the latter part of the previous issue, where he insists that Jerome indeed used the word *recludere* in his version, although he didn't use it in any scholium or marginal note. This shows us the refined judgment of our critic, who desires Latin eloquence in marginal notes but doesn't expect the same in a complete translation. Jerome himself could have taught Clericus how absurd this is, based on the practices of learned men and how it deviates from the duty of the best interpreter, if Clericus had read his works more carefully. Let all students listen, not to a critic without judgment, but to this holy doctor who gives precepts for the Latin version in his letter to Sunnia and Fretela. In the same letter, he says, "In the Valley of Tears," for which you say in Greek it's written *klauthmōnos*, meaning "of weeping." But whether we say "crying," "mourning," "weeping," or "tears," the meaning remains the same.

We follow this principle: where there is no change in meaning, we maintain the elegance of the Latin language. Additionally, in the same letter, we should adhere to the same rule of translation that we've often mentioned, ensuring that where there's no loss in meaning, the euphony and accuracy of the language we're translating into are preserved. If our critic Clericus had followed this guidance, he wouldn't have made absurd or childish mistakes, accusing Jerome of filling his Scripture translation with barbarisms. However, in his notes and annotations, he managed to preserve the elegance of the Latin language. He presents another weak argument against my Latin, which I address here by first noting it appears on pages 379 and 380, before addressing what has already been refuted. I chose to refute the barbarisms of my style before getting caught up in grammatical trivialities. Clericus objects to Cassiodorus's advice on the orthography of ancient books, linking it to his criticism with these words: If our Benedictine monk, or the tedious commentator he initially presented as Jerome, had followed this instruction, neither would have made childish mistakes in the Book of Numbers, Chapter Six, Verse Eight. Jerome had written: "All the days of his separation shall be holy to the Lord." The crude commentator, not recognizing "all" as the accusative case like "days," noted in the margin that in Hebrew it is "all days," as if "all the days" meant something different! The refined monk provides a similar example of his learning, writing at the bottom of the page: Manuscript books read this verse in two or three ways. Many have: "All the days of his separation," etc. Others have: "All the day of his separation," etc. Finally, the royal version reads with the common Latin: "All the days of his separation," etc. Such varying readings are included in the Canon of Hebrew truth. As if these were different readings, when the last one is merely a corruption, while the second and first are exactly the same.

Let the editor of Jerome consult someone who, unlike many clad in Roman purple, has accumulated substantial learning over the years; I mean Henry Noris, in Dissertation 4 on the Pisan Cenotaphs, chapter 3. There, they will learn about the accusative plurals of the third declension, whose genitive plural ends in IUM. These can interchangeably end in ES, EIS, and IS. These are the words of an excessively bold writer, showing us many examples of his lack of knowledge. He considers us dull and barbaric for noting variant readings that genuinely differ in the eighth verse of the sixth chapter of Numbers. To ensure our refutation proceeds logically based on credible sources, let the diligent reader remember my annotations in the divine library of Saint Jerome, especially chapter 1 of Joshua, verse 14: "But you shall go armed before your brothers, all the mighty men of valor," etc. Years ago, I warned the prudent and curious reader about the variety of such readings, noting: The Septuagint reads in the singular, "every man of valor," which the Hebrew truth canon, the royal manuscript of the Bible, and one from Corbie imitate. In manuscripts, it is easy to see how "every man, and mighty" could be written as "all and mighty men," since the ancients often wrote I for E. What I wrote was read seven years before the book QQ. Jerome was published. Thus, this mention is like a reproach to a clerk ungrateful for a benefit. I had taught him both the variant readings of Scripture and the orthography of the ancients, not from the instruction of Cassiodorus, but through daily reading and continual use of the oldest manuscripts. Therefore, he ignorantly and childishly orders us to approach the master clothed in the purple of grammar, although we were already knowledgeable before that master's instruction. What can I say about the variant reading of the verse in Numbers? I am more learned than our comic in the literary republic, who is unaware of the consensus among all editors of sacred scripture.

So, let the critic Clericus look into Brian Walton's Polyglot Bible and Thomas James's Papal War. From these, he'll learn that every day brings various readings. Interestingly, these are often more significant than those collected by Walton from the Alexandrian manuscript. It's important to note that not every variation changes the meaning, as long as it's expressed and explained differently. For example, in the Polyglots, for verse 14 of Genesis chapter 1, the Greek variant reads "for light upon the earth," while the Alexandrian manuscript reads "for light of the earth," or "to illuminate the earth." Also, in chapter 3, verse 9, it says "in the midst of the garden," and the Alexandrian manuscript has "in the middle of the garden," or "in the middle of paradise." Now, let Clericus claim that it's absurd for a commentator and critic to note such various readings in Greek. Or, if he wishes to be reasonable, let him apologize for his rashness, ignorance, and his tendency to criticize other writers. But who wouldn't be surprised at our critic's assertion that "He will be holy to the Lord all the days of his separation" is just a corruption of verse 7 of Numbers chapter 6? There was never any safe faith in John Clericus, and now he proves himself unfaithful to all by boldly claiming that the purest reading is merely a corruption. So, let the wise and religious reader consult this verse of Scripture in the authentic texts, where they will find a wonderful harmony among the sacred context and all the holy interpreters. The Hebrew reads: "He will be holy to the Lord all the days of his Nazarite vow." The Seventy Interpreters (Septuagint) say: "He will be holy to the Lord all the days of his vow." The Chaldean reads: "All the days he is a Nazarite," and so on. The Samaritan text and version say: "All the days of his Nazarite vow," and the Syriac interpreter reads: "He is holy to the Lord all the days of his abstinence," similar to the Arabic.

Finally, the Vulgate, along with others, during all the days of his separation, etc. This harmony of Scripture and all interpreters is called by John Clericus mere corruption. Therefore, the judgment of this matter lies in the eyes of learned men and Christians. If I wanted to retaliate by criticizing the Latin of John Clericus, how much ignorance of this language would I rightly deduce from his works? However, this task has already been addressed by a learned writer, who has gathered a substantial collection of barbarisms and solecisms, or the errors and faults of our critic, from the dust of his Gospel Harmony. Therefore, I suggest John Clericus consult Father Lepineul to refine his taste in the Latin language from the best grammarian. He should do this rather than continue his usual style, which is full of barbarisms. Furthermore, he should ask for forgiveness for the past and particularly inquire about this one thing: whether this Latin phrase, the style of the Breviary Law only, could possibly escape someone speaking purely? He aimed to earn praise for himself with this expression but instead marked Martianaeus with a reputation for ignorance. After the unskilled critic attempted to attack the diligence of my Latin, he also convinced himself that I have no knowledge of Greek, whatever it may be in me, and tries to persuade everyone with the following sequence of words: Thirdly, in editing Jerome, help must be sought from the Greek language, from which he sprinkled many things throughout, and also translated many things. But these cannot be understood well enough, nor can a critical mark be placed where necessary, unless by someone so skilled in that language that he does not need the help of a lexicon from time to time. Those who translated anti phoinikon ta baia syrousi as "in front of palms they drag branches of palm" seem certainly not to have attained this skill in the language, as we noted in passing in the Art of Criticism, part 3, section 1, chapter 13, number 25. But we will also bring to light many other clearer indications of the matter in the future.

Indeed, Jerome himself, as we will demonstrate when we address that question, was not proficient in the Greek language. His mistakes can only be detected by someone more skilled, which is something his translator must do. Occasionally, in some obvious errors, to be transparent, this was done by Martianay, but it should have been done much more frequently. The knowledge of both Latin and Greek languages and familiarity with the best writers, which we believe should be required from the editor and commentator of Jerome, constitutes the philological learning that Erasmus deemed absolutely necessary. Therefore, he rightly felt he should excuse himself for having attempted to illuminate Jerome's letters for the first time without sufficient preparation in the humanities. These are things Martianay should have carefully considered; for although Jerome received countless revisions through the efforts of Erasmus, not to mention Mariano Vittori, since he undertook to compare the work of both with ancient manuscripts and to judge both, he should have been equipped with critical scholarship not much less than Erasmus. This, I think, very few would believe, who have read the prefaces, commentaries, and notes of the man. Clericus presents no example of my ignorance here, except for the Greek words *anti phoinikon*, etc., which do not seem to him adequately interpreted. About which he again warns us in Question 9, page 318. A little later, he says, Martianay notes that these Greek words were inserted into the words of Jerome, anti phoinikon ta baia syrousi, which he translates very absurdly as "they drag palm branches before palms," when they should have been translated as "for dates they drag palm branches," as we showed long ago in "Art of Criticism" part III, section I, chapter 13. I could hardly have known what that "Art of Criticism" by the exacting Reciter Clericus was, unless I had read the Paris Journal of Literature a few months ago, and in it, the dissertation of Mr. Carel, who discusses the Greek words in manuscripts.

One of our colleagues is attempting to restore it, but he's relying solely on his own guesses, rather than the trust and authority of ancient texts. In the French Journal, Mr. Carel comments on the rather absurd translation of Greek words in the Critical Art of Clericus: We agree with Mr. le Clerc that the Greek word phoinix refers to both the palm tree and its fruit, dates. However, the verb syrein does not mean to pluck or pick, as Mr. le Clerc translates it, but rather to drag. Furthermore, the continuation of Saint Jerome's speech does not support the meaning Mr. le Clerc assigns to these words. Saint Jerome is trying to discourage his friend Sophronius from translating his Latin version of the Psalms into Greek for the Greeks, as it would be pointless; it would be like carrying wood to the forest, in silvam ligna ferre, since the Greeks already have several versions that they hold in high regard. Essentially, as Saint Jerome puts it, it would expose my ignorance to the scholars of this nation by providing them a means to compare my version with those they already possess, Et doctissimos quoque viros testes imperitiae meae facere volueris. Therefore, Saint Jerome cannot at this point compare his version to fruits and the Greeks' versions to barren branches; that would contradict his intended message. If I had written about the Critical Art of John Clericus, not all scholars, particularly my rivals, would have instantly agreed with my statements. But who wouldn't trust a learned individual who has thoroughly examined and assessed the Greek words and Clericus's translation of them? It is evident from this observation that John Clericus lacks understanding of the Greek language, as he incorrectly interpreted the word syrein to mean pluck and pick.

It becomes clear to us, evident from Lord Carel's observation, that there is such a blindness of mind in Clerico. Not only does he interpret the words in Jerome's writings absurdly, but he also makes Jerome himself appear ridiculously inconsistent. Now, let's address the objection from our critic, who wanted to label me as ignorant and foolish in interpreting these Greek words. The judgment of this matter should be based on my annotations, not from an inexperienced writer holding a grudge. Here, then, is the context of Jerome's preface to his Sophronius, volume one, pages 837 and 838:
