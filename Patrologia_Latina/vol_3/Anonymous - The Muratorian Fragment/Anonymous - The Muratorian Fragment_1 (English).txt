The Muratorian Fragment is one of the earliest known lists of New Testament books, discovered by Ludovico Antonio Muratori in the 18th century.

Found in a manuscript at the Ambrosian Library in Milan, this ancient text likely dates from the late 2nd or early 3rd century CE.

Muratori described the manuscript as nearly a thousand years old, written in large, square letters.

Despite some errors in copying, he recognized its importance, hoping it would be well-received due to its "highly venerable antiquity."

Scholars have debated the fragment's authorship, with some attributing it to Caius, a Roman presbyter from the late 2nd century.

While this remains uncertain, most agree on its antiquity and importance in understanding the early development of the New Testament canon.

The fragment discusses various books now in the New Testament, omits some, and includes others not in the current canon.

It also mentions some non-canonical works, accepting some for private reading while rejecting others.

Despite some textual issues and scholarly debates, the Muratorian Fragment remains a key document in the study of early Christianity and the formation of the New Testament canon.
