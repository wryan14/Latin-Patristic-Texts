However, even if no one feels adequate, no sinner should stop praising, even if they can't fully express their feelings.</p>\n    \n    <p>That's why the divine word, when talking about the sinner in the Psalms, says: \"The sacrifice of praise will honor me,\" and then immediately adds, \"and there is the way by which I will show him the salvation of God\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> Psalm 50:23. It's as if it clearly says, \"There is the path of praise leading to eternal praise, but no one will grasp it unless I show them the way.\"</p>\n    \n    <p>So, dearest ones, because the path of our salvation is in the praises of the Savior, I urge and remind you on this holy feast of the Mother of God, Mary, not to stop praising.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you are a virgin, rejoice because you have deserved to be what you praise: just strive to be worthy of giving praise. If you are chaste and pure, honor and praise, for it is by the grace of Christ, which was fully in Mary whom you praise, that you can be chaste.</p>\n    \n    <p>If you are married or a sinner, still confess and praise, because mercy and grace have flowed to all from there so that they may praise. And although praise from the mouth of a sinner is not beautiful, don't stop praising, for forgiveness is promised to you from there, just as it is to all, so that you may praise.</p>\n    \n    <p>Otherwise, unless we strive to praise God in His saints according to the measure of our ability, how will we be able to praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness, as we sing?</p>\n    \n    <p>We must not neglect what we will someday fulfill, as it is said: \"Blessed are those who dwell in your house, Lord; they will praise you forever and ever\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> Psalm 84:4.</p>\n    \n    <p>Sometimes, because He is immense, what we cannot express with words or eloquence, we should carry out with the desires and innermost thoughts of the heart: because He is great and good and immense, as great and as such as He knows Himself to be, let us confess with mouth and spirit for righteousness and salvation.</p>\n</speak>",
            "original_latin": "VI. Tamen etsi ad haec nemo idoneus invenitur,\n votis omnibus cessare non debet etiam quilibet peccator\na laudibus, quamvis explere non queat quod\nsentit. Unde sermo divinus cum de peccatore ageret\nin Psalmis: Sacrificium, inquit, laudis honorificabit\nme: protinus addidit: et illic iter est quo ostendam\nilli salutare Dei (Psalm XLIX 23): ac si patenter\ndicat, Illic iter est laudis ad aeternam laudem sine\nfine mansuram: sed nemo apprehendet illud, nisi\nego praemonstravero. Propterea, charissimae, quia\niter salutis nostrae in laudibus est Salvatoris, hortor\nvos et commoneo in hac sacra solemnitate genitricis\nDei Mariae, nolite cessare a laudibus. Quod si virgo\nes, gaude, quia meruisti esse et tu quod laudas:\ntantum cura ut sis, quae digne laudare possis. Quod\nsi continens et casta es, venerare et lauda, quia non\n aliunde constat, ut possis esse casta, quam ex gratia\nChristi, quae fuit plenissime in Maria quam laudas. Quod si conjugata certe aut peccatrix, nihilominus\nconfitere et lauda, quoniam inde misericordia omnibus\nprofluxit et gratia ut laudent. Et quamvis non sit\nspeciosa laus in ore peccatoris, noli cessare a laude,\nquia inde tibi promittitur venia, unde et omnibus, ut\nlaudes. Alioqui nisi juxta modulum ingenii nostri\nDeum laudare in Sanctis suis studeamus: quomodo\neum, secundum quod canimus, juxta multitudinem\nmagnitudinis ejus, laudare poterimus? omnino quippe\npraetermittendum non est, quod impleturi sumus\nquandoque, secundum quod dicitur: Beati qui habitant\nin domo tua, Domine, in saecula saeculorum laudabunt\nte (Psalm LXXXIII 5). Interdum vero quia\n immensus est, quod voce non possumus, nec facundia\nvalemus, exsequamur votis et medullis cordis:\nquia magnus et bonus est atque immensus, tantus\nac talis quantum ac qualem ipse se novit, ore ac\nspiritu confiteamur ad justitiam et salutem.",
