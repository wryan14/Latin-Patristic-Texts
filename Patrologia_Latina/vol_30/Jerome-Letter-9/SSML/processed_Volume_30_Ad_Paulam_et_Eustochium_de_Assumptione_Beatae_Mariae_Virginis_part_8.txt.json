Hinc, rogo, omnes pariter festivitatem gloriosae\nsemper virginis Mariae devotissime celebremus: quia\nhaec est dies praeclara, in qua meruit exaltari super\nchoros angelorum, et pervenire ultra quam nostrae\nhumanitatis est natura. Ubi non substantia tollitur,\nsed gloriae magnitudo monstratur, cum elevatur in\ndexteram Patris, ubi Christus pro nobis introivit\npontifex factus in aeternum ad coeli palatium. Haec\nest, inquam, dies, in qua usque ad throni celsitudinem\nintemerata mater et virgo processit, atque in regni\n solio sublimata, post Christum gloriosa resedit. Sic\nitaque ubique confidenter sancta Dei canit Ecclesia,\nquod de nullo alio sanctorum fas est credere, ut ultra\nangelorum et archangelorum dignitatem merito\ntranscenderit: quia etsi similitudo repromittitur\nsanctis, veritas tamen negatur. Hoc quippe privilegium\nnon naturae est, sed gratiae beatae virginis Mariae,\nde qua natus est ipse Deus et homo. Idcirco et\nipsa plus est meritis, et non natura quam virgo et\nhomo. Unde et si caeterae virgines imitantur illam\nusque ad contemptum partus, et Gabrielis novae salutationis\nobsequium: deinceps totum divinum est,\nquod operatum est in ea, teste angelo: Quia Spiritus\nsanctus et virtus Altissimi obumbrabit te. Ante hoc\n ipsum sane uterus Virginis, quamvis mundus, quamvis\nimpollutus et alienus a contagione \npeccati, quamvis sanctus: tamen adhuc vilitate\nhumanitatis induitur: ut ita dicam, ac si lana\ncandidissima, suoque colore dealbata: ad quam sane\ncum accessisset Spiritus sanctus, quasi ipsa eademque\nlana cum inficitur sanguine conchylii vel muricis,\nvertitur in purpuram: versa est et ipsa sine\ncoitu in matrem: ut non sit jam amodo quod fuerat,\nsed purpura verissima ad indumentum et gloriam\nsummi regis divinitus aptissime dedicata: ut nulli\ndeinceps ea uti usu femineo licuerit nisi Deo."

She is filled with grace, suffused with the Holy Spirit, overshadowed by the power of the Most High, becoming more precious in merits, higher in sublime heights, more beautiful in sanctity, and more glorious in the prerogatives of her merits. So, she is now reserved only for divine purposes. \n\n  <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n\n  Therefore, O most holy virgins, while it is fitting to imitate such a great and splendid virgin and to venerate her highly, it is also very appropriate to praise her with the most worthy praises and joy, as far as is lawful. As we have said, she is exalted above the choirs of angels by the grace of Christ and is devoutly proclaimed today because our Lord and Savior, born of her in true faith, preceded her to heaven to prepare for her a place in the heavenly mansions, as He promised His disciples. \n\n  <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n\n  Hence, the prophet David joyfully sings to Christ: <phoneme ph=\"frÉ’m\">from</phoneme> the highest heaven is His coming forth: and His return is to its highest (Psalm 18:7). He ascended to resume the same glory, although He had not lost it, which He had before the world was made. He ascended and prepared a place of immortality for this most holy and glorious Virgin, so that she might reign with Him forever.\n</speak>",
