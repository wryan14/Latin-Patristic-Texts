<s>My lords, most venerable and blessed priests, I do not know what to accuse myself of first; nor can I find anything to excuse in myself.</s>
<s>Such was the pride of my ignorance, the foolish simplicity with harmful persuasion, the fervor with intemperance, and, to speak more truthfully, the weak faith alongside self-diminution—all these traits combined in me, causing great confusion and wonder at my ability to even entertain such errors and the subsequent joy at being able to reject them from my mind.</s>
<s>Therefore, I acknowledge my sin and willingly become my own accuser.</s>
<s>But I hope for mercy because I acted out of ignorance; for there would be no excuse for my sin if I had knowingly and deliberately committed it.</s>
<s>I call upon God as a witness to my soul: I believed my error to be the truth and mistook darkest shadows for the purest light.</s>
<s>Zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, misled me into carelessness.</s>
<s>However, now, by what we believe will be pleasing to your blessedness, His mercy has called me back from wandering in rough and thorny places to the straight path.</s>
<s>Thus, what was crooked has been made straight for me, and rough places into smooth paths.</s>
<s>And now, instructed and enlightened by all my fellow priests and your brothers, I realize in what way I was blind.</s>
<s>Hence, the acknowledgment of the truth makes me a supplicant.</s>
<s>I confess, I erred in ignorance, and in some matters, while I seemed to hold to the rule of truth, I exceeded it.</s>
<s>My ignorance has been made public, and it is all the more burdensome to me because I tried to defend it to the scandal of many, which, as now is manifest more clearly than daylight, I presumed to defend more out of human error than by reason of faith.</s>
<s>But since nothing else could happen but that my own foolishness lived in me, when I had myself as my own teacher and disciple, I wish that humility had shattered the presumption that ignorance had animated.</s>
<s>But alas for me, I was found both reckless and proud.</s>
<s>Yet I pass over these things by your pardon, and what is now pressing, I will not delay to act upon.</s>
<s>I will hasten to heal the wounds I have inflicted.</s>
<s>There will be no shame in receiving the remedy, who was not cautious in maintaining health.</s>
<s>Where discord was born, let peace be generated.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, I ask that the letter, which was the cause of scandal and a stumbling block to charity, once written by me in simplicity but in some respects, as I acknowledge, arranged unfaithfully, be condemned according to the profession of this letter and by the authority of your sanctity, so that in whatever part or cause it contradicts the truth out of ignorance, it may be trampled and abolished.</s>
<s>Let it be known and clear to all that by just judgment, what opposed faith and contradicted the truth has been cut off from the body of the same letter with condemnation.</s>
<s>I cry out, I truly confess, my lords: some brothers perceived deeper truths better than we did, but we groped at the surface; and being in our own darkness, we attributed blindness to those who had a closer view.</s>
<s>But now, with the help of the Lord, our eyes are once open, and we see the true light with them, and in the same grace of light, with the mud placed on our eyes by the true physician, we regain our sight.</s>
<s>And we see Jesus Christ the Lord, not as we were previously deceived, but as He is in truth, with the purest gaze.</s>
<s>And according to the truth of the creed, what we formerly hesitated to say about Mary bearing God, where not out of some impiety but out of error we were misled, we now confess most firmly.</s>
<s>However, we did not deny that Christ, the Son of God, was born of holy Mary, and, as you yourselves recall, but not paying full attention to the mystery of faith, we said not that God became man, but that a perfect man was born with God: fearing lest we should assign a condition to divinity.</s>

        <p>Humanity's salvation:</p>
        <p>Oh foolish wisdom! As if God would not disdain to be born as a human, yet a human, because of his own status, would disdain to be born. Or, God could do one thing, but not the other. I truly believe that God cannot do something because He does not want to. If He wanted to be born, I most certainly believe that He could, because God's status cannot face any danger. Nor did He, being made human for our sake, find it undignified to be born from a human, because He did not find it undignified to create the very human from whom He would be born.</p>
        <p>Therefore, if we do not fully grasp this power of God and think wisely with our own senses and reason, then, to avoid making it seem as if God acts in a lesser way, we say that a human was born with God, but separately attribute what is God's to God alone, and what is human's to the human alone. By doing this, we clearly introduce a fourth person into the Trinity and begin to make not one, but two Christs out of one Son of God, which may the Lord and God Christ Himself avert from us.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we confess our Lord and God Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who was born from the Father before all ages and in the last times was made human by the Holy Spirit and Mary, ever virgin, and confessing both natures, we faithfully accept in holy belief that He is inseparably God and human.</p>
        <p>From the time He took on flesh, we believe that all things that were God's passed into the human and all things that were human came into God. Thus, the Word became flesh, not by any conversion or change, but by the power of divine dispensation. The Word of the Father, never leaving the Father, became truly human and was incarnate by that secret mystery known to Himself. It is our part to believe, His to know.</p>
        <p>Thus, as God the Word took on everything that is human, He became human; and the assumed human, by taking on everything that is God, could not be anything other than God. However, because He is said to be incarnate and mixed, it must not be understood as a diminishment of His substance. For God knows how to mix without corruption to Himself and yet truly mix; He knows how to take into Himself without adding anything to Himself, being able to infuse Himself entirely without any loss.</p>
        <p>Therefore, let us not, based on our weak understanding and the visible evidence of experiments, make conjectures about creatures of equal status entering into one another, and think of God and human as mixed and thus made into some kind of body by such confusion of flesh and Word. Far be it to believe so; let us not consider that the two natures are reduced to one substance by some kind of blending. Such mixing results in the corruption of both parts. For God, who is capable but not capable of being contained, penetrating but not penetrable, filling but not fillable, who is entirely everywhere and diffused everywhere by His power, mercifully mixed with human nature, but human nature was not mixed with divine nature.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the flesh advances into the Word, not the Word into the flesh, and yet the Word was truly made flesh. But, as we have said, this is proper and personal, not naturally with the Father or the Holy Spirit, because the only-begotten God, true God, who is one in nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is distinct in person. We do not say that the Father is the same as the Son, nor do we say that the Son is the same as the Father, nor do we call the Holy Spirit the Father or the Son. But distinguishing the persons by their properties, we properly name the Father God the Father, and the Son God the Son, and the Holy Spirit God the Holy Spirit. And when we say God three times, we do not believe in three Gods, but in one perfect in the Trinity of His omnipotence.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Jesus Christ, God and human, the Son of God, is truly born to us from the Holy Spirit and Mary, ever virgin. Thus, the Word and flesh become one, each nature remaining in its natural perfection, without any prejudice to itself, and the divine communicates with humanity, and humanity participates in the divine. Not one God and another human, but the same one who is both God and human;</p>
    


  In return, the man who is also God 
  Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, is both called and truly is. And so, we must always act and believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the true God, whom we confess to be eternally equal with the Father before all ages. We should not deny that the same one, from the time He took on flesh, became God and man: nor should we believe He progressed into God through stages and times, having one status before the resurrection and another after; but always of the same fullness and power.

  <p>And because He bore all our weaknesses, that is, of our nature, and truly taking on our emotions according to the flesh, to prove He was really human, running the same course of our mortality, by power, not necessity, in age and wisdom, as the Evangelist says in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luːk">Luke</phoneme> 2:52: He grew, hungered, thirsted, was tired, was scourged, was crucified, died, and rose again. He did not change from the nature of divinity: for we have already professed above that the nature of divinity is unchangeable, immutable, and impassable. But because the Word of God descended into man by graciously taking on humanity, and through the acceptance of God, man ascended into the divine Word; the whole God-Word became wholly man. For it was not God the Father who became man, nor the Holy Spirit, but the only begotten of the Father. Therefore, we must accept the one person of flesh and Word, so that we faithfully believe without any doubt that the same Son of God is always inseparable, always possessing the dual nature, also called a giant in the days of His flesh, and always truly did all that pertains to man, and always truly possessed what pertains to God: because even if He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God as it says in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɛkənd kəˈrɪnθiənz">Second Corinthians</phoneme> 13:4. Hence, we no longer fear to say, according to God, that God was born of man, according to man, God suffered, God died, and so on. But we boast in saying God was born, and the same God suffered according to man. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, as the Apostle says: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes as noted in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈroʊmənz">Romans</phoneme> 1:16. Truly, the power of God is in salvation, believing that God suffered according to man. But to the unbeliever, it is considered the weakness of God, resulting in perdition, not believing that God was crucified according to the flesh. Wherefore, again the same Apostle: We preach Christ crucified: truly the power and wisdom of God; because what seems foolish of God is wiser than men; and what seems weak of God is stronger than men as stated in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfɜrst kəˈrɪnθiənz">First Corinthians</phoneme> 1:23-25. For what seems so foolish and weak to unbelieving men, than when they hear that God's Son was crucified? But it pleased God to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching as noted in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfɜrst kəˈrɪnθiənz">First Corinthians</phoneme> 1:21: because in this our faith is mainly founded, that we believe the only Son of God, not adopted, but His own: not imaginary, but true: not temporary, but eternal, suffered all things for us according to the flesh: and did not struggle for Himself, but for us; nor for His own sake, but for ours, because we were lying low, He mercifully came down from on high; because, as the Apostle says: Though He was in the form of God, He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, and so on as written in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈfɪlɪˈpɪənz">Philippians</phoneme> 2:6, etc.</p>
  
  <break time="500ms"/>

  <p>What can be clearer than to recognize from this testimony the mystery of such great dispensation? For who is in the form of God except God? And how, let us see, did the source of fullness empty Himself? Surely it was when the form of God took on the form of a servant? When the Lord, primarily, graciously assumed the things of a servant? And while out of compassion and mercy for us, by bearing and acting in inferior things, the Word made flesh in person emptied what He possesses in nature, and in the real state of humanity, made obedient in man, restored in Himself through humility and obedience what was lost in Adam through disobedience, and though dead in the flesh, always lives, enlivening all things with the Father in the spirit: never to die again, raised by the Father in the flesh. And He became for us the firstborn from the dead, as written in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="kəˈlɒʃənz">Colossians</phoneme> 1:18, who is the only begotten.</p>


    <p>
        The living God, and living before all ages: for our sake, He became poor in time, and in need like a human, accepting for us what He always abundantly has in the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways beyond tracing out! <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈroʊmənz">Romans</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter eleven, verse thirty-three">11:33</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was given a name for our sake: He bestows upon all, because God, the giver of all things, recognizes Himself as God in giving, and knows Himself as human in receiving: so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of God the Father. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɪˈlɪpiənz">Philippians</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter two, verses ten to eleven">2:10-11</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is our faith, and this is the change of the right hand of the Most High. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɑmz">Psalms</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter seventy-seven, verse ten">77:10</sub>. Thus we believe, thus we hold: and this is not from ourselves. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɪˈfiʒənz">Ephesians</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter two, verse eight">2:8</sub>; for it is the gift of God: not by our own wisdom, so that we should not boast in ourselves: for we are His workmanship, created long ago in Christ. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɪˈfiʒənz">Ephesians</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter two, verse ten">2:10</sub>; but now reborn in the light by apostolic men, remade in the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, to Him be honor and glory forever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concerning what we most foolishly proposed in that letter but ignorantly, and which we now confess as detestable, that is attributing to Christ labor, devotion, merit, faith, we judge these things to be so unsuitable for the Son of God, that recalling what we have said, we consider it the height of our blindness and foolishness, and we openly see how true some are who were moved against us by reason; who, as though to each of the saints, although we never had this in our hearts, we almost made Christ similar, and to Him who is God over all. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈroʊmənz">Romans</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter nine, verse five">9:5</sub>. Assigning these things which simple and naked mortality has, we somehow placed Him among others in number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although He is called the head of the body (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɪˈfiʒənz">Ephesians</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter five, verse twenty-three">5:23</sub>; <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="kəˈlɑʃənz">Colossians</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter one, verse eighteen">1:18</sub>), and truly is the head of the Church's body, and is known to have come from the same mass from which all mankind descended according to the flesh, without sin: yet He who is unique should not be counted among others: nor should those things be referred to Him which can be measured, because it is said of Him: For God does not give the Spirit by measure. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter three, verse thirty-four">3:34</sub>. Where there is the fullness of deity, there is neither measure nor limit.
    </p>
    <p>
        He does not know labor, devotion, faith, merit, or the end of merits, who acts infinitely and without limits in all power. Indeed, by faith man is truly born according to the flesh; but does not cease to be God: He is nurtured, grows, matures, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="aɪˈzeɪə">Isaiah</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter fifty-three, verse seven">53:7</sub>. He endures insults, and is scourged, and the author of life coming in the flesh does not reject the cursed death. But all these things, not as one of us He completes out of necessity; but having the power to lay down His life, and having the power to take it up again, He willingly accepted by choice. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter ten, verse eighteen">10:18</sub>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also think it should not be left unmentioned, that in the same letter, deviating in a similar error, I added, that Christ our Lord fulfilled all things that were of the passions, so that in no way as a perfect man was He helped by the aid of divinity: wishing to assign in Christ a perfect man, and to assert the Word of the Father as separate from these passions; and tried to prove that man did all these things by the possibility of mortal nature alone, without any help from divinity: truly blind, who confessed the man assumed into God, and did not want that what was of the man be assumed into God.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this indeed without a doubt God assumed the whole man into Himself, so that what we think unworthy of God, not by man alone would be done by natural judgment, but God through man, and in man, Himself made man for us, would fulfill by the power and mystery of divine dispensation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, lest anything be lacking to my foolishness, a most learned scribe confirming the things not understood from those not understood, I thought it should be understood in this way, what we have stated above, so that by that testimony where it is written, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɑmz">Psalms</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter twenty-two, verse one">22:1</sub>. I tried to assign this very thing: and therefore the Lord of glory on the cross uttered this cry, because the perfect patience of man.
    </p>


    <p>
        Without the help of divinity, he would be tested in such great pains. Therefore, if the reason for proving human patience caused him to utter this voice in pain, he ought to have shouted the same words to prove the same patience when he was cut. He should have spoken the same words when he endured that multiple crown of wounds, where there were as many punishments as thorns he received in mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or perhaps those were lighter for Christ, and these were heavier. I think that he who had the will to endure all these things also had the same strength to suffer them all. Therefore, he shouted, as it is written, and on the wood of the cross, he first uttered this voice to death: not to demonstrate human and perfect patience in himself, which could be proven without the testimony of voice by the causes and evident things themselves, but to truly and clearly show himself as the Son of God according to the flesh. Using the voice of the flesh itself, setting the past for the future because by the death of the cross, the earthly body was necessarily to be left by God for a time, not only by God but also by his soul which was united with God, he testified this to us while dying before it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        For after the spirit was handed over, the dead flesh could not have shouted this; otherwise, who would believe that Christ was truly dead? God did not abandon the man in his sufferings, who deigned to suffer in the man according to the flesh, but the body in death. According to the law of human departure, the divinity with the soul united to itself did not leave the crucified man in punishment, but deserted the lifeless flesh for a time. Thus, Christ the Son of God lay dead in the tomb, as the same Christ the Son of God descended into the lower parts of the earth. As the blessed Apostle says: "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens" <break time="500ms"/> (Ephesians 4:9-10).
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, our Lord and God Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who descended into hell with his soul, ascended to heaven with both soul and body. We worship him in the present and in the future as a perfect God-man, the same Son of God, true God in eternal ages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, this Lord my God, according to the great mystery of piety, as born in the flesh, suffered in the flesh, died in the flesh, was raised in the flesh, was elevated in the flesh, and glorified in the flesh, I believe and confess. Thus, I believe that he himself will come in the same flesh to judge the living and the dead, and that each one will have an eternal reward according to his own merit from the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that I leave nothing in suspicion to anyone, I said then, rather I responded to objections, that our Lord Jesus Christ as a man was ignorant. But now I not only do not presume to say this, but I also anathematize the previously spoken sentence in this part because it is not lawful to say that even as a man the Lord of the prophets was ignorant. The other questions of causes, whether by intention, exhortation, or fraternal discussion, we have presented. Where if we have perhaps differed in sense rather than in faith, because it is long to go through each one, according to the faith of this letter, thus we testify that we accept or reject them all as the order of the Catholic Church holds, professing Christ the Lord not differently, and holding the same in our heart, we confess most sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Surely, to condemn the infamy of all heresy from us, because we have always known ourselves as Catholics from Catholics according to a pure conscience, we say anathema to all heretics: Photinus, Arius, Sabellius, Eunomius, Valentinus, Apollinaris, Mani, and all who come against sound doctrine. Even if we have slipped in tongue or sense, not in will or heart, as it is written: "He who slips with his tongue but not from his heart: who is there who does not slip with his tongue?" <break time="500ms"/> (Ecclesiasticus 19:16-17). Indeed, my most venerable and blessed lords, as much as I could, being a son of peace according to the Apostle saying: "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all" <break time="500ms"/> (James 2:10); offending not in few but in great things, I made myself guilty in everything from the whole heart.
