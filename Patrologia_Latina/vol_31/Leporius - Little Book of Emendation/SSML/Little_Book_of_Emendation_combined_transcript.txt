Little Book of Emendation
by Leporius
Prologue
Leporius, a Gallic monk, initially lived in a monastery in Marseilles, as it appears. He excelled in the monastic life with his virtuous conduct and innocence of manners. Believing that he had achieved this solely through his own will and effort, without God's help, he began to profess the Pelagian doctrine. This is testified by Gennadius. Cassian also reports similarly.
Leporius did not merely follow Pelagius; he went further and fell into the heresy that Nestorius later propagated widely in the East. According to Cassian, he was considered one of the foremost or most prominent proponents of this heresy in Gaul. Bishop Facundus of Hermiane also recorded this. The author of the "Conferences" writes that this poisonous plague emerged in his time, especially in the city of Belgae, or according to another reading, from the large city of Veligae. Therefore, it is uncertain whether he meant the town of Belica on the Rhone in Bresse or Augusta Treverorum. Sirmond and Garnier, adhering to the latter reading, understand it to be the city of Trier, and Tillemont does not deny this. In that city, Leporius first taught his errors, which he later promulgated in Provence in a certain letter, causing great scandal and offense to charity, as he himself admits in his booklet of Correction.
Despite being admonished by Cassian and other Gallican teachers to renounce his impiety, he held his harmful resolve and was deservedly ejected from the Church by the Gallican bishops Proculus and Cyllinius. This is clear from the letter of the African fathers to the same bishops, which is appended to Leporius's booklet.
He, however, banished from his homeland, crossed into Africa with some followers of his depravity. There, by the grace of God and the efforts of some African prelates, especially Augustine, he recognized and renounced his error and professed sound doctrine. But since he had caused scandal to many in Gaul, he sent a letter to Proculus and Cyllinius and other bishops of Gaul, testifying to his faith, which he confirmed with this subscription: "I, Leporius, wanting to express deeply my faith dictated by my own mind, which I will hold to the end by God's will, have signed it before the holy bishops in the church of Carthage."
About Leporius's booklet, Cassian says: "Thus he magnificently condemned his ill-conceived persuasion; so that his correction is almost as admirable as the untainted faith of many: for the first thing is not to fall into error at all; the second is to repudiate it well." He adds: "Therefore, having come to his senses, he not only confessed his error with sorrow and without shame in Africa, where he was and still is, but also sent tearful letters of confession and lamentation to all the cities of Gaul: so that where his deviation was known before, his correction might also be known; and those who were witnesses of his error before might be the same witnesses of his correction afterward."
Furthermore, some learned men, such as Garnier, Quesnel, Tillemont, and the editors of Norisian works, have thought that this booklet of Leporius was written by Augustine, based on both the style and the expressions used. They were primarily moved by the reasons that among the testimonies attached to the one hundred sixty-fifth letter of Saint Leo, Leporius's booklet is inscribed under Augustine's name. They say the same was done in the second session of the Council of Chalcedon. It is also read similarly in Theodoret. However, it should be noted that the same passage from Leporius's booklet appears in the cited authors: therefore, the opinion that Augustine is the author of Leporius's booklet should be said to stem from one of Leo's letters. As for the Council of Chalcedon, the same Leo's letter is recited in it. Theodoret, presenting the same words, is understood to have copied them from the same Leo's letter. Furthermore, that great pontiff perhaps ascribed that work to Augustine for no other reason than knowing it was from him.
Approved and signed with his own hand.
It is known that the document was signed by four African bishops, among whom Augustine stands out.
They also sent a letter on that occasion to the bishops Proculus and Cyllinnius in Gaul, which includes these noteworthy words:
"Just as he (Leporius) was received by us in person, let him be received by you through his letter."
We also thought it appropriate to sign this letter with our own hands, testifying that it belongs to him.
Such a letter from the African fathers, Sirmondus says, although written in the name of four bishops, clearly shows the style and intellect of Augustine, making it doubtful that it was not dictated by him.
It is included among Augustine's works.
But on this matter, it would be helpful to consult the learned writers of French literary history, who strongly assert that the work attributed to Leporius is genuinely his.
That this booklet held great authority among the ancients, and that Leporius himself was considered a defender of the Catholic faith against Nestorius, is evident.
This is especially clear from Cassian, who, after quoting several passages from the same booklet, concludes his opinion with these words:
"This confession of his (Leporius), that is, the faith of all Catholics, was approved by all African bishops, from whom he wrote, and by all Gallican bishops, to whom he wrote.
And no one has yet appeared who would disapprove of this faith without being accused of infidelity, because denying the approved faith is a declaration of impiety."
Furthermore, Pope John the Second took testimony from the same Leporian booklet to affirm the doctrine of faith, and he asserted that the booklet was approved by the African Synod; for it was indeed read aloud before the holy bishops in the church of Carthage, as Leporius himself writes.
Here are the words of the praised Roman Pontiff:
"Leporius," he says, "in the letter which Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, Blessed Augustine, and the African Synod confirmed," etc.
Additionally, in the petition of Basil the Deacon and Archimandrite, and other monks, presented to Emperor Theodosius in the year 430, which is found among the acts of the Council of Ephesus, Leporius is listed among the holy fathers of the Church who taught the mystery of the Incarnation, that Christ is truly God.
(For Quesnellus is not to be listened to, who vainly persuades himself that the Leporius praised by Basil there is different from our Leporius, some bishop of a certain seat, because he is listed among the bishops who defended the divinity of Christ.)
Facundus also praises the booklet of Leporius in such a way that he uses his testimony to support the orthodox faith.
Finally, Gennadius, as we have seen earlier, lists him among the illustrious men who were distinguished by their ecclesiastical writings.
Therefore, after Leporius had given such a distinguished example of his doctrine and piety in Africa, having once been a monk in Gaul teaching erroneous beliefs against the faith, he was later established in that region and was eventually ordained a priest of the Church of Hippo.
This is well known from Cassian and Gennadius.
Cassian says:
"Leporius, once a monk, now a priest."
Gennadius says:
"Leporius, still a monk, later a priest."
Furthermore, there is a question among the learned whether our Leporius, already a priest, is the same as the one mentioned among the priests of the Church of Hippo in the ecclesiastical acts, where Saint Augustine designated Heraclius as his successor.
These acts are said to have been issued during the consulship of Theodosius for the twelfth time and Valentinian for the second time, on the sixth day before the Kalends of October, that is, in the year 426.
Around the same time, Saint Augustine delivered a sermon on the life and conduct of the clergy, in which he praised the same Leporius at length with these words:
"I speak to you, who perhaps do not know; for many of you know: the priest Leporius, though distinguished by birth and born in an honorable position among his people, yet now serving God, having left everything he had, I received him as a poor man," etc.
These words clearly indicate that this priest of Hippo was once a monk and, significantly, a foreigner.
Augustine clearly states:
Norisius rightly observed that Leporius, who had previously traveled as a monk from Gaul to Africa, where the holy father received him in his poverty, seems to be the same person. But it is better to consult the learned men we mentioned a little earlier, who, upon examining the recently recited passage from Augustine more diligently, reached the same conclusion. Sirmondus also saw it this way. However, Baronius, Garnerius, Tillemontius, and Ballerinii thought differently.
Now, Leporius was still in Africa in the year 430. Cassianus, speaking of him, says: "He, therefore, having come to his senses, not only in Africa, where he was then and is now," etc. Thus, in his books on the Incarnation. This work was written against Nestorius while he still held the seat of Constantinople, and it is known to have been composed before the Council of Ephesus, celebrated in 431, thus around the year 430, as Norisius and Tillemontius also concluded after Baronius. Moreover, if the arguments discussed so far are accurately summed up, it would be nearly possible to define the time when Leporius published his pamphlet. Learned men have various opinions on this matter. Norisius states that Leporius' conversion and thus his confession should not be extended beyond the year 410 and should even be placed before this very year. Sirmondus considers it to have happened around the year 425, Garnerius in the preceding year 424. Pagius, however, refers it to the year 427, after Saint Augustine had published his book on Correction and Grace. Tillemontius and Ballerinii also agree. But putting aside such opinions, the most learned men we praised earlier say that the pamphlet on Emendation was written by Leporius in 418 or at the latest 419. For, they say, the death of Proculus, bishop of Marseille, should not be postponed beyond these years, as even Tillemontius himself acknowledges; since both Leporius' pamphlet and the letter from the African fathers about Leporius' conversion are addressed to this bishop. No other Proculus bishop from Marseille can rightly be fabricated in order to weaken this argument or introduce another way of counting. We pass over the other, not insignificant reasons by which the learned confirm the proposed time notation. They also dissolve the objection drawn from the time when Saint Augustine published his book on Correction and Grace, showing that from 421, when the holy doctor published his Enchiridion, Leporius' errors were well known to him and he openly criticized them in that work. Therefore, having rightly considered these matters, we confidently adhere to this latest opinion, which we also know was later approved by Sirmondus, as we mentioned above, since Pope John II asserted that Leporius' letter was confirmed by the African synod. "If," he says, "he called it African, which we have after the consulship of Honorius XII and Theodosius VIII in the year of Christ 419, it must be established that Leporius' emendation occurred in that same year."
What remains are only fragments of Leporius' pamphlet, described in Cassianus' books on the Incarnation, preceded by the letter from the African bishops, first published by Sirmondus in 1629 among the councils of Gaul. The following year, 1630, he published it in full from a manuscript of the Herivallensis monastery among five ancient doctrinal works. Since then, it has appeared in the royal edition of the Councils of Lupare, as well as in Labbe and Hardouin. Additionally, Garnerius attached the same work, corrected of many errors, along with the letter from the African bishops, to his Mario Mercator. It was also included in the Lyon Library of the Fathers. Finally, with Garnerius' corrections, it exists in the collection of Sirmondus' works, an edition which we have entrusted to be printed much more elegantly than the others.
The Book of Emendations, or Satisfaction
To the Bishops of Gual
From Leporius the Presbyter
My lords, most venerable and blessed priests, I do not know what to accuse myself of first; nor can I find anything to excuse in myself.
Such was the pride of my ignorance, the foolish simplicity with harmful persuasion, the fervor with intemperance, and, to speak more truthfully, the weak faith alongside self-diminution—all these traits combined in me, causing great confusion and wonder at my ability to even entertain such errors and the subsequent joy at being able to reject them from my mind.
Therefore, I acknowledge my sin and willingly become my own accuser.
But I hope for mercy because I acted out of ignorance; for there would be no excuse for my sin if I had knowingly and deliberately committed it.
I call upon God as a witness to my soul: I believed my error to be the truth and mistook darkest shadows for the purest light.
Zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, misled me into carelessness.
However, now, by what we believe will be pleasing to your blessedness, His mercy has called me back from wandering in rough and thorny places to the straight path.
Thus, what was crooked has been made straight for me, and rough places into smooth paths.
And now, instructed and enlightened by all my fellow priests and your brothers, I realize in what way I was blind.
Hence, the acknowledgment of the truth makes me a supplicant.
I confess, I erred in ignorance, and in some matters, while I seemed to hold to the rule of truth, I exceeded it.
My ignorance has been made public, and it is all the more burdensome to me because I tried to defend it to the scandal of many, which, as now is manifest more clearly than daylight, I presumed to defend more out of human error than by reason of faith.
But since nothing else could happen but that my own foolishness lived in me, when I had myself as my own teacher and disciple, I wish that humility had shattered the presumption that ignorance had animated.
But alas for me, I was found both reckless and proud.
Yet I pass over these things by your pardon, and what is now pressing, I will not delay to act upon.
I will hasten to heal the wounds I have inflicted.
There will be no shame in receiving the remedy, who was not cautious in maintaining health.
Where discord was born, let peace be generated.
Therefore, I ask that the letter, which was the cause of scandal and a stumbling block to charity, once written by me in simplicity but in some respects, as I acknowledge, arranged unfaithfully, be condemned according to the profession of this letter and by the authority of your sanctity, so that in whatever part or cause it contradicts the truth out of ignorance, it may be trampled and abolished.
Let it be known and clear to all that by just judgment, what opposed faith and contradicted the truth has been cut off from the body of the same letter with condemnation.
I cry out, I truly confess, my lords: some brothers perceived deeper truths better than we did, but we groped at the surface; and being in our own darkness, we attributed blindness to those who had a closer view.
But now, with the help of the Lord, our eyes are once open, and we see the true light with them, and in the same grace of light, with the mud placed on our eyes by the true physician, we regain our sight.
And we see Jesus Christ the Lord, not as we were previously deceived, but as He is in truth, with the purest gaze.
And according to the truth of the creed, what we formerly hesitated to say about Mary bearing God, where not out of some impiety but out of error we were misled, we now confess most firmly.
However, we did not deny that Christ, the Son of God, was born of holy Mary, and, as you yourselves recall, but not paying full attention to the mystery of faith, we said not that God became man, but that a perfect man was born with God: fearing lest we should assign a condition to divinity.
Humanity's salvation:
Oh foolish wisdom! As if God would not disdain to be born as a human, yet a human, because of his own status, would disdain to be born. Or, God could do one thing, but not the other. I truly believe that God cannot do something because He does not want to. If He wanted to be born, I most certainly believe that He could, because God's status cannot face any danger. Nor did He, being made human for our sake, find it undignified to be born from a human, because He did not find it undignified to create the very human from whom He would be born.
Therefore, if we do not fully grasp this power of God and think wisely with our own senses and reason, then, to avoid making it seem as if God acts in a lesser way, we say that a human was born with God, but separately attribute what is God's to God alone, and what is human's to the human alone. By doing this, we clearly introduce a fourth person into the Trinity and begin to make not one, but two Christs out of one Son of God, which may the Lord and God Christ Himself avert from us.
Therefore, we confess our Lord and God Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who was born from the Father before all ages and in the last times was made human by the Holy Spirit and Mary, ever virgin, and confessing both natures, we faithfully accept in holy belief that He is inseparably God and human.
From the time He took on flesh, we believe that all things that were God's passed into the human and all things that were human came into God. Thus, the Word became flesh, not by any conversion or change, but by the power of divine dispensation. The Word of the Father, never leaving the Father, became truly human and was incarnate by that secret mystery known to Himself. It is our part to believe, His to know.
Thus, as God the Word took on everything that is human, He became human; and the assumed human, by taking on everything that is God, could not be anything other than God. However, because He is said to be incarnate and mixed, it must not be understood as a diminishment of His substance. For God knows how to mix without corruption to Himself and yet truly mix; He knows how to take into Himself without adding anything to Himself, being able to infuse Himself entirely without any loss.
Therefore, let us not, based on our weak understanding and the visible evidence of experiments, make conjectures about creatures of equal status entering into one another, and think of God and human as mixed and thus made into some kind of body by such confusion of flesh and Word. Far be it to believe so; let us not consider that the two natures are reduced to one substance by some kind of blending. Such mixing results in the corruption of both parts. For God, who is capable but not capable of being contained, penetrating but not penetrable, filling but not fillable, who is entirely everywhere and diffused everywhere by His power, mercifully mixed with human nature, but human nature was not mixed with divine nature.
Therefore, the flesh advances into the Word, not the Word into the flesh, and yet the Word was truly made flesh. But, as we have said, this is proper and personal, not naturally with the Father or the Holy Spirit, because the only-begotten God, true God, who is one in nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is distinct in person. We do not say that the Father is the same as the Son, nor do we say that the Son is the same as the Father, nor do we call the Holy Spirit the Father or the Son. But distinguishing the persons by their properties, we properly name the Father God the Father, and the Son God the Son, and the Holy Spirit God the Holy Spirit. And when we say God three times, we do not believe in three Gods, but in one perfect in the Trinity of His omnipotence.
Therefore, Jesus Christ, God and human, the Son of God, is truly born to us from the Holy Spirit and Mary, ever virgin. Thus, the Word and flesh become one, each nature remaining in its natural perfection, without any prejudice to itself, and the divine communicates with humanity, and humanity participates in the divine. Not one God and another human, but the same one who is both God and human;
In return, the man who is also God
Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, is both called and truly is. And so, we must always act and believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the true God, whom we confess to be eternally equal with the Father before all ages. We should not deny that the same one, from the time He took on flesh, became God and man: nor should we believe He progressed into God through stages and times, having one status before the resurrection and another after; but always of the same fullness and power.
And because He bore all our weaknesses, that is, of our nature, and truly taking on our emotions according to the flesh, to prove He was really human, running the same course of our mortality, by power, not necessity, in age and wisdom, as the Evangelist says in Luke 2:52: He grew, hungered, thirsted, was tired, was scourged, was crucified, died, and rose again. He did not change from the nature of divinity: for we have already professed above that the nature of divinity is unchangeable, immutable, and impassable. But because the Word of God descended into man by graciously taking on humanity, and through the acceptance of God, man ascended into the divine Word; the whole God-Word became wholly man. For it was not God the Father who became man, nor the Holy Spirit, but the only begotten of the Father. Therefore, we must accept the one person of flesh and Word, so that we faithfully believe without any doubt that the same Son of God is always inseparable, always possessing the dual nature, also called a giant in the days of His flesh, and always truly did all that pertains to man, and always truly possessed what pertains to God: because even if He was crucified in weakness, He lives by the power of God as it says in Second Corinthians 13:4. Hence, we no longer fear to say, according to God, that God was born of man, according to man, God suffered, God died, and so on. But we boast in saying God was born, and the same God suffered according to man. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, as the Apostle says: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes as noted in Romans 1:16. Truly, the power of God is in salvation, believing that God suffered according to man. But to the unbeliever, it is considered the weakness of God, resulting in perdition, not believing that God was crucified according to the flesh. Wherefore, again the same Apostle: We preach Christ crucified: truly the power and wisdom of God; because what seems foolish of God is wiser than men; and what seems weak of God is stronger than men as stated in First Corinthians 1:23-25. For what seems so foolish and weak to unbelieving men, than when they hear that God's Son was crucified? But it pleased God to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching as noted in First Corinthians 1:21: because in this our faith is mainly founded, that we believe the only Son of God, not adopted, but His own: not imaginary, but true: not temporary, but eternal, suffered all things for us according to the flesh: and did not struggle for Himself, but for us; nor for His own sake, but for ours, because we were lying low, He mercifully came down from on high; because, as the Apostle says: Though He was in the form of God, He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, and so on as written in Philippians 2:6, etc.
What can be clearer than to recognize from this testimony the mystery of such great dispensation? For who is in the form of God except God? And how, let us see, did the source of fullness empty Himself? Surely it was when the form of God took on the form of a servant? When the Lord, primarily, graciously assumed the things of a servant? And while out of compassion and mercy for us, by bearing and acting in inferior things, the Word made flesh in person emptied what He possesses in nature, and in the real state of humanity, made obedient in man, restored in Himself through humility and obedience what was lost in Adam through disobedience, and though dead in the flesh, always lives, enlivening all things with the Father in the spirit: never to die again, raised by the Father in the flesh. And He became for us the firstborn from the dead, as written in Colossians 1:18, who is the only begotten.
The living God, and living before all ages: for our sake, He became poor in time, and in need like a human, accepting for us what He always abundantly has in the Father.
Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways beyond tracing out! Romans 11:33.
He was given a name for our sake: He bestows upon all, because God, the giver of all things, recognizes Himself as God in giving, and knows Himself as human in receiving: so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of God the Father. Philippians 2:10-11.
This is our faith, and this is the change of the right hand of the Most High. Psalms 77:10. Thus we believe, thus we hold: and this is not from ourselves. Ephesians 2:8; for it is the gift of God: not by our own wisdom, so that we should not boast in ourselves: for we are His workmanship, created long ago in Christ. Ephesians 2:10; but now reborn in the light by apostolic men, remade in the same.
Therefore, to Him be honor and glory forever.
Concerning what we most foolishly proposed in that letter but ignorantly, and which we now confess as detestable, that is attributing to Christ labor, devotion, merit, faith, we judge these things to be so unsuitable for the Son of God, that recalling what we have said, we consider it the height of our blindness and foolishness, and we openly see how true some are who were moved against us by reason; who, as though to each of the saints, although we never had this in our hearts, we almost made Christ similar, and to Him who is God over all. Romans 9:5. Assigning these things which simple and naked mortality has, we somehow placed Him among others in number.
Although He is called the head of the body (Ephesians 5:23; Colossians 1:18), and truly is the head of the Church's body, and is known to have come from the same mass from which all mankind descended according to the flesh, without sin: yet He who is unique should not be counted among others: nor should those things be referred to Him which can be measured, because it is said of Him: For God does not give the Spirit by measure. John 3:34. Where there is the fullness of deity, there is neither measure nor limit.
He does not know labor, devotion, faith, merit, or the end of merits, who acts infinitely and without limits in all power. Indeed, by faith man is truly born according to the flesh; but does not cease to be God: He is nurtured, grows, matures, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent. Isaiah 53:7. He endures insults, and is scourged, and the author of life coming in the flesh does not reject the cursed death. But all these things, not as one of us He completes out of necessity; but having the power to lay down His life, and having the power to take it up again, He willingly accepted by choice. John 10:18.
I also think it should not be left unmentioned, that in the same letter, deviating in a similar error, I added, that Christ our Lord fulfilled all things that were of the passions, so that in no way as a perfect man was He helped by the aid of divinity: wishing to assign in Christ a perfect man, and to assert the Word of the Father as separate from these passions; and tried to prove that man did all these things by the possibility of mortal nature alone, without any help from divinity: truly blind, who confessed the man assumed into God, and did not want that what was of the man be assumed into God.
In this indeed without a doubt God assumed the whole man into Himself, so that what we think unworthy of God, not by man alone would be done by natural judgment, but God through man, and in man, Himself made man for us, would fulfill by the power and mystery of divine dispensation.
Then, lest anything be lacking to my foolishness, a most learned scribe confirming the things not understood from those not understood, I thought it should be understood in this way, what we have stated above, so that by that testimony where it is written, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me. Psalms 22:1. I tried to assign this very thing: and therefore the Lord of glory on the cross uttered this cry, because the perfect patience of man.
Without the help of divinity, he would be tested in such great pains. Therefore, if the reason for proving human patience caused him to utter this voice in pain, he ought to have shouted the same words to prove the same patience when he was cut. He should have spoken the same words when he endured that multiple crown of wounds, where there were as many punishments as thorns he received in mockery.
Or perhaps those were lighter for Christ, and these were heavier. I think that he who had the will to endure all these things also had the same strength to suffer them all. Therefore, he shouted, as it is written, and on the wood of the cross, he first uttered this voice to death: not to demonstrate human and perfect patience in himself, which could be proven without the testimony of voice by the causes and evident things themselves, but to truly and clearly show himself as the Son of God according to the flesh. Using the voice of the flesh itself, setting the past for the future because by the death of the cross, the earthly body was necessarily to be left by God for a time, not only by God but also by his soul which was united with God, he testified this to us while dying before it happened.
For after the spirit was handed over, the dead flesh could not have shouted this; otherwise, who would believe that Christ was truly dead? God did not abandon the man in his sufferings, who deigned to suffer in the man according to the flesh, but the body in death. According to the law of human departure, the divinity with the soul united to itself did not leave the crucified man in punishment, but deserted the lifeless flesh for a time. Thus, Christ the Son of God lay dead in the tomb, as the same Christ the Son of God descended into the lower parts of the earth. As the blessed Apostle says: "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens"  (Ephesians 4:9-10).
Indeed, our Lord and God Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, who descended into hell with his soul, ascended to heaven with both soul and body. We worship him in the present and in the future as a perfect God-man, the same Son of God, true God in eternal ages.
Therefore, this Lord my God, according to the great mystery of piety, as born in the flesh, suffered in the flesh, died in the flesh, was raised in the flesh, was elevated in the flesh, and glorified in the flesh, I believe and confess. Thus, I believe that he himself will come in the same flesh to judge the living and the dead, and that each one will have an eternal reward according to his own merit from the same.
So that I leave nothing in suspicion to anyone, I said then, rather I responded to objections, that our Lord Jesus Christ as a man was ignorant. But now I not only do not presume to say this, but I also anathematize the previously spoken sentence in this part because it is not lawful to say that even as a man the Lord of the prophets was ignorant. The other questions of causes, whether by intention, exhortation, or fraternal discussion, we have presented. Where if we have perhaps differed in sense rather than in faith, because it is long to go through each one, according to the faith of this letter, thus we testify that we accept or reject them all as the order of the Catholic Church holds, professing Christ the Lord not differently, and holding the same in our heart, we confess most sincerely.
Surely, to condemn the infamy of all heresy from us, because we have always known ourselves as Catholics from Catholics according to a pure conscience, we say anathema to all heretics: Photinus, Arius, Sabellius, Eunomius, Valentinus, Apollinaris, Mani, and all who come against sound doctrine. Even if we have slipped in tongue or sense, not in will or heart, as it is written: "He who slips with his tongue but not from his heart: who is there who does not slip with his tongue?"  (Ecclesiasticus 19:16-17). Indeed, my most venerable and blessed lords, as much as I could, being a son of peace according to the Apostle saying: "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all"  (James 2:10); offending not in few but in great things, I made myself guilty in everything from the whole heart.
I have shown love to those who persecuted me, but not without reason.
Because as quickly as they accepted me with full love, they corrected me with perfect intention and zeal when I went astray.
But for me, as God is my witness, peace is desirable and sought by all.
What remains now, we again and again ask, forgive us by pardoning, and obtain through praying for us.
I hope you, fathers, live in God.
