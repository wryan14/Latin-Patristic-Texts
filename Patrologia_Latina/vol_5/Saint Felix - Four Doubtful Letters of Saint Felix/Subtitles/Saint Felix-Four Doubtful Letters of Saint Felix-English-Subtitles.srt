00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,472
Letter One to Bishop Paternus

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:05,820
On the judgments, accusations, and defenses of sacred orders. 1.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,268
Those who criticize or support enemies should be excluded from episcopal accusations.

4
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:10,372
2.

5
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:13,773
Individuals of lower rank should not accuse those of higher rank.

6
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:13,878
3.

7
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:18,744
In uncertain matters, definite judgments should not be made against a cleric in the province.

8
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:18,849
4.

9
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:21,465
Clerics should carry out their duties responsibly.

10
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:21,569
5.

11
00:00:21,569 --> 00:00:24,656
Leaders should behave appropriately with an accused bishop.

12
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:24,761
6.

13
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:32,609
Church judges should not deliver judgments without the presence of the person involved, and the deceitful words of a traitor should not be considered.

14
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,632
To my dearest and most beloved fellow bishop Paternus, Bishop Felix sends greetings in the Lord.

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:46,423
Your writings have filled me with great joy in the Lord, as they clearly demonstrate your deep love for the Catholic faith and your strong aversion to heretical errors.

16
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:55,056
Heresy is indeed very impious and an enemy of the gospel truth, attempting not only to damage a part but to undermine the very foundations of the Christian religion.

17
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,189
Whoever it ensnares falls not only into this vice but into many others as well.

18
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,102
With the persuasion of the ancient enemy, they become not only persecutors of the Church but also of its priests.

19
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:14,258
Therefore, let us unite in our efforts to correct and confront such individuals, striving to liberate the Church, its faithful, and the priests of the Lord from their enemies.

20
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:18,235
Our almighty redeemer will grant us the strength to love and pursue justice.

21
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:24,984
He will provide us with unity of Spirit, even to those far from him, through whose craftsmanship the Church is built like an ark.

22
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:33,513
With its four sides of the world, bound by the framework of incorruptible wood and the pitch of charity, it remains undisturbed by any adversity or external force.

23
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:45,688
However, just as it's important to seek the grace of governance to keep external disturbances at bay, it's equally crucial, dear brother, to pray earnestly for Providence to clear away our inner burdens.

24
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:52,320
The adversary, the devil, who rages against the humble, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,252
First Peter five.

26
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:59,392
As we observe, he no longer merely circles the sheepfolds but fiercely attacks some vital members of the Church.

27
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:09,204
There's no doubt that unless the entire group of wise shepherds, united by the Lord, comes together, the whole fold could quickly be torn apart, though we hope this never happens.

28
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:17,263
Therefore, we remove from episcopal accusation those detractors who should be eradicated by divine authority, along with the supporters of enemies.

29
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:22,635
Likewise, let no one in high positions be disturbed or destroyed by the accusations of the lesser.

30
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,676
Hadrian, column 19.

31
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,911
Nor should a fixed sentence be judged in a definite matter.

32
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,719
Saint Gregory, letter 30, book 8.

33
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,653
Nor should any judgment be considered valid unless it is carried out in an orderly manner.

34
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:40,999
If anyone believes a cleric should be accused of any crimes, they should present their case in the province where the accused resides.

35
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:41,985
Hadrian, column 8.

36
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,658
The accused shouldn't be dragged elsewhere or farther for judgment.

37
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,824
If the accused finds the judges suspicious, they may appeal to the primates.

38
00:02:49,824 --> 00:03:01,775
The primates, when examining the accused bishop, shouldn't issue a condemnation before consulting apostolic authority, unless the accused admits his guilt or is convicted by innocent and canonically examined witnesses.

39
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:33,130
Anastasius in the constitution, book 9, title 40, code Theodosian, 11, question 3, "It is null for the bishops."
Otherwise, we consider the condemnation of bishops to be null and unjust, and therefore it should be reconsidered by the synod so that those oppressed in any case may receive support from all.
Let the judges of the Church take care not to pronounce a sentence in the absence of the person whose case is being discussed, for it will be null.
They will also be accountable for the actions of the brothers in their presence.
Council of Carthage, 4th, chapter 28.

40
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:37,343
The voice or accusation of a traitor should not be considered.

41
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:42,023
No one knows a debtor better than someone who has suffered their injury and wickedness.

42
00:03:42,023 --> 00:03:45,090
Theodosian Code, constitution three, title ten, book ten.

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,954
Those who wish to live piously in Christ must endure reproach from the wicked and be seen as fools or insane.

44
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:55,096
Prosper, sentence thirty-two, from Augustine on Psalm one hundred twenty-two.

45
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:58,217
They lose present goods to gain invisible and future ones.

46
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:03,328
The scorn and mockery from such people will eventually be turned back on those who attack them.

47
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,147
Their abundance will turn into poverty, and their arrogance into shame.

48
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:11,935
The adversities faced by the just are not punishments for wrongdoing but tests of virtue.

49
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:18,929
Just as gold is refined to become better, the just person becomes purer and dearer to God through patient endurance of affliction.

50
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:27,483
As Truth itself says in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter five:
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

51
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:34,853
The Lord speaks of such people through Isaiah, saying, Isaiah, chapter sixty-six:
Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word.

52
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:42,815
Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for My name's sake said: Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy; but they shall be ashamed.

53
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:49,164
A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompense to His enemies.

54
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:54,005
Before she was in labor, she gave birth; before her pain came, she delivered a male child.

55
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,888
Who has ever heard of such a thing?

56
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,825
And who has seen anything like this?

57
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:00,461
Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day?

58
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:05,249
Or shall a nation be born at once, since Zion has labored and brought forth her children?

59
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,423
Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause delivery?

60
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,177
says the Lord.

61
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,920
Shall I, who cause others to give birth, be barren?

62
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,158
says the Lord your God.

63
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,762
Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,071
Rejoice with her, all you who mourn over her, so that you may nurse and be satisfied from her comforting breast.

65
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,835
Drink deeply and delight in her glorious abundance.

66
00:05:26,835 --> 00:07:13,355
For this is what the Lord says:
"I will extend peace to her like a river and the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream.
You will be nursed, carried on her arm, and bounced on her knees.
As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you, and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.
You will see this, and your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like grass.
The Lord's hand will be made known to his servants, and his indignation will be shown against his enemies.
For see, the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind, to unleash his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire.
For the Lord will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh, and those slain by the Lord will be many.
Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one who is among them, eating pig's flesh, detestable things, and mice, will all perish together," declares the Lord.
"And I, knowing their works and their thoughts, am coming to gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.
I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who survive to the nations: to the sea, to Africa, to Lydia, skilled in archery, to Italy, and Greece, to distant islands that have not heard of me or seen my glory.
They will proclaim my glory among the nations, and they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, as an offering to the Lord on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels to my holy mountain Jerusalem," says the Lord.
"Just as the Israelites bring their offerings in clean vessels to the house of the Lord, I will also select some of them to be priests and Levites," says the Lord.
"For as the new heavens and the new earth that I will make will endure before me," declares the Lord, "so will your descendants and your name endure.
From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the Lord.

67
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:17,614
They'll go out and see the bodies of those who have rebelled against me.

68
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:23,781
Their worm will not die, and their fire won't be extinguished, making them a spectacle for everyone to see.

69
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:31,851
What else do the detractors do,
Saint Gregory, letter forty-five, book eight,
but blow dust into the air and throw dirt into their own eyes?

70
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,540
The more they spread their gossip, the less truth they perceive.

71
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:44,128
However, such people, dearest brother, must be endured and corrected because they are blind guides leading the blind,
Saint Matthew, chapter fifteen.

72
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:50,584
I've briefly answered your questions, dearest brother, which we command you and all bishops to follow regularly.

73
00:07:50,584 --> 00:08:03,611
Yet, brother, we urge you to work diligently for the stability of the Church and its priests,
to uphold the order of the holy Roman and apostolic Church in all things, and not to allow the decrees of the saints to be violated.

74
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:08,856
Instead, instruct all those you can, so that you may present fruitful harvests to the Lord.

75
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,375
Farewell.

76
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,929
Given on the fifth of June, in the year of the consuls Claudius and Aurelianus.

77
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:20,375
Letter Two: On the Authority of the Judge of the Apostolic See, and on Accused Bishops

78
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,334
Bishop Felix to all bishops established throughout the provinces of Gaul, greetings in the Lord.

79
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:31,636
There's no doubt that God is the source of good works and spiritual endeavors, as Saint Leo mentions in letter thirty-two.

80
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,063
He inspires our minds and supports our actions.

81
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:40,107
Therefore, your writings brought me joy, reflecting your strong efforts and the integrity of your faith and devotion.

82
00:08:40,107 --> 00:08:43,516
However, your affliction and deep sorrow have greatly saddened me.

83
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:48,526
I read your letters with sadness and went through your sorrowful writings with appropriate grief.

84
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:56,739
Just as the peace of the Churches, the harmony of the priests, and the tranquility of the people bring us joy, the suffering of our brothers deeply affects us.

85
00:08:56,739 --> 00:09:01,388
But do not be overly sorrowful, as Saint Gregory advises in letter forty-five, book eight.

86
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:13,268
As Truth itself says: If you were of this world, the world would love what is its own; but because you are not of this world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you, meaning, the lovers of the world.

87
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,109
This is from the Gospel of Saint John, chapter fifteen.

88
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:27,730
No matter what others say or do against you, always keep your faith intact and maintain a pure conscience, so that your spirit and soul may be preserved on the day of the Lord, as written in First Thessalonians, chapter five.

89
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:36,511
We have called upon more than seventy of our brothers and fellow bishops to support you, and we have decided to regularly address these matters, which are detailed below.

90
00:09:37,079 --> 00:10:06,863
Your letters, read aloud for everyone, contained many complaints and grievances, as you know, and regarding your decrees about the accusations against bishops, the holy synod stated:
These are the rules we want to firmly uphold in the future to protect against the plots of malicious people who indiscriminately attack the Church and its clergy, and we intend to preserve them:
If a bishop is accused by credible accusers, after he has been approached in a charitable manner to amend the issue, and he refuses to correct it, the case should not be immediately advanced.

91
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:20,210
Instead, it should be brought canonically to the highest leaders who must regularly convene a council in a suitable location within the same province, at an appropriate time, either in autumn or summer, so that all the bishops of the province can hear it.

92
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:30,993
If he is regularly summoned, unless illness or another serious necessity prevents him, he must attend, because it is not permitted to accuse beyond the province's boundaries before the hearing is requested.

93
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:54,442
If he has been stripped of his or the Church's resources entrusted to him, or God forbid, expelled from his see or kept away from his flock in any manner:
Then, canonically, before he is restored to his former state with all the privileges of his honor, and all possessions taken from him through his enemies' plots are restored by law, he cannot be summoned or judged, unless he chooses to come willingly for his own reasons, but not to be judged.

94
00:10:54,599 --> 00:11:03,050
Let no one be asked to respond until everything lost due to his enemies' suggestions is fully restored to his authority by the honorable council in a legal manner.

95
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:12,589
The bishop should be returned to his former position with all honor, and once everything is organized and settled, he should handle his own affairs freely and securely for a long time.

96
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:23,425
Then, within four, five, or seven months, depending on what's possible for him, and not before, he should be summoned to the council at the right time in a legitimate and canonical manner to address the issue.

97
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,276
If it seems fair, he should respond to the accusations.

98
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:32,497
It's crucial to ensure he's not forced to respond before these conditions are met, as disputes should always be avoided.

99
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:46,028
Depriving a bishop of his bishopric, as noted in the Council of Africa, chapter eighty-seven, before the outcome of his case is clear, cannot be considered just by any Christian because such presumption is sacrilege, and the author of such acts is sacrilegious.

100
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:52,250
If the bishop is ill or held back by some serious necessity, he should send a representative to the synod on his behalf.

101
00:11:52,250 --> 00:12:09,617
He should not be suspended from communion if accused of a crime, as stated in the Council of Carthage three, canon seven, unless he is summoned by letter to present his case on a specified day by elected judges and fails to attend, unless some necessity prevents him within the aforementioned months or longer, as dictated by the case.

102
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:20,712
If both parties come to present their case, since one should not be heard without the other, it must be inquired in judgment about the character, faith, and suspicion of the accusers or their intention in doing so.

103
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:29,577
They should not be admitted unless they are men of good character and correct faith, those who are free from all suspicion and are clearly of good life, and not notorious.

104
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:44,145
If the accusers' character, as referenced in the third question, is found to be blameworthy by the bishops, as noted in the same Council of Carthage, they should not be admitted to argue, unless they want to assert their own causes, though not criminal ones or ecclesiastical ones.

105
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:48,527
A person with a bad reputation cannot serve as a manager or representative.

106
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:55,841
If the opponent is absent, the accuser should not be heard, and no verdict given by the judge in the absence of the other party will be valid.

107
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:02,073
No one can accuse or be accused by someone else without being present, and relatives cannot be admitted for this purpose.

108
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:11,345
Therefore, no one should be moved from one province to another or to a county unless the judge handling the appeal reports it, meaning the authority should always follow the forum.

109
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:17,629
If anyone feels that a judge is biased against them, they should voice their appeal, which should not be denied to anyone.

110
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:26,798
We generally prohibit foreign judgments because it is inappropriate for locals to be judged by outsiders when they should have judges from among themselves whom they have chosen.

111
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:41,066
These decisions, brothers, have been unanimously agreed upon in the synod for your benefit and the protection of all co-bishops, so that if some misguided individuals, deceived by falsehoods, wish to accuse you, they may read or hear these rulings, repent, and return to unity.

112
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:44,105
And what was once a matter of revenge will turn into glory.

113
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:52,088
For undoubtedly, there are many who, as the apostle says, turn away from the truth because their ears itch for new stories and they gravitate towards harm.

114
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:58,578
The same apostle speaks of the ignorance of unbelievers: If they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

115
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:06,047
Similarly, if they had known and loved the Lord perfectly, they would never have disturbed His servants, nor persecuted them with words or deeds.

116
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:10,065
Reconciled to God through the death of His Son, why do we pursue our brothers?

117
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:15,492
Why do we disrupt the peace of God's Church and trouble those who should be serving it?

118
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:22,643
The martyrs suffered, as mentioned in the same Council, yet their souls remained unharmed despite the suffering of their bodies.

119
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:29,124
The mouth of Truth assures us: "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul" (Matthew, Chapter 10).

120
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:43,985
We must understand that if the souls of martyrs cannot be extinguished by suffering, even when their bodies are destroyed, then neither should the souls of preachers and teachers be persecuted or distracted from serving God, for they too do not perish with the body.

121
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:53,147
These disruptors of the Church not only commit these wrongs but also curse the memories of the martyrs (Council of Gangra, Chapter 20, interpretation by Dionysius).

122
00:14:53,147 --> 00:15:00,242
Therefore, in the aforementioned synod, we decree and command you and all Churches to celebrate Masses in honor of the martyrs.

123
00:15:00,242 --> 00:15:05,997
This ensures that their memories cannot be erased by such people, nor can their veneration be hindered.

124
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:14,377
But you, brothers, do not be greatly troubled or distressed; rather, be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of His glory (Ephesians, Chapter 6).

125
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:18,790
Meanwhile, hold on to these decrees for your support, with apostolic authority.

126
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:25,215
Know that we are always ready to provide whatever you may need, with the Lord's help, even unto death if necessary.

127
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:33,428
However, those who oppose, with God as the author, will perish, and you will stand firm if your labor is not in vain but full of faith and charity.

128
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:39,629
"Woe," said the prophet, "to him who gives his friend a drink, mixing in his own poison" (Habakkuk, Chapter 2).

129
00:15:39,629 --> 00:16:04,993
And again, the wise Solomon says, as cited in the letter of Felix the Second to the Egyptians, "He who speaks iniquity cannot hide, nor will the judgment that corrects him pass him by."
Therefore, in the minds of the wicked, there will be questioning.
But the hearing of his words will reach the Lord and lead to the correction of his iniquities.
For the ear of jealousy hears all things, and the tumult of murmurs will not be hidden (Wisdom, Chapter 1).

130
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:11,936
If they had embraced these teachings with true understanding, they wouldn't have fallen into a depraved state of mind.

131
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:19,007
By speaking with caution and reverence for God, they could have preserved the holy teachings of the fathers without causing any harm.

132
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:25,067
The sacred scripture says: "Good advice will protect you, and a good mind will guard you" (Proverbs, chapter two).

133
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:30,595
Such accusations and slanders do not come from the life-giving sources meant to lead us to eternal life.

134
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:42,663
Therefore, the blessed Apostle Paul wisely advises us: "You should not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment" (Romans, chapter twelve), staying firm in the path of piety.

135
00:16:42,663 --> 00:16:52,072
Those who ignore these teachings not only harm themselves by losing their strength, but they also leave behind a memory of their folly in their homes, unable to hide their sins.

136
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:58,026
For glory and disgrace come through speech (Ecclesiastes, chapter five), and a man's downfall lies in his words.

137
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:09,030
It is fitting that this demonstration of their reproaches be reflected in our actions, so that you no longer suffer from those who sow discord and scandals, but instead find joy in your duties and teachings.

138
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:18,492
Let them be ashamed and hasten to remove such blasphemy, unless they wish to be separated from our priestly community and cut off from the society of the entire Christian people.

139
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:30,985
Although we could have said and written more on these matters, which are found in the decrees of the apostolic see and established by the apostles and their successors, our predecessors, we decided to conclude the letter with a prayer.

140
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:43,489
Almighty God and His only-begotten Son, our Savior Christ, grant you this encouragement, so that you may assist all our brothers and fellow bishops who are struggling with various tribulations with all your strength.

141
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:51,227
By sharing in their suffering, you carry the cross of the same Lord and Savior, revealing yourselves as His true disciples before everyone.

142
00:17:51,227 --> 00:18:05,256
In this way, both you and those with you may possess better things here and in the future, things which no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, which God has prepared for those who love Him First Corinthians chapter two.

143
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:11,158
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom there is glory to Almighty God forever and ever.

144
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:11,436
Amen.

145
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,329
I wish you well, dearest brothers.

146
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:24,073
Given on the ninth day before the Ides of August, in the consulship of the most illustrious men Claudius and Paternus, in the year of Christ two hundred sixty-nine, with Dionysius not yet dead.

147
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,096
Letter Three to Bishop Benignus

148
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:32,904
First, those who claim that the Son cannot see the Father because no one has ever seen God are mistaken.

149
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:40,556
Second, those who assert that the Son is lesser than the Father because the Father is invisible and the Son is visible are also mistaken.

150
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:45,081
To my dearest brother, Bishop Benignus, Bishop Felix sends greetings in the Lord.

151
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:57,536
Upon receiving your letters of brotherhood, in which you asked about points of faith that differed from the true faith's sacraments, I responded without hesitation, out of love for our brotherhood, as the Lord has given us.

152
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:06,529
Indeed, in times of doubt and major issues, it has always been customary to seek guidance from this holy see, instructed by the apostles through their teachings.

153
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:13,119
Therefore, you have done well to seek advice from this holy see, wanting it to strengthen and instruct you and others.

154
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:23,285
Your letters, and those of your brothers, mentioned that some people claim the Son cannot properly see the Father because it is written: "No one has ever seen God" (John, chapter 1).

155
00:19:23,285 --> 00:20:23,273
Others falsely assert: "Therefore, the Son is lesser than the Father, because the Father bears witness to Him."
Some also argue that the Son is lesser than the Father because the Father is described as invisible, while the Son is proved to be visible.
These people, ignorant of the divine Scriptures and the teachings of the apostles, create such ideas from their own or distorted understanding and seek to mislead the hearts of the faithful.
Let us return to the original source, from which we teach with clearer testimonies from the writings of the Old and New Testaments that the Son has always been able to see the Father.
Solomon says: "With you is wisdom, which knows your works, which was present with you when you made the world, and knows what is pleasing in your eyes."
And the Lord in the Gospel says: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
And again: "No one has ever seen God, except the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father; he has made him known."

156
00:20:23,663 --> 00:20:27,492
And again, he said to the Jews: You do not know him, but I know him.

157
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:31,377
If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar.

158
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,741
Also there: Whoever is from God knows him.

159
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,219
And again: I know him because I am from him.

160
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,372
See, we have taught that the Son always sees the Father.

161
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:44,551
How do they assert that the Father cannot be seen when he is known to remain in his embrace?

162
00:20:44,551 --> 00:21:00,541
If you calmly consider the divine Scriptures, you will find not only the Father bearing witness to the Son, but also the entire inseparable Trinity, as the Lord himself declares, who says: I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.

163
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,005
Saint John, chapter eight.

164
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:08,648
And again: If I bear witness about myself, my testimony is true because I know where I come from and where I am going.

165
00:21:08,648 --> 00:21:10,112
Saint John, chapter eight.

166
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:15,968
And about the Holy Spirit: When the Advocate, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he will bear witness about me.

167
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:17,544
Saint John, chapter fifteen.

168
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:26,778
Pay attention, please, pay attention because, in these cases where the power of testimony is shown to be one, no one is judged to be greater or lesser than another.

169
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:42,542
We have said these things often because the Son is said to be visible according to the form of a human, but according to the substance of deity, he is proclaimed invisible, as testified by the Apostle Paul: Oh, the depth, he says, of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

170
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:46,371
How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond tracing out.

171
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,665
Romans, chapter eleven.

172
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:51,888
And in Isaiah: To whom will you compare him, since he is himself invisible?

173
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:53,127
Isaiah, chapter forty.

174
00:21:53,127 --> 00:22:07,315
And also the Apostle: To me, the least of all the saints, this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to enlighten everyone about what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages, in which he created everything.

175
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:08,722
Ephesians, chapter three.

176
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:11,650
Also, he says: He is the image of the invisible God.

177
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,001
Colossians, chapter one.

178
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:18,449
To the Colossians, I, Paul, a minister, now rejoice in my sufferings for you.

179
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:31,245
I fill up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions in my flesh for his body, which is the Church, of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God in the ministry of Christ, which was hidden for ages and generations.

180
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:42,933
Also there, so that their hearts may be comforted in love, in all the riches of full understanding, in the knowledge of the mystery, which is Christ, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.

181
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:50,910
In the Book of Psalms, Chapter Seventy-Six: Your way was through the sea, your paths through the mighty waters, yet your footprints were unseen.

182
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,563
And in Ecclesiastes: Who can search out the wisdom of God that surpasses all things?

183
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:58,721
Also there: To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed?

184
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:00,826
And who has recognized its subtleties?

185
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:07,363
Also there: To whom has the discipline of wisdom been made known, and who has understood the vastness of its progress?

186
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:13,788
Also there: For the works of the Lord alone are marvelous, glorious, and hidden, and his works are invisible to men.

187
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:17,112
Behold, just as the Father is invisible, so also is the Son.

188
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:25,477
How then, by those who say what you have commanded, is he judged inferior to the Father because he deemed himself worthy to be seen by us in the flesh?

189
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:29,631
Do not believe such people, and teach others to turn away from their views.

190
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:33,177
Therefore, serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

191
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:36,500
Take hold of discipline, lest you stray from the right path.

192
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,655
This indeed, from the right faith, is the living tradition of the apostles.

193
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:46,139
This is true love, which is to be preached, truly loved and cherished, and confidently held by all.

194
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,130
This is the holy and apostolic mother of all churches.

195
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,842
Letter from Agatho to Emperor Constantine, Act Four of the council.

196
00:23:53,783 --> 00:24:06,304
The Church of Christ, by the grace of Almighty God, has never been proven to have strayed from the path of apostolic tradition during the six ecumenical councils, nor has it succumbed to the corruptions of heretical innovations.

197
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:31,401
Instead, as it received the rule of the Christian faith from its founders, the chief apostles of Christ, it remains unblemished to the end, in accordance with the divine promise of the Lord Savior himself, who spoke to the chief of his disciples in his gospels:
"Peter," he said, "Satan has asked to sift you all like wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers" (Luke twenty-two).

198
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:43,593
So let your excellent wisdom consider how good it is to persist in the mission entrusted to you, to uphold the true faith, to oppose heretics and those who are enemies of Christ, and never turn away from the path of truth.

199
00:24:43,593 --> 00:25:01,825
For the Lord and Savior of all, whose faith it is, who did not hesitate to die for us, and redeemed us with his own blood, promised that the faith of blessed Peter would not fail, and urged him to strengthen his brothers: something that the apostolic pontiffs, my predecessors in humility, have confidently done, as is known to all.

200
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:09,129
Even my own smallness, though unequal and least, desires to follow in their footsteps, having received this ministry by divine favor.

201
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:18,190
Woe indeed will be to us, who have taken on the burden of this ministry, if we neglect to preach the truth of our Savior Jesus Christ, which the apostles proclaimed.

202
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:27,361
Woe will be to us if we suppress the truth in silence, which we are commanded to distribute to the money changers, that is, to teach and instruct the Christian people.

203
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:32,963
What will we say in the future judgment of Christ, if we are ashamed to preach the truth of his words?

204
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:43,781
What will become of us when Christ our God, the just judge, demands a strict account of the souls entrusted to us and of the office we have undertaken (First Corinthians nine; Matthew twenty-five)?

205
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:47,625
Therefore, brothers, I urge your love (Epistle of Saint Leo against...

206
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,821
I strongly urge you to be vigilant in investigating heretics and enemies of the holy Church of God as much as you can and should.

207
00:25:54,821 --> 00:26:00,328
Use whatever severity is necessary to remove this plague from healthy minds, so it doesn't spread further.

208
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:16,328
Just as someone who diligently works for the salvation of the people entrusted to them will receive a worthy reward from God,
so too will they be unable to excuse themselves before the judgment seat of the Lord for negligence if they fail to protect their people against those who promote sacrilegious ideas.

209
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:21,887
This was given on the fifth of February, during the consulship of Claudius and Paternus, distinguished men.

210
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:25,160
In the year two hundred sixty-nine, with Felix not yet elected.

211
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:29,759
Letter Four to Bishop Maximus and the Clergy of Alexandria

212
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,681
A fragment on the divinity and humanity of Christ.

213
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:41,329
Regarding the incarnation of the Word and faith, we believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, because he is the eternal Son of God.

214
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:45,594
The Son of God did not take on a man to be someone separate from himself.

215
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:50,619
Instead, being a perfect God, he also became a perfect man, incarnate from the Virgin.

216
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:59,559
Concerning the incarnation and our faith, we affirm our belief in our Lord Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, as the eternal Son of God and the Word.

217
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,240
He was not a man taken by God to be someone other than himself.

218
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:12,297
For the Son of God did not take on a man to be someone other than himself; but, being a perfect God, he also became a perfect man, incarnate from a virgin.
