00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,919
The Book of Spiritual Understanding: One Book Addressed to Uranus
by Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyon.

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:16,495
I felt it was important to create and share with you some formulas to help understand the spiritual meanings of Latin names, out of a fatherly concern for you.

3
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:22,321
Once you grasp them, you'll easily comprehend all divine writings and focus on understanding other meanings.

4
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:29,602
As the letter kills, but the spirit gives life, it’s essential to delve into the spiritual depths of words with the life-giving spirit.

5
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:36,398
Additionally, we are reminded that all Scripture, both from the Old and the New Testament, should be understood allegorically.

6
00:00:36,398 --> 00:02:00,000
This is highlighted in the Old Testament: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from of old" Psalm seventy-eight, verse two.
And also in the New Testament: "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable" Mark chapter four, verse sixteen.
It’s no surprise that the divine word, delivered through prophets and apostles, differs significantly from the usual human writing style, with simple meanings on the surface but profound truths within.
The sacred words of God were meant to be distinct from other writings, both in merit and form, so the dignity of heavenly secrets wouldn’t be revealed indiscriminately to everyone.
This is to prevent the holy from being given to dogs, and pearls from being thrown to pigs Matthew chapter seven, verse six; and to ensure that the consecrated vessels of the temple, when covered, wouldn’t be carried or seen by the common people Numbers chapter four, verses fifteen and twenty.
Furthermore, like the dove covered in silver, whose back is speckled with gold Psalm sixty-eight, verse thirteen, the divine scriptures should shine with silver on the surface and glow with gold in the hidden parts.
Therefore, it was rightly arranged that the purity of these words would be covered with a kind of veil of modesty, hidden from the indiscriminate eyes of everyone.
It was well arranged by divine design that these writings were covered, overshadowed by heavenly mysteries, just as divinity itself was concealed in its own secrecy.

7
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:12,726
Therefore, when we encounter references to the eyes, mouth, womb, hands, feet, and even the arms of the Lord in the holy books, it's important to remember that the Catholic Church does not describe God as having a physical body.

8
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:16,183
God is invisible, incomprehensible, unchangeable, and infinite.

9
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:19,805
These descriptions are symbolic, revealed through the Holy Spirit.

10
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:26,773
In Ezekiel chapter Forty, we find the inner parts of the Lord's temple, where the mysteries of the holy of holies are unveiled.

11
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:40,436
Sacred Scripture is passed down in three forms: the letter or history, which represents the body; the moral sense, known as the tropological sense, which represents the soul; and the higher understanding, called anagoge, which represents the spirit.

12
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:56,678
This threefold approach aligns with the confession of the Holy Trinity, sanctifying us entirely so that our spirit, soul, and body may be preserved blameless at the coming and judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, as mentioned in First Thessalonians chapter Five, verses Twenty-Three to Twenty-Four.

13
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:03,811
Additionally, worldly wisdom has divided its philosophy into three parts: physics, ethics, and logic—natural, moral, and rational.

14
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:13,359
The natural part pertains to the causes of nature, the moral part addresses conduct, and the rational part, discussing higher matters, confirms that God is the Father of all.

15
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:26,967
This tripartite division of philosophy is not so different from the distinctions in our discussions, where learned individuals have suggested that the heavenly philosophy of the Scriptures should be explored through history, tropology, and anagoge.

16
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,973
History instills in us the truth of deeds and the faith of the narrative.

17
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:37,393
Tropology offers mystical insights for amending life, and anagoge leads us to the sacred secrets of heavenly figures.

18
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:46,172
Some also believe that allegory should be added as a fourth aspect of this genre of knowledge, suggesting that the narration of deeds foreshadows future events.

19
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:53,405
To clarify these ideas with examples: historically, the sky is what we see, and morally, it represents the heavenly life.

20
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:58,007
Allegorically, the waters symbolize baptism, and spiritually, they represent angels.

21
00:03:58,007 --> 00:05:17,338
This is reflected in the phrase: "And the waters above the heavens praise the name of the Lord" Psalm One hundred forty-eight, verse four.
All the teachings of our religion stem from this dual source of knowledge: the practical, which is active, and the theoretical, which is contemplative. The active life is completed through the improvement of morals, while the contemplative is concerned with reflecting on heavenly matters and studying the divine Scriptures.
Practical knowledge extends into various fields, while contemplative knowledge is divided into historical discussion and spiritual interpretation. But for now, let's focus on the forms of spiritual understanding we promised, by examining the figures of each name, commonly found in that divine text.
Let us pray to the Lord to reveal the hidden things of His Scriptures, and express how the deeper meanings should be understood.
1. About divine names.
2. About things referred to as the Lord's members or those that signify Him.
3. About heavenly creatures.
4. About earthly things.
5. About living beings.
6. About various names and terms.
7. About the inner person.
8. About commonly used or present things.
9. About various meanings of words or names.
10. About Jerusalem and its adversaries.
11. About numbers, whose meanings are drawn into allegory.
Now, let's explain the meanings of names and words, as they are mostly interpreted through allegory, as the gift of God suggests.

22
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:21,935
Chapter One
On the Divine Names.

23
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:26,304
Almighty God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, both one and three.

24
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:28,724
One in nature, yet three in persons.

25
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,286
He alone is invisible, immense, and incomprehensible.

26
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:40,485
He alone is boundless, unchangeable, incorporeal, and immortal; present everywhere yet hidden; entirely whole and immense.

27
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:54,733
He is invisible because, in His essence, He cannot be seen at all, as the Apostle affirms, stating:
"Whom no one has seen or can see" First Timothy 6:16.
And in the Gospel: "No one has ever seen God" (John 1:18).

28
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,236
He is incorporeal because He is not made up of any bodily features.

29
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:07,167
The truth in the Gospel says: "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth" (John 4:24).

30
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:12,812
He is immense because His size or nature cannot be measured by any of His creations.

31
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:41,443
Solomon, in his prayers, said: "If heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that I have built" First Kings 8:27.
He is boundless because He cannot be contained.
He is not confined to any place, for He does not move from one place to another, nor is He held in any place, as He testifies about Himself through Isaiah, saying: "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool" (Isaiah 66:1).

32
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:46,349
And through Jeremiah: "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" (Jeremiah 23:24).

33
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:57,438
The prophet confesses His immensity in the psalm, saying to the Lord: "If I ascend to heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there" (Psalm 139:8).

34
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:18,340
About His immensity, it is written in the book of Job: "He is higher than the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than the abyss, what can you know? His measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea" (Job 11:8): for He who fills heaven and earth, undoubtedly, there is no place absent from His essence.

35
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:27,591
Above everything, He rules and commands; beneath everything, He supports and carries, not with the burden of labor, but with tireless strength.

36
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,770
No creature created by Him can stand on its own unless supported by Him who created it.

37
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,150
Outside of everything, yet not excluded.

38
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:44,674
He is unchanging, because He cannot change from what He is, as He says through the prophet Malachi, Malachi, "I am the Lord, and I do not change" (Malachi 3:6).

39
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:54,078
Therefore, God is said to be unchanging because emotions such as anger, fury, repentance, forgetfulness, remembrance, and similar things do not happen to Him.

40
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:57,173
His nature is simple, unchangeable, and undisturbed.

41
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:02,292
He is not one thing and possesses another, but He is what He possesses and what He is.

42
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:13,959
Immortal, because He cannot die in any way, as the Apostle testifies and says: "He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no human has seen or can see" (First Timothy 6:16).

43
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:33,601
Whenever sacred Scripture describes the movements of the soul or human body parts in God, such as head, hair, eyes, eyelids, ears, and other body parts or movements of the soul, like anger, fury, forgetfulness, repentance, remembrance, and similar things, they should not be understood literally by those who understand correctly.

44
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:39,196
Unlike the Jews and many heretics who think carnally, believing God to be corporeal and local.

45
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:43,660
Instead, all things about Him must be understood and confessed spiritually.

46
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:52,529
If anyone believes that human body parts or movements of the soul exist in God in a human manner, they are undoubtedly creating idols in their heart.

47
00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:02,469
Therefore, as it is said, we read figuratively that the head of God is His divine essence, which precedes and to which all things are subject (First Corinthians 11:3).

48
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:20,802
The hair of His head should be typically understood as holy angels or powerful chosen ones, about which it is written in the book of Daniel: "I watched until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool" (Daniel 7:9).

49
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:29,688
This signifies God's purity through His white garments and the hair on His head, representing the holy angels and the multitude of purified saints.

50
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:34,489
Alternatively, His hair is likened to clean wool, suggesting He is the Ancient of Days.

51
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:39,125
God is said to have eyes because He sees everything, and nothing is hidden from Him.

52
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:45,306
As the Apostle says, in His presence, no creature is invisible, for everything is naked and exposed to His eyes.

53
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,293
Hebrews chapter four verse thirteen.

54
00:09:47,293 --> 00:11:30,660
In another sense, His eyes represent the grace of His attention, as in the psalm, "The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous."
Psalm chapter thirty-three verse sixteen.
Alternatively, the eyes of the Lord refer to His commandments, through which the light of knowledge is given to us, as in the psalm, "The commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes."
Psalm chapter nineteen verse nine.
The Lord's eyelids suggest His hidden and incomprehensible judgments or the spiritual speech in His divine books.
Regarding these hidden and incomprehensible mysteries and judgments, the psalm says, "His eyelids test the sons of men," meaning they examine.
Psalm chapter eleven verse five.
God is said to have ears because He hears everything, and nothing is hidden from Him in silence.
As written in the Book of Wisdom, "The ear of heaven hears everything, and the murmuring noise will not be hidden."
Wisdom chapter one verse ten.
The nostrils of God symbolize His inspiration in the hearts of the faithful, as in the Book of Kings: "Smoke rose from His nostrils," meaning the tearful contrition of the repentant as His inspiration.
Second Samuel chapter twenty-two verse nine.
The face of God represents His divine knowledge to all, about which it is written in the psalms: "Show us your face, and we shall be saved," meaning, grant us your knowledge, which He made known to humans through the Son of Man.
Psalm chapter eighty verse three.
As He says in the Gospel, "No one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."
Matthew chapter eleven verse twenty-seven.
Alternatively, the face of God signifies the invisible essence of the divinity of the Son of God.
Regarding this, the Lord replied to Moses through an angel, saying, "You shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."
Exodus chapter thirty-three verse twenty-three.

55
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:33,953
It's as if to say, you won't be able to see my divinity.

56
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:37,617
The mouth of God is the Son of the Father, that is, Christ the Lord.

57
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:45,108
The prophet Isaiah, speaking on behalf of the Jews, said: "Because we have provoked his mouth to anger" (Isaiah chapter one, verse twenty).

58
00:11:45,108 --> 00:12:03,321
Alternatively, his mouth can be understood as his word or command, as the same prophet said: "The mouth of the Lord has spoken this."
The Word of God is the Son of God the Father, through whom all things were made. As it's written in the psalm, "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made firm" (Psalm chapter thirty-three, verse six).

59
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:08,225
And elsewhere: "He sent his word, and healed them" (Psalm one hundred seven, verse twenty).

60
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:16,200
And in the Gospel according to John: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John chapter one, verse one).

61
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,397
The tongue of God mystically signifies the Holy Spirit, through whom God the Father revealed his secrets to humans.

62
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:27,301
Thus, in the psalm: "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer" (Psalm forty-five, verse two).

63
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:37,485
The lips of God are mystically understood as the harmony of both testaments, about which it's written in Proverbs: "The mouth did not err in judgment" (Proverbs chapter sixteen, verse ten).

64
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:47,131
The arms of God the Father are understood as his Son and the Holy Spirit, as it is written in Isaiah: "And my arms shall judge the peoples" (Isaiah chapter fifty-one, verse five).

65
00:12:47,131 --> 00:13:00,010
The arm of God is singularly accepted as the Son, about whom Jeremiah said: "And now, Lord God, you brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, with an outstretched arm" (Jeremiah chapter thirty-two, verse twenty-one).

66
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:05,560
Therefore, the Son of God the Father is called the arm because the chosen creation is contained by him.

67
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:17,954
The right hand of God the Father is accepted as the only-begotten Son, about whom the psalm says from the perspective of the assumed man: "The right hand of the Lord has done valiantly" (Psalm one hundred eighteen, verse sixteen).

68
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:30,509
Alternatively, the right hand of the Lord signifies the glory of the Father and eternal blessedness, about which the psalm says from the perspective of the Father to the Son: "Sit at my right hand" (Psalm one hundred ten, verse one).

69
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:35,198
The right hand of God is also called the entire chosen creation in heaven and on earth.

70
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:46,783
Similarly, his left hand is understood as the reprobate creation, meaning all demons and wicked people, who will be placed on the left to endure eternal punishments (Matthew chapter twenty-five, verse thirty-three).

71
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:52,198
The Son of God the Father is accepted because, through Him, everything was created.

72
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:58,136
As it is written in Isaiah:
"My hand made all these things, and so they all came into being" (Isaiah 66:2).

73
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:09,680
In another sense, the hand of God is understood as His power, as it is written in the book of the prophet Jeremiah:
"As clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, house of Israel" (Jeremiah 18:6).

74
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,399
The hand of the Lord is also interpreted as a symbol of punishment.

75
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:25,775
Concerning this punishment, it is written in the prophet Zephaniah:
"I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem, and I will cut off from this place every remnant of Baal" (Zephaniah 1:4).

76
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:32,601
Regarding this punishment from the Lord, blessed Job says about himself:
"The hand of the Lord has touched me" (Job 19:21).

77
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:41,315
The finger of God is uniquely understood as the Holy Spirit, by whom the law is said to have been written on two stone tablets on Mount Sinai (Exodus 32:16).

78
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:45,255
He wrote who dictated what was to be written, that is, the Holy Spirit.

79
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:50,694
About whom the Lord in the Gospel says:
"If I drive out demons by the finger of God" (Luke 11:20).

80
00:14:50,694 --> 00:15:01,128
Just as the finger is one with the hand or arm, and the hand or arm is one with the body in its nature, so the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three persons but one substance of divinity.

81
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:10,396
The fingers of God, in the plural, are understood as the holy prophets, through whom the Holy Spirit writes the books of the law and the prophets with His inspiration.

82
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:15,447
It is written in the psalm:
"I will see the heavens, the work of your fingers" (Psalm 8:4).

83
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:22,828
By heavens, it is certain that the books of the law and the prophets are mystically indicated, and by fingers, as said, the prophets.

84
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:30,820
The invisible image of God the Father is His only-begotten Son, about whom the Apostle says:
"The image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15).

85
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:41,254
For the image of God the Father in His Son is such that He begot Him not from another source, but from Himself, that is, from His own substance, similar to Himself in all things and equal.

86
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:50,023
In another way, the human soul, which He did not beget from Himself, that is, from His own substance, as many heretics have thought, but created from nothing.

87
00:15:50,856 --> 00:16:04,181
Just like a king's image is reflected in his son, whom he has begotten to be like him—a man to a man—it's different when it comes to something like a ring, where an image is merely impressed in wax and isn't the same as the original.

88
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:06,755
A son naturally possesses what the father is.

89
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:14,933
The heart of God the Father reveals the secret of His wisdom, from which He begot the Word, His Son, without suffering and without a beginning.

90
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:19,566
As He says through the prophet:
My heart overflows with a good word
(Psalm 45:1).

91
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:29,403
God is said to have wings because, like a bird, He gathers and nurtures His chosen ones under Him like chicks, protecting them from the snares of the devil and evil people.

92
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:33,921
Hence the prophet says,
Protect me under the shadow of Your wings
(Psalm 17:8).

93
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:40,212
God is described as having shoulders because He carries the weak members of the Church as if on His shoulders.

94
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:44,787
This is written in the psalm:
He will cover you with His shoulders
(Psalm 91:4).

95
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,219
The belly is understood as the secret origin of His essence.

96
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:52,908
Thus, the psalm states:
From the womb, before the dawn, I begot you
(Psalm 110:3).

97
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:58,056
Alternatively, His womb suggests His incomprehensible judgments, which cannot be fathomed.

98
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:06,005
Regarding His hidden judgment, it is written in the book of Job:
Out of whose womb came the ice, and who gave birth to the frost of heaven?

99
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:06,691
(Job 38:29).

100
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:10,009
The back parts refer to the incarnation of the Son of God.

101
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:17,443
The Son, speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai through an angel, said:
You will see my back, but my face you cannot see
(Exodus 33:23).

102
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:24,306
The feet of God symbolize the establishment of His power, as He is present everywhere and all things are subject to Him.

103
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:29,568
As He says through Isaiah:
Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool
(Isaiah 66:1).

104
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:36,774
Alternatively, the feet of the Son of God represent the incarnation, which is subject to divinity as the feet are to the head.

105
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:50,786
Just as divinity is expressed through the head, humanity is expressed through the feet, as written in Exodus:
They saw the God of Israel: there was under His feet like pavement of sapphire stone, and like the sky when it is clear
(Exodus 24:10).

106
00:17:51,816 --> 00:18:04,986
Just as heavenly creatures or holy angels are symbolized by the sapphire stone, the serene sky represents the holy Church of the chosen, drawn from humanity, over which the Son of God, who became human, reigns forever.

107
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:10,362
Regarding this, the psalm states, "You have put everything under their feet" (Psalm 8:8).

108
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:15,075
The feet of the Lord, meaning Jesus Christ, also symbolize the holy preachers.

109
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:21,478
It is written in Deuteronomy: "Those who approach his feet will receive his teachings" (Deuteronomy 33:3).

110
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:29,211
The garment of the Son of God sometimes symbolically refers to his flesh, taken from divinity, as suggested by the divine books.

111
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:37,367
Isaiah, predicting about this garment of flesh, says: "Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?" (Isaiah 63:1).

112
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:44,375
Moreover, the garment of the Lord is understood as the holy Church, which is united with him through faith and love.

113
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:49,389
It is written in the psalm: "The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty" (Psalm 93:1).

114
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:56,941
And in another psalm to the Lord: "You are clothed with honor and majesty, wrapped in light as with a garment" (Psalm 104:2).

115
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:13,192
The cloak of Christ is seen as the aforementioned Church, about which it is written in the book of Genesis: "He washed his robe in wine," referring to his flesh in the blood of his suffering, and his cloak, meaning his Church, in the blood of the grape (Genesis 49:11).

116
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:21,227
The shoes of the Lord Jesus Christ mystically signify his incarnation, which he graciously took from the mortality of the human race.

117
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:32,706
He himself, through the prophet in the psalm, speaks of this incarnation: "I will throw my shoe over Edom," meaning, I will reveal my incarnation to the people of the Gentiles (Psalm 60:10).

118
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:45,816
The steps of the coming of the Son of God into the world and his return to the Father are described in the psalm: "Your processions are seen, O God, the processions of my God, my King, in the sanctuary" (Psalm 68:25).

119
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:52,582
He came from heaven into the Virgin's womb, and, being born from the womb, he was placed in a manger (Luke 2:7).

120
00:19:52,582 --> 00:20:00,738
After fulfilling all he was sent to do by the Father, he was hung on the wood of the cross; however, from the cross, he was taken down.

121
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:06,905
According to the body, he was buried, but according to the soul, he descended to the underworld.

122
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:11,673
On the third day, through the power of his divinity, he raised his body from the tomb.

123
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:19,378
On the fortieth day after his resurrection, he ascended into heaven in the sight of the Apostles, and sits at the right hand of the Father.

124
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:25,421
As stated in Acts chapter one, verse nine, and Mark chapter sixteen, verse nineteen, this means in his glory.

125
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:31,353
These are the steps of the Son of God: his descent and ascent, which are often read in the Holy Scriptures.

126
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:40,167
God is said to ascend when the Son took the flesh he assumed from us into heaven, leading captivity captive, as mentioned in Psalm sixty-eight, verse nineteen.

127
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:49,369
He took the nature of the human race, which was held captive by the devil in the world, with him into heaven, where it had never been before, as if it were a captive.

128
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:58,184
God is said to hide his face, as in Deuteronomy chapter thirty-two, verse twenty, when he hides his knowledge from some of the nations because of their faults.

129
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:08,827
We now see this fulfilled in the people of the Jews, who, by denying the Son of God, have lost the knowledge of the true God so much that they became like the nations who do not know the Lord.

130
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:21,245
God is said to show his face, as in Psalm seventy-nine, verse four, when, by the regard of his grace, he reveals himself through hidden inspiration in the hearts of his chosen ones, and instills his love in them to love him.

131
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:27,176
God is said to sit not physically in a human manner, but by power, to preside over all creation rationally.

132
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:33,607
As it is in the psalm: The Lord reigns over all nations, God sits on his holy throne, Psalm forty-seven, verse nine.

133
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:46,967
God is also said to sit on the Cherubim, as in Psalm ninety-nine, verse one, which is interpreted as the multitude or fullness of knowledge, signifying the holy angels or the minds of spiritual men, in whom God invisibly presides and reigns.

134
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:50,071
He sits in those who are full of his knowledge and love.

135
00:21:50,071 --> 00:22:02,655
In the Proverbs of Solomon, it is written, His soul is the seat of wisdom; the wisdom of God the Father is Christ, as mentioned in First Corinthians chapter one, verse twenty-four, who is said to sit in the souls of the saints.

136
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:08,207
God is said to descend into the world when something entirely new is created by humans.

137
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:19,569
This is similar to the descent of the Son of God, who took on true flesh from the Virgin Mary for our redemption, graciously becoming a true human—not by losing what He was, but by taking on what He was not.

138
00:22:19,569 --> 00:23:55,354
Regarding His descent, or incarnation, it is written in the psalm: "He inclined the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet" Psalm 18:10.
He inclined the heavens when, before His coming, He sent angels or prophets to announce His arrival to people.
The thick darkness under His feet refers to the fact that wicked people, due to their malice, could not recognize His incarnation, and still cannot.
God is said to stand when He patiently supports His creation, calling for repentance and conversion, as mentioned by the prophet Habakkuk: "He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook the nations" Habakkuk 3:6.
This signifies that He stood to intervene and freed believers in Him from the bonds of sin.
God is said to pass by when He leaves the hearts of certain people, in whom He was once believed through faith, and then, due to creeping disbelief or sin, He departs and moves to others.
This is akin to moving from the Jews to the Gentiles, from heretics to Catholics, or from irreligious people to the religious.
God is said to withdraw and move to others not physically or visibly, but invisibly and through hidden and just judgment, as is His custom.
God is said to walk, not by moving from place to place, as it would be impious to believe so, but His walking is the delight in the hearts of the saints, as it is written: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God" Second Corinthians 6:16.
Or certainly, God walks by moving from place to place through His holy preachers.
God speaks invisibly, without the sound of a voice or any noise, by secretly inspiring His will and right understanding into the minds of the saints, or by revealing the future, as He did with the holy prophets.

139
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:59,109
Some people believe that God communicates in three main ways.

140
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:10,822
The first way is through a created being, like when He appeared to Moses in the burning bush in Exodus 3:2, to Abraham in Genesis 18, to Jacob in Genesis 32:24, and to other saints through angels.

141
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:23,909
The second method is through dreams, like those experienced by Jacob in Genesis 28:12, the prophet Zechariah in Zechariah 4:1, Joseph, Mary's husband, in Matthew 1:20, and others to whom He wished to reveal His secrets.

142
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:30,303
The third way is not through visible creatures or people, but by secretly inspiring their hearts invisibly.

143
00:24:30,303 --> 00:25:51,576
This is reflected in the writings of the prophets, who, suddenly inspired by the divine spirit, would declare, "Thus says the Lord" in Isaiah 7:7.
When God "sees," it means approving good deeds, as in Genesis: "God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good" Genesis 1:31, indicating He showed goodness to those who understand.
Alternatively, God's "seeing" means knowing and rejecting human evil, as in the prophet Isaiah, "And God saw, and the evil appeared in His eyes" Isaiah 59:15.
Another aspect of God's seeing is making us see, as in the psalm, "Test me, God, and know my heart" Psalm 139:23, and further, "and see if there is any wicked way in me."
This way of speaking is also found in the book of Blessed Job, where regarding the wisdom of God the Father, through whom many great things were spoken, it is added about the Father, "Then He saw it and declared it; He established it and examined it" Job 28:27, meaning He made them see, preach, examine, and announce it to others.
Knowing by God involves making people aware, as He said to Abraham, "Now I know that you fear the Lord" Genesis 22:12.
For He does not learn in time, as He knows everything before it happens. But God is said to know by making people aware, so that what was previously unknown about themselves becomes clear to them through His questioning and testing.

144
00:25:51,816 --> 00:27:45,768
This is similar to the passage in the law of Moses regarding the people of Israel: "I will test them," he says, "to see whether they will follow my commandments or not" Exodus 16:4.
God's act of not knowing refers to rejecting certain people as reprobates, as it is mentioned in the Gospel: "I do not know where you come from; depart from me, all you evildoers" Luke 13:27.
God is described as zealous when He often disciplines, corrects, and punishes His creatures, whom He does not want to perish, bringing them back to Him through punishment. Alternatively, God is said to be zealous when He does not want to leave any sin unpunished. He is just, and therefore all injustice is detestable to Him, which, as mentioned, He does not allow to go unpunished.
God is said to be angry, not because of any emotion or disturbance, which cannot happen to Him at all, but to impose just retribution on the sinning creature, that is, on wicked people and sinners, giving them what they deserve. This divine retribution is called His wrath Psalm 6:1.
God is said to repent, not because He regrets past actions like humans do; for He, who knows before they happen, cannot regret accomplished acts. But God's repentance means changing His decrees, and what was previously one way, changing to another. This might mean changing from good to bad due to the faults of those deserving it, as it is written that the Lord regretted making Saul king First Samuel 15:12. Or, as we now see with the Jewish people, who, although once they were God's people, due to their impiety, became the synagogue of Satan Revelation 2:9.
But changing from bad to good, as happened with the Gentile people, who were not previously God's people, but now through Christ's grace, have been made God's people Romans 9:26.
In this hidden way of God's judgment, Judas the traitor fell from the rank of apostleship Acts 1:18 and was plunged into the abyss of hell. But the thief, who was previously guilty of theft, was transferred from the cross to paradise Luke 23:43.

145
00:27:45,768 --> 00:28:04,156
This change, whether from good to better, as mentioned, or from good to evil, or from evil to good, which happens by the hidden and just judgment of God, either through His severity of justice or through His mercy, is what we call the repentance of God:
this is more clearly written in the book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 18:8).

146
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:17,136
God does not repent or change what He has decreed, as it is said in the psalm: God has sworn, and He will not repent; that is, the Father to the Son: You are a Priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4).

147
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:32,678
The Son of God is called the Priest of the Father, not according to divinity, but according to humanity, in which He offered Himself as an acceptable sacrifice to God the Father for us through His passion and death, so that He Himself was both the sacrifice and the priest.

148
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:37,574
God is said to forget when He does not have mercy on certain wicked and sinful people.

149
00:28:37,574 --> 00:28:43,153
He does not do this out of cruelty, which is not in God, but through His hidden and just judgment.

150
00:28:43,153 --> 00:29:05,754
God is said to harden the hearts of some wicked people, as it is written about Pharaoh, king of Egypt (Exodus 7:3); not that the Almighty God hardens their hearts by His power, which is impious to believe, but because of their own sins, when He does not remove the hardness of heart with which they commit all evil acts:
it is as if He hardens them, whom He allows to be hardened by just judgment.

151
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:23,231
God's sleeping is described when the only begotten Son of the Father was willing to die for us in assumed flesh:
to whom death was rightly predicted as sweet sleep, as He Himself says through the prophet Jeremiah, Therefore I awoke as if from sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me (Jeremiah 31:26).

152
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:31,258
God is also said to sleep when His faith is not awake but sleeps amid the prosperity of this world and in the hearts of some faithful people.

153
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:36,610
This sleep was signified by Jesus Himself when He slept on the sea amid the waves (Mark 4:38).

154
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:44,808
Or certainly, God’s sleeping is to help the anxious more slowly, as it is said in the psalm: Arise, why do You sleep, O Lord (Psalm 44:23), etc.

155
00:29:44,808 --> 00:29:49,134
God's waking is to reveal Himself clearly in the defense of His chosen ones.

156
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:57,023
Chapter Two
About what are called the members of the Lord, or what they signify about Him.

157
00:29:57,023 --> 00:30:00,694
The eyes of the Lord are understood as divine observation.

158
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:06,137
In the Psalm: The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous (Psalm thirty-three, sixteen).

159
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:15,186
The eyelids of God represent His judgments that test the children of men; they are not wearied by the obscurities of things, but are exercised.

160
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:18,604
They are not inflated by knowledge, but are confirmed.

161
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,641
The ears of the Lord, when He chooses to listen.

162
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:27,210
In the Psalm: And His ears are attentive to their prayers (Psalm thirty-three, sixteen).

163
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,438
The mouth of the Lord signifies His word to people.

164
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:34,868
In the prophet: The mouth of the Lord has spoken (Isaiah one, twenty).

165
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:37,336
The word of the Lord refers to the Son.

166
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,829
In the Psalm: My heart has uttered a good word (Psalm forty-five, two).

167
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:46,512
The arm of the Lord, or hand, is the Son, through whom He made all things.

168
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:52,081
In the prophet: To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed (Isaiah fifty-three, one).

169
00:30:52,081 --> 00:31:01,194
The right hand of the Lord, as mentioned in the Psalm: The right hand of the Lord has done mighty things (Psalm one hundred seventeen, sixteen).

170
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:11,067
The finger of God is said to be the Holy Spirit, because of the distribution of gifts given by Him to each according to their own, whether of men or angels.

171
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:14,801
No parts of our body show such distribution as the fingers.

172
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:20,686
And do not be troubled by the diversity of the members, when the unity of the body builds up.

173
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:25,053
The womb of the Lord, the secret from which He brought forth the Son.

174
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:31,634
In the Psalm: From the womb before the morning star, I have begotten you (Psalm one hundred ten, three).

175
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:34,672
The feet of the Lord, the stability of eternity.

176
00:31:34,672 --> 00:31:38,722
In the Psalm: Darkness was under His feet (Psalm eighteen, ten).

177
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:42,076
The footsteps of the Lord, signs of His secret works.

178
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:46,886
In the Psalm: And your footsteps were not known (Psalm seventy-six, twenty).

179
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:49,987
The steps of the Lord, His coming, or visitation.

180
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:55,113
In the Psalm: Your processions were seen, O God (Psalm sixty-eight, twenty-five).

181
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,024
The armor of the Lord, His help to the saints.

182
00:31:58,024 --> 00:32:02,074
In the Psalm: Take up armor and shield (Psalm thirty-four, two).

183
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:04,543
The shield, the protection of the Lord.

184
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:10,555
In the Psalm: Lord, you have crowned us with the shield of your good will (Psalm five, twelve).

185
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,213
The sword, divine vengeance on the wicked.

186
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:17,706
In the Psalm: Draw out the spear, and close (Psalm thirty-four, three).

187
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:20,301
The bow, the intention of divine warning.

188
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:24,730
In the Psalm: He bent His bow and prepared it (Psalm seven, thirteen).

189
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,958
The arrows, divine commands, apostles, or prophets.

190
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:33,527
In the Psalm: He sent His arrows and scattered them (Psalm one hundred forty-four, six).

191
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,296
Sword, vengeance, or the word of the Lord.

192
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:44,488
The Apostle says: For the word of God is living, effective, and sharper than any two-edged sword.

193
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:45,828
Hebrews four, twelve.

194
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:47,296
Romphea, same as above.

195
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:50,168
Trumpet of the Lord, clear voice of the Lord.

196
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:56,105
The Apostle mentions: At the command, and the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God.

197
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:58,275
First Thessalonians four, fifteen.

198
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:02,615
Chariots of God, seat of God, or the fourfold nature of the Gospels.

199
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:06,764
In the psalm, it says: The chariots of God are ten thousand fold.

200
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:08,551
Psalm sixty-eight, eighteen.

201
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,828
Rod of the Lord signifies the kingdom, or correction of discipline.

202
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:17,360
In the psalm, we read: The rod of uprightness, the rod of your kingdom.

203
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,891
Psalm forty-five, seven.

204
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:21,700
Hand of the Lord, threats, or his vengeance.

205
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,083
Staff of the Lord, support of the Lord's consolation.

206
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,593
In the psalm: Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

207
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:30,189
Psalm twenty-three, four.

208
00:33:30,189 --> 00:33:36,317
Elsewhere, the staff of the Lord signifies the holy cross, or the discipline of the holy Church.

209
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:41,423
Also, a staff is any support, as in the Book of Tobit: The staff of our old age.

210
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:43,019
Tobit five, twenty-three.

211
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:49,440
Chapter Three
About Heavenly Creatures.

212
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,743
Coals symbolize the fire of love, serve as examples, or represent penance.

213
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:57,348
As mentioned in the psalm: "With burning coals" (Psalm 119:4).

214
00:33:57,348 --> 00:34:01,826
Smoke signifies the beginnings of future repentance or acts as God's warning.

215
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:06,012
In the psalm, it states: "Smoke went up from His nostrils" (Psalm 18:8).

216
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:10,432
On another note, smoke can also mean vanity, like smoke that harms the eyes.

217
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:12,293
Fire represents the Holy Spirit.

218
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:22,411
In the Acts of the Apostles, it says: "And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which rested on each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:3).

219
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:26,365
Heaven refers to apostles or saints because the Lord dwells in them.

220
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:29,389
"The heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1).

221
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:36,076
In holy Scripture, heavens sometimes symbolize the higher realms of the world, unknown to us in their distinctions.

222
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:49,451
It is difficult but not impossible to discuss these realms for those to whom God grants understanding, as He did with the Apostle, who was caught up to the third heaven (Second Corinthians 12:2); apart from those material heavens.

223
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:59,802
The apostles are called heavens, as they are the preachers of the word of truth; through whom, like rain, we have been nourished, allowing the Church's harvest to grow worldwide.

224
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:05,210
All holy and just souls are also heavens, where God dwells in the temple of faith and action.

225
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:15,328
Additionally, heaven represents holy Scripture; from which the sun of wisdom, the moon of knowledge, and the stars of examples and virtues from ancient fathers shine upon us.

226
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:25,970
This heaven is stretched out like a skin (Psalm 104:2), because it is formed by the tongues of the flesh through its writers and is explained before our eyes by the words of teachers.

227
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,156
Clouds symbolize prophets or saints, who rain down the word of the Lord.

228
00:35:30,156 --> 00:35:34,750
In Isaiah, it says: "I will command the clouds above not to rain" (Isaiah 5:6).

229
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,019
Clouds can also represent the times of the wicked in a negative sense: "My salvation has passed by like a cloud" (Job 30:15).

230
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:47,776
Thunder represents the voices of the Gospel because they resound from heaven with the words of God.

231
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:53,649
In the psalm: "The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind" (Psalm 77:18); this means, throughout.

232
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:56,499
Lightning signifies the brilliance of the Gospel.

233
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:01,034
In the psalm, it is written: "Your lightnings lit up the world" (Psalm 77:18).

234
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,792
Lightning, powers, or words of Jesus Christ.

235
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:09,980
In the psalm: He multiplied the lightning and troubled His enemies, referring to the Jews.

236
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:17,878
In Holy Scripture, the name of angels often refers to the Lord, as Isaiah testifies: His name shall be called the Angel of Great Counsel.

237
00:36:17,878 --> 00:38:08,155
Sometimes it refers to the angelic choir, as Christ told Peter, "Do you think I cannot ask my Father, and He will provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?" Matthew 26:53.
Other times, it refers to the citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem taken from among humans, as the Lord said in the Gospel, "In the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven." Matthew 22:30.
It can also refer to the faithful people, as in, "He set the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel." Deuteronomy 32:8.
This name can also designate any righteous person, as the Lord said about John the Baptist, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face." Matthew 11:10.
Sometimes, it refers to preachers or priests, as it is written, "The lips of a priest should keep knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord of hosts." Malachi 2:7.
And the Apostle: "A woman should cover her head in the church because of the angels"—referring to the bishops; every faithful person who proclaims good things claims the name of angel for themselves if they live well. First Corinthians 11:10.
Lastly, the devil and his fellow apostates are called evil angels; although they have lost their angelic dignity, they have not lost the subtlety of angelic nature.
Through these evil angels, adversities or illnesses occur by God's permission, when and where He wills.
Thrones, angels, or saints, or the very power of reigning.
In the psalm, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever." Psalm 45:7.
Also, in another part about the devil: "I will set my throne on the north." Isaiah 14:13.
Seats refer to the same, angels or saints, because the Lord sits in them, and through them, He decrees His judgments.
In the psalm, "God sits on His holy throne." Psalm 47:9.
The Sun, Lord Jesus Christ, who shines upon the earth.

238
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:17,236
In Solomon's writings, it is mentioned what the wicked will say at the end of time: "So, the sun of justice did not shine upon us" (Wisdom 5:6).

239
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:23,732
Elsewhere, persecution is symbolized, as in the phrase: "When the sun rose, they withered" (Matthew 3:6).

240
00:38:23,732 --> 00:38:28,434
The moon represents the Church, as it shines during the night of this world.

241
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:32,641
In the psalm: "He made the moon to mark the seasons" (Psalm 104:19).

242
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:38,704
It also symbolizes the weakness of our human flesh, as its phases of waning reflect our mortality.

243
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:43,344
The stars represent the saints, the wise, or those who teach righteousness.

244
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:47,242
In Daniel: "The wise shall shine like the stars" (Daniel 12:3).

245
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:52,315
Clouds symbolize the hidden mysteries of God and sometimes represent God's angels.

246
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:56,769
In the prophet Nahum: "The clouds are the dust of His feet" (Nahum 1:3).

247
00:38:56,769 --> 00:39:05,987
They can also signify the removal of sins, as Isaiah writes: "I have wiped out your iniquity like a cloud, and your sins like a mist" (Isaiah 44:22).

248
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:09,823
Darkness (or gloom) represents the covering of divine secrets.

249
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:13,473
In the psalms: "Darkness was under His feet" (Psalm 18:10).

250
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:16,567
The abyss represents the deep truths of Scripture.

251
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,598
In the psalms: "Deep calls to deep" (Psalm 42:8).

252
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:39,086
It can also refer to the depth of the Old and New Testaments, as in the idea that "Deep calls to deep"—the Old Testament proclaims the New. Alternatively, the abyss symbolizes the human mind, which cannot fully understand itself. Thus, the prophet says: "The abyss raises its voice from its depths" (Habakkuk 3:10).

253
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:46,634
Because the human mind cannot penetrate its own depths, it humbly praises God's divine nature, which it cannot comprehend.

254
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,294
The abyss can also signify God's judgments.

255
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:53,625
In the psalms: "Your judgments are like the great abyss" (Psalm 36:7).

256
00:39:53,625 --> 00:40:02,719
When sinners pass from present evils to eternal punishment—moving from the fire of desire to the flames of hell—this is the hidden judgment of God.

257
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:11,319
Dew symbolizes the word of the Lord because it refreshes the hearts of people, as in: "Drop down dew, O heavens, from above" (Isaiah 45:8).

258
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,330
In the psalms: "Like the dew of Hermon, which falls on Mount Zion" (Psalm 133:3).

259
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:25,115
Rain represents the Lord's commandments or teachings, or the words of the apostles, because it waters the earth (meaning it nourishes people).

260
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:30,126
In the psalms: "God will send abundant rain upon your inheritance" (Psalm 68:10).

261
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:35,895
Snow symbolizes the purity of justice and the cleansing of baptism.

262
00:40:35,895 --> 00:43:07,799
In the Psalm, Psalm 51:9, it says, "You will wash me, and I will be whiter than snow."
Hail represents the warnings of the Lord, striking the stubborn.
In Psalm 18:13, it mentions, "Hail and burning coals."
Additionally, in Psalm 78:47, it states, "He destroyed their vines with hail."
The coldness of snow and the hardness of hail reflect the life of the wicked, frozen in numbness and perishing through the hardness of evil.
Frost signifies abstinence, as it cools the body's heat.
In Psalm 119:83, it states, "I have become like a wineskin in the frost."
A storm signifies the force of persecutions or tribulations.
In Psalm 55:9, it says, "He rescued me from the spirit of faintness and from the storm."
Ice represents the hardness of sinners.
In Ecclesiasticus 3:17, Solomon states, "As ice in clear weather, your sins will melt away."
Winds symbolize the souls of the saints.
In Psalm 18:10, it says, "He soared on the wings of the wind."
Also, in a negative sense, in Matthew 7:25, it says, "The winds blew."
The north wind represents the devil, unfaithful or evil people, or the coldness of sin.
In Jeremiah 1:14, the prophet states, "From the north, evil will be unleashed upon the earth."
And elsewhere, "From the north, evil will spread."
In the Song of Solomon 4:16, it says, "Awake, O north wind," meaning, "Depart."
The term "right" is used similarly.
In Proverbs 25:23, Solomon states, "The north is a harsh wind."
However, it is called "right" because the devil arrogates to himself the name of "right," as if he were good, or because he becomes "right" to those who look to the west, that is, to sin.
The south wind represents the warmth of faith.
In Psalm 126:4, it states, "Like streams in the south."
It is also the Holy Spirit, as in the Song of Solomon 4:16, "Awake, O north wind, and come, O south wind," meaning, "Depart, devil, and come, nourishing spirit."
Air signifies the expression of vanity.
In First Corinthians 9:26, the Apostle states, "So I fight, not as one beating the air," meaning, not pursuing empty things.
Seasons represent the timely distribution of divine will.
In Psalm 104:19, it states, "He made the moon to mark the seasons."
Spring signifies the renewal of life, either through baptism or resurrection.
In Psalm 74:17, it states, "You made summer and spring."

263
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:10,605
Summer symbolizes the joy that is yet to come.

264
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:16,888
In the Psalm, as previously mentioned, winter represents the current life, persecution, or tribulation.

265
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:23,048
In the Gospel: Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath (Matthew 24:20).

266
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:28,904
Years can sometimes symbolize eternity, as seen in: And your years will not fail (Psalm 102:28).

267
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:35,675
Other times, they represent the fleeting nature of life, as in: Our years are like a spider's web (Psalm 89:3).

268
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:49,582
The term months, which are made up of days, signifies the gathering of souls or the perfection of the saints, as in: From one month to another (Isaiah 66:23), referring to those at rest, who now have perfection in their actions.

269
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:55,193
Day and night represent justice and iniquity, faith and disbelief, prosperity and adversity.

270
00:43:55,193 --> 00:44:00,988
In the Psalm: In the day the Lord commands his mercy, and at night he declares it (Psalm 41:9).

271
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:06,782
The term days also refers to the illumination of divine grace through various gifts of virtues.

272
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:13,187
Sometimes, day signifies a fallen angel, as Job mentions: Let those who curse the day curse it (Job 3:8).

273
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:18,433
The term night signifies either the blindness of ignorance or the bitterness of death.

274
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:22,214
Light and darkness are most often understood as day and night.

275
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:30,510
In the letter of John: Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, but whoever hates his brother is in the darkness (First John 2:10).

276
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,316
Light also reveals the intention of the heart.

277
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:35,451
Shadow signifies divine protection.

278
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:39,659
In the Psalm: Protect me under the shadow of your wings (Psalm 16:8).

279
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:46,735
Otherwise, it signifies forgetfulness or sins, as in: Sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death (Psalm 106:10).

280
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:53,322
Sometimes shadow signifies the delight in sins, as in Job: He sleeps under the shadow in secret (Job 40:16).

281
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:59,178
Again, shadow can mean forgetfulness of the mind, death of the flesh, or imitation of the devil.

282
00:44:59,178 --> 00:45:08,632
The term light signifies the Lord or any righteous person, as in the Gospel: The true light that gives light to every man coming into the world (John 1:9).

283
00:45:08,632 --> 00:45:14,183
And the Apostle: You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord (Ephesians 5:8).

284
00:45:14,183 --> 00:45:18,087
It is also used to represent the illumination of faith and life.

285
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:26,450
Some believe we are in the final era of the world, akin to five hundred years, if a single day represents the whole age.

286
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:31,763
As stated in the Epistle of John:
My little children, it is the last hour
First John 2:18.

287
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:39,731
The East symbolizes the Savior, as light rises from there, especially as Luke mentions:
The dawn from on high has visited us
Luke 1:78.

288
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:44,630
And in Zechariah, it says:
Behold, the man whose name is the Branch
Zechariah 6:12.

289
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,345
The West represents the loss of a better life.

290
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:50,769
As the prophet states:
Your sun will set at noon
Amos 8:9.

291
00:45:50,769 --> 00:46:04,758
The North is often associated with adversity, as the prophet speaks of the devil:
I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north
Isaiah 14:13;
and elsewhere:
From the north, disaster will be poured out
Jeremiah 1:14.

292
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:08,948
Morning signifies good deeds, baptism, or the resurrection of the Lord.

293
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:23,114
In the psalm:
In the morning, I will stand before you and see
Psalm 5:3;
and elsewhere:
From the watch of the morning until night, let Israel hope in the Lord
Psalm 130:6,
meaning from the resurrection of the Lord until the day of judgment.

294
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:39,464
Morning also represents the prosperity of this life, as mentioned in:
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning
Ecclesiastes 10:16;
they feast in the morning when lifted by worldly prosperity, instead of waiting for eternal happiness.

295
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:42,416
Noon signifies the clarity of teachings and deeds.

296
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:45,839
In Solomon:
Where do you rest at noon
Song of Solomon 1:7.

297
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:54,870
And in a negative sense in the psalm:
From the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday
Psalm 91:6,
meaning openly.

298
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:03,901
Evening symbolizes the end of life, the world, or punishment;
as the psalm says:
Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning
Psalm 30:5.

299
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:11,810
Dawn represents the mind of the just, moving from sin's darkness to the light, illuminated by the sun of justice
Song of Solomon 6:10.

300
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:22,494
Arcturus, shining with the rays of seven stars in the heavens, symbolizes the universal Church, as depicted in Revelation by the seven churches and seven lampstands
Revelation 1:20.

301
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:28,455
Orions, rising in winter, represent the holy martyrs who endured persecution and emerged into heaven.

302
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:36,821
The Hyades are named after the Greek letter y because they resemble its shape and are associated with bringing rain when they appear.

303
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:42,122
They symbolize holy preachers as they shower words and beneficially water the hearts of people.

304
00:47:42,122 --> 00:47:45,080
In Greek, hyetos means rain, which is imber in Latin.

305
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:49,847
Chapter Four
About Earthly Things.

306
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:55,375
Earth represents the person himself. In the Gospel: Some fell on good soil.

307
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,144
Mark Chapter 4, Verse 8.

308
00:47:57,144 --> 00:48:00,756
Also: You are dust, and to dust you shall return.

309
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,819
Genesis Chapter 3, Verse 19.

310
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:09,305
Also in a negative sense, about the sinner: You will eat dust all the days of your life.

311
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:11,369
Genesis Chapter 3, Verse 14.

312
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:24,120
In another way, those engaged in earthly deeds, through alms and tears, reach eternal life: as in the Psalms: He called the heavens above, and the earth to judge His people.

313
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,447
Psalm 50, Verse 4.

314
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:33,112
Dry land represents unfruitful people: in Ecclesiasticus: Cover the dry land with wickedness and deceit.

315
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:35,692
Ecclesiasticus Chapter 37, Verse 3.

316
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:43,283

317
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:44,536
Psalm 1, Verse 4.

318
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:51,391

319
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:52,791
Psalm 69, Verse 15.

320
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,412
Also in another sense.

321
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:57,434
In John: He made mud and smeared my eyes.

322
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,277
John Chapter 9, Verse 11.

323
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:09,080
Mountains represent the Lord, the Church, apostles, or saints, from the height of virtues: in the Psalms: Who descends on Mount Zion.

324
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,480
Psalm 133, Verse 3.

325
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:18,145

326
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,061

00:49:25,221 --> 00:49:27,432
Jeremiah Chapter 13, Verse 16.

329
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:28,685
meaning heretics.

330
00:49:28,685 --> 00:49:34,876
Hills symbolize saints, but of lesser merit: in the Psalms: Mountains and all hills.

331
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:36,276
Psalm 148, Verse 9.

332
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:42,099
Also in another sense: in the Gospel: Every mountain and hill will be made low.

333
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:43,868
Luke Chapter 3, Verse 5.

334
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:51,902

335
00:49:51,902 --> 00:49:53,302
Psalm 65, Verse 14.

336

Support me with flowers.

422
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,191
Song of Solomon 2:1.

423
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:48,841
Lily, Christ, or angels in the brightness of righteousness: In Solomon:
I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys.

424
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:49,914
Song of Solomon.

425
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:53,535
Roses, martyrs, from the redness of blood: in Solomon.

426
00:55:56,016 --> 00:56:03,610
As a rose blooms over moist streams, confessors are like violets due to the similarity of their bruised bodies.

427
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,509
In the Song of Songs: Flowers have appeared on the earth.

428
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:16,267
(Song of Solomon, Chapter 2, Verse 12)
Forests and nations are mentioned in the Psalms: We found it in the fields of the forest.

429
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:26,871
(Psalm 132, Verse 6) From these forests came two bears, specifically Vespasian and Titus, the kings of the Romans, at the command of the figurative Elisha.

430
00:56:26,871 --> 00:56:32,960
After forty-two years of his ascension to the heavens, they devoured the Jewish children.

431
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,707
(Second Kings, Chapter 2, Verse 24)
Thickets, dense or covered, of divine Scripture.

432
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:41,718
In the Psalms: And He revealed the thickets.

433
00:56:41,718 --> 00:56:45,959
(Psalm 29, Verse 9)
Wood represents sinners destined for fire.

434
00:56:45,959 --> 00:56:49,996
In Ecclesiastes: He who cuts wood will be endangered by it.

435
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:56,017
(Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10, Verse 9) In a good sense: And he will be like a tree planted.

436
00:56:56,017 --> 00:57:07,100
(Psalm 1, Verse 3)
Sometimes, wood symbolizes the holy cross, as the prophet says: Let us put wood in his bread; meaning to hang Christ on the cross in the flesh.

437
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,684
(Jeremiah, Chapter 11, Verse 19) Also: Behold, I gather two sticks.

438
00:57:11,684 --> 00:57:17,294
(First Kings, Chapter 17, Verse 12)
Wood also signifies the righteous and sinners.

439
00:57:17,294 --> 00:57:24,136
As Solomon says: If a tree falls to the south or to the north, wherever it falls, there it will lie.

440
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:32,004
(Ecclesiastes, Chapter 11, Verse 3) On the day of death, the righteous falls to the south, the sinner to the north.

441
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:41,035
The righteous are led to joy through the fervor of the spirit, while the sinner is rejected with the apostate angel in a cold heart.

442
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:47,055
Root, origin: as mentioned in the Apostle: But if the root is holy, so are the branches.

443
00:57:47,055 --> 00:57:54,923
(Romans, Chapter 11, Verse 16) In a bad sense, in the Psalms: He will uproot your root from the land of the living.

444
00:57:54,923 --> 00:58:06,828
(Psalm 52, Verse 5)
Tree, man, by the fruit of deeds: in the Gospel: Either make the tree good and its fruit good; and in a bad sense: Or make the tree bad and its fruit bad.

445
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:14,901
(Matthew, Chapter 12, Verse 33) Some believe this tree should be taken as the will of man rather than the man himself.

446
00:58:14,901 --> 00:58:20,169
Christ was also a tree when he resurrected, having been a grain when he died.

447
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:26,600
Branch, succession: as mentioned in the Apostle: But if the root is holy, so are the branches.

448
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:32,826
(Romans, Chapter 11, Verse 16) Likewise, in another sense, in Daniel: Cut off its branches.

449
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:34,810
(Daniel, Chapter 4, Verse 14)

450
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:40,021
Similarly, branches represent the teachings of the holy Fathers.

451
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:44,625
In the Gospel, some cut branches from the trees. Matthew twenty-one, verse eight.

452
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,557
A leaf symbolizes a teaching word.

453
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:49,569
As stated in the psalm: And its leaf will not wither.

454
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:50,876
Psalm one, verse three.

455
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:56,162
In another sense, a leaf represents clothing and beauty under the protection of divine grace.

456
00:58:56,162 --> 00:58:59,743
Negatively, when He found no fruit on it because of the leaves.

457
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:01,732
Matthew twenty-one, verse nineteen.

458
00:59:01,732 --> 00:59:03,892
This suggests words without substance.

459
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:09,064
Hence, the Apostle advises us to love not just in words or speech but in actions and truth.

460
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:10,939
First John three, verse eighteen.

461
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:15,259
A person is also likened to a leaf, having fallen from the tree in paradise.

462
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:21,852
Apples, representing the virtues of the saints, are mentioned in the Song of Songs: And eat the fruit of his apples.

463
00:59:21,852 --> 00:59:23,670
Song of Solomon five, verse one.

464
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,001
The palm signifies perfection or victory.

465
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,865
As noted in the psalm: The righteous will flourish like a palm tree.

466
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,627
Psalm ninety-two, verse twelve.

467
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:34,924
The palm grows slowly but remains vibrant for a long time.

468
00:59:34,924 --> 00:59:43,506
Thus, the holy Church, through many challenges, reaches a state of faith and aims to endure for the gathering of many into the glory of the same faith.

469
00:59:43,506 --> 00:59:49,019
The palm is tightly bound below by its bark layers but expands above with its lush green foliage.

470
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:53,623
Similarly, the life of the chosen is often undervalued below but beautiful above.

471
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:57,317
The palm has a unique quality distinguishing it from other trees.

472
00:59:57,317 --> 01:00:04,194
While most trees are sturdy near the ground and narrow as they rise, the palm grows stronger near its branches and fruit.

473
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:06,808
What starts slender below broadens at the top.

474
01:00:06,808 --> 01:00:09,991
To whom are such trees similar, if not to earthly minds?

475
01:00:09,991 --> 01:00:11,980
They are broad below, narrow above.

476
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,414
Indeed, worldly loves are strong in earthly matters but weak in heavenly ones.

477
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:22,438
People strive for temporal glory even unto death, yet for the hope of eternity, they endure little effort.

478
01:00:22,438 --> 01:00:29,656
For earthly gains, they tolerate many injuries, but for heavenly reward, they refuse even the smallest insult of a single word.

479
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:35,573
They can stand all day before an earthly judge, showing great strength.

480
01:00:35,573 --> 01:00:39,410
Yet, in prayer before the Lord, they tire in less than an hour.

481
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:47,086
Often, they endure exposure, sleeplessness, and hunger to gain wealth and honors, inflicting much self-denial upon themselves.

482
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:52,934
On the other hand, the progress of a righteous life is symbolized by the evenness of palm trees.

483
01:00:52,934 --> 01:01:02,376
These people are not strong in earthly pursuits and weak in heavenly ones; instead, they show more devotion to God than they remember showing to the world.

484
01:01:02,376 --> 01:01:14,742
Therefore, it is rightly written, as I have reminded you: "The righteous will flourish like a palm tree."
Cedar trees represent men of greater power: "He will grow like a cedar of Lebanon" (Psalm 92:15).

485
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:21,809
And in a bad sense, they represent the proud and arrogant: "The Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon" (Psalm 29:5).

486
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:29,789
The olive tree symbolizes a holy person abundant in mercy: "But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God" (Psalm 52:10).

487
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:37,404
The wild olive tree represents a person without fruit, or a Gentile: "If you were cut from a wild olive tree" (Romans 11:24).

488
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:43,556
The fig tree sometimes represents the synagogue: "The fig tree withered immediately" (Matthew 21:19).

489
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:47,699
And in Habakkuk: "The fig tree will not bear fruit" (Habakkuk 3:17).

490
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:56,166
The fig tree is understood in both good and bad senses, as in Isaiah: "And he showed me very good figs, and very bad ones" (Jeremiah 24:3).

491
01:01:56,166 --> 01:02:04,207
And the Lord said to Nathanael: "When you were under the fig tree that is, under original sin, I saw you to redeem you" (John 1:48).

492
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:15,416
The fig tree also represents human nature or the unbelieving synagogue, which, though well-created, fell of its own accord and did not produce the fruit of God's command or good works.

493
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:24,310
Thus, the Lord sought fruit from it for three years and found none because He visited, admonished, and sought it during three periods (Luke 13:7).

494
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,721
That is, before the law, under the law, and under grace.

495
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:36,737
Before the law, He sustained it by sparing it; under grace, He demonstrated His presence in His incarnation; under the law, He taught by commanding.

496
01:02:36,737 --> 01:02:41,793
Yet, during these three periods, it remained fruitless and withered from the roots.

497
01:02:41,793 --> 01:02:47,215
The sycamore, known as the foolish fig tree, was climbed by little Zacchaeus (Luke 19:4).

498
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:54,187
He saw the Lord because those who humbly embrace worldly wisdom can subtly perceive the wisdom of God.

499
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:59,717
We climb the sycamore wisely if we hold onto the commendable and divinely commanded foolishness.

500
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:08,934
What seems more foolish in this world than not seeking what's lost, giving away what we have, letting go to those who take, and not returning injury for injury?

501
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:12,909
Yet, according to the Lord's command, we show patience in all things.

502
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:18,842
Hyssop, a humble herb that clings to the stone it grows on, is known for its roots that penetrate rock.

503
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:20,570
It especially heals the lungs.

504
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:24,948
Pride is associated with the lungs: where there's inflation, there's breath.

505
01:03:24,948 --> 01:03:27,598
Thus, hyssop symbolizes humility and patience.

506
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:38,255
Buckthorn, nettles, thistles, brambles, and thorny plants symbolize the cruel, deceitful, proud, and wicked, whom no good or gentle person can touch or chastise without feeling remorse.

507
01:03:38,255 --> 01:03:46,895
They also represent vices and the struggles of temptation, as mentioned in Genesis: "Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth for you" (Genesis 3:18).

508
01:03:46,895 --> 01:03:59,453
The pomegranate represents the Church, drawing from many nations or possessing diverse graces, as noted in the Song of Songs: "Your branches are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruit of apples" (Song of Songs 4:3).

509
01:03:59,453 --> 01:04:08,785
Alternatively, apples are seen as the fruits of good deeds with a pleasant fragrance, symbolizing the grace of a good reputation and the fruits of good character.

510
01:04:08,785 --> 01:04:17,944
A reed represents a sinner, someone fragile in faith, or under some temptation, as mentioned in the Gospel: "A bruised reed he will not break" (Matthew 12:20).

511
01:04:17,944 --> 01:04:28,659
A reed also signifies weak support, as described in Isaiah: "Why do you rely on this reed-like staff of Egypt? If anyone leans on it, it will break and pierce his hand..." (Isaiah 36:6).

512
01:04:28,659 --> 01:04:40,986
The bramble is thought by some to prefigure the Virgin Mary because, from the thorny human condition, she brought forth the Savior like a rose, or because she bore the divine brilliance without a man's involvement.

513
01:04:40,986 --> 01:04:50,087
In Exodus: "The Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush, and he saw that the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed" (Exodus 3:2).

514
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:59,682
The burning bush, which was not consumed, symbolizes the Jewish people, who received the flame of God's law yet faced the consequences of sin.

515
01:04:59,682 --> 01:05:06,506
Thorns sometimes represent the harmful worries of wealth, suffocating the mind and the anxieties of this world.

516
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:17,326
As the Gospel states:
Some fell among thorns (Luke chapter eight, verse six);
and again:
They are choked by worries, riches, and pleasures (Luke chapter eight, verse fourteen).

517
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:27,962
Thistles symbolize the sharp points of vices or temptations, as mentioned in Genesis:
Thorns and thistles will it bring forth to you (Genesis chapter three, verse eighteen).

518
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:35,462
Springs represent baptism, as indicated in the psalm:
As the deer longs for streams of water (Psalm forty-two, verse two).

519
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:50,279
The spring also represents Christ, as seen in the psalm:
My soul thirsts for God, the living spring (Psalm forty-two, verse two);
and in Isaiah:
On that day a spring will be open to the house of David (Zechariah chapter thirteen, verse one).

520
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:57,041
In a negative sense, the Apostle refers to:
Springs without water (Second Peter chapter two, verse seventeen).

521
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:06,140
Waters often represent temptations, as noted in the psalm:
Perhaps the waters would have overwhelmed us (Psalm one hundred twenty-four, verse four).

522
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,505
Also:
The waters have come up to my soul (Psalm sixty-nine, verse two).

523
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:25,629
In a positive sense, Jeremiah states:
They have forsaken me, the spring of living water (Jeremiah chapter two, verse thirteen);
and in Isaiah:
You who are thirsty, go to the water (Isaiah chapter fifty-five, verse one),
referring to the teaching.

524
01:06:25,629 --> 01:06:29,379
In Holy Scripture, water sometimes signifies the Holy Spirit.

525
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:41,737
This is illustrated by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit: as mentioned in the Gospel:
Whoever believes in me, rivers of living water will flow from within them (John chapter seven, verse thirty-eight).

526
01:06:41,737 --> 01:06:52,372
The angelic choir is also expressed through water, as in the psalm:
Let the waters above the heavens praise the name of the Lord (Psalm one hundred forty-eight, verse four).

527
01:06:52,372 --> 01:07:02,394
Additionally, sacred knowledge is symbolized by water, as in the Book of Wisdom:
They will drink the water of wisdom (Ecclesiasticus chapter fifteen, verse three).

528
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:08,418
Furthermore:
The words from a man's mouth are deep waters (Proverbs chapter eighteen, verse four).

529
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:11,554
Perverse knowledge is also described through water.

530
01:07:11,554 --> 01:07:21,145
As Solomon states, the woman symbolizing heresy flatters with cunning persuasions, saying,
Stolen water is sweeter (Proverbs chapter nine, verse seventeen).

531
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:32,026
Water can also signify the prosperity of this world, as in the psalm:
We went through fire and water, and you brought us to a place of abundance (Psalm sixty-six, verse twelve).

532
01:07:33,071 --> 01:09:55,031
Fire and water are both dangerous, as noted in the Gospel: "It often threw him into fire and into water to destroy him."
Mark Chapter 9, Verse 22.
When challenges and hardships arise in life, it's like facing fire.
When prosperity and abundance overflow, it's like water.
Water also represents people, as stated in Revelation: "The many waters are many peoples."
Revelation Chapter 17, Verse 15.
Water not only signifies the movement of people but also represents the minds of good individuals following the teachings of faith, as mentioned in Isaiah: "Blessed are you who sow beside all waters."
Isaiah Chapter 32, Verse 20.
Water also symbolizes baptism, as the Evangelist John says: "There are three that testify on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood."
First John Chapter 5, Verse 8.
The Spirit makes us children of God through adoption.
The water of the sacred font cleanses us.
The blood of the Lord redeems us.
A torrent refers to the rush of persecution or the slipping away of death, as in the psalm: "He drinks from the torrent along the way."
Psalm 110, Verse 7.
Also: "The torrent has overwhelmed my soul."
Psalm 124, Verse 5.
And in a positive sense: "You give them drink from your river of delights."
Psalm 36, Verse 8.
Torrents are also likened to holy preachers who, during this life, flow to us with divine words, gathered like waters in winter.
When the summer sun comes, they withdraw, for when the light of the eternal homeland shines, they will cease to preach.
Rivers can represent the peoples of unbelievers, as in the psalm: "By the rivers of Babylon."
Psalm 137, Verse 1.
Also in a positive sense: "Rivers of living water will flow from within them;" meaning various gifts of the Spirit.
John Chapter 7, Verse 38.
Thus in the psalm: "The river's flow brings joy to the city of God."
Psalm 46, Verse 4.
The lake represents hell, as in the psalm: "You have put me in the lowest pit;" that is, in that place of hell where sinners are kept in penal custody.
Psalm 88, Verse 6.
The sea signifies the world or the peoples, as mentioned in the psalm: "This great and wide sea."
Psalm 104, Verse 25.
The sea also signifies sacred Scriptures, as in Ezekiel: "The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the vision of the sea."

533
01:09:55,031 --> 01:10:01,955
So, holy scriptures are aptly likened to the vision of the sea, as the words are affirmed by the sacrament of baptism.

534
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:04,478
Fish can symbolize both saints and sinners.

535
01:10:04,478 --> 01:11:39,650
In the Gospel: "And they hauled in a net full of large fish" John 21:11.
Also, in a negative sense: "But the bad ones they threw away" Matthew 13:48.
Again, fish express genuine faith; just as a fish is born, lives, and thrives under water, so faith in God, which brings the joys of another life through current sorrows and unceasing tears, is sanctified in the heart by the unseen grace of the spirit through baptism.
It is sustained by the invisible aid of divine protection, so it does not falter.
It does good as much as it can by the unseen promise of rewards, remembering the words of the Apostle: "For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal" Second Corinthians 4:18.
Moreover, the roasted fish signifies suffering; the waves signify temptations.
In the psalms: "All your waves and billows have gone over me" Psalm 41:8.
Waves also signify the fear of God, as in the book of Job: "For I have always feared the Lord like swollen waves over me" Job 31:23.
Thus, as mentioned earlier in the Song: "The waves congealed in the heart of the sea" Exodus 15:8.
Islands represent souls or the Churches of God, which face various waves of temptations.
In the psalms: "Let many islands be glad" Psalm 96:1.
The shore represents the end of the world.
In the Gospel: "And sitting by the shore, they chose the good ones into vessels" Matthew 13:48.
The sand of the sea represents the countless multitudes of people.
In Genesis: "And I will multiply your descendants, that is, the saints, like the stars of heaven, and like the sand, sinners, which is by the seashore" Genesis 22:17.

536
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:44,639
Chapter Five
About Living Creatures.

537
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,803
Birds, the holy ones, soar upward with their hearts.

538
01:11:47,803 --> 01:14:00,359
In the Gospel, it says: "And it grew large branches, so that the birds of the air could nest in its shade" Mark 4:32.
Birds can also symbolize excessive thoughts, as shown by Abraham, who drove away birds that swooped down on his sacrifice to God Genesis 15:11.
During the sacrifice of prayer, unwelcome thoughts can intrude and pollute the hearts of the just.
But when these thoughts are quickly driven away with discretion, it prevents the shadow of temptation from covering the heart, which might have been touched by illicit pleasure.
Flying represents the holy ones' transcendence into God or understanding of Scriptures.
In Psalms, it says: "I will fly away and be at rest" Psalm 55:7.
Birds, in a positive sense, reflect what we've discussed about them.
In a negative sense, they symbolize proud demons, as the Lord says in the Gospel: "Other seed fell by the path, and the birds of the air devoured it" Luke 8:5.
Evil spirits besiege human minds, planting harmful thoughts and snatching the word of life from memory.
Wings symbolize the two Testaments.
In Ezekiel, it says: "Each covered its body with two wings" Ezekiel 1:23.
Wings also represent the virtues of the holy ones, through which they fly to contemplation or heavenly things, or divine protection.
Feathers symbolize Scripture.
In the psalm, it mentions: "The wings of a dove covered with silver" Psalm 68:14.
The nest represents the Church or a place of high rest for the holy ones.
In the psalm, it states: "The turtledove has found a nest for itself, where it may lay its young" Psalm 84:4.
Alternatively, a nest signifies a good conscience, where good thoughts are nurtured and brought into action, later becoming known as children.
In the psalm, it says: "Your children will be like olive shoots around your table" Psalm 128:3.
Chicks symbolize the holy ones.
This is mentioned in the psalm, as noted earlier.
In the book of Job, it says: "Its young ones drink blood" Job 39:30.
This refers to the children of the holy Church, who partake in the blood of Christ.
And in a negative sense.
In Solomon, it says: "And may the ravens of the valley pick it out" Proverbs 30:17.
Eagles symbolize the holy ones.

539
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:04,872
In the Gospel, it says: Wherever the body is, there the eagles will gather.

540
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:09,684
This verse is from the book of Matthew, chapter twenty-four, verse twenty-eight.

541
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:16,483
It suggests that holy souls, upon leaving the body, are gathered to Christ, who took on a body and died for them.

542
01:14:16,483 --> 01:14:21,536
The eagle also symbolizes Christ, as Solomon notes: The way of the eagle in the sky.

543
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:26,770
This is from Proverbs, chapter thirty, verse nineteen, referring to Christ's ascension.

544
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:30,921
In a negative context, it is said: May the eagle's chicks devour him.

545
01:14:30,921 --> 01:14:36,095
Similarly, in Jeremiah, regarding evil spirits: Our pursuers were swifter than eagles.

546
01:14:36,095 --> 01:14:39,464
This is from Lamentations, chapter four, verse nineteen.

547
01:14:39,464 --> 01:14:42,111
The eagle can also represent earthly storms.

548
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:49,391
The ostrich symbolizes any heretic, philosopher, or hypocrite, who seems to possess the wings of wisdom but does not fly.

549
01:14:49,391 --> 01:14:54,564
In Isaiah, it states: It will be a habitation of dragons, and a pasture for ostriches.

550
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:57,994
This is from Isaiah, chapter thirty-four, verse thirteen.

551
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:05,393
The ostrich lays eggs but does not nurture its young, much like a hypocrite who preaches well but fails to lead by example.

552
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:12,011
As noted in the book of Job: The ostrich leaves its eggs on the ground and forgets that a foot may crush them.

553
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,260
This is from Job, chapter thirty-nine, verse fourteen.

554
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:20,674
The pelican represents the Lord Christ in His Passion or a holy man dedicated to solitude.

555
01:15:20,674 --> 01:15:24,585
As mentioned in the psalm: I am like a pelican of the wilderness.

556
01:15:24,585 --> 01:15:27,472
This is from Psalm one hundred two, verse seven.

557
01:15:27,472 --> 01:15:30,601
The raven symbolizes the darkness of sins or demons.

558
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:35,594
In Proverbs, it says: Let the ravens of the valley pick it out or the young eagles.

559
01:15:35,594 --> 01:15:38,903
This is from Proverbs, chapter thirty, verse seventeen.

560
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:46,603
However, in a positive sense, in the Song of Songs about the bridegroom: His locks are like clusters of dates, black as a raven.

561
01:15:46,603 --> 01:15:50,033
This is from Song of Solomon, chapter five, verse eleven.

562
01:15:50,033 --> 01:15:52,379
The partridge is a symbol of the devil.

563
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:57,071
As stated by the prophet: The partridge called, gathering what it did not lay.

564
01:15:57,071 --> 01:16:00,380
This is from Jeremiah, chapter seventeen, verse eleven.

565
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,546
The dove represents the Holy Spirit.

566
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:07,419
In the Gospel, it is written: And I saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove.

567
01:16:07,419 --> 01:16:10,367
This is from John, chapter one, verse thirty-two.

568
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,022
In a negative sense, as the prophet says: And Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense.

569
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:18,910
This is from Hosea, chapter seven, verse eleven.

570
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:24,024
The turtledove symbolizes the Holy Spirit, a holy person, or spiritual understanding.

571
01:16:24,024 --> 01:16:28,836
In the Song of Songs, it says: The voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.

572
01:16:28,836 --> 01:16:32,205
This is from Song of Solomon, chapter two, verse twelve.

573
01:16:32,205 --> 01:16:37,740
The dove is called the Holy Spirit when there is a clear explanation of the holy Scriptures.

574
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:44,358
The turtledove is considered the Holy Spirit when the Scriptures are elevated with deep and obscure mysteries.

575
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:54,717
The dove symbolizes simplicity, while the turtledove signifies chastity because it doesn't seek another mate after losing its first.

576
01:16:54,717 --> 01:16:58,343
The kite, I think, represents a greedy or arrogant person.

577
01:16:58,343 --> 01:17:02,845
In the psalm, according to the Hebrews: The fir tree is the kite's home.

578
01:17:02,845 --> 01:17:07,597
The hawk sometimes symbolizes a holy person who captures the kingdom of God.

579
01:17:07,597 --> 01:17:14,725
By shedding its old feathers and casting off deceitful habits, it embraces a new life of simple, righteous living.

580
01:17:14,725 --> 01:17:18,101
In the Book of Job: Does the hawk soar by your wisdom?

581
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:23,228
The night heron represents Christ or a holy person who is despised by unbelievers.

582
01:17:23,228 --> 01:17:27,730
In the psalm: I have become like an owl in a ruined house (Psalm 102:7).

583
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,419
The sparrow sometimes represents the Lord or a holy person.

584
01:17:31,419 --> 01:17:34,983
In the psalm: Even the sparrow finds a home (Psalm 84:3).

585
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:46,987
And elsewhere, it's about any Christian told by heretics, who believe they alone possess Christ, referred to as the mountain in the Scriptures: Fly to the mountain like a sparrow (Psalm 11:1).

586
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:50,801
The rooster, I believe, represents the Lord or a holy person.

587
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:55,178
In Solomon: The rooster walks proudly among the hens (Proverbs 30:31).

588
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:58,117
And in Job: Who gave the rooster understanding?

589
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:58,867
(Job 38:36).

590
01:17:58,867 --> 01:18:03,556
And on the other hand: I will carry you away like a rooster (Isaiah 22:17).

591
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:11,559
The name of the rooster signifies holy preachers who, amidst the darkness of this life, announce the coming light as if singing.

592
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:14,623
They say: The night is gone, and the day is near.

593
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:31,442
The rooster is also described as walking with girded loins (Proverbs 30:31), because these holy preachers, announcing the true morning in this night's darkness, restrain the excesses of lust in their bodies, to whom the Lord says, Let your loins be girded (Luke 12:35).

594
01:18:31,442 --> 01:18:47,448
The rooster is also granted understanding from above because the teacher of truth is divinely provided with discernment to know what, to whom, when, and how to impart, as not every exhortation suits everyone, since not everyone follows the same moral path.

In reference to the beetle, the prophet says: "And the beetle will cry out from the wood," which some interpret as relating to the Lord.
Locusts refer to people.
In the Gospel, it says: "His food was locusts" (Matthew 3:4).

601
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:31,018
The term locusts sometimes describes the people of the Jews, at other times converted gentiles, flattering speech, or even the resurrection of the Lord.

602
01:19:31,018 --> 01:19:33,569
It can also signify the life of preachers.

603
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,938
The bee symbolizes virginity or wisdom.

604
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:41,343

605
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:46,810

606
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:52,823
And in Psalms: "They surrounded me like bees" (Psalm 118:12), referring to the malicious and angry.

607
01:19:52,823 --> 01:20:01,084
Bees can also represent those who speak sweetly but secretly harm, like those who offer the sweetness of honey while inflicting a sting.

608
01:20:01,084 --> 01:20:07,704
This name can indicate wise sayings as well, such as: "Pleasant words are like a honeycomb" (Proverbs 16:24).

609
01:20:07,704 --> 01:20:12,199
The fly can symbolize the devil, his servant, or the impurity of idolatry.

610
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:17,058
As Solomon says: "Dead flies spoil the perfume's fragrance" (Ecclesiastes 10:1).

611

615
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:43,176

As mentioned in Kings: "And two bears came out and ate them" (Second Kings 2:24).

622
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,877
This is because Vespasian and Titus, the Roman emperors, destroyed the Jews.

623
01:21:18,877 --> 01:21:21,655
The deer symbolizes Christ or the saints.

624

637
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:42,552
(Psalm 22:21)
In a negative sense, it refers to anyone proud and violent, or holding only one testament, as the Psalmist, in the person of the Lord, says: Deliver me, Lord, from the horns of the unicorns.

638
01:22:42,552 --> 01:22:48,989

640
01:22:55,425 --> 01:23:01,252

642
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:16,158
(Job 39:5)
The Jewish people are also referred to as a wild donkey, as it continues in the same book: And who untied its bonds, the bonds of the commandments indeed.

643
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,697

646

647
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:41,633

The hedgehog, as mentioned earlier, represents a weak people who made their homes in the rocks.

648
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:45,969
The fox can represent a heretic, the devil, or a cunning sinner.

649
01:23:45,969 --> 01:23:49,018
In the Gospel, it says: Go and tell that fox.

650
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:52,270
(Luke 13:32)
The animal symbolizes a carnal man.

651
01:23:54,167 --> 01:25:59,279
In the Apostle:
"But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God"
First Corinthians 2:14.
An animal, lacking understanding or speech, can sometimes be obedient.
In the Psalm:
"I became like a beast before you"
Psalm 73:22, sometimes indulgent, as in:
"The beasts rotted in their dung"
Joel 1:17.
Horse, a holy man. In Habakkuk:
"You ride on your horses"
Habakkuk 3:8.
And in a negative sense:
"A horse is a false hope for salvation"
Psalm 33:17, referring to anyone who is irrational.
In the Psalm:
"Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding"
Psalm 32:9.
Donkey, representing the human body or the people of the Gentiles. In the Gospel:
"They brought to Jesus the donkey and her colt, and they placed their cloaks on them, and he sat on them"
Matthew 21:7.
The name of donkeys signifies the laziness of fools, as Moses testifies:
"You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together"
Deuteronomy 22:10, which means, in preaching, do not join the wise with the foolish; for the simplicity of the faithful is expressed by this name, which Christ leads to Jerusalem, that is, the vision of peace, by guiding and presiding.
Hence it is said:
"The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's manger"
Isaiah 1:3: again, the donkey represents the excessive wantonness of the reckless, as the prophet says:
"Their flesh is like the flesh of donkeys"
Ezekiel 23:20.
Donkey, symbolizing flesh or people lacking knowledge of God. As mentioned in the Gospel.
Camel, representing the rich burdened with worldly goods, or those distorted in morals. In the Gospel:
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven"
Matthew 19:24.
The camel also signifies the Lord himself, as in:
"You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel"
Matthew 23:24: here the Lord is clearly designated, who, humbled willingly, carried the burdens of our weakness, and the needle's point, and the narrowness of the hole in the pain of his passion.

652
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:04,002
A gnat stings by buzzing, but a camel willingly bends to take on burdens.

653
01:26:04,002 --> 01:26:16,940
The Jews overlooked the gnat when they asked for the release of a rebellious thief, yet they swallowed the camel when they sought to destroy the one who came down to bear the burdens of our mortality.

654
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,657

656
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:30,331
Oxen represent the apostles, who, having taken on the yoke of Christ, plowed the world with the plow of the Gospel.

657
01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:34,277
In the psalm, I will offer you oxen with goats (Psalm 66:15).

658
01:26:34,277 --> 01:26:44,174
Oxen also signify the foolishness of the ignorant, as Solomon rightly said: "Immediately he followed her, as an ox led to the slaughter" (Proverbs 7:22).

659
01:26:44,174 --> 01:26:57,889
The term ox also expresses the life of each worker, as noted by Moses: "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain" (Deuteronomy 25:4); and by the Lord: "The worker deserves his food" (Matthew 10:10).

660
01:26:57,889 --> 01:26:59,829
Cows are full of carnal vices.

661
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:03,711
In the psalm: "Among the cows of the peoples" (Psalm 68:31).

662
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:13,285
Cows also represent all the faithful in the Church, who, while contemplating the precepts of sacred teachings, carry the Lord's ark upon themselves.

663
01:27:13,285 --> 01:27:22,924
Many are bound outwardly by carnal desires but do not stray from the right path because they carry the Lord's ark in their minds (First Samuel 6:12).

664
01:27:22,924 --> 01:27:25,576
The calf represents Christ or the saints.

665
01:27:25,576 --> 01:27:30,557
In the psalm: "Then they will offer young bulls on your altar" (Psalm 51:21).

666
01:27:30,557 --> 01:27:37,155
And in another part: "Many bulls have surrounded me" (Psalm 22:13), referring to those who are wanton.

667
01:27:37,155 --> 01:27:38,773
Pigs are unclean sinners.

668
01:27:38,773 --> 01:27:45,565
In the letter of Peter: "And the sow that is washed returns to wallowing in the mud" (Second Peter 2:22).

669
01:27:45,565 --> 01:27:48,476
Rams are apostles or leaders of the Churches.

670
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:52,552
In the psalm: "Ascribe to the Lord, sons of rams" (Psalm 29:1).

671
01:27:52,552 --> 01:27:54,492
Sheep are the faithful people.

672
01:27:54,492 --> 01:27:57,921
In the Gospel: "My sheep hear my voice" (John 10:27).

673
01:27:57,921 --> 01:28:02,708
Animals refer to those simpler ones, less endowed with reasoning subtlety.

674
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:07,236
In Solomon: "Know well the condition of your flocks" (Proverbs 27:23).

675
01:28:07,236 --> 01:28:09,177
Goats are sinners or gentiles.

676
01:28:09,177 --> 01:28:15,581
In Daniel: "And behold, a goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth" (Daniel 8:5).

677
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:20,174
Also in a good sense: "I will offer you oxen with goats" (Psalm 66:15).

678
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:23,739
Numbers sixty-five, fifteen.

679
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:27,563
Goats, the righteous sometimes coming from the nations.

680
01:28:27,563 --> 01:28:32,500
In Solomon: Your hair is like a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

681
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,030
(Song of Solomon 6:4).

682
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:43,209
Just as goats often seek pasture in high places, so do the saints of the world desire nourishment from baptism and repentance above.

683
01:28:43,209 --> 01:28:46,547
Hence the apostle: Our citizenship is in heaven.

684
01:28:46,547 --> 01:28:47,868
(Philippians 3:20).

685
01:28:47,868 --> 01:28:56,282
Goats are souls made wilder by the vain doctrine of philosophers, but now within the holy Church through the holy Gospel.

686
01:28:56,282 --> 01:28:59,689
Lambs are Christ, or the apostles, or the saints.

687
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:01,706
In the Gospel: Feed my lambs.

688
01:29:01,706 --> 01:29:02,540
(John 1:15).

689
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:05,113
Kids are sinners, or carnal impulses.

690
01:29:05,113 --> 01:29:07,895
In the Gospel: But the kids on the left.

691
01:29:07,895 --> 01:29:09,007
(Matthew 25:33).

692
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:12,554
Moles, idols, or heretics who do not see the truth.

693
01:29:12,554 --> 01:29:15,127
In Isaiah: To worship moles and bats.

694
01:29:15,127 --> 01:29:16,100
(Isaiah 2:20).

695
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,534
Dog, the devil, or Jew, or gentile.

696
01:29:18,534 --> 01:29:22,428
In the psalm: And from the hand of the dog, my only one.

697
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:23,401
(Psalm 21:21).

698
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:28,825
And in another part, in Ecclesiastes: A living dog is better than a dead lion.

699
01:29:28,825 --> 01:29:30,147
(Ecclesiastes 9:4).

700
01:29:30,147 --> 01:29:40,438
Here they think the lion is the devil, but the dog is the gentile or sinful man: because he can come to faith or repentance, but the other does not.

701
01:29:40,438 --> 01:29:45,584
Also, a dog represents lazy preachers, as there: Mute dogs unable to bark.

702
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:46,627
(Isaiah 56:10).

703
01:29:46,627 --> 01:29:47,600
Frogs, demons.

704
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:54,137
In Revelation: And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon.

705
01:29:54,137 --> 01:29:56,293
They are the spirits of demons.

706
01:29:56,293 --> 01:29:57,614
(Revelation 16:13).

707
01:29:57,614 --> 01:30:05,611
Similarly, frogs are heretics who, dwelling in the mire of vile thoughts, do not cease to croak with empty chatter.

708
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:07,488
Ant, the prudent or worker.

709
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,270
In Solomon: Go to the ant, you sluggard.

710
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:11,313
(Proverbs 6:6).

711
01:30:11,313 --> 01:30:14,998
Worm, Christ in the humility of assumed human nature.

712
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,058
In the psalm: But I am a worm and not a man.

713
01:30:18,058 --> 01:30:18,962
(Psalm 22:7).

714
01:30:18,962 --> 01:30:20,422
Also in another part.

715
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:30,296
In Isaiah: Their worm will not die (Isaiah 66:24), meaning either the worm itself, or the conscience of sin, or the unrest of wicked thoughts.

716
01:30:30,296 --> 01:30:31,826
Spider, human frailty.

717
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:36,346
In the psalm: And you have made my soul waste away like a spider.

718
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:37,250
(Psalm 39:2).

719
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:47,090
Spider webs are creations driven by fleeting desires, lacking strength and easily swept away by the winds of time.

720
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:50,247
A serpent can symbolize the devil or wicked people.

721
01:30:50,247 --> 01:31:31,916
In the Gospel: "Serpents, brood of vipers" Matthew 23:33.
Similarly, in another context in the Gospel: "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert" John 3:14.
The serpent also represents those who are wise, as in: "Be as wise as serpents" Matthew 10:16.
A dragon can signify the devil or an open persecutor; as mentioned in the psalm: "You crushed the heads of the dragon, you gave him as food for the people of Ethiopia" Psalm 74:14.
A scorpion represents the devil or his servants; in the Gospel: "I have given you power to tread on serpents and scorpions" Luke 10:19.
A viper is similar to what was previously mentioned; in the Gospel: "Brood of vipers" Luke 3:7.

722
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:37,127
Chapter Six On the Various Names and Titles.

723
01:31:37,127 --> 01:31:39,238
Man, or the whole person, or mind.

724
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:42,652
In Genesis: God made man in His own image and likeness.

725
01:31:42,652 --> 01:31:48,921
And in a negative sense; in the Psalm: Arise, Lord, let not man prevail, meaning flesh, or the devil.

726
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:59,225
It also signifies the reproach of man, as in the Apostle's words: For when there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not worldly, and behaving like mere humans?

727
01:31:59,225 --> 01:32:03,074
And elsewhere: An enemy has done this, referring to the devil.

Psalm Sixteen, Verse Seven.

878
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:26,984

Psalm Seven, Verse Nine.

880
01:45:28,454 --> 01:45:30,966

888
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:06,965
Fat represents the richness of divine grace or the fullness of heavenly wisdom.

889

In the Apostle: "If there is any affection of mercy" (Philippians 2:1).

899
01:46:59,772 --> 01:47:06,555
And in another sense, in the Acts of the Apostles about Judas: "And all his bowels gushed out" (Acts 1:18).

900
01:47:06,555 --> 01:47:08,330
Skin is a sign of mortality.

901
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:12,197
In Genesis: "And He made them coats of skins" (Genesis 3:21).

911
01:48:11,279 --> 01:50:39,935

Similarly, the flesh is associated with guilt, as in: "My spirit shall not remain in these humans, because they are flesh" Genesis 6:3.
Knees symbolize the confession of humility. In the Song of Songs, it says: "And now I bend the knees of my heart" Ephesians 3:14, and in the psalm: "My knees are weak from fasting" Psalm 109:24.
Sometimes, knees represent the strength of faith, as seen in the prophet: "I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed their knees to Baal" First Kings 19:18.
Feet can signify the course of life, mental stability, or faith. In the psalm: "Our feet were standing" Psalm 122:2. And in a negative sense, in the prophet: "Why do you falter with both feet?" First Kings 18:21. And, "Their feet are swift to shed blood" Psalm 14:3.

917
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:05,001
Wine similarly holds significance.

918
01:51:05,001 --> 01:51:09,149
In Solomon: And drink the wine I have mixed for you Proverbs 9:5.

919
01:51:09,149 --> 01:51:18,211
Wine also symbolizes the security of righteousness, as in: Pouring oil and wine Luke 10:34, where wounds are stung by wine and soothed by oil.

929
01:51:55,355 --> 01:51:59,248
Fine flour represents purity of mind and strength of charity.

930

931
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:08,694

932
01:52:08,694 --> 01:52:14,055

933
01:52:14,055 --> 01:52:17,820
In a negative sense: Ephraim is like an ash cake Hosea 7:8.

934
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,990

01:52:25,543 --> 01:52:34,031
Also, for the inexperienced in the Church: I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able First Corinthians 3:2.

937
01:52:34,031 --> 01:52:36,520
Here, milk means limited understanding.

938
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:39,519
Curdled milk represents being hardened by sins.

939
01:52:39,519 --> 01:52:43,668

940
01:52:43,668 --> 01:52:46,221
Salt represents the seasoning of wisdom.

941
01:52:46,221 --> 01:52:52,411

943
01:52:55,794 --> 01:53:03,197

944
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:13,342
Here's another perspective from Solomon:
When you find honey, eat only what you need, so you won't feel too full and get sick.

945
01:53:13,342 --> 01:53:18,698
(Proverbs 25:18)

And the Lord Himself says: Father, take this cup away from me.

959
01:54:13,763 --> 01:54:18,271
(Mark 14:36)
In a negative sense, consider the golden cup of Babylon.

960
01:54:18,271 --> 01:54:24,541
(Jeremiah 51:7)
Pure wine symbolizes the sincerity of judgment or truth, or the warmth of faith.

968
01:54:51,192 --> 01:54:57,528
In the Psalm: You will give them drink from the river of your pleasures, meaning the Holy Spirit.

969
01:54:57,528 --> 01:55:03,407

01:55:42,599 --> 01:55:47,200
In the Gospel: "You should have put my money in the bank" (Matthew 25:27).

980
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:55,655
Wisdom is also referenced, as Solomon says: "Hidden wisdom and unseen treasure—what benefit is there in either?" (Ecclesiasticus 20:32).

988
01:56:29,661 --> 01:56:34,385
In the Gospel: "A woman hid leaven in three measures of flour" (Luke 13:21).

989
01:56:34,385 --> 01:56:42,281
On the negative side, flour can represent vain thoughts, as in the prophet: "Take the millstone and grind flour" (Isaiah 47:2).

990
01:56:42,281 --> 01:56:44,954
The millstone represents one’s way of life.

991
01:56:44,954 --> 01:56:49,430
In the Gospel: "Two women will be grinding at the mill" (Matthew 24:41).

992
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:59,252
The two millstones can also symbolize the two Testaments, through which the labor of study grinds the wheat of the Old Testament into the flour of the Gospel.

993
01:56:59,252 --> 01:57:11,313
These terms, when they appear in the sacred text, are to be understood as they are most clearly expressed, although they often take on different meanings depending on the person, time, or place.

994
01:57:11,313 --> 01:57:17,281
They also take on figurative meanings appropriate to the context for allegorical interpretation.

995
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:28,347
For example, the abyss can mean the depth of Scripture, as mentioned earlier, or the vastness of water, as in: "The fountains of the great abyss were broken open" (Genesis 7:11).

998
01:57:43,889 --> 01:57:53,774
Alternatively, it can represent the darkened hearts of people burdened by sin, as in Job: "The abyss says, 'It is not in me,'" referring to wisdom (Job 28:14).

999
01:57:53,774 --> 01:58:01,172
Fire, as mentioned earlier, can represent the Holy Spirit, as Paul says: "Our God is a consuming fire" (Hebrews 12:29).

1000
01:58:01,172 --> 01:58:06,518
Fire also symbolizes love, as in: "Its flames are flames of fire" (Song of Songs 8:6).

1001
01:58:07,823 --> 01:58:09,055
Fire and tribulation.

1002
01:58:09,055 --> 01:58:16,445
In the Psalms, it says: "You have tested us with fire, as silver is tested with fire" (Psalm Sixty-Six, Verses Ten to Eleven).

1003
01:58:16,445 --> 01:58:38,028
It also mentions: "We went through fire and water."
Fire can symbolize anger: "And I will consume them in the fire of my wrath," says the Lord.
Fire can also represent lust: "All are adulterers, like an oven heated by their heart."
Furthermore, fire can signify malice of the mind, as in: "Then the fire will consume the adversaries" (Hebrews Ten, Verse Twenty-Seven).

1004
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:46,591
It can also reflect the power of charity, as in: "The chariots of God are flames of fire, its wheels are burning fire" (Daniel Seven, Verse Nine).

1005
01:58:46,591 --> 01:58:49,817
As we've mentioned, shadow signifies divine protection.

1006
01:58:49,817 --> 01:58:57,559
However, sometimes shadow can represent sins: "Sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death" (Psalm One Hundred Seven, Verse Ten).

1007
01:58:57,559 --> 01:59:04,421
Other times, shadow symbolizes punishment, as in Job: "The shadow of death and no order" (Job Ten, Verse Twenty-Two).

1008
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:10,638
And because a shadow is close to what it reflects, death is also near the punishment that brings it about.

1009
01:59:10,638 --> 01:59:20,315
Sometimes shadow indicates delight in sins; in Job, it describes the devil: "He sleeps under the shadow among the reeds in hidden places" (Job Forty, Verse Sixteen).

1010
01:59:20,315 --> 01:59:24,421
Additionally, certain appearances can signify multiple things at once.

1011
01:59:24,421 --> 01:59:29,524
For example, the two testaments can be likened to these two millstones we've discussed.

1012
01:59:29,524 --> 01:59:54,274
The two testaments are also symbolized by the two cherubim in Exodus (Exodus Twenty-Five, Verse Twenty); two animals in Habakkuk; two rocks in Exodus (Exodus Seventeen, Verse Six) and the Song of Songs (Song of Songs Two, Verse Fourteen), under which the bride and Moses are protected; and two bronze mountains in Zechariah, from which chariots with red, black, white, and spotted horses emerge (Zechariah Six, Verse One).

1013
01:59:54,274 --> 02:00:00,608
However, exploring all these meanings for each name would be not only a tremendous task but also impossible.

1014
02:00:00,608 --> 02:00:06,943
So now, let's return to the manner and order of interpretation, which we briefly paused for this discussion.

In Revelation: "And Babylon the great came into remembrance before God to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath" (Revelation sixteen, verse nineteen).

1260
02:26:29,956 --> 02:26:32,094
Enemies symbolize the devil or vices.

1261
02:26:32,094 --> 02:26:39,780
In the psalm: "He will not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate" (Psalm one hundred twenty-seven, verse five).

1262
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:42,438
Thieves represent heretics and false prophets.

1263
02:26:42,438 --> 02:26:47,581
In the Gospel: "All who came before me were thieves and robbers" (John ten, verse eight).

1264
02:26:47,581 --> 02:26:48,968
Nations symbolize vices.

1265
02:26:48,968 --> 02:26:58,677
In the Pentateuch: "When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, and drives out many nations before you" (Deuteronomy seven, verse one).

1266
02:26:58,677 --> 02:27:03,589
Also, in another part: "All nations, clap your hands" (Psalm forty-seven, verse two).

1267
02:27:03,589 --> 02:27:08,559
Battle represents a struggle against spiritual wickedness or a conflict against vices.

1268
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:14,453
In the Apostle: "Thus I fight, not as one beating the air" (First Corinthians nine, verse twenty-six).

1269
02:27:14,453 --> 02:27:19,134
Peace signifies the peace of the flesh in goodness and the harmony of the spirit.

1270
02:27:19,134 --> 02:27:24,335
In the psalm: "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem" (Psalm one hundred twenty-two, verse six).

1271
02:27:24,335 --> 02:27:26,069
Also, peace represents Christ.

1272
02:27:27,455 --> 02:27:30,377
In the Apostle: For he is our peace. Ephesians 2:14.

1273
02:27:30,377 --> 02:27:34,029

1274
02:27:34,029 --> 02:27:39,254

1275

First Corinthians 15:57.

1276
02:27:40,602 --> 02:27:43,130

Philippians 3:14.

1279
02:27:49,029 --> 02:27:52,793
The crown represents the reward of eternal glory for righteousness.

1280
02:27:52,793 --> 02:27:57,288
In the Apostle: From now on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.

1281
02:27:57,288 --> 02:27:58,355
Second Timothy 4:8.

1282
02:27:58,355 --> 02:28:06,839
Since the completion of spiritual progress leads to the crown, it is fitting that the spiritual interpretation of these names concludes with the crown.

1283
02:28:06,839 --> 02:28:13,805
However, it is challenging to encompass all these names, just as it is to express everything that holds double significance.

1284
02:28:14,423 --> 02:28:18,143
Chapter Eleven On Numbers.

1285
02:28:18,143 --> 02:28:29,256
Now that we've finished discussing these terms, let's take a quick look at numbers, which have gained importance among sacred symbols due to their mystical significance.

1286
02:28:29,256 --> 02:28:32,741
One: This number symbolizes the unity of the Godhead.

1287
02:28:32,741 --> 02:28:38,001
In the Pentateuch: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one" (Deuteronomy 6:4).

1288
02:28:38,001 --> 02:28:42,735
And from the Apostle: "One God, one faith, one baptism" (Ephesians 4:5).

1289
02:28:42,735 --> 02:28:52,598
Noah's ark, representing the holy Church, is completed in one cubit (Genesis 6:16) because eternal rest is found through the contemplation of one God.

1290
02:28:52,598 --> 02:28:56,148
Two: This represents the two testaments of divine law.

1291
02:28:56,148 --> 02:29:02,461
As in First Kings: "And he made in Debir two cherubim of ten cubits in size" (First Kings 6:23).

1292
02:29:02,461 --> 02:29:06,011
The two commandments of love, loving God and neighbor.

1293
02:29:06,011 --> 02:29:11,534
The holy Gospel mentions two in the field, two at the mill, two in bed (Luke 17:34).

1294
02:29:11,534 --> 02:29:13,573
Three: Symbolizing the Trinity.

1295
02:29:13,573 --> 02:29:27,315
In John's Epistle: "There are three who bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and there are three who bear witness on earth: the spirit, the water, and the blood" (First John 5:7).

1296
02:29:27,315 --> 02:29:30,537
And in Genesis: "Three branches" (Genesis 40:10).

1297
02:29:30,537 --> 02:29:32,904
Four: Representing the four Gospels.

1298
02:29:32,904 --> 02:29:38,953
In Ezekiel: "And from their midst came the likeness of four living creatures" (Ezekiel 1:5).

1299
02:29:38,953 --> 02:29:42,438
Just like the four rivers of paradise (Genesis 2:10).

1300
02:29:42,438 --> 02:29:46,054
The Tetragrammaton is written with four Hebrew letters.

1301
02:29:46,054 --> 02:29:52,104
The holy cross is marked by four horns, as in Habakkuk: "Horns in his hands" (Habakkuk 3:4).

1302
02:29:52,104 --> 02:30:02,624
Five: Referring to the five books of Moses, the five porticoes (John 5:2), the five loaves (John 6:9), and the five wounds on the body of the Lord (John 20:25).

1303
02:30:02,624 --> 02:30:09,922
The Apostle says: "In the Church I would rather speak five words with my understanding" (First Corinthians 14).

1304
02:30:09,922 --> 02:30:16,892
Six: Relating to the sixth day when the Lord created man along with all the living creatures of the earth.

1305
02:30:16,892 --> 02:30:21,561
In Genesis: "Let us make man in our image and likeness" (Genesis 1:26).

1306
02:30:21,561 --> 02:30:27,018
Further on: "And it was evening, and it was morning, the sixth day" (Genesis 1:31).

1307
02:30:27,018 --> 02:30:36,881
The number six signifies completeness: God completed the world in six days, and so to these five, one is added, fulfilling the law through the Gospel.

1308
02:30:38,327 --> 02:30:46,977
There are six ages of the world: five have passed, and the sixth extends from John the Baptist and the incarnation of Christ to the end of the world.

1309
02:30:46,977 --> 02:30:56,962
God created man in His image on the sixth day because, in this sixth age, the reformation of our minds in the likeness of Him who created us is revealed through the Gospel.

1310
02:30:56,962 --> 02:31:07,934
These six ages are symbolized by the six water jars that the Lord ordered to be filled with water, where the water turned into wine as described in the book of John, Chapter Two, Verse Six.

1311
02:31:07,934 --> 02:31:12,521
This is so we can understand Christ, now revealed, in the law and the prophets.

1312
02:31:12,521 --> 02:31:19,777
Those six times were arranged and distinguished like sections and would have been like empty vessels if not filled by Christ.

1313
02:31:19,777 --> 02:31:24,538
Truly, times would pass in vain unless the Lord Jesus Christ was preached in them.

1314
02:31:24,538 --> 02:31:27,847
The jars are filled meaning the prophecies are fulfilled.

1315
02:31:27,847 --> 02:31:32,084
To the seventh day, on which the Lord rested after completing everything.

1316
02:31:32,084 --> 02:31:39,225
In Genesis, it is written: And God rested on the seventh day from all the work He had done Genesis, Chapter Two, Verse Two.

1317
02:31:39,225 --> 02:31:51,068
This number signifies the highest perfection for human reason because it consists of the first even and the first odd numbers: from the first that can be divided and from the first that cannot be divided.

1318
02:31:51,068 --> 02:31:55,306
Hence the jubilee, which expresses perfect rest, consists of seven weeks.

1319
02:31:55,306 --> 02:32:00,763
Hence the seven spirits, who are before the throne of God Revelation, Chapter One, Verse Four.

1320
02:32:00,763 --> 02:32:09,819
The seven loaves, with which Christ fed four thousand people, symbolized the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit Matthew, Chapter Fifteen, Verse Thirty-Four.

1321
02:32:09,819 --> 02:32:12,722
To the Lord's Day of resurrection, the eighth day.

1322
02:32:12,722 --> 02:32:17,656
In the title of the psalm, For the end, for the eighth Psalm, Chapter Six, Verse One.

1323
02:32:17,656 --> 02:32:21,662
To the sacrament of the ninth hour, when the Lord gave up His spirit.

1324
02:32:21,662 --> 02:32:28,744
In the Gospel: And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice Matthew, Chapter Twenty-Seven, Verse Forty-Six.

1325
02:32:28,744 --> 02:32:32,866
There are also nine names of precious stones and nine orders of angels.

1326
02:32:32,866 --> 02:32:36,697
To the Decalogue, the ten words, which are written on two tablets.

1327
02:32:36,697 --> 02:32:41,980
In the psalm: I will sing to You with a ten-stringed harp Psalm One Forty-Four, Verse Nine.

1328
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:42,909
To the apostles.

1329
02:32:42,909 --> 02:32:48,772
In the Gospel: But the eleven disciples went to Galilee Matthew, Chapter Twenty-Eight, Verse Sixteen.

1330
02:32:49,991 --> 02:32:55,952
The number eleven, when it goes beyond ten, is often associated with transgression and criticism.

1331
02:32:55,952 --> 02:33:03,018
That's why the Apostle Peter didn't let the number of apostles stay at eleven; he chose Matthias to be the twelfth.

1332
02:33:03,018 --> 02:33:03,633
Acts 1:26.

1333
02:33:03,633 --> 02:33:10,392
In the old law, eleven curtains of goat hair were instructed to be made, symbolizing acts of penance for sins.

1334
02:33:10,392 --> 02:33:11,130

1335
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:14,939

Referring to the apostles in the Gospel: Now the names of the twelve apostles are these.

02:33:21,576 --> 02:33:22,375
Matthew 10:2.

1340
02:33:22,375 --> 02:33:32,636
This number represents the entire multitude of judges, with two parts of seven often signifying universality: these two parts, three and four, multiply to make twelve.

1341
02:33:32,636 --> 02:33:33,497
Matthew 19:28.

1342
02:33:33,497 --> 02:33:34,050
Fourteen.

The strength of the Ten Commandments is fulfilled through the four books of the Gospel.

1351
02:35:03,737 --> 02:35:08,776
We fulfill the Ten Commandments if we perfectly keep the four holy books of the Gospel.

1352
02:35:08,776 --> 02:35:19,026
Through self-control, vigils, prayers, and other practices mentioned by the Apostle, the weapons of righteousness
Second Corinthians 6:7 lead us to the rewards of immortal life.

1353
