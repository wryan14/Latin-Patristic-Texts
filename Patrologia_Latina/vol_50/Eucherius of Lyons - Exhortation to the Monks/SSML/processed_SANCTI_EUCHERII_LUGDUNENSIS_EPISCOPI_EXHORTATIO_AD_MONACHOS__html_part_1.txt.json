Just as a body with swelling is not healthy, neither is a soul with pride. Therefore, humble yourself and do not seek things higher than you <sub alias=\"Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 22\">Ecclesiastes 3:22</sub>.</p>\n  <p>If someone wants to be proud, they can exercise their pride by being proud toward the world, despising worldly behavior, considering its desires as nothing, rising up against vices, being proud against pride itself, and having power, riches, desires, and other things that dominate the world under their feet.</p>\n  <p>Let them despise all things here considered great and magnificent as filth and dung with commendable severity: they will satisfy their pride when they see themselves in spirit above even kings. Yet if they still want to be holy and proud, they will indeed be a despiser of the world but humble to Christ. They will indeed be chosen there, but here they will be submissive: for they lift themselves up in those things so that they can more easily lower themselves to these things.</p>\n  <p>If we diligently maintain this humility, then true obedience will also be served without effort. In this obedience, beloved ones, genuine contrition is shown. For the one who judges themselves as the least is contrite in heart. When would they dare to carry out their own wills? When would they dare to resist the author who commanded them? Hence the Apostle also says: <sub alias=\"Hebrews chapter 13 verse 17\">Obey your leaders, and so on (Hebrews 13:17)</sub>.</p>\n  <p>But is only the one who commands to be praised? Is not the one who obeys, beloved ones, also to be praised? The former deserves glory for leading, the latter for obeying.

Sed sicut corpus cum tumore, ita anima cum\n\nsuperbia sanitatem non habet. Humilia ergo temetipsum,\n\net altiora te ne quaesieris (Eccl. III, 22).

For He, being equal to the Father, obeyed the Father. And how did He obey? Did He obey in an easy matter? He obeyed unto death. And what kind of death? The death on the cross <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"fɪˌlɪp.iˈænz\">Philippians</phoneme> 2:8. Not only did He obey, but He also made the Father's will His own. For we can do what we are commanded even unwillingly; true obedience is when the one who obeys begins to want what the one who commands desires.\n\n  <p>\n    The Holy Scripture says: It is good for a man to carry the yoke from his youth; he will sit alone and remain silent <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"læmənˈteɪʃənz\">Lamentations</phoneme> 3:27-28. Therefore, with Christ helping us, let us guard our mouths with a door and bolts, and weigh our words carefully. The Apostle says: Those who serve well gain a good standing for themselves <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"fɜrst ˈtɪməθi\">First Timothy</phoneme> 3:13.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And these things, beloved ones, I do not say to instruct you, but so that you may recognize in my words the benefits of humility and obedience that you practice.

For it is not the one who starts, but the one who perseveres that will be saved <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"mɑrk\">Mark</phoneme> 13:13. And to the one who wants to be saved, there is a struggle. If someone in battle leaves their position when the lines are drawn and stands against the adversaries, they are henceforth regarded as cowardly and a deserter. In this place too, soldiers of Christ seem to be standing as if in a battle line against the devil: to abandon the fight and leave is not only inglorious but also dangerous. We must stay in this very place; so that by holding on to what we have, others do not take our crowns. We must stay and remain, so that by fighting gloriously here, sailing peacefully, we may live the safest life in spiritual pursuits and grasp eternal life, for which we have been called.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

Et quomodo\n\nobedivit? Numquid in re facili obedivit? Usque ad\n\nmortem. Et qualem mortem? mortem autem crucis\n\n(Phil. II, 8). Nec solum obtemperavit, sed etiam\n\nvoluntatem Patris voluntatem suam fecit.

Neque enim\n\nqui coeperit, sed qui perseveraverit, hic salvus erit\n\n(Marc. 10, 12). Ei autem qui vult salvus esse, hic\n\ncertandum est. Si quis in pugna, quando acies ordinatur,\n\net contra adversarios statur, loco suo recesserit,\n\n deinceps ignavus ac refuga habetur.
