1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
Ruinart's message about the passion of Saint Maurice and his companions, martyrs.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,511
Long ago, Laurence Surius published the Acts of Saint Maurice and his companions under the name of Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyon.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:16,140
However, these acts were so inconsistent that scholars considered them false and fabricated.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:23,486
Although slightly improved versions existed in Mombritius' work, they were still so altered that they couldnâ€™t be attributed to Eucherius of Lyon.

5
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:31,586
As a result, discerning individuals were troubled that the genuine Acts of such illustrious martyrs were either lost or so corrupted that they deserved no trust.

6
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:41,297
Nonetheless, these long-sought Acts were finally discovered by Reverend Father Peter Francis Chifflet, a priest of the Society of Jesus, in an ancient manuscript from the famous Jura Monastery.

7
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:44,920
He published them in the first part of the illustrated work of Paulinus.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,064
We present the same edition compared to several old manuscripts, one of which is a relic from the Fossat Library dating back around 900 years.

9
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:59,813
Moreover, Eucherius' name was indifferently prefixed to both the interpolated and genuine Acts in the manuscripts, though more rarely to the genuine ones.

10
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:07,260
This is the same Eucherius' letter to Silvius or Salvius, which we found attached to the genuine Acts in a single manuscript from the Royal Library.

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,857
Since this manuscript is of excellent quality, and was also used by Chifflet, we retained it and present it accurately compared to several manuscripts.

12
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:20,392
Eucherius, the author of this Passion, presided over the Church of Lyon at the beginning of the fifth century.

13
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:29,398
If you desire more information about him, besides those who compiled the catalogs of ecclesiastical writers, you may consult Chifflet in the illustrated Paulinus, part I, chapter.

14
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:35,177
Fourteen and following, where he argues that Eucherius was the only one to have led the Church of Lyon.

15
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:48,064
On the contrary, Theophilus Raynaldus, in the list of saints of Lyon, and Cardinal Baronius, who previously argued the opposite; Mabillon, in the notes to the life of Saint Consortia, and other learned men acknowledge two bishops named Eucherius of Lyon.

16
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:54,101
The elder, a contemporary of Hilary of Arles, praised by him in the sermon about Saint Honoratus, died in the year 454.

17
00:01:54,101 --> 00:02:01,711
The younger, mentioned in the Life of Saint Caesarius of Arles, is said to have signed the Second Council of Orange, which took place in the year 529.

18
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:09,169
Moreover, it seems that the Gallican Fathers used the account of Eucherius in composing the office that was read on the feast day of these martyrs.

19
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,482
This seems certain from the Gothic Missal, a passage of which we will describe below.

20
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:22,056
Indeed, this appears to be the Passion, which Saint Avitus, Bishop of Vienne, in the homily he gave about these martyrs, testifies to have been read according to custom.

21
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:29,057
What is more fully detailed in Eucherius's account, Avitus expresses in a few words in the fragment of the same homily that remains to us.

22
00:02:29,057 --> 00:03:03,050
He acknowledges that these martyrs, whom he calls the "Felix Legion," were decimated once and again by lot, and finally completely consumed.
But the entire fragment must be presented, which was copied from the oldest parchment sheets of the Thuane Library by the very devoted scholar of sacred antiquity, Jacobus Sirmond.
These sheets, now kept in the Royal Library, are affirmed by the most skilled men who examined them to have been written while Avitus was still alive or shortly after his death.
The title of the aforementioned homily is as follows: "SPOKEN IN THE BASILICA OF THE SAINTS OF AGAUNUM, AT THE RENOVATION OF THE MONASTERY OR THE PASSION OF THE MARTYRS."

23
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:07,925
The proclamation of the Felix army, in whose gathering no one perished and no one escaped.

24
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:17,509
When the unjust death of the holy martyrs was judged as if it were the justice of fate, it was said that being scattered over the field twice would yield a hundredfold fruit from the decimated.

25
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:23,419
With hatred favoring prosperity, each was chosen individually until they were all gathered together as the chosen ones.

26
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,448
The chosen passion was explained by the obligation of custom.

27
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:35,089
Marius, bishop of Aventicum, mentions the Monastery of Agaunum multiple times, especially in his Chronicle in the year 515, during the consulship of Florentius and Anthemius.

28
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,416
He notes that the Monastery of Agaunum was built by King Sigismund.

29
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,247
This should be understood as referring to its renovation.

30
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:48,100
Even if the monastery existed before, it was so enriched by the generosity of this pious prince that he can rightly be called its founder.

31
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,556
Furthermore, even if the names of most of these martyrs are unknown, their memory has always been highly celebrated in the Church.

32
00:03:54,556 --> 00:04:04,786
This is evident not only from what we have produced but also from other ancient authors, who celebrated them under the name of the holy Acaunensians, from the place of their martyrdom, or the Theban Legion.

33
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:17,648
Gregory of Tours calls them the Felix Legion in Book 1 of the Glory of the Martyrs, chapter 75, where he reports that King Sigismund of the Burgundians enriched the Agaunum Church abundantly with lands and other resources, and established daily singing there.

34
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:22,018
The same author, in the following chapter, recounts some miracles of these same martyrs.

35
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:31,057
In Book 10 of History, Gregory of Tours says he found the relics of the blessed Acaunensians in the main church of Tours, where he presided, and also in the basilica of Saint Martin.

36
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:40,989
In honor of these martyrs, Venantius Fortunatus composed the fifteenth poem of Book 2, and in Book 8, poem 4, he lists them among the most celebrated martyrs, calling them the Felix Legion of Agaunum.

37
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:46,253
From this, it can be inferred that these martyrs were commonly known as the Felix Legion in ancient times.

38
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:51,815
This conjecture is supported by Saint Avitus in the place mentioned above, where they are called the Felix army.

39
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,735
I'll skip mentioning Walafrid Strabo and the numerous other authors from various times who celebrated the martyrs of Agaunum.

40
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:05,108
However, it's important to highlight the testimony of the ancient Gallican Liturgy, specifically from the Gothic-Gallican Missal.

41
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:13,606
This was published by Joseph Maria Thomasius and our own Jean Mabillon in Book 3 of the Gallican Liturgy, using a manuscript written in square letters around 900 years ago.

42
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:21,313
In this Missal, number 64 contains the Mass of Saint Maurice and his companions, which includes the narrative of their history, likely taken from Eucherius.

43
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,734
This will become clear when comparing both texts.

44
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:28,230
To make this easier, let's present the entire Preface, known as the Immolation of the Mass.

45
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,022
Truly it is right and just for us to give thanks to you, Holy Lord, Almighty Father, eternal God.

46
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:44,237
For you, Lord, recalled the Theban legion, destined for the punishment of your people, by the sudden grace of your command, so they chose to be killed with diligent devotion rather than be satiated with the blood of Christians.

47
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:50,116
With your assistance, they did not hesitate to bear the burden of persecution, bowing their necks to their persecutors.

48
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:59,453
And when the enemy's rage decreed that the people of God should perish by the insistence of enumeration, he was taken up first, who by the anticipation of martyrdom became the first fruits.

49
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:06,123
A clamor arises in the camps; the valor of fighting is scorned, and a strenuous contention over the assumption of martyrdom is stirred.

50
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:11,508
The people of God are pierced by the sword, the blood of the innocent is shed, and faith is kept unblemished.

51
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:17,930
Thus, Lord, you protect your soldiers, ensuring neither patience was lacking in their suffering nor constancy in their confession.

52
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:26,428
Among the blessed battles and blessed contests, the glorious confession deserved more to be separated from the company of comrades than for the executioner's hand to boast.

53
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:34,777
For the whole people of God were burning with such fervent faith and eagerness that if the persecution of the body were delayed, the devotion of suffering would precede.

54
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:37,248
For the constancy of the people was so great, and.

55
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:37,297
.

56
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:37,346
.

57
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:43,614
Enemies could neither find anything to destroy in their rage nor leave anything glorious behind to perish.

58
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:54,614
That holy place of the Agaunensians became a sanctuary for the present and a protection for the future through the intercession of the martyrs, consecrated by a wave of blood and the presence of precious bodies.

59
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,334
Hence, rightly to you, Lord, etc.

60
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,514
In the collections, these holy martyrs of Agaunum are called.

61
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:05,458
This shows that the veneration of these martyrs in our Gaul is ancient, as our ancestors held them in high esteem.

62
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:13,538
Under the name of Saint Maurice, two metropolitan churches, Vienne and Tours, as well as two cathedral churches, Angers and Mirepoix, are dedicated to God.

63
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:18,856
Among the old churches that once existed in the city of Reims, the title of Saint Maurice is recorded.

64
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:26,154
It is remembered by Sonnatius and Lando, bishops of the same city, in their wills, according to Marlotus in volume 1 of Metropolis Remensis.

65
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,605
Less is said about the number of these martyrs.

66
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,316
The liturgy, praised by the people, designates them.

67
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:36,946
They are said to have been 6,600 according to the Admonition, which is called the Preface by ancient custom.

68
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:47,529
It goes like this: Let us beseech the mercy of Almighty God on this feast day of 6,600 martyrs, dearest brothers, so that He who granted the glory of martyrdom to such a people may also grant to us, etc.

69
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:53,212
That number seems to be mentioned because Eucherius said that the legion consisted of 6,600 men at that time.

70
00:07:53,212 --> 00:08:03,795
Moreover, the author of the life of Saint Romanus, abbot of Jura, who was a contemporary of Romanus himself and flourished at the end of the 5th century, also says there were as many Agaunensian martyrs.

71
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:06,193
Such a massacre of soldiers was unprecedented.

72
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:15,003
I will provide a single example from Dio Cassius in the Life of Galba, where this author reports that 7,000 praetorian soldiers were killed, and the rest were decimated.

73
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:20,477
As for the names of these martyrs, except for those listed by Eucherius, they are entirely unknown to us.

74
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:24,720
Most people, however, add Innocent and Vitalis to the Eucheriani.

75
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,950
They are mentioned in the oldest Martyrologies and in the Gregorian Sacramentary from the Corbie manuscript of Ratoldus, as noted by our Hugo Menardus in his notes on page 180.

76
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,614
Similarly, they are mentioned in the ancient manuscript of the Metropolitan Church of Reims and some others.

77
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:46,274
Certainly, Ordericus Vitalis reports in Book 13 of his Ecclesiastical History that he was named after this holy martyr Vitalis.

78
00:08:46,274 --> 00:10:13,278
He says, "The name Vitalis was given to me instead of an English name, which was deemed unpleasant by the Normans, borrowed from one of the companions of Saint Maurice the martyr, whose martyrdom was celebrated at that time."
Various churches also celebrate other martyrs from the same legion, who might have been absent from the army at that time or had already been martyred before that general massacre. Gregory of Tours in Book 1 of The Glory of the Martyrs chapter 62, says that fifty of them were martyred in Cologne, where the basilica was formerly called the Church of the Holy Golden Ones.
The Martyrologies commonly mention Gereon and three hundred eighteen others, who, according to Ado, are said to be from the legion of Saint Maurice, martyred on October 10 in the same city. Mallosus the martyr, whom Gregory in the following chapter writes was buried in the town of Bertun with Victor the martyr, is believed by some to be from the Theban legion.
On October 10, Usuardus confuses him with Gereon, stating: "In the city of Cologne, Saint Gereon the martyr, also called Mallosus, with three hundred eighteen others, who, etc."
The martyrs of Turinâ€”Octavius, Adventitius, and Solutorâ€”are commonly counted among them. Saint Maximus of Turin gave two homilies about them, which are found in Volume 5, Part 1 of the Library of the Fathers. They are also praised by Ennodius of Ticinum in his first poem.
There are other famous martyrs in various cities of Italy, such as Maximinus in Milan, Maurice, George, and Tiberius in Pinerolo, Sebastian and Alverius in Fossano in Liguria, and Alexander in Bergamo, about whom Ughellus has written extensively.

79
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,451
If we believe Notker and others, there were also female martyrs in that legion.

80
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:23,321
Notker mentions Regula, who, along with her brother Felix, endured various tortures and was beheaded on September 11.

81
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:27,385
He also reported more about the virgin Verena on the first day of the same month.

82
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:35,614
Others who were martyred elsewhere are frequently mentioned in Martyrologies and specific Church records, but we do not have the time to discuss them all in detail.

83
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:43,240
I never intended to defend as certain or unquestionable those stories about these martyrs that some authors have narrated without legitimate foundation.

84
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:55,934
However, to question the martyrdom of that renowned legion, which is supported by such authoritative and ancient testimonies, is not the attitude of a sincere person, nor of someone who, rejecting all bias, loves to embrace the truth wherever it shines.

85
00:10:55,934 --> 00:11:04,764
The ancient and recent Latin Martyrologies commemorate the feast of Saint Maurice and his companions on September 22, but I could not find any mention of them among the Greeks.

86
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:13,745
The Maurice they commemorate with seventy soldier companions on February 21 is entirely different from our Maurice, and aside from their names, they have almost nothing in common.

87
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:18,963
Our Maurice suffered in Gaul with his whole legion, while the other Maurice suffered in Apamea in Syria.

88
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:27,893
After his son Photinus was sent ahead to receive the martyr's palm, he endured unbearable tortures with his companions for ten days and nights, and then died with them in prayer.

89
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:38,078
This Maurice the martyr is praised by Theodoret in his eighth sermon on the Cure of Greek Afflictions, and his complete Acts are found in Simeon Metaphrastes on February 21, according to the Bollandists.

90
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:47,712
Cardinal Baronius dates the passion of the Agaunensian martyrs to the year 297, but we believe it should be rather attributed to the beginning of the reign of Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

91
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:56,907
The year 286 holds significance because Maximian Herculius, whom Diocletian had appointed to share imperial power the previous year, was stationed in Gaul with his army.

92
00:11:56,907 --> 00:13:15,308
The learned Baluzius notes this in his commentary on Lactantius' booklet "On the Deaths of the Persecutors."
However, it is possible that the martyrdom of these saints could have occurred in the following years. Agaunum, the site of this massacre, has since been revered by Christians for the memory of these great martyrs and the notable monastery built there, which is known today as Saint Maurice. This site is located in the Diocese of Sion at the foot of Mount Saint Bernard.
Initially, the monastery was established under a private rule, but it later came under the Benedictine monks and eventually the Augustinian canons regular. Mabillon demonstrates that this monastery existed before the year 515 in volume one of the "Acts of the Saints of the Benedictine Order," page 568. It was endowed and perhaps restored by Sigismund, king of the Burgundians, but not originally constructed by him. This is confirmed by the title of a fragment of Avitus of Vienne's homily mentioned earlier.
The former fame of this monastery is evident from its status as a model for other establishments, especially for the practice of continuous psalm-singing, known as "Perpetual Praise." This practice of continuous singing in monasteries, adopted from the Greek Acoemeti monks, was once common in many Benedictine monasteries, as proven by old charters published in various collections. More information about this custom can be found in Mabillon's preface to the second part of the fourth century Benedictine annals, numbers 204 and following.

93
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,538
Saint Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons.

94
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:22,355
The Passion of the Martyrs of Agaunum: Saints Maurice and his Companions.

95
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:25,788
(From the Acts of the Martyrs by Theodoric Ruinart.)

96
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,223
To the most blessed Lord in Christ, Bishop Salvio, from Eucherius.

97
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,875
I am sending you the account of our martyrs' passion.

98
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,329
I was concerned that such a glorious martyrdom might be forgotten over time if neglected.

99
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:45,138
Therefore, I sought the truth from reliable sources, particularly from those who confirmed that Saint Isaac, the Bishop of Geneva, knew the order of the passion as it was told.

100
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:50,393
I believe he had received this account from the most blessed Bishop Theodore, a man from an earlier time.

101
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:58,600
While others from various places and provinces offer gifts of gold, silver, and other items to honor and serve the saints, we respectfully offer you these writings.

102
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,255
We hope for intercession for all sins and perpetual protection from my patrons in the future.

103
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:10,161
Remember us also in the presence of the Lord, always adhering to the duties of the saints, holy Lord, and most deservedly blessed brother.

104
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,863
PASSION OF THE MARTYRS OF AGAUNUM.

105
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:22,105
We honor the passion of the holy martyrs who illuminate Agaunum with their glorious blood, recounting their deeds with the same faith by which their martyrdom has been passed down to us.

106
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:26,378
Through successive narrations, the memory of this event has not been lost to oblivion.

107
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:33,880
Each martyr is honored by the places or distinguished cities that possess them, and rightly so, for they gave their precious lives for the supreme God.

108
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:41,283
But how much more reverence should be given to the sacred place of Agaunum, where thousands of martyrs were said to have been slaughtered for Christ?

109
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:44,513
Now, let us speak of the very cause of this most blessed passion.

110
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:51,866
Under Maximian, who ruled the Roman Republic together with Diocletian, the people of the martyrs were torn apart or killed across various provinces.

111
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:59,269
Maximian, consumed by greed, lust, cruelty, and other vices, was devoted to the abominable rites of the pagans and profane towards the God of heaven.

112
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,449
He had armed his impiety to extinguish the name of Christianity.

113
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:09,256
Anyone who dared to profess the worship of the true God at that time was seized for torture or death by the scattered troops of soldiers.

114
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:14,671
It was as if a holiday had been declared for barbarian peoples, as he entirely stirred arms against religion.

115
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:18,994
At that same time, there was a legion of soldiers in the army called the Theban Legion.

116
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:24,658
This legion, consisting of six thousand six hundred men, had come to assist Maximian from the regions of the East.

117
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:32,310
These men were valiant in warfare and noble in virtue, but even more noble in faith, fighting with fortitude for the emperor and with devotion for Christ.

118
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,918
Even under arms, they did not forget the command of the gospel, rendering unto God what was God's, and unto Caesar what was Caesar's.

119
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:47,712
When they, like the rest of the soldiers, were assigned to persecute Christians, they alone dared to refuse the ministry of cruelty and declared they would not obey such orders.

120
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,380
Maximianus was not far away, resting and weary from his journey near Octodurum.

121
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:00,778
When messengers reported to him that this legion had rebelled against royal orders and halted in the narrow pass of Agaunum, he flew into a rage fueled by indignation.

122
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:04,348
Before I recount the rest, it seems necessary to describe the location.

123
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:10,382
Agaunum is about 60 miles from the city of Geneva and 14 miles from the head of Lake Geneva, into which the Rhone flows.

124
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:13,550
The place itself is located in a valley among the Alpine peaks.

125
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,170
For those traveling there, a difficult, rough, and narrow path opens up.

126
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,852
The Rhone, hostile as it is, leaves a scarcely passable embankment along the rocky mountain's base for travelers.

127
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:28,082
Once the narrow pass is overcome, a not-insignificant plain suddenly opens up among the mountain cliffs.

128
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:29,792
The holy legion had settled there.

129
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:44,676
Thus, as we mentioned earlier, when Maximianus learned of the Theban legion's response, he, burning with impulsive wrath over the neglected orders, commanded every tenth man of that legion to be killed by the sword, so that the rest, terrified by fear, would more easily submit to royal commands.

130
00:16:44,676 --> 00:16:50,408
He then reinforced his orders, decreeing that the remaining soldiers be forced into the persecution of Christians.

131
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:59,510
When the repeated warning reached the Thebans and they understood that they were again being ordered to carry out profane executions, an outcry and tumult arose throughout the camp.

132
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:08,964
Many proclaimed that they would never yield to such sacrilegious tasks; they would always detest the profane idols and dedicate themselves to the worship of the sacred and divine religion.

133
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:14,545
They would worship the one God of eternity; it was better to face the worst than to betray the Christian faith.

134
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:25,809
When Maximianus learned of this, more bloodthirsty than any beast, he returned to his usual cruelty and ordered that once again every tenth man be put to death and that the rest be compelled to carry out the rejected orders.

135
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:37,525
When these commands were again brought to the camp, the men chosen by lot as the tenth were separated and killed; meanwhile, the rest of the soldiers encouraged each other through mutual conversation to persist in such a noble cause.

136
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:45,209
The greatest encouragement for faith at that time came from Saint Maurice, who, according to tradition, was the senior officer of his legion.

137
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:51,794
Along with Exsuperius, the army leader, and Candidus, a military senator, Maurice inspired and advised each individual in their faith.

138
00:17:51,794 --> 00:18:01,722
He drew on the examples of fellow martyrs, urging everyone to be willing to die for the sacrament of Christ and divine laws if necessary, and to follow their comrades who had already ascended to heaven.

139
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:05,555
These blessed men were already burning with the glorious desire for martyrdom.

140
00:18:05,555 --> 00:19:14,899
Inspired by these leaders, they sent a message to Maximian, who was still consumed with madness, saying: "We are your soldiers, Emperor; but we freely confess, we are also servants of God. We owe you military service, but to Him, we owe our innocence. We receive our wages for labor from you, but from Him, we received the beginning of life. We cannot follow you as our leader to the extent that we deny God, our true leader and yours as well, whether you like it or not. If we are not forced into such horrid deeds that offend Him, we will continue to obey you as we have done up to now; otherwise, we will obey Him rather than you.
We offer our hands against any enemy; but we consider it a crime to stain them with the blood of the innocent. These right hands know how to fight against the wicked and enemies; they do not know how to tear apart the pious and citizens. We remember that we take up arms for our fellow citizens rather than against them. We have always fought for justice, for piety, and for the safety of the innocent: these have been the rewards of our dangers so far. We have fought for faith, but how can we keep faith with you if we do not show it to our God? We first swore an oath to the divine sacraments; then we swore an oath to the royal sacraments: you need not believe that we will keep the second if we break the first. You order Christians to be sought out for punishment by us."

141
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,026
Now, you don't need to look for others.

142
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:22,720
You have us here, confessing God the Father, the creator of all, and His Son, Jesus Christ, whom we believe is God.

143
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,107
We have seen our fellow workers and companions in dangers and labors, with their blood sprinkled on us, slaughtered by the sword.

144
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:34,355
Yet we did not weep or grieve for the deaths of these most holy comrades and the funerals of our brothers.

145
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:39,950
Instead, we praised and followed them with joy, because they were considered worthy to suffer for their Lord God.

146
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,564
And now, not even this last necessity of life has driven us to rebellion.

147
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:48,218
Not even the utmost despair, which is strongest in dangers, has armed us against you, Emperor.

148
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:55,595
Look, we hold arms, but we do not resist because we prefer to die rather than to kill, and we would much rather perish innocently than live guiltily.

149
00:19:55,595 --> 00:20:03,121
If you decide anything further against us, if you order anything else, if you bring anything upon us, we are ready to face fire, torture, and the sword.

150
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:06,141
We confess we are Christians; we cannot persecute Christians.

151
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:19,509
When Maximian heard such things and saw their minds steadfast in the faith of Christ, despairing that their glorious constancy could be recalled, he decreed that all should be killed with one judgment, and he ordered the matter to be carried out by surrounding soldiers.

152
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:26,589
When they came to the most blessed legion, the impious drew their swords against the holy ones, who did not refuse to die out of love for life.

153
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:37,679
Thus, they were slaughtered everywhere by swords, not even protesting or resisting, but laying down their arms and offering their necks to their persecutors, exposing their throats or unprotected bodies to their persecutors.

154
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:50,503
They were not elated by their own multitude or the defense of their arms to try to assert the cause of justice by the sword, but only remembering this: that they confessed Him who was led to slaughter without protesting and did not open His mouth like a lamb.

155
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:55,800
They themselves, like a flock of the Lord's sheep, allowed themselves to be torn apart by attacking wolves.

156
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,345
The earth was covered there by the prostrate bodies of the pious in death, and streams of precious blood flowed.

157
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:05,207
What madness ever, without war, caused such a great slaughter of human bodies?

158
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,014
What kind of savagery has ever decreed, from its own judgment, that so many should perish at once, whether guilty or not?

159
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:18,376
The crowd did not succeed in preventing the just from being punished, since what the crowd transgresses usually goes unpunished.

160
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:25,136
Thus, by the cruelty of this most savage tyrant, that holy people who despised present things for the hope of the future were afflicted.

161
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:32,492
That truly angelic legion was killed, which, as we believe, now praises the Lord God of Hosts together with the legions of angels forever in heaven.

162
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:38,855
However, Victor the martyr was neither of the same legion nor a soldier; but a veteran of an already completed military service.

163
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:44,223
While he was traveling, he suddenly came upon those who were joyfully feasting on the spoils of the martyrs.

164
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:48,945
When invited to join the feast, he learned the reason for the celebration from those rejoicing.

165
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,529
He detested both the guests and the feast, and fled.

166
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:59,681
When questioned whether he too might be a Christian, he responded that he was a Christian and always would be, and was immediately killed by those who attacked him.

167
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:04,254
He was united in the same place with the other martyrs, not only by death but also by honor.

168
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:09,572
These are the names of the martyrs known to us: the most blessed Maurice, Exsuperius, Candidus, and Victor.

169
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:13,350
The other names are unknown to us, but they are written in the book of life.

170
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,867
From this same legion, it is said that the martyrs Ursus and Victor, who suffered at Solothurn, were also from.

171
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:22,098
Solothurn is a fort above the Aare River, not far from the Rhine.

172
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:26,124
It is also worth noting the fate that befell the cruel tyrant Maximian afterward.

173
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:31,890
When he plotted to kill his son-in-law Constantine, who was then ruling, by laying traps, his deceit was discovered.

174
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:38,948
Captured at Marseilles, he was soon strangled and met his end with this most terrible punishment, ending his wicked life with a fitting death.

175
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:46,887
Indeed, the bodies of the most blessed martyrs of Agaunum, after many years of suffering, were revealed to Saint Theodore, the bishop of that place.

176
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:51,714
When a basilica was being built in their honor, next to a vast cliff, a remarkable miracle occurred.

177
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:56,782
Among the craftsmen invited to work on the basilica, there was one man who was still known to be a pagan.

178
00:22:56,782 --> 00:23:01,947
One Sunday, while the others had left to observe the festivities, this worker stayed alone in the building.

179
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,857
Suddenly, the holy ones appeared to him in a bright light in that secluded place.

180
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:09,043
The worker was seized and stretched out for punishment or torment.

181
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:15,849
Seeing the crowd of martyrs, he was beaten and rebuked for either missing church on a Sunday or daring to undertake the holy work as a pagan.

182
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:21,979
The saints did this so mercifully that the worker, alarmed and terrified, asked to be saved and immediately became a Christian.

183
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:26,323
I must also mention another miracle among the saints that is equally clear and well-known.

184
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:31,391
The wife of Quincius, a distinguished and honorable man, was so paralyzed that she couldn't use her feet.

185
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:34,335
She asked her husband to take her to Agaunum, a long journey.

186
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:42,734
When she arrived, carried by the hands of the servants of the basilica, she returned to the inn on foot; having been healed from her paralysis, she now proclaims her miracle.

187
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:46,451
I believed these two wonders should be included in the passion of the saints.

188
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:52,388
However, many other miracles occur there through the power of the Lord, whether in casting out demons or in other healings.
