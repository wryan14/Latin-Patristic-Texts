Fear spread throughout the entire city.</p>\n  <p>Some ran to their spouses, others to their children, relatives, or friends. Everyone was simultaneously afraid in different ways, some for their fellow citizens.</p>\n  <p>Amidst all this, the weight of the disaster fell entirely on Honoratus, the bishop of holy memory, who was then the beloved shepherd, as he alone feared for everyone.</p>\n  <p>What emotions of piety he felt at that time! How quickly he, distressed in his soul, was present for the distressed! Raising his eyes to heaven, with the intensity of his heart matched by the light in his eyes, he departed from us standing around him in a complete trance of the mind, so that no one doubted he stood before the tribunals of Christ with Saint Genesius to seek help for the present evil.</p>\n  <p>Meanwhile, amidst great turmoil, pitiable shipwrecks occurred. Horses adorned with finery were mixed with people, struggling to swim, their legs surfacing with high chests. They trampled over anything in their way, either warned by danger or driven by panicked instinct, with a fearful courage. Clinging to their beloved burdens, the arms of mothers, and servants pressed by the burdens of their mistresses, the entire solemn procession became mixed with the debris of their journey.</p>\n  <p>Let no bad interpreter arise here. Let no one obscure the great glory of the martyr with malicious slander, and let no one claim the crowd near the riverbank. Let no one assert those caught in the shallows, whom the divine right hand clearly saved. Laden with the goods of travelers, ships of inestimable burdens are daily joined to these same banks. An ancient ordinance established a ship there for bearing bridges, as if to give up on laying the foundation with embankments.</p>\n  <p>The weight of the crowded people exposed to this vast whirlpool was as much as the beams, long and strong, could bear, even though they were broken. Let those recalling these events bring them to their minds and eyes now: the entire Rhone, the ruin, the shipwreck, the diverse crowd of the miserable, entangled together, all conglomerated into one disaster by the devilâ€™s snares. Nothing was lacking in the danger so that nothing was lacking in the glory of the martyr.</p>\n  <p>For when would the river have drowned his disciples, whom he had consecrated the same day with devout birthdays? O great glory of God!</p>\n</speak>",

Inter haec sanctae recordationis antistiti Honorato,\nquo tunc ille populus pastore gaudebat, uni quidem\npro omnibus metuenti, omne cladis pondus incumbit:\nquos tunc illa pietas stimulos accepit! quam subita\nanimi aegritudine aegris praesto fuit!

You might have thought the Jordan River had once again, by divine intervention, opened up; or that the seas had once more provided a solid path for the people of God, as they had in the past under Moses' leadership, by the command of his rod.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        No one was shaken by the collapse, no one was soaked by the river, and no one was swept away by its flow. Everyone was safely welcomed by the familiar and homely shore. The entire procession exited just as it had entered. The matron's secrets were revealed by the necks of their mobile servants from the depths. The virgins, adorned in honor of God, did not lose any of their floating jewelry; even the pins remained as securely attached to their maternal hands as they had been before.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        No one suffered any loss of property, and no one faced any danger. Beloved children rushed to meet their loved ones: each person joyfully embraced the one they had feared for the most. Whose power but Christ's, through the intercession of His martyr, accomplished this miracle? Surely, the bishop met the martyr, and the lord met the martyr. The faithful people's service was shown to be worthy of salvation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        And indeed, many immediately, so that the holy devotion might not be easily disturbed by the enemy, boarded boats with their clothes still wet and disregarded the morning chill of the river with fervent hope. They hurried to the place they aimed for, the site of the martyrdom, with a victorious spirit, ready to offer their vows with even greater enthusiasm after the recent danger. Oh, such prayers are worthy of being heard!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        They, unbroken by injuries, do not blame the peril they faced: they know how to give thanks for their escape. Everyone dances with joy, happily participating in the solemn rites. It is a joy to have been in danger because it was a wonder to have witnessed the miracles. It was so significant for each to have doubted their safety so that they could miraculously gain it.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Pompa omnis, sicut\ningressa fuerat, egressa est. Materfamilias ex\nprofundo famulorum suorum cervicibus mobilium\ncubiculorum secreta viderunt. Comptae in honorem\nDei virgines, nulla fluitantium monilium detrimenta\nsenserunt; acus ipsae, ut ita dixerim, sicut affixae\nfuerant maternis manibus, haeserunt. Nemo damnum\naliquod rei, nemo dispendium salutis accepit. Occurrunt\npignora chara pignoribus: unusquisque\nproximum suum, cui plurimum timuerat, laetus amplectitur. Cujus hic nisi Christi per intercessionem\nmartyris sui praesens virtus operata est? Convenit\nutique episcopus martyrem, et dominum martyr. Ostensum est salute dignum fidelis populi officium. Et denique plurimi (quod mecum forsitan, et cui\nfecistis agnoscitis) illico, ne vel leviter turbare devotionem\nsanctam liceret inimico, vestibus ut erant\nmadidis navigia conscendunt, et matutinum rigorem\nfluvii spe fervente contemnunt; festini quo intenderant,\nad locum scilicet caedis, animo victore perveniunt,\nalacritate majori post periculum recens vota\nfusuri. O dignae audiri preces! quae non fractae injuriis,\nimputare nesciunt quod periclitati sunt: grates\nreferre sciunt quod evaserunt. Omnes gaudio tripudiant:\nassistunt denique solemnibus laeti, interfuisse\n periculis juvat: quia conspicabile interfuisse miraculis:\ntanti cuique fuit de salute dubitasse, ut salutem\nsuam mirabiliter acquireret."
