Chapter Twenty: Errors contained in Cassian's definitions are summarized.

These definitions teach and write this, and it is proclaimed in published discussions:

That when Adam sinned, his soul was not harmed and remained healthy in him, from which he sinned:

indeed, the knowledge of good that he received, he did not lose; nor could his descendants lose it, of which he did not suffer the loss.

Moreover, every soul naturally has seeds of virtue implanted by the Creator’s benefit, so that whoever wants to, by natural judgment, can anticipate God's grace, and merit His help, to more easily reach perfection:

because there is no praise or merit for someone who is adorned with given goods, not their own.

It should also be avoided that all the merits of the saints are referred to God in such a way, as if human nature itself can do nothing good by itself:

since its integrity of power is so great, that it can fight against the devil himself and his cruelty up to the extreme punishments, without God’s help.

This possibility is natural in all men, but not all want to use the virtues generated within themselves.

Moreover, the Creator's goodness is so great towards all men, that some are received with praise because they come voluntarily, while others are drawn unwillingly because they resist: and therefore He is the receiver of those who want and the savior of those who do not want.

And since part of the Church is justified by grace, and part by free will, those whom nature has advanced are more glorious than those whom grace has freed: because the free will in Adam’s descendants is as free for every good work as it was in Adam before the sin.
