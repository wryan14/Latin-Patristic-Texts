    <s>It is demonstrated more clearly that Cassian's view, which claims that pious thoughts and holy intentions can arise from natural wisdom without God's inspiration, is incorrect.</s>
    <s>Contrary to this, it is shown through the interpretation of the passage he misused and the addition of other arguments, that pious thoughts do not originate from free will without God's inspiration.</s>
    <s>Human goodwill is indeed his own, but it is only conceived through God's inspiration.</s>
    <s>Likewise, human conversion, although not without his participation, does not begin from him.</s>

    <s>But so that we do not seem to be acting on suspicions or probing the hidden meanings beyond the words, let the following clarify what is added to what is already known.</s>
    <s>Thus, the one who among the principles of his argument had said, "Not only the beginning of actions but also of good thoughts is from God; who inspires in us the beginnings of holy will, and grants us the strength and opportunity to carry out what we rightly desire," now, wishing to prove that religious thoughts and holy intentions, conceived without any inspiration from God, can arise from natural wisdom, quotes the words of Solomon, who said:</s>
    <s>"My father David wanted to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. But the Lord said to my father David: 'You did well to have it in your heart to build a house for my name; however, you will not build the house for my name (First Kings 8:17).'"</s>
    <s>Then, to show how this should be understood, the author himself adds: "So, this thought and this plan of King David, should it be said to be good and from God, or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why is the effect denied by the one who inspired it? But if it was bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains, therefore, that it should be believed to be both good and from man. In this way, we can judge our daily thoughts. For it was not granted only to David to think good from himself, nor is it denied to us to naturally think or understand anything good."</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>In no way can this testimony and argument prove that pious thoughts arise solely from free will and not from God's inspiration.</s>
    <s>For David's will, which was certainly good, is not to be believed as not from God, just because the Lord wanted the temple to be built not by him but by his son.</s>
    <s>Therefore, it must be asked from what spirit this desire of his will proceeded, namely from that spirit of God, in which he said, "I will not enter the tent of my house or go up to the bed of my couch, or give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, or rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob (Psalm 132:3)."</s>
    <s>While the Prophet desired this, he did not ignore that the true and perfect temple was to be established by him who, while being the Son of God, was also made the son of David; and who, when he saw the temple constructed by Solomon, said, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days." But he was speaking of the temple of his body (John 2:19 and 21).</s>
    <s>So that this temple, which was being prepared in Christ and in the Church, might be prefigured, it was appropriate that not David, but the son of David, should be chosen for its construction, so that through the son of man it might be signified that the Son of God and man was to come.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    The relationship between God and man, and through the dissolvable temple, would indicate the incorruptible tabernacle. For the construction of which the will of David was approved, and the work was transferred to him whose person more suited that image. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      And so it was from God that David desired this, and it was from God that Solomon did this.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    To make this clearer with examples, let us look for where God
    did not want what men wanted to do with God willing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Lord commanded the apostles, saying,
    
    Go, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you (Matthew 28:19).
  </p>
  <p>
    When the apostles heard this, without a doubt they did not receive these words merely as empty sounds through their physical ears, but the power of the living word ignited an unquenchable flame of love in their hearts, by which they ardently desired to preach the Gospel of Christ to all nations.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when they were forbidden to speak the word in Asia and when they attempted to go into Bithynia, they were prevented by the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:6 and 7): did they not have this desire from God, even though they wanted to convert the hearts of those to faith whom God, by his hidden judgment, did not want to hear the Gospel at that time? Or when the Church prays daily for its enemies, that is, for those who have not yet believed in God, does it not do this from the Spirit of God? Who would say otherwise, except someone who does not do this or who thinks that faith is not a gift from God? And yet, what is prayed for all is not obtained for all. Nor is there injustice with God, who often does not grant what is asked for, which he has granted to ask for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, it must be acknowledged that good will, that is, by which one adheres to God, is indeed proper to man, but it must be confessed to be conceived by God's inspiration. For since no one is good except God alone (Luke 18:19), what kind of good would it be that does not have a good author? For the nature of humanity, whose creator is God, even after transgression retains substance, form, life, sense, reason, and other goods of body and soul, which are not absent even in the wicked and vicious, but does not have the perception of true goodness in these, which can adorn mortal life but cannot confer eternal life. For it is not unknown how much the Greek schools and Roman eloquence, etc.

  <p>
    Romans 1:21, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Those who used themselves as guides to know the truth were misguided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, if anyone, ashamed of the distressing vanities and deceitful madness, realizes that whatever they embraced as light and life is actually darkness and death, and tries to withdraw from these things; this turning away is not from themselves, though it is not without themselves; nor do they strive towards the beginnings of salvation by their own strength. But this is the work of the hidden and powerful grace of God, which, removing the ashes of earthly opinions and dead works, stirs up the buried heart's torch and ignites it with the desire for truth: not to subdue a reluctant person, but to make them eager for submission; not to drag an ignorant person, but to lead one who understands and follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    For free will remains, which God certainly created with man, and from the vanities and desires into which they flowed by neglecting God's law, it is changed, not by itself, but by the Creator; so that whatever is restored in it for the better, it is not without Him who heals, nor except by Him who heals; of whom we are a new creation and a new formation, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we might walk in them <w role="ivona:NNP">Ephesians</w> 2:10.
