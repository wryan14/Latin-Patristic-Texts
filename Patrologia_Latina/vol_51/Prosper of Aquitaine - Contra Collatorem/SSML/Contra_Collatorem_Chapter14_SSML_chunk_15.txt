    <s>Cassian attempts to demonstrate the strength of free will.</s> 
    <s>Cassian's Tenth Definition: Job overcame the devil by his own strength, not by the aid of grace, except in the sense that God did not grant the tempter more power than He knew Job had the strength to resist.</s> 
    <s>Cassian's deceit: he begins his discussion by praising the Catholic view of grace but later attacks it.</s> 
    <s>He gradually descends into Pelagian errors.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>After this, however, when he had attributed so much to man before grace, as to make it seem most beneficial for him to have grace, he added some perplexing and confusing statements to demonstrate the strength of free will.</s> 
    <s>And regarding the strengths already granted to him, he wants to assert that what is naturally inherent in him is fortified, so that what he accomplished with God's help is something he began by the freedom of his own will.</s> 
    <s>However, let us pass over these tolerably: for we also say that free will, which we call the inclination of good will and the beginning of faith, is conceived by the operation of grace, so that by these things which are given without any preceding merit, he may deserve the promises made to those who will work, always asking from Him the ability to do something good, who said, "Without me you can do nothing" <sub alias="John Chapter 15 Verse 5">John 15:5</sub>.</s> 
    <s>Let us therefore pass over these matters and reconsider what he said about the sufferings of Saint Job.</s> 
    <s>For he says: "We read that divine justice provided for Job, its most tested athlete, when the devil sought him for a one-on-one contest.</s> 
    <s>If Job had fought against the enemy not by his own strength but solely by the protecting grace of God, and if, without any virtue of his own patience, he had endured those multiple and cruel temptations and calamities solely by divine assistance, how could the devil not more justly have repeated his slanderous accusation, 'Does Job fear God for nothing?</s> 
    <s>Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has?</s> 
    <s>But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face' <sub alias="Job Chapter 1 Verse 9">Job 1:9</sub>.</s> 
    <s>But since the slanderous enemy dared not repeat any such complaint after the conflict, he confesses that he was defeated not by God's power but by Job's own strength.</s> 
    <s>Although it is to be believed that God's grace did not entirely fail him, as it granted the tempter as much power as it knew Job had the strength to resist, it did not protect him from the attacks to such an extent that it left no room for human virtue; but it ensured only that the most violent enemy did not overwhelm his soul by making him mad and senseless, burdening him with an unequal and unjust weight of the conflict.</s>

    <s>Who would believe that these things could be preached among Catholics by Catholics unless what is often defended in domestic discussions is also read in writings?</s> 
    <s>Do all men have such a dim view of intelligence, and has the spirit of knowledge and piety departed from all the children of the Church, that they do not blush to introduce...</s>

    Let's ascribe it to nature. And so that we would not believe that any nature lost its virtues in the transgression of Adam, you defined that the souls of all people are as whole by nature as the soul of the first man was before sin, by saying:
  </p>
  <p>
    "Therefore, it cannot be doubted that every soul naturally has the seeds of virtues, inserted by the Creator's benefit."
  </p>
  <p>
    Considering, therefore, these definitions of yours, it is not hidden how much you have deviated from the soundness of that opinion, in which by falsely preaching what should be attributed to grace, you wanted to win the judgments of Catholic ears, who, assured by the promise's preface, would easily accept the following if they liked the first.
