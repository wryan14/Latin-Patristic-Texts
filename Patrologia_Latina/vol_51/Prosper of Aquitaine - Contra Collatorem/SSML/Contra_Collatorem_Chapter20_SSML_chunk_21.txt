    <s>That when Adam sinned, his soul was not harmed and remained healthy in him, from which he sinned:</s>
    <break time="500ms" />
    <s>indeed, the knowledge of good that he received, he did not lose; nor could his descendants lose it, of which he did not suffer the loss.</s>

    <s>Moreover, every soul naturally has seeds of virtue implanted by the Creator’s benefit, so that whoever wants to, by natural judgment, can anticipate God's grace, and merit His help, to more easily reach perfection:</s>

    <s>because there is no praise or merit for someone who is adorned with given goods, not their own.</s>

    <s>It should also be avoided that all the merits of the saints are referred to God in such a way, as if human nature itself can do nothing good by itself:</s>
