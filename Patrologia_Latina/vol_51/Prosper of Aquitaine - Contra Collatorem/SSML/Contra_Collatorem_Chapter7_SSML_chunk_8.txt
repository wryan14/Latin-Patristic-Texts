      CHAPTER VII.
      Cassianus, confusing contradictory definitions, tries to illustrate his point with examples, suggesting that some can achieve certain things through free will without God's help, while others cannot without God's cooperation.
      This is refuted by Scriptures, and it is shown that, like Matthew and Paul, the conversion of Zacchaeus and the thief on the cross is equally due to grace.

      But now let us see what the sober disputant infers; who, in order to counter one fault with another, and to correct one error with another, confuses contradictory definitions with new art.
      And in order to present this concoction to unsuspecting listeners, he tries to illustrate his mix with examples.
      For he says <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="kəˈleɪʃən">Collation</phoneme> 13, Chapter 11:

      "If we say that the beginning of a good will is ours, what about Paul the persecutor? What about Matthew the tax collector?
      One was involved in the bloodshed and punishment of the innocent, the other in public violence and extortion, and both are drawn to salvation.
      But if we say that the beginnings of good will are always inspired by God's grace, what do we say about Zacchaeus' faith?
      What about the piety of the thief on the cross, who, by their own desire, forcefully entered the heavenly kingdom, anticipating the special call?"

      Through this difference in the beginnings of good, he tries to prove that some can achieve certain things through free will without God's help, while others cannot without God's cooperation.
      And he wants this to be understood from the slower obedience of some and the more eager consent of others.

      As if where hardened unbelief submits to God and suddenly succumbs to the Gospel it long resisted, there the change in man is wrought by the hand of the Most High <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɑm">Psalm</phoneme> 76:11.
      But where a willing listener embraces a calm exhortation or mere rumor without hesitation, the goodness of such a conversion is solely due to human will.

    Fear draws us: For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom

    Joy draws us, because, I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the Lord"

    Delight draws us: How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth

    And who can understand or explain the feelings through which God’s visitation leads the human soul, so that what it once fled, it now follows; what it once hated, it now loves; what it once disdained, it now hungers for; and by a sudden miraculous change, what was once closed becomes open; what was once burdensome becomes light; what was once bitter becomes sweet; what was once obscure becomes clear?
  </p>
  <p>
    All this is the work of one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one as He wills 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɝst kəˈrɪnθiənz">First Corinthians</phoneme> 12:14.
  </p>
  <p>
    For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="sɛkənd kəˈrɪnθiənz">Second Corinthians</phoneme> 4:6, 
    that is, in the revelation of His Son, who is in the glory of the Father.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the same one who shone in the heart of Matthew the tax collector and Paul when he was persecuting the Church, also shone in the heart of Zacchaeus and in the heart of the thief crucified with the Lord: unless perhaps the voice of the Lord was idle when He deigned to call Zacchaeus, who sought to see who Jesus was, saying: Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay at your house 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luk">Luke</phoneme> 19:5; 
    and He did not prepare Zacchaeus's heart, whose house He chose to stay in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, when everyone murmured, asking why He had gone to be the guest of a sinner, and Zacchaeus, already repenting, promised to give half of his goods to the poor and repay four times the amount of any fraud, the Lord said: Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.
  </p>
  <p>
    And to make the cause of this salvation clear, He added: For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luk">Luke</phoneme> 19:10; 
    so that we might know that the one who was saved was sought first.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the justification of the thief, even if no signs of the working of grace were understood, would we not, along with all believers, also accept that he was drawn in? For the Lord said: All things have been delivered to Me by My Father 
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luk">Luke</phoneme> 10:22; 
    and, when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to Myself

    In the end, let him teach. Among all things, however, this one is either handed down or drawn out, as his own confession teaches; who, after blaspheming against Jesus Christ for some time, suddenly changed and said: <break time="500ms" /> "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom." <break time="750ms" /> <s> <lang xml:lang="en-US">Luke twenty-three forty-two</lang> </s>

    But where such a great difference in conflicting voices in one man has originated, let the blessed Apostle instruct us and say: <break time="500ms" /> "No one speaking in the Spirit of God says, 'Anathema Jesus'; and no one can say 'Lord Jesus,' except in the Holy Spirit." <break time="750ms" /> <s> <lang xml:lang="en-US">First Corinthians twelve three</lang> </s>

  <p>
    So that we do not doubt that in the will of the same man, it was from his own will that he blasphemed, and from the Holy Spirit that he believed. <break time="500ms" /> Therefore, this disputant, in vain, wanted to adapt the inscrutable variety of one grace to his argument's definition; so that a portion of the justified is believed to come to Christ by the movements of their own will, but the resisting portion is dragged and compelled unwillingly: <break time="500ms" /> since it is God who works all things in all, whether He wants to attract some in one way, and others in another way, to whom no one comes unless they are somehow attracted. <break time="750ms" /> <s> <lang xml:lang="en-US">First Corinthians twelve six</lang> </s>
