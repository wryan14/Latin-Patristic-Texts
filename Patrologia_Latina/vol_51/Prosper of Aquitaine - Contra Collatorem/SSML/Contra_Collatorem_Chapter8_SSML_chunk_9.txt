    <s>CHAPTER VIII. Sixth Definition of Cassian: Free will and grace should be accepted together; that is, they are believed to equally contribute to salvation.</s>
    <s>Divine authorities on grace are presented: and the reason why free will is not taken away by grace is given.</s>

    <s>After this, he presents testimonies from Sacred History, showing that the observance of God's commandments and the fulfillment of virtues are attributed to divine grace.</s>
    <s>We also readily confess this.</s>
    <s>And having recalled examples such as Balaam, whom God transformed from cursing the Israelites to blessing them <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈnʌmbərz">Numbers</phoneme> thirteen; and Abimelech, who was not allowed to sin against Rebecca <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛnəsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> twenty-six; and Joseph, who was sold by his brothers, whose evil intention God turned to good <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɛnəsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> thirty-seven: he returns to confirm his definition.</s>
    <s>He states that free will, which he claims to join with grace, is partially taken away from some of the human race, as much as it is in itself, and established in another part.</s>
    <s>He says: Indeed, these two, that is, either grace or free will, seem to oppose each other; but both agree, and we should accept both equally with a sense of piety: lest by taking away one of these from man, we seem to exceed the rule of ecclesiastical faith.</s>

      This rule takes away the will from no human; because the power of grace does not work in wills so that they do not exist, but that they may be made good from evil, and faithful from unfaithful; and those who were darkness of themselves may become light in the Lord.
