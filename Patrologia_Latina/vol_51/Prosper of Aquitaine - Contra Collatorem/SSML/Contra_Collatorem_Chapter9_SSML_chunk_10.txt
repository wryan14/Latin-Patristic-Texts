    <p>Against Cassian, it is proven from Scriptures and the Church's definitions that the beginning of good will comes from grace. The first man, created without sin and able to persist in good if he wanted, departed from good by his free will. After sin, nothing remained in him except what pertains to temporal life. Into what deep evil the entire human nature was submerged by his transgression. Cassian's seventh definition: Adam, after the transgression, gained knowledge of evil but did not lose the knowledge of good. Refuted.</p>
    <s>Then he added: For when God sees us wanting to turn to good, He comes to meet us, guides, and strengthens us. For at the sound of your cry, as soon as He hears it, He will answer you (Isaiah 30:19): and, Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will glorify me (Psalm 50:15).</s>
    <s>Who does not see that this teaching assigns merit to free will, so that grace precedes it and serves it by rendering what is due, not by granting a gift? This definition was condemned in the synod of bishops in Palestine, even with Pelagius condemning it.</s>
    <s>For in the person who begins to want good and desires to depart from iniquity and error, we profess that this is worked by the grace of God. For the steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way (Psalm 37:23); and, Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the hearts (Proverbs 21:2); and, A man's steps are directed by the Lord; how then can anyone understand their own way (Proverbs 20:24)?</s>
    <s>And what the Apostle says: For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba, Father (Romans 8:15).</s>

    <s>After this, he continues, and says (Conference 13, chapter 12): For it is not to be believed that God made man in such a way that he could never want or be able to do good. Otherwise, He did not permit him free will, if He only allowed him to want and be able to do evil, but neither to want nor to be able to do good.</s>
    <s>And how will that sentence of the Lord stand, pronounced after the transgression of the first man, Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil (Genesis 3:22)?</s>
    <s>For it is not to be thought that he was entirely ignorant of good before. Otherwise, he must be acknowledged to have been formed as a certain irrational and senseless animal: which is sufficiently absurd and by all means alien to the Catholic faith. Rather, according to the statement of the wisest Solomon, God made man upright (Ecclesiasticus 7:30): that is, so that he might continually enjoy the knowledge of good: but they have sought out many schemes.</s>
    <s>For they became, as it is said, knowing good and evil. Therefore, Adam conceived after the transgression.</s>


  <p>
    She had not yet acquired the knowledge of evil; however, she did not lose the knowledge of good that she had received.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>There is no doubt that the first man, in whom the nature of all humans was created, was made upright and free from every vice.</s>
    <s>He received free will in such a way that if he did not abandon God, who was helping him, he could remain in the good things he had naturally received because he wanted to.</s>
    <s>By the merit of voluntary perseverance, he could reach that blessedness where he neither wanted to fall into worse things nor could he.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But with that free will, by which he remained good as long as he wanted to, he departed from the law set before him.</s>
    <s>He did not fear the punishment of death that was announced to him, abandoning God and following the devil, rebelling against the Lord, the Savior, and obeying the enemy, the destroyer.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>"Therefore, Adam was, and in him, we all were; Adam perished, and in him, all perished" (Ambrose, Book VII on Luke Chapter 15).</s>
    <s>Blessed Ambrose said this truthfully, just as Truth itself said, "The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost" (Luke 19:10).</s>
    <s>For in that ruin of universal transgression, neither the substance nor the will of human nature was taken away.</s>
    <s>But it was stripped of the light and honor of virtues, which it had been deprived of by the deceit of the envious one.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Having lost those things through which it could have reached eternal and unlosable incorruption of body and soul, what remained for it except what pertains to temporal life, which is entirely of condemnation and punishment?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, those born in Adam must be reborn in Christ, so that no one is found in that generation which perished.</s>
    <s>For if the descendants of Adam naturally acted in those virtues in which Adam was before sin, they would not be by nature children of wrath (Ephesians 2:3), they would not be darkness (Ephesians 5:8), nor under the power of darkness (Colossians 1:13), and they would not need the grace of the Savior.</s>
    <s>Because they would not be good in vain, nor would they be deprived of the reward of justice; having those goods, the loss of which made the first parents deserve to be exiled from paradise.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But now, since no one can escape eternal death without the sacrament of regeneration, is it not clearly evident from the uniqueness of this remedy how deeply the nature of the entire human race has been plunged into evil by the transgression of the one in whom all sinned (Romans 5:12), and whatever he lost, they lost?</s>
    <s>He lost, first of all, faith, he lost self-control, he lost charity, he was stripped of wisdom and understanding, he lacked counsel and strength.</s>
    <s>And wickedly pursuing higher things, he was cast down from the knowledge of truth and the piety of obedience: without even the fear left to him, so that he might avoid the forbidden things out of fear of punishment, who did not abstain out of love for justice.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, free will, that is, the spontaneous desire for what pleases oneself, when it despised the use of the good things it had received and the supports of its happiness became worthless to it, it directed its insane desire to the experience of transgression, drank the poison of all vices, and soaked the entire nature of man with the drunkenness of its intemperance.</s>
    <s>Hence, before digesting the fatal cruelty by eating the flesh of the Son of Man and drinking his blood, his memory totters.</s>
  </p>


    He makes errors in judgment, wavers in his steps, and is in no way fit to choose and desire that good which he has willingly deprived himself of. Just as he could fall without God pushing him, he cannot rise without God lifting him up.

    <p>
        <s>
          Therefore, it is not correct to say: For it should not be believed that God made man in such a way that he would never want or be able to do good.
        </s> 
        <s>
            As if we were saying that this weakness of man was created by the Creator, and not contracted by man as a result of sin.
        </s> 
        <s>
            Therefore, whoever thinks it follows that if free will is said to be blinded, the blindness itself should be attributed to the creator of nature, wants to persuade us that free will is as sound in Adam's descendants as it was in Adam before the sin: which we consider to be quite contrary to the Catholic faith.
        </s>
        <s>
            For what was harmed by sin if not that from which the sin came? Unless perhaps it is said that punishment passed onto Adam's descendants, not guilt: which is completely false, and therefore is not said.
        </s>
        <s>
            It is extremely impious to think this about God's justice, that He would want the children to be damned along with the guilty.
        </s>
        <s>
            Therefore, guilt is evident where punishment is not hidden, and the fellowship of sin is convicted by the sharing of punishment; so that what is human misery is not from the Creator's institution, but from the judge's retribution.
        </s>
    </p>

    <p>
        <s>
           That statement was inappropriately made, and contrary to the sense of all commentators, which connected it to prove the soundness of free will, saying: And how will that sentence of the Lord stand after the transgression of the first man, "Behold, Adam has become like one of us, knowing good and evil" (Genesis 3:22)?
        </s>
        <s>
            As if the devil had promised Adam the truth, and Adam, by transgressing God's command, had advanced in the likeness of God, and God had pronounced that this had been conferred upon him: when in these words it was rather indicated what he had not achieved, who, having entered the path of pride, lost what he had when he desired what he had not received.
        </s>
        <s>
            Moreover, in the very conclusion of this sense, there is a sin, when it is said: Therefore, Adam conceived after the transgression, the knowledge of evil which he had not had; but the knowledge of good, which he had received, he did not lose.
        </s>
        <s>
            Adam had the knowledge of good then, when he faithfully kept God's holy command with a loyal heart, and remained just in the image of his Creator, not forgetting His law.
        </s>
        <s>
            But after he sold himself, that is, the image and temple of God, to his deceiver, he lost the knowledge of good because he lost a good conscience.
        </s>
        <s>
            For injustice drove out justice, pride destroyed humility, lust crushed self-control, infidelity took away faith, and captivity took away freedom: nor could any portion of virtues remain there, where such a crowd of vices had invaded.
        </s>
        <s>
            For no one can serve two masters (Luke 16:13); and: Whoever commits sin is a slave of sin (John 8:34); and, By whom a person is overcome, by him he is also brought into bondage (Second Peter 2:19).
        </s>
        <s>
            No one, however, serves except with some liberty; and no one is free except with some servitude, as the Apostle says (Romans 6:20), When you were...
        </s>
    </p>


  <p>
    <s>
      If you were of sin, you were free from righteousness.
    </s>
    <s>
      So what benefit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
    </s>
    <s>
      But now, having been freed from sin and having become servants of God, you have your fruit leading to sanctification and the end, eternal life.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, he who serves the devil is free from God; but he who, having been freed, serves God is free from the devil.
    </s>
    <s>
      This shows that bad freedom could be had from the defect of human will, but good freedom could not be received without the help of the liberator.
