00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Saint Nicetas, Bishop of Aquileia, on the Different Names Applicable to Our Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,828
Many names and titles are found in the holy Scriptures that are fitting for our Lord Jesus and our Savior.

3
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:18,088
He is called the Word, wisdom, light, power, right hand, arm, angel, and is referred to as a man.

4
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:20,962
He is called a lamb, sheep, priest, way, truth, life.

5
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:27,523
He is called the vine, righteousness, redemption, bread, stone, doctor, fountain of living water, peace, judge, and gate.

6
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:39,291
He is called all these things; and you will find many other names for Christ in the holy Scriptures, since He is the one and the same Son of God, our God, so that the reason for His power and arrangement can be known.

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,599
You have heard the names; now seek the meanings of the names.

8
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:51,709
He is called the Word, either because He was begotten by God the Father without suffering, or because His generation existed without any loss of the Father's substance.

9
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:55,234
For a man does not seem to suffer any loss when he speaks a word.

10
00:00:55,234 --> 00:01:01,687
Or certainly, He is called the Word because through Him, God the Father has always spoken both to angels and to humans.

11
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:06,568
He is called wisdom because through Him, at the beginning, everything was wisely arranged.

12
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:13,563
He is called light because He illuminated the first darkness of the world and dispelled the night of human minds with His coming.

13
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:16,600
He is called power because no creature can overcome Him.

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,216

15
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:28,042
He is called the angel of great counsel because He is the messenger of the Father's will.

16
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:32,272
He is called the Son of Man because He was willing to be born as a man for us.

17
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:35,092
He is called a lamb because of His unique innocence.

18
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:37,694
He is called a sheep to demonstrate His passion.

19
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:47,510
He is called a priest either because He offered His own body as an offering and sacrifice to God the Father for us; or because He graciously allows it to be offered by us every day.

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,360
He is called the way because through Him we progress towards salvation.

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,518
He is called the vine because, extending the branches of His arms on the cross, He provided a great fruit of sweetness to the world.

22
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:03,019
He is called righteousness because through faith in His name, He justifies sinners.

23
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:08,342
Redemption is called so because once lost, he redeemed us with the price of his blood.

24
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:12,531
It is called bread because it satisfied the hunger of the nations through his Gospel.

25
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:17,213
It is called a stone because no serpent left a trace on it, and he provided us with protection.

26
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:21,599
He is called a physician because he healed our sicknesses and wounds with his visitation.

27
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,006
It is called the fountain of living water because through the washing of regeneration, it both cleanses and gives life to sinners.

It is called the gate because through him, the entrance to the kingdom of heaven is opened to the faithful.

32
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:54,619
Therefore, because the Lord is called by so many names and titles, have confidence, faithful one, and place your hope in him with all your strength.

33
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,886
For to know the Father, he is the word to you.

34
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,547
If you want to be wise, seek him because he is wisdom.

35
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:03,342
If your senses suffer from any darkness, seek Christ because he is the light.

36
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:03,983
Are you weak?

37
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,940
You have refuge because he is both a physician and strength.

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,474
Do you want to know through whom the world was created and by whom all things are sustained?

39
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,776
Believe in him because he is said to be the arm and the right hand.

40
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,910
Do you endure any fear?

41
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,620
He will be present for you like an angel in all things.

42
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:27,343
If it is difficult for you to approach the majesty of the only begotten with sight, do not despair because he was also made human so that humanity might have easy access to him.

43
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,695
If you are innocent, he will associate himself with you like a lamb.

44
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:39,122
If any persecution by the pagans saddens you, take confidence because he was also sacrificed like a sheep; and he will receive you as a priest to be offered to the Father.

45
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:43,311
If you do not know the way of salvation, seek Christ because he is the path of souls.

46
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:46,712
If you want to know the truth, listen to him because he is the truth.

47
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:49,915
Do not fear death at all because Christ is the life of believers.

48
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:52,084
Does the sweetness of the world delight you?

49
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:57,801
Turn more to the cross of Christ so that you may be refreshed by the sweetness of his vine, which hung on the cross.

50
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:58,885
Are you a lost sinner?

51
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:06,374
You should hunger for justice and thirst for a redeemer, who is Christ, for he satisfies because he is bread.

52
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:12,533
If you waver in anything, steady your step in him, because he is a rock, and he will protect you like a wall.

53
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,889
Are you weak and feeble?

54
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,545
Seek a remedy from him, because he is a doctor.

55
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:20,613
Do you suffer from the heat of sins, especially if you are a catechumen?

56
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:26,151
Run to the source of life, so that your heat may be extinguished, and your soul may gain eternity.

57
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:36,943
If anger torments you and conflict agitates you, go to Christ, because he is peace, so that you may be reconciled with the Father and love every person just as you judge yourself to be loved.

58
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:44,684
If you fear the fall of the body and dread the death of this life, remember that he is the resurrection; he can raise up what has fallen.

59
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:56,324
If the pleasure of sin tempts you, and the vices of the flesh provoke you, consider knowingly that he is a just judge, a severe examiner, and the preparer of eternal fire; and you will never delight in sin.

60
00:04:56,324 --> 00:05:11,693
Finally, brother, if any despair about the reward of justice or the expectation of heavenly glory invades you, confidently presume that he is the door; for through him, you will be resurrected from the dead, penetrate the secrets of heaven, and join the company of angels.

61
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:31,186
And you will hear that desirable voice: "Well done, good and faithful servant, because you were faithful, enter into the joy of your Lord; possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world," with him providing, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit for all ages of ages.
Matthew chapter 25, verse 23. Amen.
