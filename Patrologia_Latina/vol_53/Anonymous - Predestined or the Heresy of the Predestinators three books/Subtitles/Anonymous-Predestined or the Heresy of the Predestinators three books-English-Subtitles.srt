1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,295
Predestined or the Heresy of the Predestinarians, and the Refutation of the Books Wrongly Attributed to Saint Augustine, distributed in three books

2
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:11,375
BOOK ONE.

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:24,050
This is a summary of the writings of Hyginus against the heresiarchs, the categories of Epiphanius against the sects, and the expositions of Philaster, who translated these from Greek to Latin, published when the Arians were condemned.

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:31,384
First Hyginus, then Polycrates, Africanus, Hesiod, Epiphanius, and Philaster; these men wrote about various heresies at different times.

5
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:39,097
The first heresy began with Simon, who claimed that chastity does not pertain to God, that God did not create the world, and other such things.

6
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:46,162
He was publicly defeated by the blessed and holy apostle Peter, to the point that he fell at Peter's feet and could not rise again.

7
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:52,688
The second heresy was that of Menander of the Menandrians, who claimed that the world was made not by God, but by angels.

8
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:59,645
Saint Linus, the second bishop after the apostle Peter, expelled them from our community and condemned them to eternal damnation.

9
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:11,187
He taught rationally, according to the holy Scriptures of the Old Testament, that the God who spoke with Moses is the creator of all things, and that there is nothing in all creation that is inherently blameworthy.

10
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:15,825
All things that are judged blameworthy are blamed for their actions, not their nature.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,953
The third heresy was that of Basilides of the Basilidians.

12
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:24,670
They claimed that there are 365 heavens, opposing Moses, and they called the god of these heavens Abrasax.

13
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,254
This name, according to the Greek system of letters, sums up to this number: ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ.

14
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:35,133
The letters are: Α equals 1, Β equals 2, Ρ equals 100, Α equals 1, Σ equals 200, Α equals 1, and Ξ equals 60.

15
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,074
When added together, they total 365.

16
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:43,600
The Church, considering these individuals possessed, did not condemn them through argument, but rather through expulsion.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,018
The fourth heresy, that of the Nicolaitans, was invented by Nicolas, one of the seven deacons ordained by the apostles.

18
00:01:50,018 --> 00:02:00,967
When he was reproached for his jealousy of his beautiful wife, he began to teach that one should use wives indiscriminately, not only lay people but even those who performed the duties of the priesthood.

19
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:08,958
Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist condemned these people and ordered that anyone who even spoke with them should be excluded from communion.

20
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,998
He taught that from the beginning of the world, chastity has greatly pleased God.

21
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:19,731
Furthermore, Christ, the Son of God, dedicated the glory of chastity to Himself, having a virgin mother and remaining a virgin Himself.

22
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:28,659
He did not permit any of His disciples to marry, even lawfully, saying: "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me" (Matthew 16:24).

23
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,101
The fifth heresy is that of the Saturninians, named after Saturninus.

24
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:37,936
He taught that seven angels made the world and introduced lust into it to perpetuate the world through sexual desire.

25
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:45,019
Blessed Thomas the Apostle of Christ condemned these teachings, reasonably asserting that the world had a beginning and thus will have an end.

26
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,059
Angels do not possess omnipotence and therefore could not have created the world.

27
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:55,842
Rather, the Creator of the world is the one God, whom Moses proclaimed made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.

28
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:04,521
The sixth heresy is that of the Gnostics, who called themselves Gnostics as if they had superior knowledge, but were considered more wretched than those previously mentioned.

29
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:09,459
Blessed Paul the Apostle reasonably taught that they do not serve God but their own belly and lust.

30
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,347
They are puffed up with pride, know nothing, and are sick with disputes and arguments about words.

31
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:23,923
The seventh heresy is that of the Carpocratians, founded by Carpocrates, who taught that the powers of darkness cannot be overcome except by those who have indulged in every kind of depravity.

32
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:29,210
They claimed that our Lord Jesus was born of both sexes but received a soul that knew the heavenly realms.

33
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,549
Denying the resurrection of the body, they condemned the prophets of the Old Testament.

34
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:40,477
They had a certain Marcellina who displayed images of Jesus, Paul, and the philosopher Pythagoras among those she was deceiving.

35
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:44,079
She made them honor these images as if they were divine and offer incense.

36
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:53,083
Blessed Barnabas, a disciple of Christ, condemned these people in Cyprus, teaching that they were ministers of Satan and that Christians should have no association with them whatsoever.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,370
Eighth heresy: the Cerinthians, from Cerinthus.

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:03,206
They claimed the world was made by angels, that circumcision of the flesh was necessary, and that the precepts of the Old Testament should be followed literally.

39
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:07,732
They said Jesus was merely a man, had not yet resurrected, but would resurrect in the future.

40
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:11,480
Blessed apostle Paul condemned these people with an eternal curse in Galatia.

41
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,157
He also addressed them in his Epistle to the Galatians.

42
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:15,519
Ninth heresy: the Nazarenes.

43
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,289
They acknowledged the Son of God but kept all the rites of the Old Testament in the Jewish manner.

44
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:29,390
Blessed apostle Paul taught them to interpret the Scriptures spiritually; he found them in the churches of Galatia and declared them anathema because they did not agree with his doctrine.

45
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,753
Tenth heresy: the Ebionites.

46
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:36,788
They asserted that Jesus Christ was just a man and that the commandments of the law should be observed in the Jewish manner.

47
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:50,610
Luke the evangelist, finding them in the church at Antioch, condemned them, teaching that an angel had said to Mary:
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore, the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35).

48
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,092
Eleventh heresy: the Valentinians, from Valentinus.

49
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:59,809
These people were spread throughout the East and severely harmed the Church of God, saying that the deep and the high were mixed together.

50
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:12,025
From these two, as from a marriage, the world emerged: they called the high one the Father and the deep one the Son, claiming He took nothing from the Virgin Mary, but passed through her like water through a stream or pipe without taking on any flesh.

51
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,604
They completely denied the resurrection of the flesh.

52
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,879
These were condemned by the blessed Zacchaeus, bishop of Caesarea.

53
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:26,506
He taught that our Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, passed through the virginal mysteries, from the seed of David according to the flesh.

54
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:32,409
He was truly born as a man, truly suffered, truly died, truly rose from the dead, and truly ascended into heaven.

55
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,028
Twelfth heresy: The Secundians.

56
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:41,864
They differ from the Valentinians only in that they add to this sect the disgrace of the body, which the so-called false chaste ones pretend to avoid.

57
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:44,476
These were condemned by Diodorus, bishop of Crete.

58
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:51,894
Thirteenth heresy: The Ptolemites, followers of Ptolemy, a disciple of Valentinus, who spread this same heresy more vigorously through debate.

59
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,968
He was condemned by the holy Zacchaeus, bishop of Caesarea, mentioned earlier.

60
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,782
However, he spread this very bad heresy through many regions of the East.

61
00:05:59,782 --> 00:06:08,401
Fourteenth heresy: Invented by a certain Marcus, who denied the resurrection of the flesh and tried to establish that Christ did not truly suffer but only seemed to.

62
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:14,304
Saint Clement, bishop of Rome and a most worthy martyr of Christ, refuted him with clear and complete assertions.

63
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:19,162
He exposed Marcus before all the people in the church and condemned him to eternal damnation.

64
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:29,139
He taught that our Lord Jesus Christ was truly born and suffered, not doing anything in fantasy, and showed clearly that truth, being the enemy of falsehood, could not contain anything false.

65
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,781
Just as light cannot contain darkness, nor can a blessing contain a curse, nor sweetness contain bitterness.

66
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:39,535
And if these could be mixed, he taught that it is impossible for God to be mixed with lies.

67
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,617
Fifteenth heresy: The Colorbasians, invented by Colorbasus.

68
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:48,937
He tried to establish that all human life is placed in seven stars, and these seven Churches and seven golden lampstands.

69
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:53,273
Saint Theodotus, bishop of Pergamum, anathematized him in a synod of seven bishops.

70
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:57,139
He taught that the seven Churches are consecrated in the sevenfold spirit.

71
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:05,079
"There is one form," he said, "when it is recalled in the form that the first man had lost."
The second, when the sinner who was immaculate becomes so."

72
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,524
Third, when a dead body is raised from the earth.

73
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:11,276
Fourth, when a soul is freed from the confines of hell.

74
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:16,230
Fifth, when the soul rejoices in the dwelling of paradise until it receives its incorruptible body.

75
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,633
Sixth, when it transforms the children of Adam into children of God.

76
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:23,187
Seventh, when it makes a person a participant in the kingdom of heaven.

77
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:29,142
These are the forms of the Holy Spirit placed in the seven churches, the seven eyes, and the seven golden candlesticks.

78
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:32,595
Sixteenth, the heresy of the Heracleonites was invented by Heracleon.

79
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:39,451
It taught that a baptized person, whether just or sinful, should be considered sacred, and it claimed that sins do not harm the baptized.

80
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:44,005
It said that just as fire does not receive cold in itself, the baptized do not receive sin.

81
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:52,763
Just as fire melts snow by its presence, no matter how much snow is near, one who is baptized does not receive the guilt of sins, even if their deeds are mixed with many sins.

82
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,215
Heracleon began to teach this in parts of Sicily.

83
00:07:55,215 --> 00:08:00,670
Against him, the bishops of Sicily, Eustachius of Lilybaeum and Theodorus of Panormus, took up the challenge.

84
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:08,527
They called for a synod of all the bishops throughout Sicily, decided to hear him out, and directed all his assertions to holy Alexander, bishop of the city.

85
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:11,029
They asked him to arrange something to refute him.

86
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:18,585
Then holy Alexander, drawing each sword of the Word of God from the sheath of divine law for each head of the hydra, composed a book against Heracleon.

87
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:30,896
He sent the fervent priest Sabinianus, who would refute him with both the writings of the bishop and his own assertions, so thoroughly that Heracleon fled in the middle of the night with the help of a ship, and no one ever knew where he ended up.

88
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:32,848
Seventeenth, the heresy of the Ophites.

89
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:34,549
They were named after the serpent.

90
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,501
For serpent, in Greek, is called ophis.

91
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:43,157
They have a serpent accustomed to licking their bread with its tongue, thereby supposedly sanctifying it as if it were the Eucharist.

92
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,959
This serpent they call their Christ.

93
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:54,030
Against these heretics, the priests of the provinces of Bithynia, namely the bishops Theocritus and Evander of the cities of Chalcedon and Nicomedia, took a stand.

94
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:01,705
They publicly refuted and overcame them, intervening in their gatherings in Bithynia, as I mentioned, secretly where they were conducting their activities.

95
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:08,537
They eliminated their priests, killed their snakes, and, by informing all the people, freed the majority of the populace from this danger.

96
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:09,924
Eighteenth Heresy: Cainites.

97
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:14,281
They are called this because they honor Cain, claiming he possessed the greatest virtue.

98
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:25,173
They also believe Judas the betrayer was divine in some way and view his crime as beneficial, asserting he foresaw how much Christ's passion would benefit humanity, and therefore handed Him over to the Jews to be killed.

99
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:29,481
Priests of the Mesopotamian Churches of Syria wrote to their fellow bishops about them.

100
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:43,592
Thirty-two bishops residing in Antioch, along with the bishop of the same city, Theodore, condemned them in person, quoting what the Holy Spirit spoke through the prophet:
"Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness" (Isaiah 5:20).

101
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:52,504
Therefore, it is clear that you are condemned by your own actions, as you wish to call great and just those whom God has destined to the eternal fire of Gehenna due to their deeds.

102
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:53,891
Nineteenth Heresy: Sethians.

103
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:55,772
They are named after Adam's son, Seth.

104
00:09:55,772 --> 00:10:05,427
They boast that he was born from a heavenly mother, whom they say united with a heavenly father, from whom a divine seed was born, from which God would choose the just and call them His children.

105
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,457
They originated in the regions of Achaia.

106
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:19,588
Saint Perigenes, the bishop of the city of Argos, opposed them, showing them that from one holy and true Isaac, two twins were born from the same womb: one ascended to the heights of divine grace, while the other descended to the depths of hell.

107
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:33,263
Therefore, he says, of the two possibilities, either the children are of a bad nature and both are damned for what they have been born as; or they are of a good nature, and according to their actions, one is justly blessed while the other is condemned.

108
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:38,796
With Saint Perigene asserting these and similar ideas, some believers turned away from this terrible error.

109
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:43,709
However, those who neither believed nor converted were cut off by the sword of excommunication.

110
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,898
The twentieth heresy among the Archontics in Crete got its name from the princes.

111
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,414
They claim to worship the princes who, they say, created this world.

112
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:57,723
Saint Dioscorus, bishop of Crete, condemned them, teaching that the one true God cannot be divided into substantial parts.

113
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:07,290
This is the God who revealed Himself to the prophets and delivered believers like Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the sons of Israel, Jonah, Susanna, and the three youths from all dangers.

114
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,513
God showed countless signs of power to those who believed in Him, proving Himself to be the only God.

115
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:17,788
He accepted those who agreed with the truth but punished those who disagreed with eternal abomination.

116
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:20,270
The twenty-first heresy originated from Marcion.

117
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,269
He affirmed that there were two principles: good and evil.

118
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,734
Epiphanius said he taught three principles: good, just, and wicked.

119
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:32,526
However, Eusebius wrote that a certain Syrinus, not Marcion, was the author of the three principles and natures.

120
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:39,610
When the Marcionites defiled the universal Church of the East, they were overcome by Origen, who refuted and condemned them in each city.

121
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:49,539
After some years, although already defeated and exposed, they began to resurface in the African regions, but Tertullian overcame them in all ways, making them publicly denounce their own sect.

122
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:58,072
The twenty-second heresy is of the Apellites, led by Apelles, who introduces two gods but acknowledges one principle: that from that one principle, another was made.

123
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:03,705
When it was recognized as evil, it was rejected by the good, specifically by the good principle.

124
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:08,613
This principle, acting against the will of the good principle, created the world in its own evil.

125
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:15,089
This explains why we are naturally more inclined towards evil than good, and why we find more pleasure in vices than in virtues.

126
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:22,274
They claim that our Lord Jesus Christ took on flesh from the elements and returned it to the air when he ascended, entering heaven without it.

127
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:29,358
Origen overcame these people so effectively that he became a traveling preacher, moving through each city in the East to spread his message.

128
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:41,602
Because his volumes of treatises are countless, the heretics, having been defeated, altered the books with very cunning reasoning to fit their own desires, so they could deceive others by claiming Origen had defined things in his expositions.

129
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:48,433
Therefore, anyone reading Origen today, if they can distinguish with prudent recitation, will detect the parts tainted by the heretics.

130
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:51,266
Saint Pamphilus the martyr affirmed this in his Apology.

131
00:12:51,266 --> 00:13:03,865
The twenty-third heresy of the Cerdonians began with Cerdo, who taught two opposing principles and claimed that the God of the law and prophets was not the Father of Christ, nor was He a good God, but a just one, while the Father of Christ was good.

132
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:10,847
He also claimed that Christ was neither born of a woman, nor had flesh, nor truly died or suffered anything, but only pretended to suffer.

133
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:25,723
Saint Apollonius, bishop of Corinth, opposed him and, along with the entire Eastern synod, condemned him, reasoning that this God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, about whom Moses says at the beginning of his book: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1).

134
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:37,411
He approved all the irreproachable ones of the Old Testament according to the Apostle, saying: "Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who then is the one who condemns?" (Romans 8:33).

135
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:41,122
These and similar things condemned the heretics for this reason.

136
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:48,171
The priests, with reasonable words, either tried to call them back from the precipice or to show that they condemned the sects, not the people.

137
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:53,248
However, the people condemned themselves by embracing the condemned sects and departing from the truth.

138
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,896
The twenty-fourth heresy is that of the Severians, who arose from Severus.

139
00:13:56,896 --> 00:14:02,466
They do not drink wine because they claim, with a fabulous vanity, that the vine sprouted from the seed of Satan.

140
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:06,212
They also reject the resurrection of the flesh along with the Old Testament.

141
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,846
Saint Euphranon, the bishop of Rhodes, condemned them; for their superstition arose in Rhodes.

142
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:18,930
He refuted them with the reasoning of the Holy Scriptures, which read that God brings forth bread from the earth to strengthen the heart of man and wine to gladden.

143
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,817
(Psalm 104:15-16).

144
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:24,106
The use of wine is not necessary, but excess is harmful to health and should be blamed.

145
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:30,809
The resurrection of the flesh was promised by Him who raised the dead in the present; if He had lied, He could not have raised the dead.

146
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:42,295
He clearly taught that the saints are the pillars of the Old Testament, like the foundations of a house, saying:
The foundations of the house are placed in dirty places so that the upper parts do not suffer any insult from the filth.

147
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:47,668
Therefore, the upper parts of the house are adorned with gilded ceilings, painted walls, and various marbles.

148
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:51,414
The lower parts, close to the earthly moisture, support all the upper parts.

149
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,695
What then shall we do now?

150
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:55,653
If we remove the lower parts, the upper parts will collapse.

151
00:14:55,653 --> 00:15:00,237
However, if the lower parts were to be destroyed, no one could do this except the Son of God.

152
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:07,533
Let us see, therefore, whether He Himself destroyed what we say remains:
Do you think, He said, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets?

153
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,194
I have not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.

154
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:10,934
(Matthew 5:17).

155
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:18,377
With these and similar words, Saint Euphranon, the bishop, converted many; those who persisted in error he deprived of communion by perpetual sanction.

156
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:23,996
The twenty-fifth heresy is that of the Tatianists, instituted by a certain Tatian, who are also called Encratites.

157
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:29,554
These people condemn marriage, equating it entirely with fornication and other corruptions.

158
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:33,828
They refuse to accept anyone who is married, whether male or female, into their ranks.

159
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:36,065
They do not eat meat and completely abhor it.

160
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:58,926
Saint Epiphanius, the bishop of Ancyra in Galatia, opposed them, citing the first letter of Paul the Apostle to Timothy:
Because they have a seared conscience, forbidding marriage and teaching to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth: for every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

161
00:15:58,926 --> 00:15:59,920
First Timothy 4:2-5.

162
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,834
We, however, commend our Catholic abstainers because when they do not take food, they do not say it is evil to take it.

163
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:10,257
Instead, they call it good and excellent, asserting that they are unworthy to receive it.

164
00:16:10,257 --> 00:17:07,908
Thus, the statute of the Apostle is also observed, which says: "Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats."
Romans 14:3.
For they do not accuse the creature but declare themselves to be unworthy of being refreshed by this feast.
Twenty-sixth Heresy: The Cataphrygians arose, named after the province, not the doctrine; their founders were Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla.
These people claim that the coming of the Holy Spirit promised by the Lord was returned to them rather than to the apostles.
They regard second marriages as fornication and say that the apostle Paul allowed them because he knew in part and prophesied in part.
For what is perfect had not yet come.
However, they deliriously believe that this perfection came in Montanus and his prophetesses whom we mentioned above.
So far, I have spoken about the Cataphrygians.
I pass over the other things said about them as uncertain.
Regarding the claim that they take the blood of infants, we mention it so as not to seem ignorant of everything said about them: for those who wrote against them did not mention anything at all about this.

165
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:13,443
Books were written against them by Saint Soter, the Pope of Rome, and Apollonius, the bishop of Ephesus.

166
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:16,884
In response, Tertullian, a presbyter of Carthage, wrote against them.

167
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:22,471
While Tertullian's writings were generally excellent and incomparable, he was criticized for defending Montanus.

168
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:34,741
He argued against the aforementioned Soter, the Pope of Rome, claiming that the accusations about the blood of an infant, the Trinity in the unity of the Godhead, repentance for the fallen, the same mysteries, and one Passover with us were false.

169
00:17:34,741 --> 00:18:57,688
He stated, "This is the only thing we differ on: we do not accept second marriages, and we do not reject Montanus' prophecy about the future judgment." Some people object to Tertullian, saying he claimed the soul is generated from the soul, just as the body is from the body, which the Catholic faith strongly opposes.
The twenty-seventh heresy is of the Pepuzians, named after a certain place. Epiphanius says this deserted city is called Jerusalem by them because they consider it divine. They give such prominence to women that they even honor them with the priesthood. They claim two churches, one of Quintilla and one of Priscilla, in the same city of Pepuza. They are associated with the Cataphrygians. They are looked down upon because these Pepuzians consider themselves better than others. They say that this village of Pepuza was the home of Montanus, Priscilla, and Maximilla, and because they started preaching there and lived there, they called the place Jerusalem. And because they are the inhabitants of the place, they consider themselves superior to others. Apollonius, the bishop of Ephesus, overcame them.
The twenty-eighth heresy calls its followers Artotyrites, named after their offering. They offer bread and cheese, claiming that the first people celebrated offerings to God from the fruits of the earth and sheep. Epiphanius connects them with the Pepuzians, against whom no one has deemed it worthy to even speak.
The twenty-ninth heresy is of the Tessarescaedecatites, named because they celebrate Passover on the fourteenth moon, regardless of the day of the week. And if it coincides with Sunday, they fast and keep vigil on that day.

170
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,248
The only difference between them and us is this, and nothing else.

171
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:05,830
Saint John, the bishop of Constantinople, achieved unity in many cities using this method.

172
00:19:05,830 --> 00:20:46,890
He visited with his clergy and celebrated Easter with them, saying:
"Just as we celebrated Easter with you, come and celebrate with us too."
When they agreed, they began to think the same way and celebrate the day with us.
They realized that we share the same faith and believe just like them.
Thirty.
The thirtieth heresy is the Alogi.
They are called this because they refuse to accept that the Word of God is the Son; they even claim the Gospel of John is not his, nor do they accept the Revelation of John.
What more can be said?
They agree with us on everything else but completely reject the idea that the Word of God is the Son of God, considering it blasphemy.
Bishop Philo often defeated them.
Thirty-One.
The thirty-first heresy is the Adamites, named after Adam, whose nakedness in paradise they imitate, just as it was before sin.
They reject marriage because Adam did not know his wife before he was expelled from paradise.
They believe that marriages would not have existed if no one had sinned.
Thus, men and women meet naked, listen to readings naked, pray naked, celebrate the sacraments naked, and consider their church to be their paradise.
Saint Polycarp, the priest, discovered them, overcame them, and eliminated them.
Thirty-Two.
The thirty-second heresy is the Helcesites.
A false prophet named Helchi deceived them, and from his lineage, two women were worshipped by them as goddesses.
The rest of their beliefs are said by Epiphanius to be similar to those of the Ebionites.
Papias, the priest of Achaia, overcame them.
Thirty-Three.
The thirty-third heresy is held by the Theodotians, founded by Theodotus, who claimed that Christ was only a human being, the Son of God.
It is said that Theodotus taught this because, during persecution, he fell and thought he could avoid disgrace by claiming he had not denied God but only a man.
Craton, the bishop of the Syrians, overcame them.
Thirty-Four.
The thirty-fourth heresy was discovered by the Melchizedekians.

173
00:20:46,992 --> 00:22:39,936
Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High God, is believed not to have been a human but rather a power of God, following that passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews where it says, "without father, without mother, without genealogy" Hebrews 7:3. Dionysius, the bishop of Jerusalem, countered this by saying that he did have both a father and a mother. He explained that the Apostle said this because neither his genealogy nor his maternal or paternal ancestry was included in the order prescribed by the law of the Hebrews, even though the generation of the Hebrews was certainly pleasing to God.
Heresy thirty-five is that of the Bardesanites, named after a certain Bardesanes who went astray. It is said that Bardesanes was originally a perfect Catholic but later fell into error through a disciple of Valentinus, claiming that the creation of human flesh was evil, but the soul was good. Theocritus, the bishop of Cappadocia, condemned him, teaching that God made both good, joined both together, and that it was the transgression, not the nature of human flesh, that should be blamed.
Heresy thirty-six is that of the Noetians, who say that Christ is the same as the Father and the Holy Spirit: not by substance, as we understand it, but by person, so that the Holy Spirit is said to be only seemingly, not truly. He was condemned by Tranquillus, the bishop of the Chalcedonians in Syria. Tranquillus showed that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all true: one God by one substance, but believed to be three persons by distinction.
Heresy thirty-seven is that of the Valesians, who unhappily castrate both themselves and their guests. They claim that this is in fulfillment of the saying, "Those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven" Matthew 19:12. They are also said to teach other heretical and shameful things, but neither Epiphanius himself mentions them, nor have I been able to find them anywhere. They were condemned by a synod in Achaia.
Heresy thirty-eight is that of the Cathars, who arrogantly call themselves by this name as if for purity. They do not admit second marriages. They deny penance. They follow the heretic Novatus, and thus are also called Novatians.

174
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:48,117
Against the blessed Sixtus, martyr and bishop, and the venerable Cyprian, martyr of Christ and bishop of Carthage, a book was written against Novatus on the Lapsed.

175
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:54,951
It stated that those who have fallen can recover the grace they lost through repentance, which Novatus claimed was absolutely impossible.

176
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,345
The thirty-ninth heresy is that of the Angelics.

177
00:22:57,345 --> 00:23:02,383
They wanted to be called Angelics and believed that angels should be worshiped and honored in spirit.

178
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:09,766
They thought prayers should be offered to angels so that, knowing who has more power than themselves, they would fulfill human wishes and petitions.

179
00:23:09,766 --> 00:23:14,156
Epiphanius testifies that they were completely defeated by Theophilus, bishop of Apamea.

180
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:18,895
In the fortieth place appeared the Apostolics, who arrogantly wanted to be called by this name.

181
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:26,927
They do not accept into their communion those who use marriage and possess personal property, such as the Catholic Church does, including many monks and clerics.

182
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:34,609
These are considered heretics because, separating themselves from the Church, they believe that those who use these things, which they lack, have no hope.

183
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:43,189
The Church counters them with the testimony in which the Apostle says: Even if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing First Corinthians 13:3.

184
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:50,422
The forty-first heresy is that of the Sabellians, which arose from Sabellius, who confessed that the same person is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

185
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:57,705
They are also called Praxeans, after their initial teacher Praxeas, and Hermogenians, because they had Hermogenes in their company with Sabellius.

186
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:04,589
They were countered by Dositheus, bishop of Seleucia, who taught that they deny the whole Trinity while thinking they are defending unity.

187
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:11,573
For the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, equal in all things to the Father and the Son.

188
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:15,813
Divinity thus maintains unity of substance without losing the distinction of persons.

189
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:23,073
The forty-second heresy of the Origenists began with a certain Origen, not the well-known one, but another extremely wicked Syrian.

190
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:28,584
Epiphanius says that this man taught such shameful things that they shouldn't be recorded for our descendants.

191
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:33,292
The forty-third heresy of the Origenists followed immediately after, as Epiphanius also notes.

192
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:40,555
They deny the resurrection of the dead, claim that the Holy Spirit is a creature of Christ, and interpret paradise and the heavens allegorically.

193
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,759
These two Origens wrote many corrupt things.

194
00:24:42,759 --> 00:25:50,533
Heretical and perverse teachers mixed these writings with those of our Catholic writer Origen, fulfilling what the Lord says in the Gospels: "Did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these weeds come from?" He replied, "An enemy did this" Matthew 13:27.
That is why, when we read Origen, we find a Catholic who fights against heresies and wins; yet, at the same time, we find a heretic who contradicts the faith. Written words convey both the letter and the meaning: if they could also show the faces of the speakers, no one could mistake the identity of the teacher.
It must also be noted that a certain Ampullianus, a heresiarch from Bithynia, who taught after Origen in the Church of God, fell into such heresy that he claimed all criminals, along with the devil and demons, would be boiled in hell until they became pure and could emerge from there clean and spotless, to be restored to their creator as they were before their guilt.
When he was condemned by the universal Church, he began to produce books of Origen that he himself had corrupted, saying, "See, this is what Origen believed," especially in the four books of "Periarchon." But anyone of sound mind and clear vision can see the evil additions to Origen's works and recognize them, just as one would notice white or differently colored patches sewn onto a scarlet cloak.

195
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:53,785
What Saint Pamphilus, the holy martyr, teaches us is true.

196
00:25:53,785 --> 00:26:00,306
Before he received the crown of martyrdom, he held the bishop's chair blamelessly and shared sound doctrine with God's people.

197
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:05,118
He wrote an Apology and refuted all the false claims made by ignorant Catholics about Origen.

198
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:11,432
He showed that the works found objectionable in Origen's writings were not his, but those of others whom he had surpassed.

199
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:18,315
The entirely erroneous works, however, belonged to two other heretics who used Origen's name without sharing his faith or conscience.

200
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:24,421
Heresy 44, the forty-fourth heresy, was created by Paul of Samosata and led to the formation of the Paulian community.

201
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:29,907
They claimed that Christ did not always exist but began with Mary and that he was nothing more than a man.

202
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,132
This heresy previously belonged to Artemon.

203
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,358
When it faded, Paul of Samosata revived it.

204
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:44,449
Later, the Church opposed this heresy, and although many years passed, when its faulty defense by its proponents failed, it was renewed by our bishop Photinus, leading to the Photinian community.

205
00:26:44,449 --> 00:27:04,270
Therefore, whether you hear of the Artemonites, the Paulians, or the Photinians, you should know they are one and the same, just as we call the Donatists, the Montanists, and the Parmenianists by their leaders' names: Donatists from Donatus, Montanists from Montanus, and Parmenianists from Parmenian, who traveled throughout Africa writing books against us and composing new psalms.

206
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,340
Our own writer, Optatus, replied to him.

207
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,047
But let's return to the Paulians.

208
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:15,396
It is well known that we do not rebaptize heretics who come to us but extend a hand of reconciliation and then join them to the divine people.

209
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:21,606
However, the holy synod of Nicaea decreed that Paulians must be fully baptized before they can join the Catholic people.

210
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:27,454
This shows they did not keep the true rule of baptism, and hence this decree was established by Christ's bishops.

211
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:34,699
Heresy 45, the forty-fifth heresy, is the Photinian heresy, named after Photinus, who was our bishop just as Judas Iscariot was our apostle.

212
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,200
He created his own community.

213
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,847
Christ taught that a man was indeed pure and believed, like Paul of Samosata, that he began from Mary, but he always remembered that the Holy Spirit was eternal.

214
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:50,250
This belief differed from the forty-fourth heresy because he named the people who were led astray after himself.

215
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,495
The forty-sixth heresy was started by Mani, who formed the community of the Manichaeans.

216
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:59,319
Mani, a Persian citizen teaching in Persia, claimed to be an apostle of God and even went to Greece.

217
00:27:59,319 --> 00:29:17,039
His Greek disciples, avoiding the name of madness, decided to call him Manichaean, which means "pouring out manna."
He proposed two principles that were different and opposing, yet eternal and coeternal, meaning they always existed. He believed in two natures and substances, namely good and evil, following other ancient heretics. They tell stories about the struggle and mingling between these principles, the purification of good from evil, and the eternal damnation of the part of good that could not be purified from evil, according to their doctrines.
They say that good souls are of the same nature as God. Therefore, they confess that the world was made by the nature of good, that is, by the nature of God, but from the mingling of good and evil that happened when both natures fought each other. They believe that the purification and liberation of good from evil is performed not only through the whole world and all its elements by the power of God but also through their chosen ones by the food they consume.
They claim that the substance of God is mixed in these foods, just as it is in the whole world, and that it is purified in their chosen ones through the kind of life the elect Manichaeans lead, which they consider holier and more excellent than their followers. They wanted their church to consist of these two groups, the elect and the followers.
As for other people, even their own followers, they believe that this part of the good and divine substance, which is mixed and bound in food and drink, is thought to be more tightly and impurely bound, especially in those who have children.

218
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:25,719
Whatever light is purified from all sides through certain vessels, which they believe to be the moon and the sun, is returned to the kingdom of God as its proper seats.

219
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:33,903
They claim that these vessels are made from the pure substance of God and that this physical light, visible to mortal eyes, is considered to be the nature of God.

220
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:40,117
They attribute five elements, which have their own rulers, to the race of darkness: smoke, darkness, fire, water, and wind.

221
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:49,565
Animals born in smoke are bipedal, from which they believe humans originate; in darkness, crawling creatures; in fire, quadrupeds; in water, swimming creatures; in wind, flying creatures.

222
00:29:49,565 --> 00:30:03,811
To combat these five evil elements, they say that five other elements were sent from the kingdom and substance of God; and in that battle, they were mixed together: air with smoke, light with darkness, good fire with bad fire, good water with bad water, and good wind with bad wind.

223
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:10,682
They distinguish those vessels, namely the two celestial lights, by saying that the moon is made of good water and the sun of good fire.

224
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:28,667
They believe that there are holy virtues in these vessels, which transform themselves into males to entice the females of the opposing race; and through this attraction, their stirred-up lust causes the light mixed with their bodies to flee, to be received and purified by angels of light, and placed in those vessels to be returned to its proper kingdoms.

225
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:38,569
On this occasion, their elect are compelled to consume something like the Eucharist mixed with human seed, so that even from this, as with other foods they take, that divine substance is purified.

226
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,994
But when they deny doing this, they are exposed.

227
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:44,076
For they were revealed in the church of Carthage in this way.

228
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:55,342
Finally, in a gathering of bishops before all the people, a girl not yet twelve years old confessed this vile crime; and she revealed many things, asserting that she had endured violence for this wicked sacrament of theirs.

229
00:30:55,848 --> 00:31:00,373
At first, when no one believed a single girl alone, she named many accomplices in the crime.

230
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:09,769
With the support of Ursus the tribune, who then presided over the royal house, they were expelled from various houses where they were hiding and brought by clerics to the Church of Restituta.

231
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:13,754
Because of this, having suffered greatly, they were finally compelled to confess.

232
00:31:13,754 --> 00:31:19,903
The entire vile crime was then revealed, involving flour spread to catch and mix the seed of those having sexual intercourse.

233
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:26,642
With immense shame, it is said and heard that in recent times, some of them were brought to the church, as the episcopal records testify.

234
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:29,692
There are three types: Catharists, Macarians, and Manichaeans.

235
00:31:29,692 --> 00:31:34,168
It is known that all these three forms were written by one master, the wicked Mani himself.

236
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:38,251
All of them read Manichean works, and all his books are undoubtedly common to them.

237
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:47,942
In these books, it is taught that through lust, the prince of darkness of both sexes is dissolved, and the divine substance, which they believe to be held stained in human seed, is freed from them.

238
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,796
Hence, they are also called Catharists, meaning purifiers.

239
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:57,683
Although they do not eat meat, they are so defiled that they even consume human seed with all their food, even though they do not take eggs.

240
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,798
They say that even eggs expire when broken.

241
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:06,931
Nor do they use milk as nourishment; not because they think there is no divine substance mixed in it, but because their beliefs are inconsistent.

242
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:13,916
For they do not drink wine, saying it is the gall of the prince of darkness, yet they eat grapes, even though they do not take a drop of must.

243
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:25,034
They believe the souls of their listeners are reincarnated into the elect; however, they assert that other souls, those not of their listeners, return into animals and into all things fixed by roots and nourished in the earth.

244
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:30,150
They believe that herbs and trees have life in such a way that they feel pain and suffering when harmed.

245
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:40,021
Therefore, they also accuse farming, the most innocent of all arts, as if it were responsible for many murders, foolishly blaming it especially when they see a field being cleared of thorns.

246
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:44,300
They believe their listeners are excused because they provide food for their chosen ones.

247
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,453
By purifying the divine substance in their stomachs, it is said to grant forgiveness to those whose offerings need purification.

248
00:32:50,453 --> 00:33:01,125
Thus, the chosen ones themselves do not work in the fields, do not pick fruit, nor pluck any leaves, but wait for these to be brought to them by their listeners, living off many and great murders according to their vanity.

249
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:10,403
They also instruct their listeners that if they eat meat, they should not kill animals, so as not to offend the rulers of darkness bound in the heavens, from whom they say all flesh originates.

250
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:18,719
And thus, they use their spouses to avoid conception and generation, so that the divine substance that enters them through food does not get bound in the flesh of offspring.

251
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,940
They believe that souls come into all flesh through food and drink.

252
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,622
Hence, they undoubtedly condemn and, as much as they can, prohibit marriage when they prevent generation, which is the purpose of marriage.

253
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:42,083
They claim that Adam and Eve were born from the rulers of smoke, whose father, they say, is named Saclas, who they claim devoured the offspring of all his companions, and whatever of the divine substance was mixed within, he bound in the flesh of offspring by lying with his wife.

254
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:52,322
They assert that Christ was the one whom our Scripture calls the serpent, from whom their eyes were enlightened to discern good and evil; and they claim that Christ came in the last days to free souls, not bodies.

255
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:59,244
They say he was not in true flesh, but only appeared to have flesh to deceive human senses, where he not only faked death but also resurrection.

256
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:06,167
They affirm that the God who gave the law through Moses and spoke in the Hebrew prophets is not the true God, but one of the rulers of darkness.

257
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:13,073
They read the New Testament Scriptures in a way that supports their views, accepting what they like and rejecting what they don't.

258
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,918
They even regard some apocryphal texts as completely true.

259
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,363
They believe that the promise of our Lord Jesus Christ about the Paraclete was fulfilled in their leader, Mani.

260
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:30,095
Mani, in his letters, refers to himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ, claiming that Jesus promised to send him, thus making him an apostle through whom the Holy Spirit was sent.

261
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:39,660
To imitate the apostolic number, Mani also had twelve disciples, a tradition the Manichaeans continue today with twelve teachers selected from their elect and a thirteenth leader overseeing them.

262
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:45,106
The bishops, ordained by these teachers, and the priests, ordained by the bishops, are of an indefinite number.

263
00:34:45,106 --> 00:34:46,577
The bishops also have deacons.

264
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:48,490
The rest are simply known as the elect.

265
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:54,818
Those deemed suitable among them are sent to propagate their beliefs, either to expand their influence or to prevent its decline.

266
00:34:54,818 --> 00:35:00,607
They believe that baptism in water does not bring salvation and thus do not consider it necessary for their followers.

267
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:09,339
They pray to the sun during the day and to the moon at night if it is visible; if not, they pray to the northern part of the sky, where the sun returns to the East after setting.

268
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,908
They always stand while praying.

269
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:17,972
They attribute the origin of sins not to individual free will but to the substance of an opposing race, which they believe is mixed with humans.

270
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:23,270
They teach that all flesh is not the work of Divinity but of an evil mind, co-eternal with the opposing God.

271
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:29,206
They believe carnal desire, which causes the flesh to lust against the spirit, is a contrary substance that clings to us.

272
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:33,130
Even when liberated and purified, it regenerates and lives immortally by nature.

273
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,655
They claim there are two souls and two minds in one person, naturally opposing each other-one good and one bad-in perpetual conflict.

274
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,786
When this age ends, after the world's fiery destruction, they say that the substance of evil will be confined in a certain sphere like a prison.

275
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:57,325
They claim that this sphere will also contain the souls that are naturally good but could not be cleansed from the contamination of evil nature, adhering to it like a covering or plaster.

276
00:35:57,325 --> 00:35:57,631
XLVII.

277
00:35:57,631 --> 00:36:00,437
The forty-seventh heretic was Hierac of the Hieracites.

278
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:02,478
They deny the resurrection of the flesh.

279
00:36:02,478 --> 00:36:07,069
They only accept monks and nuns into their community, and those who do not have marriages.

280
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:14,007
They say that children do not belong to the kingdom of heaven because they have no merits from any struggle by which vices are overcome.

281
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:21,506
Saint Aphrodisius, bishop of Hellespont, opposed them, asserting that the resurrection of the flesh is affirmed by both the New and Old Testaments.

282
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:31,606
He argued that infants are already human beings: and just as if someone kills them, they are charged with murder, so those who consecrate them with baptism acquire a reward for saving a human being.

283
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:36,606
Communion should be denied to no one, except those who, neglecting their own spouses, seek others.

284
00:36:36,606 --> 00:36:36,963
XLVIII.

285
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:41,095
The forty-eighth heresy is that of the Meletians, named after a certain Meletius.

286
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:45,533
They refused to pray with those who had fallen during persecution and created a schism.

287
00:36:45,533 --> 00:36:54,002
Saint Basil, bishop of Cappadocia, resisted them, saying that greater love of hope and faith, which endures all things, should extend a hand to those who have fallen.

288
00:36:54,002 --> 00:37:03,337
He also encouraged those in despair of recovery to return, for even the angels in heaven have greater joy over one repentant sinner than over ninety-nine who did not sin (Luke 15:10).

289
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:03,592
XLIX.

290
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,480
The forty-ninth heresiarch was Arius.

291
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:12,060
He founded the Arian peoples, who do not believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same substance.

292
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:18,641
Instead, they believe the Son is a creation and the Holy Spirit is a creation of a creation, that is, created by the Son himself.

293
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:31,171
In that he considered Christ to have taken on flesh without a soul, Epiphanius reported, and therefore says the Father is greater than the Son as the creator, and the Son is greater than the Holy Spirit as his creator.

294
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,580
They rebaptize our people, that is, Catholics, who come to them.

295
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,001
Whether they do this to others, that is, non-Catholics, is not documented anywhere.

296
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:44,593
The first to oppose them was Saint Hesiod, bishop of the Corinthians, a man said to have raised the dead.

297
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:48,695
Consequently, people, focusing more on holiness than on debate, cursed Arius.

298
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:55,459
It is said that during his prayers, Arius, while sitting in the restroom, expelled all his intestines along with his excrement.

299
00:37:55,459 --> 00:38:02,596
Both Eastern and Western bishops have written against his sect, asserting that he blasphemes in every single chapter of his doctrines.

300
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:30,294
Epiphanius recalls the Audian schismatics from the 50th heresy, not as heretics, but as schismatics, whom others call Anthropomorphites because they imagine God in a carnal way, in the likeness of a corruptible human being, saying: "The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous" (Psalm 33:16); "The heavens are the work of God's fingers" (Psalm 8:4); and: "God sits on his holy throne" (Psalm 46:9); and: "God stands in the congregation of the mighty" (Psalm 82:1), and other things that can be thought of in a visible way.

301
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:38,283
Therefore, because they err in nothing else, Epiphanius, dealing more gently with them, did not want to call them heretics, forgiving their rusticity.

302
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:45,953
However, because they do not communicate with us, they claim that our bishops have wealth, which Christ also commands even laypeople to despise.

303
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:47,977
They celebrate Passover with the Jews.

304
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:50,480
Bishop Zenon of the Syrians acted against them.

305
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,197
The 51st heresy is of the Eunomians, from Eunomius.

306
00:38:53,197 --> 00:39:00,760
These, filled with the spirit of the ancient serpent, assert not only that the Son is lesser, but also that the Son is not of similar essence.

307
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,784
Presbyter Ammonius acted against them.

308
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:05,714
The 52nd heresy is of the Macedonians, from Macedonius.

309
00:39:05,714 --> 00:39:10,667
Our people in the East call them Pneumatomachians because they dispute about the Holy Spirit.

310
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,700
They understand the Father and the Son correctly but refuse to believe that the Holy Spirit is God, claiming He is a creature.

311
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,606
Philaster notes that Macedonius refers to the Holy Spirit as the divinity of the Father and the Son.

312
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:25,696
This implies he denies the Holy Spirit His own distinct nature.

313
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,934
The fifty-third heresy is that of the Aerians, named after Aerius.

314
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:32,858
Aerius was a presbyter who became upset because he was not ordained as a bishop.

315
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:38,156
He taught that prayers should not be offered for the dead and that established fasts should not be observed.

316
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:43,062
Instead, he believed fasting should be done whenever one wishes to avoid appearing bound by the law.

317
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:51,155
He also believed there should be no distinction between a presbyter and a bishop and that only those who abstain from marriage should be admitted to their communion.

318
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,442
The fifty-fourth heresy is that of the Aetians, named after Aetius.

319
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:59,348
Along with Eunomius, they claim that the Son is completely dissimilar to the Father in all respects.

320
00:39:59,348 --> 00:40:05,577
They assert that anyone who agrees with their faith should know that no sins can harm them, no matter what they have committed.

321
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,785
A synod of 20 bishops in Achaia opposed them.

322
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:11,513
The fifty-fifth heresy is that of the Apollinarians, founded by Apollinaris.

323
00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:16,419
They deny that Christ was a perfect man, claiming that divinity took the place of a soul in the man.

324
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:19,607
They teach that the flesh and the Word are of the same substance.

325
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:53,504
They assert, quite contentiously, "The Word became flesh" John 1:14, suggesting that something of the Word was converted into flesh.
Furthermore, they claim that none of Mary's flesh was involved in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
A synod in Antioch opposed them.
The fifty-sixth heresy is that of the Antidicomarites, who vehemently deny Mary's perpetual virginity, asserting she united with a man after Christ was born.
Theodotus, the bishop of Cyprus, opposed them.
The fifty-seventh heresy is that of the Messalians.
Their name comes from the Syrian language; in Greek, they are called Euchites, named for their constant praying.
They do not chant psalms but pray continuously.

326
00:40:54,239 --> 00:41:00,339
But because they act alone, without love, kindness, or humanity, they are refuted by the holy council among the heretics.

327
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:07,195
They also condemn those monks who, apart from reading and praying, engage in any other work, whether it be craftsmanship or agriculture.

328
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:09,766
Epiphanius reached this point and then fell silent.

329
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,531
I believe he lived up to that time.

330
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:16,068
Human curiosity can indicate past and present things, but only God can predict the future.

331
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:22,369
Philaster, in his books recounting the histories of various people, also includes the heresies that arose at different times.

332
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:25,293
We now present only the heresies excerpted from his books.

333
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:27,763
Ephrem, the priest of the Syrians, opposed these.

334
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:30,384
The Metangismonites started the fifty-eighth heresy.

335
00:41:30,384 --> 00:42:22,711
The Greek word angeion means "vessel," and metangismos means a vessel within a vessel.
From this concept, they took their name, saying: "The Son is in the Father as a smaller vessel is within a larger vessel."
The Church rejects them because they think carnally about the incorporeal, treat the incomprehensible in a limited way, and propose a hierarchy within the equality of the Divinity.
Diodorus, bishop of Nicomedia, opposed these.
The fifty-ninth heresy involves the Seleucians, originating from Seleucus, who claim that the material elements from which the world was made were not created by God but are co-eternal with God.
They do not attribute the soul to God the creator but claim that angels create souls from fire and spirit.
They assert that evil sometimes comes from God and sometimes from matter.
They deny that the Savior sits in the flesh at the right hand of the Father, claiming instead that He shed it and placed it in the sun, interpreting the psalm "He has set up a tabernacle in the sun" (Psalms 19:4) in this way.

336
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:31,079
They deny a visible paradise, do not accept baptism in water, do not believe in a future resurrection, but assert that it happens daily in the generation of children.

337
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:39,580
These people, according to our faith's teachings, are not allowed to engage in debate with us; instead, they are meant to be condemned for their definitions.

338
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,451
The sixtieth heresy was created by the Proclinianists, followers of Proclus.

339
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:50,174
They claim that the Son of God appeared on earth like the angel Raphael or Gabriel-not by taking on flesh, but simply by being seen.

340
00:42:50,174 --> 00:42:53,943
They blend in with the people of God so seamlessly that they go unnoticed.

341
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:57,865
Unfortunately, since they have no other errors, they interact with us freely.

342
00:42:57,865 --> 00:43:03,213
This is more problematic because they can easily influence simple people to think and believe as they do.

343
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,219
They assert a belief that is very hostile to our salvation.

344
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:11,872
They question whether God had to endure the impurities associated with natural conception, birth, and delivery.

345
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:18,137
Did the Son of God have to deal with bodily functions like a cleansing stomach, a runny nose, saliva, earwax, or excrement?

346
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,022
Did he have to experience foul odors?

347
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:22,416
These ideas are the result of a disturbed mind.

348
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:27,356
Tertullian strongly opposes these notions, arguing that the Son of God is incapable of suffering.

349
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:31,023
He insists that these experiences do not harm but rather honor Divinity.

350
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:42,585
He uses an analogy: Just as a king might put on a servant's tunic to retrieve a gem-encrusted golden ring from a sewer, allowing the tunic to get dirty while he rescues the ring and cleans it, then wears it on his royal finger.

351
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:45,438
Similarly, the Son of God took on the form of a servant.

352
00:43:45,438 --> 00:43:51,397
He came down not just to earth, where we live, but even to the underworld, which is far below us, to rescue humanity.

353
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:53,638
He endured all our filth-none of it his own.

354
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:58,833
For the living, he lived like us, differing only in that he led a sinless life, having God within him.

355
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:03,672
For the dead, he died similarly, differing only in that he rose from the dead on the third day.

356
00:44:03,672 --> 00:44:07,696
By descending in this way, he rescued the saints and bound the prince of death.

357
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:17,113
But as for the golden ring with the gem that he placed, he taught in the following reading that the ring represents the body and the gem inside it symbolizes the soul.

358
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:26,574
Therefore, Christ, lifting this ring from the ancient filth and sewer of this world, washed it with the water of baptism, cleansing it from all grime, and made it shine in His holy hands.

359
00:44:26,574 --> 00:44:31,026
For it is written: "But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God" (Wisdom 3:1).

360
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:34,416
And again: "Set me as a seal upon your hand" (Song of Solomon 8:6).

361
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,249
And: "Into your hands I commend my spirit" (Psalm 31:5).

362
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:43,928
There are countless similar passages in the holy scriptures, which we omit for brevity, so let us proceed to the sixty-first heresy.

363
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:48,026
The sixty-first heresy was created by the Patricians, originating from Patricius.

364
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:57,083
They believe that the substance of human flesh was not created by God, but by the devil, and they detest it so much that they say one who can consistently kill himself is perfect.

365
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:00,118
Some of them even ask strangers they encounter to kill them.

366
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:03,609
This madness began long ago in parts of Upper Numidia and Mauretania.

367
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:10,743
Later, the wretched Donatists followed them and began to throw themselves from the peak of a mountain as if they would become future martyrs.

368
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:15,398
So those who abandon eternal life through the Catholic faith find eternal death by violence.

369
00:45:15,398 --> 00:45:17,573
It is read that Optatus acted against them.

370
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:19,951
The sixty-second heresy is that of the Ascitae.

371
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,430
The Ascitae are named from the word for wineskin.

372
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,151
For askos means wineskin in Greek.

373
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:39,228
Though they have no issues with the Trinity, they place a large wineskin next to the altar, inflate it, cover it with linens, and worship it, because they add the blood of the Lord there, saying that evangelical phrase: "They put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved" (Matthew 9:17).

374
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:42,011
The sixty-third heresy is that of the Passalorynchites.

375
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:50,713
Whenever they gather at their church, they strive for such silence that they place a finger on their nose and lips, so as not to disturb the silence even with their breath.

376
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:56,308
But why those who composed this name preferred to signify a finger by a stake, I do not know.

377
00:45:56,308 --> 00:46:00,288
In Greek, passalos means stake, daktylos means finger, and rhynchos means nose.

378
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:03,663
However, it seems better to me if they are called Dactylorynchitae.

379
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:16,660
The devil has found some in the law of God to turn them into Pythagoreans, observing what the Apostles said:
"I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the mind" (First Corinthians 14:15).

380
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,698
Therefore, they teach people outside the church what to say in their hearts while inside the church.

381
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:29,456
As if the same Apostle did not say:
"With the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation" (Romans 10:10).

382
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:37,163
I say it is a futile effort to engage with such people, who waste time responding to them, and I believe it is right to conquer them by remaining silent.

383
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:42,856
The sixty-fourth heresy of the Aquarians, who are called Aquarians because they offer water in the sacrament cup.

384
00:46:42,856 --> 00:46:52,074
They say that wine causes drunkenness, through which murders, fornications, and other crimes are committed, although it is clear that anything in excess causes crime and creates vice.

385
00:46:52,074 --> 00:46:56,105
Therefore, crimes are not committed by drinking wine, but by excessive drinking.

386
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:59,480
For what is there that, when taken in excess, does not incur blame?

387
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,905
Let water be drunk excessively; let's see if it does not cause harm.

388
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:06,532
Let bread be eaten excessively; let's see if it does not cause gluttony.

389
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:17,917
Therefore, holding to moderation in all things is best, and we also condemn those who, separating the blood of Christ from the source, boldly infringe the rule established by Christ under the pretext of fornication and murder.

390
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:21,494
The sixty-fifth heresy of the Coluthians arose from a certain Coluthus.

391
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:28,698
They say that God created both good and evil, interpreting literally what is said:
"I am the Lord, creating evil and doing good" (Isaiah 45:7).

392
00:47:28,698 --> 00:47:41,795
When God promised through the prophet that He would make them live without the sword of enemies and make the land give its produce and abundance of all crops if they kept His commandments; but if they were transgressors, they would suffer the sword and famine.

393
00:47:41,795 --> 00:47:45,775
And after saying this, He added:
"I am the Lord, creating evil and doing good."

394
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:51,820
Those who transfer this to the substance from the appearance assert that God is the creator of evils.

395
00:47:51,820 --> 00:48:03,172
Since no creature is evil, they can, as I see it, blaspheme God perversely because He says to the people: If you walk uprightly, I will walk uprightly with you; but if you walk perversely, I will walk perversely with you.

396
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:03,994
Leviticus 26:23.

397
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:10,466
The sixty-sixth heresy is that of the Florians, named after Florian, who says that both good and bad souls are created by God.

398
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:18,120
Therefore, he claims, those who are malicious are evil and cannot change; and the good who live simply are not drawn into the audacity of wicked men.

399
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,411
This statement is briefly refuted by Theodore, who points out that Judas was good and became a traitor.

400
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:33,377
At the very moment when the worst prostitute was washing His feet with her tears, seeking mercy, if the woman had an evil soul, why did she not persist in the crime of prostitution at that time?

401
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:47,503
It is evident, therefore, that good souls are created by God: to whom the Creator has granted by nature that, while they are good, they are not only improved by their own actions, but can also turn to evil itself, as diligence finds one thing and negligence incurs the other.

402
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:51,355
The sixty-seventh heresy is that of the Satannians, followers of Satannius.

403
00:48:51,355 --> 00:49:02,605
They say that after the resurrection of the dead, we will not remain in the same state as we are now; nor will we be changed in such a way that there will be a new heaven and a new earth, as the Holy Scripture promises.

404
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:03,530
Second Peter 3:13.

405
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,150
The writings of both Testaments oppose these views.

406
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,718
The sixty-eighth heresy is that of the Gymnopodae.

407
00:49:08,718 --> 00:49:13,444
They always walk barefoot because the Lord said to Moses: Remove the sandals from your feet.

408
00:49:13,444 --> 00:49:14,009
Exodus 3:5.

409
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:17,091
And because it is written that Saint Isaiah walked barefoot.

410
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:17,707
Isaiah 20:2.

411
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:21,149
Therefore, they create a schism by condemning those who wear shoes.

412
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:24,693
The sixty-ninth heresy is that of the Donatists, named after Donatus.

413
00:49:24,693 --> 00:49:36,560
They created a schism due to the ordination of Caecilian as bishop of the Church of Carthage, against their will, accusing him of unproven crimes, and especially that he was ordained by those who had betrayed the divine Scriptures.

414
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,237
When they were exposed as liars, they turned their division into a heresy.

415
00:49:41,237 --> 00:49:48,741
They acted as if, even if the accusations against Caecilian had been true, the Church worldwide could have lost its status because of one man's fault.

416
00:49:48,741 --> 00:50:01,048
Whether true or, as seemed more apparent to the judges, false, they believed only Donatus could have preserved the Church's status in Africa, while the efforts of the holy apostles and the suffering of the martyrs would have been erased globally.

417
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:09,953
Even the blood of our Savior, they argued, failed to preserve the assembly of the Catholic faith, which only Donatus and a few insignificant followers from Byzacena could obtain.

418
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:11,854
So, they dared to rebaptize Catholics.

419
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:20,208
In doing this, they proved themselves presumptuous and damnable, knowing that the universal Church did not approve of violating the power of baptism, even in heretics.

420
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:22,759
We read that the leader of this heresy was Donatus.

421
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:26,962
He came from Numidia to Carthage and divided the people of Christ against Caecilian.

422
00:50:26,962 --> 00:50:32,364
He joined bishops of the same faction and appointed a man named Majorinus as bishop in his part of Carthage.

423
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:41,519
Another Donatus succeeded Majorinus in this division, and his eloquence confirmed this heresy so much that many believe the Donatists took the beginning of their heresy more from him.

424
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,372
His writings still exist today, proving that he opposed the Catholic faith regarding the Trinity.

425
00:50:46,372 --> 00:50:55,127
Though he claimed that in the Trinity, God the Father is of one substance, he tried to assert that the Father is greater than the Son and the Son greater than the Holy Spirit.

426
00:50:55,127 --> 00:51:00,079
However, no one among his followers paid attention to this error because their focus was elsewhere.

427
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,682
These heretics are called Montenses in parts of Italy, Parmenianians in inner Africa, and Donatists in Carthage.

428
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:15,187
In both Numidias, they have monks of sorts, called Circumcellions, rustic and very bold servants of demons, who not only fiercely attack others but also, poor souls, do not spare themselves.

429
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:26,255
They have become accustomed to ending their lives through various means, especially by jumping from heights, drowning, and burning, and they lure as many people as they can from both genders to do the same.

430
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:31,188
Sometimes, they even ask those they meet to kill them, threatening them with death if they refuse.

431
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:35,717
It's true that many Donatists disapprove of such actions, but only in words, not in deeds.

432
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:43,116
If they truly disapproved, they would not associate with these individuals, who accuse the churches around the world of the crime of one Caecilian.

433
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:45,431
They have often had disputes among themselves.

434
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:58,214
Finally, in Carthage, during the time of Count Heraclian, when Maximian was ordained by nearly one hundred bishops of the same error against Primianus, he was condemned by the remaining three hundred and ten bishops, who accused his ordination of crimes.

435
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:03,096
He taught his followers that the baptism of Christ could be administered even outside the Church.

436
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:12,609
Therefore, whoever moved from Primianus to Maximian or from Maximian to Primianus was not baptized again by the one they previously opposed and is accepted by the one they surely condemned.

437
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,779
They do not reject, refuse, or change the sacrament of baptism.

438
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:22,574
Whether someone is baptized or ordained as a cleric by Primianus or Maximian, it is as if it was done by one, not two opposing parties.

439
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:33,545
In the dignity from which one came to the other, they remain: baptism is not changed, nor is the dignity taken away; because the division was made not over the dispute of baptism, but over the contention of ordination.

440
00:52:33,545 --> 00:52:40,843
They began to dissent over the ordination of Caecilian, not over the transgression of baptism or faith, and separated themselves from the Church.

441
00:52:40,843 --> 00:52:46,128
Priscillian is recorded to have started the seventieth heresy of the Priscillianists among the Spaniards.

442
00:52:46,128 --> 00:52:48,292
They claim that souls are of divine nature.

443
00:52:48,292 --> 00:53:00,975
They believe these souls descend through seven heavens and various stages to engage in some voluntary struggle on earth and encounter an evil prince, who they think created this world, and from this prince, they are sown into different bodies of flesh.

444
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:08,284
They also claim that people are bound by the stars of fate and that our bodies are composed according to the twelve signs of the zodiac.

445
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:16,248
Just like astrologers, they place Aries in the head, Taurus in the neck, Gemini in the shoulders, Cancer in the chest, and so on, naming the signs down to the feet.

446
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:19,648
They have shifted from the sign of Christ to the signs of astrologers.

447
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:21,979
They invent many other fabulous and vain things.

448
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:24,601
They separate wives from their husbands when they can.

449
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,350
They avoid meat like the Manicheans.

450
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:32,906
They accept apocryphal books along with the canonical Scriptures and interpret them allegorically according to their own understanding.

451
00:53:32,906 --> 00:53:38,685
They confess the Trinity, like the Sabellians, as the Father being the same as the Son and the same as the Holy Spirit.

452
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:45,823
The seventy-first heresy began with the Adelophagi, who say that Christians should not eat in a way that others can see them while they are eating.

453
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:49,174
This is the only reason they are considered separate from the Church.

454
00:53:49,174 --> 00:53:51,457
They confess the Trinity of the same substance.

455
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:53,496
Bishops from Ephesus have dealt with them.

456
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:57,916
The seventy-second heresy of the Rhetorians, started by Rhetorius, is noted by Philastrius.

457
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:05,637
They have fallen into such vanity that they say all heretics are rightly following God because this is given in their minds: they worship God as best they can.

458
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:09,911
Their error seems reprehensible to us, but before God, there is neither error nor blame.

459
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:18,798
Their teachers instruct them to enter any place where Christ, born of a Virgin, is invoked, whether it is a temple or synagogue, and to make themselves participants with the heretics.

460
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:21,420
The seventy-third heresy is that of the Theopaschites.

461
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:28,025
They say that in Christ, while He suffered, the Divinity felt pain just as the soul can feel pain when the body is subjected to torment.

462
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:44,293
Bishop Gregory says of them: "Unfortunate and miserable ones, they do not see that when trees are cut with an iron tool, although sunlight is indeed present on the trees, the brightness of the sun does not feel pain, even though the iron strikes it before reaching the wood.
God, therefore, is light, and how can light be struck down?"

463
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:53,063
Because it is the soul that feels pain in the body, we notice this: when the soul leaves the body, the body cannot feel anything, neither good nor bad.

464
00:54:53,063 --> 00:55:01,219
Therefore, in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, the human soul felt what it assumed with the body, not He who assumed it, just as the sun shines on a tree.

465
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:12,879
Remember: even if the sunlight on the tree can be cut off by a blow, the Divinity in Christ cannot be touched by the one crucifying; because the light of the sun is a creature, but here the Creator is recognized and proven.

466
00:55:12,879 --> 00:55:19,781
For the human soul felt the suffering, the Lord Himself said to His disciples: "My soul is sorrowful even to death" (Matthew 26:38).

467
00:55:19,781 --> 00:55:22,657
And let this suffice: let us move on to the next point.

468
00:55:22,657 --> 00:55:34,212
The seventy-fourth heresy was committed by the Triscilidae: they assert that God is threefold, so that one part of Him is the Father, one part is the Son, and one part is the Holy Spirit, and thus the Trinity is in unity.

469
00:55:34,212 --> 00:56:31,414
Gregory said about them: "Unhappy and miserable, they do not see that they are blaspheming the entire Trinity." For God is only He who is perfect in Himself. Therefore, the perfect Father begot the perfect Son from Himself, and the perfect Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father. Behold, three perfect beings do not make three gods, but one, because there is one Deity. For, unlike three persons, there are not three deities: but there are three-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; yet one Deity, one majesty, one power, one will, and one substance to be confessed.
The seventy-fifth heresy was committed by the Hydrotheitae, who say that water is God, having neither beginning nor end, cleansing filth, forgiving sins, and having the Holy Spirit. The Catholic faith justly condemns them as blind and not seeing what filth water serves, and how God can serve, even in such squalor; or what significance water has without consecration. The living word gives it life, the holy word sanctifies it, so that the Holy Spirit may deign to dwell in it, or that it may cleanse the sins of believers.

470
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:40,650
Just as this entity gains its power through a blessing to cleanse all sins, it cannot cleanse the sins of someone who has not fully believed and offered their faith to God first.

471
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:49,423
Therefore, it's not just the act of washing, but more importantly, the act of believing that allows the Holy Spirit to be poured into people, granting the forgiveness of sins.

472
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:56,591
The seventy-sixth heresy was introduced by the Homuncionites, who claim that the image of God resides in the body of a person, not in the soul.

473
00:56:56,591 --> 00:57:09,073
Gregory states that since the image of God should be sought in the profound and primary aspects of a person-such as memory, intellect, knowledge, and the inclination towards piety-these attributes are established in the soul, not in bodily features.

474
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:12,782
The purer these mentioned attributes are, the more a person resembles God.

475
00:57:12,782 --> 00:57:17,645
The seventy-seventh heresy was proposed by the Ametrites, who believe there are countless worlds.

476
00:57:17,645 --> 00:57:24,713
Those unfamiliar with the philosophers might think this is a new idea, but some ancient philosophers among the pagans proposed this long ago.

477
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:29,976
However, we accept Moses as sent by God, and our understanding and beliefs about the world come from him.

478
00:57:29,976 --> 00:57:39,851
The seventy-eighth heresy was adopted by the Psychopneumones, who claim that the good souls of people transform into the spirits of angels, while the bad souls transform into the spirits of demons.

479
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:49,025
The seventy-ninth heresy is upheld by the Adecerditae, who assert that when Christ descended to the underworld, all the multitude of souls met him, believed in him, and were set free.

480
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:57,045
The eightieth heresy claims that the Son of God was born later, only because the Father willed it; if the Father had not willed it, he would not have been born.

481
00:57:57,045 --> 00:58:02,359
We must confess that the Son is equal to the Father; his equality is not a matter of nature, but of grace.

482
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:06,670
The Father willed this, and therefore everything is from the Father, not from the Son.

483
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:13,589
We, on the contrary, say: just as a spring gives rise to a river from itself, so the Father generates the Son from Himself.

484
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:25,298
Just as a spring does not generate a river by willing or not willing, but by its very nature; so the Father does not generate the Son by debating, willing, or not willing, but by the nature of His fullness, He pours out the Son.

485
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:37,111
And just as the river flows around the whole world and enters the sea, yet never departs from the spring's source: so the Son never departed from the Father's bosom, not even when He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death.

486
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:42,452
Thus, He appeared among us by assumption, but by His majesty, He never departed from the Father's bosom.

487
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:47,023
For in order for this to happen, neither the possibility nor the will was lacking in God.

488
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,464
If either of these were lacking in God, He could not be called God.

489
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:55,497
For one who does not will what is good is evil; one who cannot do what he wills is not omnipotent.

490
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:59,811
Condemning this blasphemy in the heretic we mentioned, let us proceed to the others.

491
00:58:59,811 --> 00:59:03,407
We accuse not the eighty-first heresy of Lucifer, but we argue schism.

492
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:16,657
Catholics indeed in every way, but by making people Luciferian and dividing themselves from the Church, charity excluded them from their faith: as the Apostle says: If I have faith so that I can move mountains, but do not have charity, it profits me nothing.

493
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:17,838
First Corinthians 13:2.

494
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:24,875
They boast of not deviating from the faith, but we argue that they incur no small crime in not wishing to have charity with God's Church.

495
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:30,267
The Jovinianists, named after a certain Jovinian, are detected to have taken up the eighty-second heresy.

496
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:40,744
Like the Stoic philosophers, they claim that all sins are equal: that a man cannot sin once he has received the washing of regeneration, and that fasting or abstaining from certain foods is of no benefit.

497
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,904
They destroy the virginity of holy Mary, saying she was violated by giving birth.

498
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:54,092
The virginity of nuns, the chastity of the continent, and the celibacy of men who choose a celibate life are equated to the merits of chaste and faithful marriage.

499
00:59:54,092 --> 01:00:01,573
Some sacred virgins, already advanced in age, in the city of Rome where these teachings were spread, are said to have married upon hearing this.

500
01:00:01,573 --> 01:00:05,002
Interestingly, Jovinian himself neither had a wife nor wanted one.

501
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:09,678
He believed this was not beneficial for future life but applied it to present convenience.

502
01:00:09,678 --> 01:00:15,965
In response, Saint Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, took action and published a book to counter all of Jovinian's arguments.

503
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:28,797
After it was read in mid-Rome, specifically in the Lateran Church, the Roman people and priests, with one voice, declared anathema on the Jovinianists and Jovinian himself, at the very beginning of Lent, with Saint Anastasius the bishop presiding.

504
01:00:28,797 --> 01:00:33,369
Ultimately, during Easter week, they were found feasting and indulging in pork banquets.

505
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:39,500
The people hung a roasted pig, which they found on their table, by its neck and paraded it throughout the entire city.

506
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,825
Jerome the priest also wrote several books against these people.

507
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:50,670
Those who read them thoroughly learn the great benefits of virginity, continence, and abstinence, and recoil at the great evils of gluttony and luxury.

508
01:00:50,670 --> 01:01:01,840
Eighty-three: Our historian Eusebius places the eighty-third heresy in the sixth book, which neither Epiphanius, Polycrates, Africanus, nor Hesiod, who wrote many volumes describing all heresies in Greek, mentioned.

509
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:09,322
In the sixth book, as I said, Eusebius narrates that there were heretics in Arabia, whose leader he does not name, so we can call them Arabians.

510
01:01:09,322 --> 01:01:14,569
They say that souls die and dissolve with bodies, and at the end of the world, both will be restored.

511
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:18,985
However, he notes that many of them were recalled by the great disputation of Origen.

512
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:24,544
Eighty-four: We recall that the eighty-fourth heresy was occupied by the Helvidians, named after Helvidius.

513
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:34,777
Those who dispute the holy virginity of Mary by claiming that she had other children with Joseph after the birth of Christ emerged recently, during the time of Siricius, the bishop of Rome.

514
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:37,392
They sent their followers throughout Italy and Gaul.

515
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:43,829
Jerome, an eminent scholar, wrote two books against them, which, when read at the time, were condemned with deserved abhorrence.

516
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:53,083
However, Epiphanius, an investigator of heretics, wrote a tract against those who were at that time proclaiming this blasphemous assertion, and he decided to call them Antidicomarites.

517
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:56,805
The Paternian heresy is recorded to have begun as the eighty-fifth heresy.

518
01:01:56,805 --> 01:02:07,014
These people believe that the lower parts of the human body were made not by God but by the devil and live very impure lives, granting themselves the freedom to commit all sorts of sins with those parts.

519
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:59,218
When Bishop Damasus condemned them after discovering their crimes, he wrote about them in his report to Emperor Valentinian the Elder, saying:
"We wish your piety to know that the Venustians, discovered in their most shameful crime, have been condemned by the apostolic see."
He also sent their confessions along with his report.
Subsequently, a special law was enacted against them, so that wherever they were found, they would be dealt with by the sword of justice.
The Tertullianists were long ago condemned by Pope Soter of Rome.
The reason we say they adopted the eighty-sixth heresy is this:
A certain Octaviana, coming from Africa, whose husband, named Hesperius, seemed to be very close to the general Arbogast, who also held considerable power with the tyrant Maximus, brought with her a deceitful and cunning demon, who could scarcely be countered by a hundred speaking humans.
This demon claimed to be a Tertullianist priest, and through a sacred writing, he earned the right to establish a congregation outside the city walls.

520
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:09,914
When he obtained this from the tyrant Maximus, he excluded the place of our saints, the two brothers Processus and Martinianus, claiming they were Phrygians and therefore followed this law, as Tertullian did.

521
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:14,162
In this way, through the occasion of the martyrs, he was deceiving the people of God.

522
01:03:14,162 --> 01:03:27,156
But when God granted victory to the devout Augustus Theodosius, and the followers of Maximus, from whose power the Tertullianist boasted, were punished, he immediately fled with the matron who had come, without any news of the living or the dead being renewed.

523
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:31,254
God restored the watch over His martyrs to the celebration of the Catholic Church.

524
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:34,302
Tertullian, however, was a citizen and presbyter of Carthage.

525
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:37,750
He published very eloquent and fervent works in defense of the truth.

526
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,899
He had a basilica in Carthage where people would gather to him.

527
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:43,747
This basilica remained until the time of Bishop Aurelius.

528
01:03:43,747 --> 01:03:50,294
When Augustine, the bishop of Hippo, reasonably debated with them, they were converted and brought their church to the holy Church.

529
01:03:50,294 --> 01:04:07,436
However, the Catholic authority reproaches Tertullian for saying that the soul is born from the soul, and for defending Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla against the Catholic faith, and against Apollonius, the bishop of the East, and against Soter, the pope of the city of Rome, as we mentioned earlier when we exposed the Cataphrygian heretics.

530
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:12,133
From whom he later separated, lest the people seem to exclude Tertullian's name from Montanus.

531
01:04:12,133 --> 01:04:18,330
He discarded all the vanity of Phrygia and propagated the Tertullianist gatherings, but he did not change anything in faith.

532
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:25,027
For he also condemned second marriages, as we mentioned, asserted that the soul comes from the soul, and called us Catholics psychics.

533
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:29,824
Wherever you read Tertullian against the psychics, know that he is acting against the Catholics.

534
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:37,121
In the eighty-seventh heresy, we name the Abelites, who, although they are earlier than almost all heretics, have now come to an end in our times.

535
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:41,918
They took their name from the son of Adam, that is, they wanted to be called Abelites from Abel.

536
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:46,816
They did not mix with wives, and yet it was not allowed for the sect itself to live without wives.

537
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:54,809
Therefore, a man and a woman, living together under the vow of continence, would adopt a boy and a girl as their future successors in the same bond.

538
01:04:54,809 --> 01:05:00,981
When each of them died, others were appointed in their place, ensuring that two of different sexes succeeded in that household.

539
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:05,599
If either parent died, the surviving one would take care of the children until their own death.

540
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,098
After that, the adopted children would similarly adopt a boy and a girl.

541
01:05:09,098 --> 01:05:15,368
They never lacked children to adopt, as their neighbors willingly gave their own children, hoping for an inheritance from others.

542
01:05:15,368 --> 01:05:22,318
This was the only difference between us and them: they criticized our marriages, saying that those who marry do so as if they were not married.

543
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:34,080
The apostolic seat under Pope Saint Innocent I declared that it had found the eighty-eighth heresy in Pelagius when Coelestius, a disciple of Pelagius, taught in Carthage that humans could be without sin by relying solely on their own nature.

544
01:05:34,080 --> 01:06:18,211
A deacon named Paulinus, a defender and advocate of the Church of Milan, opposed him by presenting many charges against the Catholic faith, which Coelestius refused to condemn, saying: "It does not concern me to address those accusations where my name is involved, and the crime is someone else's."
They then offered him their books, where he claimed that human nature alone could achieve perfection: that a person could exercise such justice that they could be without sin if they wanted. Adam was made mortal, and whether he sinned or not, he would have died. The law led to the kingdom, just as the Gospels did.
We confess that infants are baptized for the remission of sins because of the rule of the universal Church. Adam's sin did not harm humanity. All these points were used to condemn Coelestius. But he said there were many things in his beliefs, and he could not condemn them because of the rest.

545
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:25,228
Then, based on reports from nearly all the African bishops, Pope Innocent issued a condemnation against Pelagius and Coelestius.

546
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:41,972
However, whether before or after their condemnation by the universal Church, they continued to write that a person could be without sin, that Adam's sin did not harm the human race, that the law was given for the kingdom just like the Gospels, and that infants should not be baptized because they might have original sin.

547
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:46,979
They also claimed that nature was made so well by God that it alone is enough to be without sin.

548
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:52,196
In response to these writings, a certain writer named Constantius contended without using scripture.

549
01:06:52,196 --> 01:06:57,986
Following him, Augustine, the bishop of Hippo, and Jerome, the presbyter of Bethlehem, also wrote against them.

550
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:04,036
However, the Pelagians or Coelestians are mixed with the Catholic people because they do not have a separate church.

551
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:07,218
Therefore, wherever it happens, they do not refuse communion.

552
01:07:07,218 --> 01:07:11,600
They say it is of one confession in this part, in which the Eucharist is celebrated.

553
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,147
They argue that it is not about communion that we are distinguished.

554
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:21,928
Due to this boldness, they face dangers from our people if they are caught, and they are considered cursed by their own followers.

555
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:24,431
They also have their own presbyters and bishops.

556
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:52,442
Pelagius himself wrote in his commentary on Romans; while discussing the place where the Apostle says: Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned Romans 5:12
Addressing Coelestius, who was the first to write against the transmission of sin, he says with these words: Those who oppose the transmission try to argue this way: If Adam's sin harmed even those who did not sin, then Christ's grace should also benefit those who do not believe.

557
01:07:52,442 --> 01:08:03,344
They also add this: If baptism removes that original sin, then those born from two baptized parents should be free from this sin; for how can they pass on to their descendants what they themselves do not have?

558
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:06,473
These things, written by Pelagius himself, we have included.

559
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:15,510
Regarding the idea of a person being able to live without sin, the objection is this: Either a person can do it and doesn't need help, or they can't and do need help.

560
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:23,667
Anyone who seeks help admits they can't do what they want to do on their own; otherwise, it's ridiculous to ask for help with something they can do by themselves.

561
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:27,897
For example, if I wanted to lift ten pounds and asked for help, it would seem silly.

562
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:36,759
But if I wanted to lift two hundred pounds or more, because I can't do it alone, I would ask for help with great urgency, especially if my life depended on lifting that weight.

563
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:43,708
Similarly, if a child is born to two baptized parents, this reasoning teaches us that the child has nothing from the faith of the parents.

564
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:48,441
Those who are baptized have two births: one from the flesh and the other from the Holy Spirit.

565
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:56,598
From these two births, they pass on two generations to us: one from the flesh through marriage, and the other from the Spirit through the consecration of baptism.

566
01:08:56,598 --> 01:09:00,626
So, I ask you, this child born of baptized parents, from which birth is he born?

567
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:05,057
From the flesh, that is, the first birth, or from the Spirit, that is, the second birth?

568
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,827
If he is born of the Spirit, he should not be baptized.

569
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:08,028
Why?

570
01:09:08,028 --> 01:09:11,352
Because the Holy Spirit made him born, not the desire of marriage.

571
01:09:11,352 --> 01:09:19,710
But if he is born from a carnal union, that is from a man and a woman, then just as they were reborn in Christ and the Church, they must also rebirth their offspring.

572
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:28,673
For we are born from the first Adam: from the second Adam, we are reborn, as the holy Apostle said:
The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit.

573
01:09:28,673 --> 01:09:32,802
But it is not the spiritual that comes first, but the natural; then the spiritual.

574
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:36,981
The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is from heaven, heavenly.

575
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:45,088
Therefore, just as we have borne the image of the earthly, that is, just as we have created children in a carnal way, let us also bear the image of the heavenly.

576
01:09:45,088 --> 01:09:46,448
First Corinthians 15:45-49.

577
01:09:47,303 --> 01:09:50,726
Those whom we have created physically, let us recreate spiritually.

578
01:09:50,726 --> 01:09:56,550
Or we, who have been created physically by the Creator's will, let us again be spiritually recreated by His grace.

579
01:09:56,550 --> 01:10:30,368
The Apostle said this: "Flesh and blood," meaning people born only by natural means, cannot find the kingdom of God unless they have earned divine grace.
Nor will corruption inherit incorruption.
The eighty-ninth heresy is attributed to Nestorius, the bishop of Constantinople.
It was customary for the bishop of Alexandria to send one of his sermons to Constantinople to be read at Easter, and for the bishop of Constantinople to send one to Alexandria to be read there.
In his sermon, Nestorius of Constantinople wrote that Mary should not be called Theotokos (God-bearer) but Christotokos (Christ-bearer); that is, she did not give birth to God, but to a man.

580
01:10:30,368 --> 01:10:37,366
Cyril of Alexandria criticized this statement by writing a letter, suggesting that if Nestorius had made a mistake, he should correct it.

581
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:41,351
Because of this criticism from Cyril, Nestorius began to call Cyril a heretic.

582
01:10:41,351 --> 01:10:50,699
A synod was held at Ephesus; and even then, Nestorius did not want to correct his statement to say that Mary gave birth to both God and man, but insisted she gave birth only to a man.

583
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:55,552
He argued that if we say she gave birth to God, we make her the mother of God, like the pagans.

584
01:10:55,552 --> 01:11:00,252
So, Mary, he said, gave birth to a temple for God, not God Himself who dwells in the temple.

585
01:11:00,252 --> 01:11:08,170
He was given a chance to either condemn his statement and return to his position as bishop, or if he refused to condemn it, he would not be able to return.

586
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,571
He refused and remained in the same confession.

587
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:12,359
The synod at Ephesus condemned him.

588
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:18,234
In this condemnation, Pope Celestine of Rome wrote, and all the bishops, both Eastern and Western, signed with him.

589
01:11:18,234 --> 01:11:25,436
The ninetieth heresy, which we mentioned in our preface as falsely attributed to the name of Bishop Augustine, is called the Predestinarians.

590
01:11:25,436 --> 01:11:32,435
They define the election of the good and the rejection of the bad as being decided by God, not by a person either striving or neglecting.

591
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:37,492
They do not want God's laws to be either kept by those who strive or violated by those who neglect.

592
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:42,413
They say that someone destined to do evil cannot achieve goodness, even if they try.

593
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:47,620
On the other hand, someone destined to do good will be led to it involuntarily, even if they neglect it.

594
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,724
They claim that the water of baptism doesn't cleanse all sins.

595
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:58,735
They believe that grace comes before free will, so a person receives it before asking, finds it before seeking, and has the door opened to them before knocking.

596
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:07,146
They say no one comes to faith in Christ unless drawn by the Father, referencing the passage: "No one comes to me unless the Father who sent me draws them" (John 6:44).

597
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:17,710
They argue that everything happens not in reality but in hope, applying the Apostle's words: "Hope that is seen is not hope" (Romans 8:24) to mysteries, suggesting that things perceived seem to exist but do not.

598
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,864
They say Adam harmed the human race more than Christ helped it.

599
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:27,273
They claim that Adam's harm remains in such a way that neither Christ's passion nor the sanctification of baptism can remove it.

600
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:29,626
But why should we delay, holy and eager reader?

601
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:38,037
We present to you their book in its entirety, as it was published, so that by reading it, you will recognize its definitions as inventions of the Antichrist's plotters.

602
01:12:38,037 --> 01:12:41,592
Whenever we opposed them, they accused us of using heretical arguments.

603
01:12:41,592 --> 01:12:50,153
Feeling so defeated that they couldn't even sigh, they always cast this slander on our Catholic efforts, fearing to be branded as heretics and stifling the voice of truth.

604
01:12:50,153 --> 01:12:57,263
Therefore, for their sake, we have exposed all heresies from Simon up to now, to prove that we alone are in agreement with the Catholic faith.

605
01:12:57,263 --> 01:13:08,628
We pray to you, Lord, Father of heaven and earth, who with Your Son and the Holy Spirit hold the majesty of one truth, the majesty of one divinity, the trinity of one divinity, to help us against your enemies who wield weapons.

606
01:13:08,628 --> 01:13:12,283
Let them have the camps of Goliath set up in the line of the Philistines.

607
01:13:12,983 --> 01:13:24,143
We Hebrews, your children taking up David's sling, will fight from your cornerstone so that we may confidently say with your Apostle:
Thanks be to our God, who gave us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

608
01:13:24,143 --> 01:13:25,444
First Corinthians 13:17.

609
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:35,195
Let there be peace for all Catholics, and with the angels, let them cry out with one voice with us,
singing, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.

610
01:13:35,303 --> 01:13:44,327
Book Two, Forged Under the Name of Augustine, containing the ninetieth heresy, which asserts that sins are committed by God's predestination.

611
01:13:44,327 --> 01:13:48,281
Spiritual brothers suggested that I share in your intention to defend the truth.

612
01:13:48,281 --> 01:13:51,789
Therefore, I briefly joined your efforts, avoiding a lengthy discourse.

613
01:13:51,789 --> 01:14:02,908
I condensed the thoughts that seek a broad field of contention into a narrow scope to spare you the tedium of reading and to provide an opportunity to defend the truth and refute those fighting against the will of their Lord.

614
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:11,112
Specifically, those who say that human wills are moved against the will and desire of God, and that the power of the immortal God is thwarted by the power of mortals.

615
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:16,350
They add that people become holy through their own will and reach friendship with God by their own choice.

616
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:26,381
You will see these individuals easily falling, from whom human concern has taken the better and primary parts, and who say that a person can save themselves not by God's ordinance, but by their own will.

617
01:14:26,381 --> 01:14:34,041
But you, O children of love, retaining the zeal of faith marked in your hearts, be assured of the ordinance of God, which He established by predestination.

618
01:14:34,041 --> 01:15:11,203
Let the sentence spoken by the apostolic voice be certain to our minds: "For He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills." For it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy. As it is written in the book of Romans chapter nine, verses nineteen and sixteen: "For He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills."
Because the potter has power over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for honor, and another for dishonor, as stated in Romans chapter nine, verse twenty-one. Hence, it is that the flesh opposes the spirit, and the spirit opposes the flesh. The Apostle says, "These are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want" (Galatians chapter five, verse seventeen).

619
01:15:11,203 --> 01:15:17,083
For in His work, God foresaw all people beforehand, and by foreseeing what would be fitting for each, He determined it.

620
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:20,493
This is a unique indication of His majesty, in which He has no equal.

621
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:23,705
For God alone foreknows what should be thought, spoken, and done.

622
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:30,080
Since He foresaw the deeds of all generally before they were done, He arranged their merits as if they were already accomplished.

623
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:36,042
And so, God predestined and determined things as if they were visible and clear to Him when He foresaw them.

624
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:42,062
He decided who would become like the image of His Son so that the Son of God would be the firstborn among many brothers.

625
01:15:42,062 --> 01:15:47,129
Those He predestined, He called; those He called, He justified; and those He justified, He glorified.

626
01:15:47,129 --> 01:17:12,665
Therefore, the prophet says, "It is not in man to direct his steps."
What do you think, you fragile, mortal, and miserable humans? Do you think you should be praised if you do good, or completely condemned if you sin?
The law speaks to instill fear; otherwise, nothing happens except what God wills. Whoever God wills to be holy is holy; nothing else will be. Whoever He foresees to be wicked will be wicked; nothing else will be.
For God's predestination has already set the number of the righteous and the number of sinners, and the determined limit cannot be exceeded.
However, this is not established as a respecter of persons but as one who knows all future events.
God fixed and established His predestination not by favoritism but by foreknowledge. Those He foreknew would not turn back in any way, He predestined to death; those He foreknew would turn back in every way, He predestined to life.
I am amazed that testimonies from the Old Testament are presented against the authority of the New Testament.
They usually misuse the testimonies of the holy prophet Ezekiel, who says, "This is what the Lord says: When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and they turn from their wickedness, as I live, says the Lord, they shall live."
This, as I said, was written in the old law for the time of captivity, for the reason that captivity happened, and for the people to whom it was inflicted, so that those in captivity would learn that they were subjected to the yoke of the Assyrian king because of their sins.
Certainly, captivity happened because of sin. And why did the righteous suffer captivity along with sinners, if not because the mysteries of God cannot be fully known by our frailty?

627
01:17:12,815 --> 01:17:14,911
This mystery is written in the old law.

628
01:17:14,911 --> 01:17:20,285
But in the new law, the Apostle exclaims:
"Vessels of wrath prepared for destruction" (Romans 9:22).

629
01:17:20,285 --> 01:17:26,142
It is written, recalling what God said in his foreknowledge:
"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated" (Romans 9:13).

630
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:33,826
Before they were born or had done anything good or bad (Romans 9:11), it was said in foreknowledge that one would be hated and the other loved.

631
01:17:33,826 --> 01:17:39,092
These things were not invented by us, nor do we say anything other than what the Apostle preached.

632
01:17:39,092 --> 01:17:43,122
He himself recalls that predestination is done through God's foreknowledge.

633
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:46,830
He says of God:
"Those he called, he also predestined" (Romans 8:30).

634
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:59,726
If you read in the Apostle about foreknowing, predestining, and calling, why do you accuse us of a crime for saying that God predestined people either to righteousness or to sin, lest it appear that he makes people do what he does not want?

635
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:03,649
For God remains undefeated in his will, while man is constantly overcome.

636
01:18:03,649 --> 01:18:10,795
So if you confess that God is undefeated, confess also this: whatever he wanted those he created to be, they cannot be anything else.

637
01:18:10,795 --> 01:18:24,766
Hence, we conclude that those whom God once predestined to life, even if they neglect, even if they sin, even if they are unwilling, will be led to life against their will: but those he predestined to death, even if they run, even if they hurry, labor in vain.

638
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:28,098
And do not admit this without the teaching of a clear example.

639
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:36,534
Judas heard the word of life every day, adhered to the Lord every day, engaged in virtues every day, and heard the Son of God himself as a teacher every day.

640
01:18:36,534 --> 01:18:40,618
But because he was predestined to death, he perished suddenly with one blow.

641
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:45,938
Saul was a persecutor every day, a stoner of Christians every day, a ravager of churches every day.

642
01:18:45,938 --> 01:18:51,096
Yet because he was predestined to life, he was suddenly made a vessel of election with one blow.

643
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:53,246
So why do you, who remain in sins, fear?

644
01:18:53,246 --> 01:18:55,449
If God has honored you, you will be holy.

645
01:18:55,449 --> 01:19:00,016
Or why do you, who live in holiness, become anxious as if your anxiety preserves you?

646
01:19:00,016 --> 01:19:02,435
If God does not want it, you will never fall.

647
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:04,335
Be secure in God.

648
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:17,743
You, who are holy and anxious not to fall, who attend to prayers day and night, engage in fasting, are diligently devoted to divine readings, occupied with exhortations, and daily immersed in all holy studies-do you think you will be saved by this dedication?

649
01:19:17,743 --> 01:19:30,632
Will you be holier than Judas, who received the power to heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead, and tread on serpents and scorpions, a fellow apostle and disciple of Christ; and yet, because he was predestined to death, found eternal death?

650
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,547
Cease worrying about yourself, O man.

651
01:19:32,547 --> 01:19:37,206
Cease, I say, to be anxious about your virtue, and trust securely only in the will of God.

652
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:43,470
You will obtain nothing good from God against His will; but if God deems you worthy to remain in good, you will be saved.

653
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:47,404
You too, who are shaken by vain despair in sin, learn from the Apostle Paul.

654
01:19:47,404 --> 01:19:49,837
Who could ever be found equal to him in crimes?

655
01:19:49,837 --> 01:19:52,321
Could you have committed worse sins than he did?

656
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:59,879
And yet, because he was predestined to the apostleship, he suddenly escaped all crimes and ascended from the lowest depths to the highest heights.

657
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:09,300
Therefore, all whom God knows to be worthy of the salvation of His redemption, He has predestined to salvation: and He saves only those whom He knows He has predestined to salvation.

658
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:14,270
For the salvation of God does not serve the will of man; for He knows to whom He will give what.

659
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:20,274
Nor does the freedom of human will precede the grace of God, but the grace of God precedes the will of human choice.

660
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:24,519
For the will of man is vain and fruitless, and the judgment of human will is vain.

661
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:32,284
He errs who thinks he can reach Christ by his own will for good, when Christ Himself says: No one comes to me unless the Father draws him (John 6:44).

662
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:39,324
You who understand better from Christ, tell me if Christ lied: and then assert that we have set this opinion against the rule of Christ.

663
01:20:39,324 --> 01:20:45,587
For if Christ spoke the truth, it is not a lie that we say the predestined are drawn to life, because He Himself is life.

664
01:20:46,415 --> 01:21:02,786
If the force of the Gospel testimony weighs on you, and you come against our judgment, and you cannot give us an answer, being burdened by the weight of our judgment, at least explain to us the Apostles' definition, which says:
"It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Romans 9:16).

665
01:21:02,786 --> 01:21:07,390
Therefore, no matter how much human will exerts its strength to build, it strives in vain.

666
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:22,225
Or why does human frailty think its vigilance will be helpful to eternal desires when the prophet clearly exclaims with evidence, saying:
"Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchmen stay awake in vain" (Psalms 127:1-2).

667
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:31,945
What is the point of someone hoping to work towards building against divine teachings and their own conscience, when these sacred writings teach that human building is uncertain and in vain?

668
01:21:31,945 --> 01:22:12,358
But if you come against us, you do not come against us but against Him who said:
"Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchmen stay awake in vain."
Do you not know that it was not useful to the people of God who had these things written and directed to future generations until the end of time?
Therefore, you who criticize these things, remove them from the book of Psalms, because, as you say, those reading and singing these verses cannot be built up.
But what do these people think they can achieve by their own will, when even the chosen vessel did not claim to have fulfilled his own will?
For the Apostle says about himself:
"For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do" (Romans 7:19).

669
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:19,060
So if the Apostle cannot accomplish the good he wants, how do these people say they can reach the fruit of grace by their own will?

670
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,231
These are the words of the Apostle, we add nothing of our own.

671
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:31,081
He says about himself:
"For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do."
And you blame us because we say,
"None are called except the predestined?"

672
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:33,839
For the grace of God precedes the will of man.

673
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:39,367
God is first in the goodness of man; however, even the best of men are rarely the last in all good things.

674
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,131
Give the first place to God to eliminate human pride.

675
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:51,258
But if you want to nurture pride in people, it appears you seek the ruin of the human race, because you teach that in doing good, it is not God who goes first, but human will.

676
01:22:51,258 --> 01:23:02,524
This makes it seem as if people are the ones reminding God to do good, as if He would not do good unless they told Him to, even though it is clear that God grants good to everyone without anyone suggesting or asking.

677
01:23:02,524 --> 01:24:20,547
For the Apostle does not say "when we asked"; instead, he says, "when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son" Romans 5:10. So where is the will of man? It is excluded. Why? Because not everyone who wants is saved; if everyone who wanted to be saved was saved, no one could be excluded from salvation.
For every person wants to be saved, but not every person is saved; rather, the one whom God wills is saved. Indeed, I say, the one whom God wills, so that the will of man is excluded and His complete grace is fully revealed.
But if God wants someone to be good and they are not good, then man would be defeating God. For man would indeed defeat God if God wanted him to be good and he was not. Therefore, the will and effect of God is in the goodness of man. For it was not when we asked or when we requested, but "when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son."
And when you read that His Son died for all, I wonder how you understand "all" to mean everyone, when you scarcely see a few attain salvation. Wherever you read "all," you want to understand it generally as everyone, although often "all" is taught to mean a part.
For when it says, "All have turned away" Psalms 14:3, not all have turned away, and "every man is a liar" Psalms 116:11, not every man is a liar, because we read of someone: "There was a truthful man." And also, "Lying men will not be remembered by Him; but truthful men will be found in it" Sirach 15:8.

678
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:26,677
Therefore, the largest part seems to signify everyone, even though it is clear that not everyone should be understood.

679
01:24:26,677 --> 01:24:30,506
And I am surprised that with your eyes closed, you pass by the enemy's traps.

680
01:24:30,506 --> 01:24:40,703
You say that a person's will can achieve something of virtue, not noticing how many falls from chastity are caused by the devil, and how many crimes of lust, greed, envy, and treachery are committed daily.

681
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:46,174
If you could see these things, we would not have to show you the damage to virtues and the victories of vices.

682
01:24:46,174 --> 01:24:49,556
If the freedom of choice were intact, these things would not happen.

683
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:53,883
Through the transgression of the first man, the freedom of choice perished from humans.

684
01:24:53,883 --> 01:24:59,753
But you renew the Pelagian heresy again when you say that people can put an end to sins through the freedom of choice.

685
01:24:59,753 --> 01:25:02,339
For you exclude grace through the freedom of choice.

686
01:25:02,339 --> 01:25:05,522
We are either freed by free will or rescued by the grace of God.

687
01:25:05,522 --> 01:25:06,517
Choose what you say.

688
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:11,541
If you give everything to grace, we think alike; if to free will, know that we cannot agree with you.

689
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:18,653
From where comes that greater freedom of choice in one for good, and the lesser in another, except that it is determined by God's dispensation?

690
01:25:18,653 --> 01:25:27,308
For in one person, grace shows itself as slight, in another as abundant and generous, as grace itself wills, not as we will, who have departed from the order of our creation.

691
01:25:27,308 --> 01:25:41,085
We recognize to such an extent that human nature is corrupted through Adam's transgression, that its restoration through Christ has been achieved not in reality but in hope, as the Apostle says:
"For in hope we have been saved; but hope that is seen is not hope"
(Romans 8:24).

692
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:45,711
Therefore, if we are saved in hope, we have not yet received the reality in this present age.

693
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:54,067
Thus, even those who are baptized still desire carnally and suffer the movements of the body; because they have received the aid of restoration in hope, not in reality.

694
01:25:54,067 --> 01:26:00,384
For if they had received it in reality, after the grace of baptism, there would be neither the possibility nor the will to sin.

695
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:09,834
But because the power of baptism is so great that it erases all sins, the tendency of sins is not washed away by the water of baptism; for it is taught that it naturally exists through Adam.

696
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:18,513
For those parts of the body that have no shame at the moment of baptism later receive shame, causing them to avoid being seen and seek modest concealment.

697
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:24,057
The parts that God created were turned into shameful parts by disobedience and are now called shameful parts.

698
01:26:24,057 --> 01:26:31,941
These shameful parts become parts again at the moment of baptism but soon turn back into shameful parts; for they are renewed not in actuality but in hope.

699
01:26:31,941 --> 01:26:40,232
The desire of the flesh, which rules the body like a law of sin through Adam's disobedience, reclaims the baptized person and tries to overthrow their entire soul.

700
01:26:40,232 --> 01:26:42,826
This is the root of that wound which Christ healed.

701
01:26:42,826 --> 01:26:47,251
He healed it in the way the Apostle says: For in this hope we were saved (Romans 8:24).

702
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:53,151
He commands us to shift our mind to contemplate the unseen and not to fall by presuming on the things that are seen.

703
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:56,406
Therefore, he says: Hope that is seen is not hope (Romans 8:24).

704
01:26:56,406 --> 01:27:02,510
Lest it be thought that sins are so completely removed through baptism that even the roots of sins are equally uprooted.

705
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:12,225
That movement of pollution, which invaded nature through disobedience, remains in the baptized person like the root of a hair, even when the surface has been cleansed and shaved with a razor.

706
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:18,380
For it has been shaved so that the place may be cleansed: it has not been eradicated, so that it may no longer grow back.

707
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:30,791
If all the frailty of Adam's disobedience were completely removed through baptism, all the baptized would be drawn to no crimes by the heat of passion, no one would be polluted by human filth, and no one would be pricked by the sting of desire.

708
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:35,063
But because we are saved in hope, what we do not yet see, we wait for with patience.

709
01:27:35,063 --> 01:27:40,913
The time will come when they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in heaven (Matthew 22:30).

710
01:27:40,913 --> 01:27:50,017
For when this perishable body puts on the imperishable, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: Death is swallowed up in victory.

711
01:27:50,017 --> 01:27:51,645
Where, O death, is your victory?

712
01:27:51,645 --> 01:27:53,171
Where, O death, is your sting?

713
01:27:53,171 --> 01:27:57,647
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law (First Corinthians 15:54-56).

714
01:27:58,512 --> 01:28:02,664
Then we will say: Thank God who gave us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

715
01:28:02,664 --> 01:28:04,776
Prologue of the following book

716
01:28:04,776 --> 01:28:08,965
The book, which stands against humanity and opposes the Catholic faith, is now complete.

717
01:28:08,965 --> 01:28:12,250
It is a deceitful book, filled with lies, and distorts pure doctrine.

718
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,345
As Saint Cyprian says, it presents falsehoods to steal the truth.

719
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:20,201
Although it is published under the guise of piety, it acts against all the institutions of the saints.

720
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:29,438
Because of this book, as we mentioned in the preface, we have compiled the sects of all heretics into one volume so that its defenders know we oppose all heresies and do not support any of them.

721
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:41,626
Therefore, O holy mother Church, mother of pure faith, against your hidden enemies, against new barbarians who pretend to be peaceful, against those who take up arms against you in your name, lift up our strength and help those willing to enter the battle.

722
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:55,291
Especially against those whom no one has yet challenged in writing, while they have almost wounded the whole world with their writings under the name of the priest Augustine, producing corrupted books and various letters which they falsely claim to be from the mentioned bishop of Hippo.

723
01:28:55,291 --> 01:29:01,671
And to all defenders of the Catholic faith, we earnestly pray that you set aside all distractions and attentively consider our battle.

724
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:06,670
Keeping the future judgment in mind, defend what should be defended and condemn what should be condemned.

725
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:14,335
The reason we have brought this book to the forefront, leaving other wrongdoings aside, is because they pass it down to those they deceive as if it were a creed.

726
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:26,523
Therefore, we believed it necessary to write this entire book in order, so it does not seem that the easily refutable parts were taken from their book, while the cleverly omitted parts, which could have defended the book from our accusation, were left out.

727
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:33,165
We have therefore omitted nothing: revealing all his body in these writings, we brandish the sword of God's word against him.

728
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:41,353
Cutting him into pieces, we expose each of his limbs to the eyes of Catholics: showing the poison in his head, the twists in his mouth, and the arrows from his chest.

729
01:29:41,353 --> 01:29:44,954
By examining the function of each limb, we expose his cunning opposition.

730
01:29:44,954 --> 01:29:51,316
Laying him captive at the feet of the Catholic Church, we make him manifest to all:
So that he himself becomes his own condemner.

731
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:56,298
By abandoning Catholic doctrine, he wished to defile his own consent with the contagion of this book.

732
01:29:56,496 --> 01:30:02,688
Book Three
Containing the refutation of the previous book falsely attributed to Saint Augustine

733
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:08,611
So far, the forests of all heretics have been set ablaze, where deceitful treachery has plundered the riches of faith.

734
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:12,124
The Church has suffered plunder, and the blood of souls has been shed.

735
01:30:12,124 --> 01:30:20,808
But since thorns often sprout again after a fire, let us hold the sickle of divine judgment, so we can cut off the heads of the thorns that rise again and go against heaven.

736
01:30:20,808 --> 01:30:34,411
There will be no lack of workers for this field, with God's provision, so that the blessed and blameless on the path, blameless in faith, who walk in the law of the Lord (Psalm one hundred nineteen, verse one), can reach their destination without the hindrance of thorns.

737
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:43,546
The Predestinarians made the ninetieth heresy, showing false books that they falsely attribute to Augustine, whose statements in many places are read in these books as very contrary.

738
01:30:43,546 --> 01:30:58,454
Therefore, Catholics are given a true suspicion that such wicked statements cannot be those of an orthodox man, who, submitting to the Mathematicians, say that the human race is so subject to divine predestination that all the evils that happen in the world are said to be committed by God's will.

739
01:30:58,454 --> 01:31:09,949
Therefore, human fear or shame should not make us share in their errors; we have taken care of all heretics and found that no one could err worse than those who say that all evils and crimes are committed by God's predestination.

740
01:31:09,949 --> 01:31:18,181
Let all heretics have one book, in which we condemn them not by power but by true reasoning, so that the Predestinarians know that we do not consent to any heretic.

741
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:28,822
Let the Predestinarians also have one book, in which God himself proves against them, who knows that he has predestined no one to evil but has predestined all to good, so that we may approve what is good, as his.

742
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:37,908
For all the good things that people do now, or have done from the beginning, or will do, we say are completed by God's grace, God's mercy, God's help, and even God's predestination.

743
01:31:37,908 --> 01:31:49,754
But by predestination, we mean not that God forces good upon the unwilling, but that he never changes his intention of goodness and is always ready for those who willingly choose good, but unprepared for those who willingly choose evil.

744
01:31:50,256 --> 01:32:04,892
If those approaching goodness receive immediate rewards for their faith, such as forgiveness of sins and becoming children of God, while those heading towards evil do not immediately face the punishment they deserve, instead receiving generous periods of grace from His patience.

745
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:04,944
.

746
01:32:04,944 --> 01:32:04,997
.

747
01:32:04,997 --> 01:32:08,197
We confess and affirm this predestined and fixed plan of God.

748
01:32:08,197 --> 01:32:14,597
Therefore, when evil occurs, it is not because God has forsaken His plan, but because man has introduced his own contempt.

749
01:32:14,597 --> 01:32:18,112
Sin is never committed by God's will, but through man's negligence.

750
01:32:18,112 --> 01:32:25,036
Mankind sins against God's will to such an extent that He is always angered by those who practice sin and aids those who act justly.

751
01:32:25,036 --> 01:32:33,378
Indeed, when the whole world had turned away from righteousness and deserved to perish in the flood, it is shown that God wished to save it through His rebuke.

752
01:32:33,378 --> 01:32:35,056
What does the apostle Peter say?

753
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:38,833
God's patience waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.

754
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:39,725
First Peter 3:20.

755
01:32:39,725 --> 01:32:42,086
Tell us, what was God's patience waiting for?

756
01:32:42,086 --> 01:32:45,443
Was it for predestined destruction or for a provoked conversion?

757
01:32:45,443 --> 01:32:48,696
The construction of the ark served as a preacher of the flood.

758
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:55,411
The axe cried out, the hammer resounded, the saw testified, and even the tools themselves preached the flood to the unbelievers.

759
01:32:55,411 --> 01:33:06,270
Given a period of 100 years, the law preceded, stating that those destined to perish could escape by repenting: predestination did not hinder this, as it did not deny that correction could lead to salvation.

760
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:11,673
If predestination set a fixed limit, the law would be unjust, as it seeks to invade others' boundaries.

761
01:33:11,673 --> 01:33:17,811
Therefore, to establish predestination, refute the commandments: reject the law to bring the reign of predestination.

762
01:33:17,811 --> 01:33:21,431
The law has always wanted to command everyone and never serve anyone.

763
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:28,461
So if predestination nullifies the law's authority, and the law disrupts the rights of predestination, one of the two carries tyranny.

764
01:33:28,461 --> 01:33:31,503
Choose now, Catholics, to whom we should submit our necks.

765
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:37,345
If we consider the law, we must acknowledge that predestination removes the authority of the law.

766
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:46,584
The law says: Keep my commandments, and you will live; but predestination says: The vessels of wrath are already prepared for destruction, and the vessels of mercy are called to life.

767
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:49,462
Both of these are written: What should we do now, choose.

768
01:33:49,462 --> 01:33:59,761
If the vessels of wrath are already prepared by God to sin, and the vessels of mercy are prepared for life, then we should all submit to the rule of predestination and set aside the law and its preachers.

769
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:04,810
And don't think this is a new sin; this has happened from the beginning with every group of sinners.

770
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,788
Why were the prophets, apostles, and all the saints killed?

771
01:34:07,788 --> 01:34:11,878
Because they brought God's law to human minds and accused sinners of their vices.

772
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:19,198
If they had wanted to introduce the kingdom of predestination with flattering words, excluding the law of justice, no one would have been killed.

773
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,237
For they said, as it is written: Do not prophesy to us hard things Isaiah 30:10.

774
01:34:23,237 --> 01:34:25,913
What does it mean, do not prophesy to us hard things?

775
01:34:25,913 --> 01:34:30,053
It undoubtedly means: do not preach punishments to us through the threatening law.

776
01:34:30,053 --> 01:34:41,311
To this they responded: If the monitors of our time had listened to them, they would have served them with flattering words in these matters, and, as you do, deceived them by wrongly interpreting the testimonies of the law.

777
01:34:41,311 --> 01:34:44,543
Rest assured in the order of God, established by predestination.

778
01:34:44,543 --> 01:34:47,420
God has mercy on whom he wants and hardens whom he wants.

779
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:51,257
It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.

780
01:34:51,257 --> 01:34:56,054
The potter has the power to make from the same lump one vessel for honor, another for dishonor.

781
01:34:56,054 --> 01:34:59,234
The flesh opposes the spirit, and the spirit opposes the flesh.

782
01:34:59,234 --> 01:35:02,516
These are contrary to each other, so you do not do what you want.

783
01:35:02,516 --> 01:35:10,190
God has already predestined those he foreknew; and those he predestined, he called; those he called, he justified; and those he justified, he glorified.

784
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:11,553
A man's way is not his own.

785
01:35:11,553 --> 01:35:16,198
Do you think you should be praised for the good you do, when the law speaks to instill fear?

786
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:22,688
Ultimately, nothing happens unless God wills it: whoever He wants to be holy is holy; there is no other outcome.

787
01:35:22,688 --> 01:35:25,967
Whoever He foresees as wicked is wicked; there is no other outcome.

788
01:35:25,967 --> 01:35:34,090
For God's predestination has already determined the number of the righteous and the number of sinners, and it is inevitable that the set boundary cannot be surpassed.

789
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:41,186
If they had said these things you mention, they would have escaped human anger for a time, but they would have found eternal punishment from God.

790
01:35:41,186 --> 01:37:04,964
So they did not say this, but they said:
"This is what the Lord says: If you are willing and listen to me, you will eat the good things of the land; but if you refuse and do not listen to me, the sword will devour you. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken this" Isaiah 1:19-21.
And again: "This is what the Lord says: Because you have turned away from me, I will also turn away from you and deliver you to the Assyrians for plundering. Your children will be killed by the sword before your eyes, and your wives will be taken away, because you have despised my law and chosen what I did not want."
And again: "This is what the Lord says: Have I become a disgrace to the house of Israel because they have abandoned me and considered my commands and laws as nothing?"
And again: "Because I have called and you have refused, I too will laugh at your disaster and rejoice when sudden calamity comes upon you" Proverbs 1:26.
Saying these and similar things, they were killed with various punishments.
Therefore, the Lord also cries out to the people of the city where the prophets were killed, both in the prophets and in His Gospels, saying:
"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing" Matthew 23:37.
You were not willing, He says, for what I wanted; you wanted what I did not. So if God did not want what they wanted, either He was forced by someone more powerful to set the predestination, or if He set it Himself, He acted unjustly. For why would He say to a person: "I wanted this, but you did not," if He knew He had predestined them not to want it?

791
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:11,925
According to your view, man's guilt is dismissed, and the blame is shifted to God: the sinner is innocent, and the punisher is unjust.

792
01:37:11,925 --> 01:37:18,993
It's more appropriate to feel sorrow for the sinner rather than anger,
because he was driven by divine predestination when he fell into sin.

793
01:37:18,993 --> 01:37:23,285
This is what the Creator willed; the one who created is the same one who predestined.

794
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:27,324
If this is true, it's clear that the fault doesn't lie entirely with the sinner.

795
01:37:27,324 --> 01:37:35,200
So, if he doesn't fully own the fault when he sins, and if everything the just God condemns is foreign to Him, it is found to be His work, and thus His sin.

796
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:43,985
It doesn't make sense to say that one person predestines while another is called the transgressor; nor is it fair to suggest that God's predestination causes another's crime.

797
01:37:43,985 --> 01:37:54,133
To punish the sinner, show the predestinator; reveal the author of predestination so you can identify the judge of sin, because you can't claim the same one is both the predestinator and the condemner.

798
01:37:54,133 --> 01:38:05,947
If God is the author of predestination and the establisher of our actions, show another who punishes predestined sins; or if He, as a just being, condemns the unjust deeds of human actions, show another who predestined this injustice.

799
01:38:05,947 --> 01:38:09,834
Someone who disapproves of a deed could never have established it to be done.

800
01:38:09,834 --> 01:38:14,126
It's foolish to believe that the same predestinator is also the condemner of actions.

801
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:20,083
No one is so impious as to despise something preordained by themselves and then punish the very deed they preordained.

802
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:26,849
Unless perhaps, by changing his mind for the better, he decides that what he previously did is condemnable, driven by better judgment.

803
01:38:26,849 --> 01:38:32,907
But if He stands firm in omnipotence, knowing no equal or superior, tell us why He would condemn His own predestination?

804
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:38,511
Because if the actions of the predestined are guilty, then the order of the predestinator must be even more so.

805
01:38:39,168 --> 01:38:45,002
If someone is guilty because of predestination itself, how much more is the one whose predestination leads to guilt?

806
01:38:45,002 --> 01:38:54,508
Be careful, I beg you, not to let these false teachings corrupt the pure doctrine of the Church: sin is not directed by the one who predestines but is committed by the one who transgresses.

807
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:56,671
So, let the empty arguments of words cease.

808
01:38:56,671 --> 01:39:06,781
The transgression of the sinner and the predestination of the avenger have nothing in common: because sin is in the will of the transgressor, but predestination is ordered by the power of the redeemer.

809
01:39:06,781 --> 01:39:11,459
The Creator did not predestine anything other than that man could live according to His will.

810
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:20,915
It is blasphemous and extremely wrong to believe that human presumption comes from God's predestination, and that the vice of the sinner is judged by the preordination of the future judge.

811
01:39:20,915 --> 01:40:12,370
They say: "God established His predestination through foreknowledge. For those He knew would not convert, He predestined to death; and those He knew would convert, He predestined to life."
Let's see if you are not twisting God's judgment to the detriment of justice with these unjust arguments.
So, men are not yet created, and already they suffer from a just God's prejudice?
It seems you have invented another God for yourselves, one so unjust that He surrounds the human race with bias, determines the fate of an unborn man by marking him, binds him to sin through predestination, and prepares eternal punishments for one not yet conceived; He prepares perpetual darkness for one to whom He has not yet given the transient gifts of this fleeting life.
Seek another God for yourselves, as I said, if you believe these things.
For you will never provoke our merciful and compassionate God to act this way, even with your blasphemies.
For He who tolerates you patiently, I do not know whom He would not forgive for sinning.

812
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,836
Every day, He helps us even when we act unjustly, and He continually grants us new gifts of forgiveness for our new sins.

813
01:40:18,836 --> 01:40:24,899
Yet you say: Before the world's creation, He was already angry with us for future sins and destined us to condemnation.

814
01:40:24,899 --> 01:40:35,546
In the present, He grants pardon to those who blaspheme, but you say: At that time, He was already angry with those who would sin and predestined them to death when He first formed the foundations of humanity.

815
01:40:35,546 --> 01:40:43,545
So, did He already judge the world back then, before He even created the world itself, so that after the end of the age, He would find no one left to punish?

816
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:50,728
Perhaps He wanted to avoid the effort of judging people after they were made, by predestining them to death before they were created to live.

817
01:40:50,728 --> 01:41:00,306
And yet, if He created those He predestined to punishment, He anticipated the act of killing; and someone who has not even begun to live has already received the sentence of eternal death.

818
01:41:00,306 --> 01:41:05,452
Our God never did this: if there is some other god of yours, then attribute these blasphemies to him.

819
01:41:05,452 --> 01:41:33,268
About our God, the prophet says:
"As I live, declares the Lord, if I say to the sinner: 'You will die,' and the sinner turns from his evil way and from his wicked pursuits, as I live, declares the Lord, he will live and not die in the sin he committed. And if I say to the righteous: 'You will live,' and he then turns from his righteousness, as I live, declares the Lord, he will die: his righteousness will not save him on the day he turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity; he will die in his iniquity" (Ezekiel 33:13 and following).

820
01:41:33,268 --> 01:41:39,738
You see, our God warns both the righteous, so they do not fall from security, and the sinner, so they do not remain in despair.

821
01:41:39,738 --> 01:41:57,213
If anywhere you have read about God saying: "As I live, declares the Lord, those I have predestined to life will be nothing else, and those I have predestined to death will undoubtedly die," who would tolerate you teaching such things?
Behold, God speaks against your judgment, and you do not believe God Himself as He testifies about Himself.

822
01:41:57,672 --> 01:42:05,322
The righteous should not feel secure, he says, if I tell him: You will live, because if he turns away from righteousness, he will die in iniquity.

823
01:42:05,322 --> 01:42:12,659
And when I have told the sinner: You will die, and he has repented, I live, says the Lord, I will not remember his iniquities, he will live.

824
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:16,799
For I do not desire the death of the dying, but only that he may turn and live.

825
01:42:16,799 --> 01:42:25,235
Again, those who cry out meet us: This is written in the old law, but in the new, the Apostle proclaims: Vessels of wrath prepared for destruction (Romans 9:22).

826
01:42:25,235 --> 01:42:37,707
Therefore, if mercy was already abundant before the coming of mercy, how much more now, when mercy itself has taken upon the sentence for the ungodly, to absolve the ungodly from their guilt and call them back to the grace of forgiveness?

827
01:42:37,707 --> 01:42:41,795
So let us see by what order the vessels of wrath are prepared for destruction.

828
01:42:41,795 --> 01:42:47,192
Listen to the Apostle, applying this not to God's predestination, but to man's negligence or diligence.

829
01:42:47,192 --> 01:42:54,895
In a great house, he says, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; and some are for honor, and some for dishonor.

830
01:42:54,895 --> 01:43:02,808
If anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to God, prepared for every good work (Second Timothy 2:20-22).

831
01:43:02,808 --> 01:43:32,049
Therefore, the vessels prepared for wrath, if they cleanse themselves from the things for which they were prepared for destruction, will be vessels for honor, sanctified, and useful to God, prepared for every good work; as he said above to the prophet: When I tell the sinner: You will die (Ezekiel 33:34), that is, when I say: You will be a vessel prepared for destruction, and this sinner turns away from his iniquity, that is, when he, being a vessel prepared for destruction, cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified.

832
01:43:32,049 --> 01:43:39,333
After you have overcome them on this point, they flee to the more obscure places of Scripture to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.

833
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:43,420
They say, Do you not know that it is written: Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated?

834
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:51,019
For when they were not yet born, and had done neither good nor evil, it was said from foreknowledge that one would be hated, and the other loved.

835
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:56,757
We need to shed light on the sacred law interpretation here, so you don't focus on anything misleading.

836
01:43:56,757 --> 01:44:01,172
The goal isn't to strip Catholics of their beliefs but to address certain misconceptions.

837
01:44:01,172 --> 01:44:11,440
In the book of Genesis, it is said about Rebecca:
"Two nations and two peoples will come from your womb, and one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger" (Genesis 25:23).

838
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,607
This prophecy isn't about those born naturally, but about the Jews and the Gentiles.

839
01:44:15,607 --> 01:44:19,179
Here, the greater people, the Jews, will serve the lesser, the Gentiles.

840
01:44:19,179 --> 01:44:24,933
The Apostle follows this idea:
"It was said from foreknowledge that the older will serve the younger" (Romans 9:12).

841
01:44:24,933 --> 01:44:27,165
Why did you say this, O blessed Apostle Paul?

842
01:44:27,165 --> 01:44:30,935
Did you mean to suggest that predestination would affect those not yet born?

843
01:44:30,935 --> 01:44:46,908
The Apostle answers:
"I said, 'The older will serve the younger,' so that the choice would be made from the Gentiles."
If the Apostle interprets this prophecy for us, who are you to explain it differently? Remember, it was said that if an angel from heaven preaches a different gospel, let him be accursed (Galatians 1:8).

844
01:44:46,908 --> 01:44:50,480
Some argue:
We do not say anything other than what the Apostle preached.

845
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,456
He mentions predestination made through God's foreknowledge.

846
01:44:53,456 --> 01:44:57,028
He says about God: "Those He called, He also predestined" (Romans 8:30).

847
01:44:57,028 --> 01:45:01,889
If you read about foreknowing, predestining, and calling in the Apostle, why accuse us of a crime?

848
01:45:01,889 --> 01:45:04,617
We aren't accusing you of a crime, but proving a point.

849
01:45:04,617 --> 01:45:09,032
Whether you consider yourselves skilled or not, you shouldn't distort apostolic meanings.

850
01:45:09,032 --> 01:45:15,431
We criticize you for making assumptions without proper knowledge and for promising to teach something you never truly understood.

851
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:27,072
If you had wanted to learn first and then teach, avoiding these interpretations, you would never have strayed from God's fairness, nor would you have said that God does not want all people to be saved.

852
01:45:27,072 --> 01:45:33,089
Our knowledgeable Apostle of the law says he became all things to all people so that he might save all sinners.

853
01:45:33,089 --> 01:47:08,771
As it is written in First Corinthians chapter 9, verse 22: "For he had already learned that God has confined everyone in disobedience so that he may have mercy on all." From the book of Romans, chapter 11, verse 32: "He had learned that every mouth should be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God." From Romans, chapter 3, verse 19: "And so he said: I say through the grace given to me, to everyone among you." Romans, chapter 12, verse 3: "Admonishing every person and teaching." From Colossians, chapter 1, verse 28: "The same God is rich to all of you." Romans, chapter 10, verse 12: "The grace of God has appeared to all people, teaching us." From Titus, chapter 2, verse 11: "So that everyone may be perfect in Christ." Second Timothy, chapter 3, verse 17: "And because he knew that the Son of God was born for everyone, and suffered for everyone, he therefore exclaims, saying: This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth." First Timothy, chapter 2, verse 3: "Hence, every day in his Gospels, the Lord himself cries out to us, saying: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest." From the book of Matthew, chapter 11, verse 28: "Therefore, to show that he does not reject anyone from his generosity, always ready, generous, abundant, never lacking, he speaks in his Gospels, saying: Everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened." Matthew, chapter 7, verse 8: "For even the Scripture of the Old Testament, inviting all nations to listen, said: Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, both low and high, rich and poor alike." Psalm 49, verse 2:

854
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:24,072
And so, the same Apostle, seeing that God wants all people to be saved, but not all people want God, remembers the future judgment and cries out, saying: We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.

855
01:47:24,072 --> 01:47:29,202
Second Corinthians 5:10
Hence, the Apostle Peter says: The grace of God is over all, and in all of you.

856
01:47:29,202 --> 01:47:37,670
All the prophets call, all the apostles call, Christ calls everyone, and priests of God all over the world call everyone to the grace and mercy of God and to forgiveness.

857
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:45,739
Only a few small-minded men, with blind hearts, go out with these apostate books, pretending that they are written by Catholic men, and they harm the whole world.

858
01:47:45,739 --> 01:47:52,414
By introducing a new kind of blasphemy, they say that God does not want all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.

859
01:47:52,414 --> 01:47:59,537
And by enduring the obscurity of one passage, they want to impose the darkness of their own ignorance on such great light and immense splendor.

860
01:47:59,537 --> 01:48:10,097
But because the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it (John 1:5), with the Lord's help, taking from his treasures, we have explained the passage that they think supports their heresy.

861
01:48:10,097 --> 01:48:13,185
Now, let us also speak about foreknowledge and predestination.

862
01:48:13,185 --> 01:48:18,565
God foresaw and foretold that in the offspring of Abraham, that is, in Christ, all nations would be blessed.

863
01:48:18,565 --> 01:48:21,404
While this was coming to pass, the Jews were quite upset.

864
01:48:21,404 --> 01:48:30,569
For this reason, they apprehended the apostles and kept them in custody, saying to them: We warned you not to preach in this name; yet you have filled all Jerusalem with your teaching.

865
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:52,137
Acts 5:28
But the Apostle Paul, seeing that the Jews were failing because the Gentiles were entering into the faith and excluding the Jews from the privilege of the Synagogue by the privilege of the Church, addresses them so that they would not be saddened, saying: Why do you now forbid us to speak to the Gentiles so that they may be saved, when you know that God said to Abraham that in your offspring all nations will be blessed?

866
01:48:52,137 --> 01:48:54,578
First Thessalonians 2:16, Genesis 22:8, Acts 3:25

867
01:48:55,176 --> 01:49:01,244
God knew in advance that the Jews would reject His Son and that people from other nations would believe in Him.

868
01:49:01,244 --> 01:49:10,210
And so He says:
"Those He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers." (Romans 8:29).

869
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:20,214
While the Jews, through circumcision, are taught to be the children of Abraham, the nations become children of God through baptism, and the Son of God becomes their firstborn brother.

870
01:49:20,214 --> 01:49:26,556
The only begotten Son of God specifically becomes the brother of those who are generally adopted as children of God.

871
01:49:26,556 --> 01:49:31,312
Hence, He says to the Father:
"I will declare Your name to my brothers." (Psalm 22:22).

872
01:49:31,312 --> 01:50:04,715
So, as we said, He foreknew these people of the nations, knowing that they would receive His Son, whom the Jews were going to crucify, with a sincere heart and would worship Him as the Son of God, as was fitting:
"Those He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that His Son might be the firstborn among many brothers; those He predestined, He also called."
If you ask the Apostle when He predestined, he tells you:
"When He said to Abraham: 'In your seed all the nations shall be blessed.'
And therefore, through the prophet, He says:
"Hear this, all you nations." (Psalm 49:1).

873
01:50:04,715 --> 01:50:15,212
So He says to the Jews: Nothing should seem new to you in what God has done, who wished to fulfill the promise He made to our father Abraham, that in his seed all the nations would be blessed.

874
01:50:15,212 --> 01:50:21,499
Therefore, because He predestined all the nations, He concluded all in unbelief so that He might have mercy on all.

875
01:50:21,499 --> 01:50:22,319
(Romans 11:32).

876
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:32,542
Therefore, those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified by removing all sins; and those He justified, He also glorified, that is, He made them children of God.

877
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:36,643
Why then do you murmur, O Jews, preventing us from speaking to the nations?

878
01:50:36,643 --> 01:50:38,829
If God is for us, who can be against us?

879
01:50:38,829 --> 01:50:39,759
(Romans 8:31-32).

880
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:43,476
Why do you lay hands on us and cause scandal to the apostles of God?

881
01:50:43,476 --> 01:50:51,458
For if God did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, know this, O Predestined one, what He says:
He delivered Him up for us all.

882
01:50:52,224 --> 01:50:57,536
By saying He was given up for everyone, He removed the scandal from the Jews and excluded your intention.

883
01:50:57,536 --> 01:52:04,731
However, I am amazed at your prudence in reading this passage:
Those whom He predestined, He also called," so you were afraid to approach the previous verse.
For when you came to this passage, thinking it satisfied your intention, you did not want to look ahead to the verse that convicted you, that is,
He gave Him up for everyone"; but you closed the book and began to shout:
God does not call everyone to His grace, He does not invite everyone."
And when our people asked,
So does He not call everyone?"
you responded,
He does not call everyone."
Our people, stunned and anxious, hearing something no heretic had ever said, asked your expertise:
How do you prove that God does not call everyone to His grace?
Does God Himself not want to call them? Or does He want to and cannot? Or do they not deserve it?
If He wants to and cannot, He is blasphemed as powerless; if He can and does not want to, He seems unjust; if they do not deserve it, then grace is no longer grace, and the call is a matter of human merit, not God's grace.
But if it is God's grace and not human merit, He calls everyone.
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, as the Apostle says in the Book of Romans, chapter 3, verse 23; and he added: "They are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ" (Romans 3:24).

884
01:52:04,731 --> 01:52:06,451
Behold, freely, behold redemption.

885
01:52:06,451 --> 01:52:14,648
I boldly say: Where there is presumption of human merit, there is no grace of divinity; for we cannot apply everything we believe to be God's grace to our merits.

886
01:52:14,648 --> 01:52:20,821
Therefore, if it is grace and not merit, how do you say that some are not called because they are unworthy of His calling?

887
01:52:20,821 --> 01:52:28,917
For if no one is called by their own merit, but by the gift of God's grace, and one is called and another rejected, God is blasphemed as a respecter of persons.

888
01:52:28,917 --> 01:52:32,307
The apostles are also argued to be false witnesses of His judgment.

889
01:52:32,307 --> 01:52:38,429
For the blessed Apostle Peter declares: "In truth, I perceive that God shows no partiality" (Acts, chapter 10, verse 34).

890
01:52:38,784 --> 01:52:42,389
Blessed Paul says, "For there is no partiality with God" (Romans 2:11).

891
01:52:42,389 --> 01:52:52,239
And again, the Lord speaks of servants: "Do the same for them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him" (Ephesians 6:9).

892
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:57,774
If this is true, or rather because it is true, how can you claim that He does not call everyone to His grace?

893
01:52:57,774 --> 01:53:01,379
Who does He not wish to save, who prays even for those who crucify Him?

894
01:53:01,379 --> 01:53:07,625
In this heresy, the devil rages with the fury of his tyranny, aiming to wound nearly the entire world with a deadly plague.

895
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:14,378
The creature wages war against the Creator, claiming that He has predestined what He punishes and has ordained what He has forbidden.

896
01:53:14,378 --> 01:53:18,593
How impious and sacrilegious this is, even the most unskilled person can recognize.

897
01:53:18,593 --> 01:53:31,440
For any sin is rightly called sin when both the guilt of the offender and the justice of the judge are evident; because the punishment for sin always follows the merit of the deed:
But no one is made guilty except the one who could have avoided the sin.

898
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:40,072
So, distinguish between the one predestining and the one committing the sin, so that the former condemns or corrects the latter's evil deed as something alien to Himself.

899
01:53:40,072 --> 01:53:42,865
All things that God condemns are foreign to a just God.

900
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:50,938
Hence, if predestination is shown in the sinner, the sinner owes nothing to the just judge; because if predestination is asserted, the action is also approved.

901
01:53:50,938 --> 01:53:54,645
Do you see, I beg you, how gravely God is blasphemed by these assertions?

902
01:53:54,645 --> 01:54:02,566
For if the force of His predestination is brought to the point where sin is said to be by His preordination, a bad fruit can only grow from an impious root.

903
01:54:02,566 --> 01:54:11,046
According to the Manicheans, there would be one God for evil and another for good: so that good things are attributed to the good God, and evil things to the evil God.

904
01:54:11,046 --> 01:54:19,424
Let us not seem to be shouting blasphemy worse than the Manicheans, when we consider the same God whom we confess to be good and just to have predestined all crimes.

905
01:54:19,424 --> 01:54:22,014
Therefore, let the empty arguments of words depart.

906
01:54:22,776 --> 01:54:27,690
There is nothing in common between the wrongdoing of the sinner and the predestination of the avenger.

907
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:32,075
Sin lies in the transgressor's contempt, while vengeance is rooted in the judge's fairness.

908
01:54:32,075 --> 01:54:38,387
So, consider one of two options: either prove the predestination of the judge to be just, or show that there will be another judge.

909
01:54:38,387 --> 01:54:41,327
For no judge can reasonably punish his own established order.

910
01:54:41,327 --> 01:54:45,663
If you attribute evil to God's predestination, you cannot attribute it to the will of man.

911
01:54:45,663 --> 01:54:55,252
Either blame man's guilt and absolve yourself from blasphemy against God, or if you claim that predestination is set by God for the sinner, you remove the sinner's guilt but accuse God of wrongdoing.

912
01:54:55,252 --> 01:55:00,263
Certainly, sin is nothing other than man's transgression, and predestination is nothing but God's order.

913
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:10,671
How then could such different and opposing things come together in one framework, where what is good from God becomes the evil of man, and the vice of the sinner is called the predestination of the one forbidding it?

914
01:55:10,671 --> 01:55:15,489
But why do you not consider this, you who think that people consent to sins by God's predestination?

915
01:55:15,489 --> 01:55:18,140
Every sin is certainly willed and desired by the devil.

916
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:30,764
Do you believe that God set his predestination according to the devil's desire for the destruction of man, wanting his predestination to serve the devil's will, so that humans, before they even had their own merit, would already be condemned to the enemy's will?

917
01:55:30,764 --> 01:55:34,040
Let it suffice to have exposed the blasphemies of this place so far.

918
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,980
For with a trembling heart, I am overcome by unbearable fear.

919
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:45,557
We have written about eighty-nine heresies in the first book; we have seen none that so loosen the reins for people to commit crimes, none that so assert blasphemies against God.

920
01:55:45,557 --> 01:55:49,315
I confess, Catholic confessors, their blasphemies are growing in this defense.

921
01:55:49,315 --> 01:55:56,061
Therefore, I ask for the purity of your faith, that you help me with your prayers as I struggle against those whose every word is blasphemy.

922
01:55:56,784 --> 01:56:00,005
I admit, my dearest friends, all the parts of my body are numb.

923
01:56:00,005 --> 01:56:05,834
My spirit is failing, my hearing is trembling, my face is drained of color, and the hair on my head stands on end.

924
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:08,799
My mind is shaken with fear, and its plans are distressed.

925
01:56:08,799 --> 01:56:15,242
My tongue itself cannot move in its place because we are speaking against those who say that God serves the will of the devil.

926
01:56:15,242 --> 01:56:23,371
Now indeed, they say, God has predestined people, whether to righteousness or to sin; therefore, they cannot be anything other than what He created them to be.

927
01:56:23,371 --> 01:56:30,632
When you ask them why they utter such blasphemy, they say because the Apostle said: "Those whom He predestined, He also called" (Romans 8:30).

928
01:56:30,632 --> 01:56:39,886
And so they argue, those whom God has once predestined to life, even if they are negligent, even if they sin, even if they are unwilling, will be brought to life against their will.

929
01:56:39,886 --> 01:56:44,437
But those whom He has predestined to death, even if they strive and hurry, labor in vain.

930
01:56:44,437 --> 01:56:52,567
Who does not see that this statement removes the concern from the righteous of fearing they might fall and cuts off the hope from sinners that they might rise?

931
01:56:52,567 --> 01:56:56,402
We have escaped the blasphemies against God; we come to the ruin of humans.

932
01:56:56,402 --> 01:57:10,207
For if it is so, that each one is what he is predestined to be, the law ceases, the priest ceases, the devotion of the people ceases, the refuge hall is closed, the embrace of the Church is emptied, no one bends the knee to God, and no one bows their head for blessings.

933
01:57:10,207 --> 01:57:13,990
The heights of God are closed, and all efforts of virtues vanish together.

934
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:23,859
For no matter how much, they say, anyone strives, and does not leave the Church of God, and the priests of God, and divine studies, if God has once predestined him to death, he cannot be saved.

935
01:57:23,859 --> 01:57:31,835
Judas heard the word of life every day, adhered to the Lord every day, was occupied with virtues every day, and heard the Son of God as his guide every day.

936
01:57:31,835 --> 01:57:35,721
And because he was predestined to death, he perished suddenly with one blow.

937
01:57:35,721 --> 01:57:40,783
Saul was a persecutor every day, a stoner of Christians every day, a ravager of churches every day.

938
01:57:40,783 --> 01:57:45,333
And because he was predestined to life, he suddenly became a chosen vessel with one blow.

939
01:57:46,152 --> 01:57:49,271
What, then, they ask, you who remain in sin, are you afraid?

940
01:57:49,271 --> 01:57:51,455
If God deems you worthy, you will be holy.

941
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:54,107
And why, you who live in holiness, are you anxious?

942
01:57:54,107 --> 01:57:56,447
If God does not want it, you will never fall.

943
01:57:56,447 --> 01:57:58,006
Both of you, be secure in God.

944
01:57:58,006 --> 01:58:10,745
Are you who are holy and worried about falling, attending prayers day and night, occupied with fasting, and diligently engaging in divine readings, devoting yourself to exhortations and all holy studies daily, will you be saved by your own will?

945
01:58:10,745 --> 01:58:19,949
Will you be holier than Judas, who received the power to heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead, tread on serpents and scorpions, a fellow apostle, a disciple of Christ?

946
01:58:19,949 --> 01:58:23,536
And yet, because he was predestined to death, he found eternal death.

947
01:58:23,536 --> 01:58:28,996
Stop being anxious, and be secure in God's will; for if God deems you worthy to remain, you will be holy.

948
01:58:28,996 --> 01:58:31,804
But you who are a sinner, learn from the Apostle Paul.

949
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:34,767
Will you ever be able to commit worse things than he did?

950
01:58:34,767 --> 01:58:42,463
And yet, because he was predestined to apostleship, he suddenly escaped all sins and ascended from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high.

951
01:58:42,463 --> 01:58:44,439
This is the whole sum of your counsel.

952
01:58:44,439 --> 01:58:54,630
From here you deceive the world, from here you enter homes and captivate little women weighed down by sins, led by various desires, always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of God.

953
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:56,813
Second Timothy, chapter 3, verses 6 and 7.

954
01:58:56,813 --> 01:59:06,381
Therefore, with the Lord's help, the spirit that shattered the plans of the false elders against Susanna will now divide you who handle falsehoods against the immaculate Church of God.

955
01:59:06,381 --> 01:59:12,516
And just as they were found full of deceit by their own accusation, so you will leave defeated by your own opposition.

956
01:59:12,516 --> 01:59:19,276
Therefore, we say the same words at the beginning that you yourselves said, but we gather the end of those same words differently.

957
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,276
We say that Judas was indeed an apostle and did not stray from Christ's path.

958
01:59:24,276 --> 01:59:31,333
He received guidance for salvation directly from Christ, performed powerful signs, and obtained all the distinctions of apostleship.

959
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:33,417
Yet, because he was negligent, he fell.

960
01:59:33,417 --> 01:59:40,581
Be vigilant so you do not fall; be diligent, because your adversary, like a roaring lion, prowls around looking for someone to devour.

961
01:59:40,581 --> 01:59:42,666
First Peter, chapter five, verse eight.

962
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:47,905
However, do not think that Judas's fall was due to God's impiety; God did not want him to be evil.

963
01:59:47,905 --> 02:00:01,965
But because he was a thief and had the money bag, John, chapter twelve, verse six, and because greed, the root of all evil, was in his heart, First Timothy, chapter six, verse ten, he fell miserably and burst open in the middle, Acts, chapter one, verse eighteen.

964
02:00:01,965 --> 02:00:09,396
He neglected such divine gifts and, with the healer present, not only did he fail to heal his wounds, but he also tried to make them worse.

965
02:00:09,396 --> 02:00:11,908
In Judas's sin, we ask you to judge yourselves.

966
02:00:11,908 --> 02:00:16,559
We conclude, with Christ's help, that you must surpass yourselves by your own judgment.

967
02:00:16,559 --> 02:00:21,157
In Judas's sin, there is a great sacrilege, an incomparable crime, an immense offense.

968
02:00:21,157 --> 02:00:23,990
Tell us, to whom do you want to attribute this crime?

969
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:27,144
To Judas the betrayer himself, or to God the predestinator?

970
02:00:27,144 --> 02:00:40,723
If you prove that this sin, worse than any other, is the sin of God the predestinator, I admit you have won; but if it is the sin of Judas the betrayer himself, our defense has triumphed: for God neither predestined him to be so, nor wanted him to be so.

971
02:00:40,723 --> 02:00:50,987
Let us therefore defend the holy and blameless Lord from any crime; lest we accuse Him, whom Judas betrayed out of greed, of injustice; and by removing Judas's crime, call the Lord into guilt.

972
02:00:50,987 --> 02:01:18,305
For if Judas was such because God predestined him to be so, not because he himself was negligent, we indeed free him from all weight of crime, and removing ourselves from the reproach of the betrayer, we accuse the cunning of the predestinating God, who supposedly wanted to make him an apostle, only to turn him into a betrayer; who supposedly wanted to elevate him to the heavens, only to throw him down from on high; who supposedly wanted him to cast out demons, only to hand him over to the power of demons.

973
02:01:18,305 --> 02:01:19,160
Why do we delay?

974
02:01:20,016 --> 02:01:27,564
Before your eyes, you have both, oh scholars of our time: the servant and the Lord, the Master and the disciple, the good God and the evil man.

975
02:01:27,564 --> 02:01:28,990
Accuse either one you wish.

976
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:39,811
If you accuse God of predestination, Judas is innocent; if you accuse Judas of betrayal, you cannot teach that God predestined his crime, because God's predestination is good, but Judas's betrayal is evil.

977
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:44,404
Therefore, the good one did a good deed, because it is believed that he never did evil.

978
02:01:44,404 --> 02:01:51,530
And if God's predestination is good, and Judas's betrayal is very bad, the evil deed of Judas and the good deed of God could not agree.

979
02:01:51,530 --> 02:01:57,865
For it is impossible for darkness and light, good and evil, life and death, truth and lies, to have fellowship together.

980
02:01:57,865 --> 02:02:04,780
Therefore, giving Judas alone his entire sin, and showing to God the purest honor of his justice, also give us the kiss of charity.

981
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:10,376
For you are struggling in vain, who excuse and defend all sinners through Judas, but accuse God's justice.

982
02:02:10,376 --> 02:02:18,611
Now let us come to the good and truly blessed teacher Paul, and, removing the madness of evasion, let us explain what cannot be denied as true and complete.

983
02:02:18,611 --> 02:02:26,318
It is one thing to persecute an innocent person out of malicious zeal, as Cain did; it is another to persecute out of zeal for God, as Elijah did.

984
02:02:26,318 --> 02:02:31,756
Not only did he persecute, but he also commanded many people to be killed by the sword in his presence.

985
02:02:31,756 --> 02:02:37,826
Cain killed one person and is punished with eternal damnation; Elijah killed many and is taken up to eternal glory.

986
02:02:37,826 --> 02:02:43,105
Therefore, as you think, Paul did not imitate Cain, but, driven by zeal for God, he followed Elijah.

987
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:45,481
Perhaps you might say: How do you prove this?

988
02:02:45,481 --> 02:03:00,050
Read Galatians where he bears witness to himself, saying: "I was persecuting," he said, "the Church of God, and was trying to destroy it beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation; being, he said, exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my ancestors" (Galatians 1:13-14).

989
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:05,329
Is it not known to all Catholics that the God of the Hebrews is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ?

990
02:03:05,329 --> 02:03:06,860
Whom, then, was he defending?

991
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:13,142
The Father, without a doubt, because his priests had told him that this was not the Son of God whom they had crucified.

992
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:23,219
Believing in his own law and trusting the priests of the living God, he received letters from them to go to Damascus and bring back Christians in chains to the synagogues (Acts 9:2).

993
02:03:23,219 --> 02:03:27,507
He was a very wise and discerning man, who thought he was acting out of zeal for God.

994
02:03:27,507 --> 02:03:32,752
He undoubtedly believed he was persecuting God's enemies, running for the sake of God's faith and truth.

995
02:03:32,752 --> 02:03:40,873
He had not learned that Jesus Christ was the Son of God and considered Him a deceiver and misleader of His people, as he had heard from his teachers and priests.

996
02:03:40,873 --> 02:03:48,186
With the spirit of Elijah, not Cain, he fiercely pursued the new worshippers of God and unknowingly committed crimes, thinking they were virtues.

997
02:03:48,186 --> 02:03:55,046
However, God, who examines the heart and observes faith, allowed him to find mercy because his ignorance was confirmed by his innocence.

998
02:03:55,046 --> 02:03:56,105
How do we prove this?

999
02:03:56,105 --> 02:04:02,057
He himself says to Timothy:
I was a persecutor and an arrogant man; but I received mercy because I acted in ignorance.

1000
02:04:02,057 --> 02:04:05,739
Do you see, therefore, that where there is ignorance, there is no malice?

1001
02:04:05,739 --> 02:04:11,943
For to the ignorant, the teachings of God's justice are given; but to the knowing and contemptuous, judgment is pronounced.

1002
02:04:11,943 --> 02:04:21,375
Thus, Paul, walking through the darkness of ignorance, thought he was persecuting the enemy of his Lord: he burned with persecution because he strove to please the Lord as a good servant.

1003
02:04:21,375 --> 02:04:26,116
He did not rest; he raged, being more zealous than anyone for the traditions of his ancestors.

1004
02:04:26,116 --> 02:04:28,033
Which ancestors' zeal was he carrying?

1005
02:04:28,033 --> 02:04:31,311
Without a doubt, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and who is their God?

1006
02:04:31,311 --> 02:04:33,984
Without a doubt, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1007
02:04:33,984 --> 02:04:42,710
Therefore, striving to please Him, he thought he was pursuing His enemy, suffering the darkness of his own priests, to whom he gave his faith in obedience to the divine law.

1008
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:44,627
It is well known what darkness brings.

1009
02:04:44,627 --> 02:04:54,714
Can experience not teach us that the nature of darkness is such that it presents the known and the unknown, the parent and the stranger, the citizen and the barbarian, in the same way before our eyes?

1010
02:04:54,714 --> 02:04:57,388
Unless he speaks, it is impossible to know who he is.

1011
02:04:58,296 --> 02:05:05,130
Like a good guardian of the vineyard of the Lord of hosts, the house of Israel, he walked through the night of ignorance with staff in hand.

1012
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:10,208
Whenever he found someone gathering the Lord's harvest, he would destroy them with the spirit of Elijah.

1013
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:23,731
To the good servant watching over his Lord's vineyard, zealously pursuing the faith, imitating Elijah, and fighting for the truth in the darkness of ignorance: to the one who knew he was called to fight for the truth even unto death, the Lord came saying: Rest, I am your Lord.

1014
02:05:23,731 --> 02:05:24,903
Now, judge for yourself.

1015
02:05:24,903 --> 02:05:41,160
If you enter your vineyard at night, and your servant, in the dark of night, senses you and begins to seize you, tell me: would you remain silent and allow yourself to be held by him, knowing he is not persecuting you out of malice, but defending you, while he mistakenly thinks you are a thief and is pursuing you for your own sake?

1016
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:43,455
Such a servant deserves both praise and reward.

1017
02:05:43,455 --> 02:05:52,487
When you finally tell him who is pursuing you to stop, saying: I am your lord, he will immediately drop his staff, throw himself at your feet, and beg for forgiveness for his ignorance.

1018
02:05:52,487 --> 02:05:54,830
At that moment, he will do whatever you command.

1019
02:05:54,830 --> 02:06:00,298
So then, the blessed Paul, sent by the priests of God and already full of apostolic merits, was a chosen vessel.

1020
02:06:00,298 --> 02:06:09,477
With the spirit of Elijah within him, he persecuted those he thought were enemies of God's law, believing them to be thieves in his Lord's vineyard, when in reality, they were his own God.

1021
02:06:09,477 --> 02:06:12,211
He endured the night of disbelief caused by the priests.

1022
02:06:12,211 --> 02:06:17,678
The just Lord, pleased with Paul's righteousness even in his persecution, had given the law which Paul observed.

1023
02:06:18,216 --> 02:06:31,088
Therefore, it is not as though He, who accepts no one's person, took an unwilling person and made him willing, took a faithless person and made him faithful, took an enemy and made him a friend, or took a bad person and made him good.

1024
02:06:31,088 --> 02:08:25,072
Rather, He speaks to His own faithful servant who is working for Him and says:
"Why do you persecute me?"
Acts 9:4.
But he says the very words usually said in the darkness:
"Who are you, Lord?"
And the Lord replies:
"I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting."
Acts 9:5.
Immediately he believes, and immediately he transfers himself from the Synagogue to the Church, not by changing his Lord, but by recognizing that He is the same one whom he has always worshiped. He does not come from one God to another God, but by proving that He is the same God whom he has always worshiped. He does not come from faithlessness to faith, but by holding onto the same faith which he rightfully had.
Therefore, the righteous Lord recognized His servant, just as the Apostle himself says to Timothy:
"The Lord knows those who are His"
Second Timothy 2:19.
But to those whom He sees claiming to be His servants out of a desire for vain glory and some greed, He shouts to them, saying:
"Depart from me, for I never knew you"
Matthew 7:23.
But why do we stand in this place, when you not only hurl these insults at the Apostle, saying that he was dragged unwillingly, when you read that he says of himself:
"If I do this unwillingly, I am entrusted with a stewardship; but if I do this willingly, I have a reward"
First Corinthians 9:17.
Exclude him from his reward and say:
"Because you do this unwillingly, being unwillingly held and dragged, you do not run; for if you do not progress in your course, be secure now. Know that, even if you want to sin, you cannot."
To this, he himself responds to you:
"I run thus, not with uncertainty"
First Corinthians 9:26;
"I hasten every day, and I extend myself toward the prize of the heavenly calling"
Philippians 3:14.
And although I am aware of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this
First Corinthians 4:4.
Do not be deceived: God is not mocked
Galatians 6:7.
For unless I persist in many fasts, and mortify my flesh, and subject it to servitude, I myself will become a castaway
First Corinthians 9:27.
Oh good teacher!

1025
02:08:25,128 --> 02:08:27,842
O wise architect and instructor of all good things!

1026
02:08:27,842 --> 02:08:31,939
He who wants to offer the example of salvation builds the Church in this way.

1027
02:08:31,939 --> 02:08:43,061
He does not discourage those striving on the good path, so that they think they can reach God by removing the desire to please God from their souls and say:
We will not please Him by our effort, so why strive?

1028
02:08:43,061 --> 02:08:45,722
We will not please Him by our running, so why run?

1029
02:08:45,722 --> 02:08:48,383
We will not please Him by our will, so why desire?

1030
02:08:48,383 --> 02:08:51,523
We will not please Him by our vigilance, so why stay awake?

1031
02:08:51,523 --> 02:08:54,183
We will not please Him by our prayer, so why pray?

1032
02:08:54,183 --> 02:08:57,004
If we are predestined to life, we will not be damned.

1033
02:08:57,004 --> 02:09:05,465
Excluding this, the apostle Peter shouts: Be alert, because your adversary, like a roaring lion, prowls around looking for someone to devour (First Peter 5:8).

1034
02:09:05,465 --> 02:09:11,745
And the apostle Paul: Do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them (Ephesians 5:11).

1035
02:09:11,745 --> 02:09:13,235
He says, Do not participate.

1036
02:09:13,235 --> 02:09:15,736
Do you see how carefully he guides our consent?

1037
02:09:15,736 --> 02:09:19,674
He knows that through our consent each person is either deceived or saved.

1038
02:09:19,674 --> 02:09:30,157
I mean the consent by which we agree with the doctor who, wanting to heal us freely, calls out to us daily: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest (Matthew 11:28).

1039
02:09:30,157 --> 02:09:33,563
Therefore, you hear the call, so present yourself as responding.

1040
02:09:33,563 --> 02:09:37,341
He who shouts for everyone to come to him did not ignore your doctrine.

1041
02:09:37,341 --> 02:09:47,825
For he would not say: Come to me, all; but he would say: Let those who are predestined to salvation come to me to be saved, and let those who are predestined to death depart from me to be punished.

1042
02:09:47,825 --> 02:09:49,475
But it is not so, as you teach.

1043
02:09:49,475 --> 02:09:53,147
For if a man withdraws his consent from the call of God, he perishes.

1044
02:09:53,147 --> 02:09:56,765
This doctor of ours indeed heals freely, but he commands observance.

1045
02:09:56,765 --> 02:10:04,056
Whoever has not been saved, either despised the caller, refused the invitation, or neglected the commands to abstain from certain things.

1046
02:10:04,056 --> 02:10:06,451
This is what we say about the perfect doctor.

1047
02:10:06,451 --> 02:10:07,302
What do you say?

1048
02:10:07,302 --> 02:10:15,072
Say what you will: if you praise the doctor and blame the sick person, you show the diligence of the doctor and the negligence of the sick person.

1049
02:10:16,296 --> 02:10:20,326
You're not saying this directly, but rather implying it through your writings.

1050
02:10:20,326 --> 02:10:25,182
God has predestined those He knows are worthy of salvation; He saves only those He has chosen.

1051
02:10:25,182 --> 02:10:29,574
God's salvation does not cater to the will of man, for He knows exactly whom to save.

1052
02:10:29,574 --> 02:10:34,069
Free will does not come before God's grace; rather, God's grace comes before free will.

1053
02:10:34,069 --> 02:10:36,807
These are your words, a mix of truths and falsehoods.

1054
02:10:36,807 --> 02:10:38,202
We will address each point.

1055
02:10:38,202 --> 02:10:44,919
If He calls those He knows are worthy, then He must have predestined everyone for salvation because He continually calls everyone.

1056
02:10:44,919 --> 02:10:50,551
If He only saves those He has predestined, then everyone must be predestined because He is the Savior of all.

1057
02:10:50,551 --> 02:11:03,002
If God's salvation isn't subject to human will but rather God's grace, show us someone who received baptism unwillingly and then desired it through grace; or someone who performed penance unwillingly, but later repented after being forgiven.

1058
02:11:03,002 --> 02:11:08,376
These acts, the sacrifice and confession, are vital to human salvation, and we perform them voluntarily.

1059
02:11:08,376 --> 02:11:17,314
The sacrifice, through which we are redeemed by Christ's blood and cleansed by water from His side, and confession, by which we acknowledge our sins and receive forgiveness.

1060
02:11:17,314 --> 02:11:22,687
Therefore, these two things-sacrifice and confession-are crucial for salvation and are done voluntarily.

1061
02:11:22,687 --> 02:11:27,234
Let's see if they are demanded from an unwilling person or requested from a willing one.

1062
02:11:27,234 --> 02:11:32,866
If from an unwilling person, you win; if from a willing person, truth prevails through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1063
02:11:32,866 --> 02:11:36,586
We voluntarily sacrifice to God and confess His name because He is good.

1064
02:11:36,586 --> 02:11:41,081
Yet, some say: The will of man is futile and unproductive, and human choice is in vain.

1065
02:11:41,856 --> 02:11:47,626
When comparing this to divine grace, we maintain one key point: we do not place human will above divine grace.

1066
02:11:47,626 --> 02:11:51,298
All good things are attributed not to human pride, but to God's mercy.

1067
02:11:51,298 --> 02:11:55,442
However, we cannot agree with you when you say that the will of man is useless.

1068
02:11:55,442 --> 02:12:00,793
We believe the will of man is not useless; if it were, it would neither deserve reward nor punishment.

1069
02:12:00,793 --> 02:12:03,259
Don't misunderstand us by not paying attention.

1070
02:12:03,259 --> 02:12:06,983
Take your catechumens and penitents to the bishops of all the Churches.

1071
02:12:06,983 --> 02:12:12,072
If you see them unwilling to grant baptism or lay hands for penance, know that you are Catholics.

1072
02:12:12,072 --> 02:12:22,826
But if they require a thorough examination of true and complete will before granting baptism, or voluntary confession before laying hands for penance, then you must understand: does grace precede the will?

1073
02:12:22,826 --> 02:12:27,914
Indeed, God's grace is greater than human will, but in this context, the will comes before grace.

1074
02:12:27,914 --> 02:12:30,537
The former precedes in merit, the latter in order.

1075
02:12:30,537 --> 02:12:35,993
I know the confusion you often create among the uninformed, using deceitful cleverness in this argument.

1076
02:12:35,993 --> 02:12:37,934
They say the will comes before grace.

1077
02:12:37,934 --> 02:12:44,071
In two respects, we agree: the will comes before grace in the attainment of baptism and in the conversion of penance.

1078
02:12:44,071 --> 02:12:49,737
This ensures that people, not influenced by your advice, begin to seek excuses for their sins (Psalm 140:4).

1079
02:12:49,737 --> 02:12:55,455
As one might say: If God wills, forgiveness will come to me; if Christ wants me in His flock, it will happen.

1080
02:12:55,455 --> 02:13:03,061
To this, we respond: Unless you wholeheartedly believe, forgiveness and grace will not come to you, nor will you become part of the divine flock.

1081
02:13:03,061 --> 02:13:06,576
Similarly, to those still in sin, it is said: Do penance (Matthew).

1082
02:13:07,416 --> 02:13:08,819
The kingdom of God is near.

1083
02:13:08,819 --> 02:14:17,141
When they say, "If God deigns to forgive sins, it is in His power," we respond, "Unless you repent with all your heart, God's forgiveness will never reach you."
In these situations, we assert that human will precedes God's grace. We explain that this human will comes before God's grace because we wouldn't even have the will to repent unless the Only Begotten, coming down from heaven, had opened the workshop of His grace to everyone. He came and suffered for all people. Therefore, in this order, God's grace precedes human will.
We make this point to reject two extremes. For those of you who say, "Grace precedes will," you sound correct but miss the mark. You argue, "Grace precedes will, so a person neither begins to want good nor seeks to be drawn to it, but waits to be made good against their will." And when he is bad, he says, "God wills this, because His grace does not come to me."
In this matter, we respond to both you and the one who says this by stating, "Human will precedes God's grace." For the Lord did not say, "First you will receive, and then ask; first you will find, and then seek; first it will be opened to you, and then knock." But He said, "Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives" (Matthew 7:7-8).

1084
02:14:17,141 --> 02:14:31,336
By saying "everyone," He established a general principle and excluded the specificity of His predestination. And by saying "who asks receives," He demonstrated human will prior to the gift of grace. And yet, human will comes before grace, and God's grace comes before will.

1085
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:35,303
We did not go to the Holy One as sinners; instead, the Holy One came to us.

1086
02:14:35,303 --> 02:14:38,188
We did not ask Him to come; He came without being asked.

1087
02:14:38,188 --> 02:14:41,176
So that humanity might ascend to God, God descended to us.

1088
02:14:41,176 --> 02:14:42,721
He emptied Himself to fill us.

1089
02:14:42,721 --> 02:14:44,318
He humbled Himself to exalt us.

1090
02:14:44,318 --> 02:14:45,915
He became poor to make us rich.

1091
02:14:45,915 --> 02:14:47,821
The living bread hungered to feed us.

1092
02:14:47,821 --> 02:14:52,715
The eternal fountain thirsted so that the sweet and eternal waters might wash over our dryness.

1093
02:14:52,715 --> 02:14:54,673
He was held so that we might be freed.

1094
02:14:54,673 --> 02:14:56,682
He was bound so that we might be saved.

1095
02:14:56,682 --> 02:14:57,970
He was sold to redeem us.

1096
02:14:57,970 --> 02:15:02,245
He received a crown of thorns to remove the thorns and thistles of the first curse.

1097
02:15:02,245 --> 02:15:03,739
He was stripped to clothe us.

1098
02:15:03,739 --> 02:15:07,397
He was hung on the cross to free us from the torments of eternal death.

1099
02:15:07,397 --> 02:15:13,991
Condemning the wood of concupiscence from the wood of the cross, He spread out His immaculate hands for our uncontrollable ones.

1100
02:15:13,991 --> 02:15:19,657
For the taste of concupiscence, He took the food of gall, and brought the death of life for the life of death.

1101
02:15:19,657 --> 02:15:21,563
He conquered for us, not for Himself.

1102
02:15:21,563 --> 02:15:23,985
He has always been, is, and will be victorious.

1103
02:15:23,985 --> 02:15:31,609
Because we lost life and paradise in Adam, we gain through Christ both paradise, eternal life, adoption as children of God, and the eternal kingdom.

1104
02:15:31,609 --> 02:15:36,245
Here, we strongly denounce anyone who says that the will of man precedes the grace of God.

1105
02:15:36,245 --> 02:15:42,066
We affirm that since the passion, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, grace has spread throughout the world.

1106
02:15:42,066 --> 02:15:47,372
Those who do not seek these great gifts of God and wait for the Church to come to them, we call insane.

1107
02:15:47,372 --> 02:15:51,287
To these people, we say: The grace of God is available to all in the Church.

1108
02:15:51,287 --> 02:15:53,245
If anyone seeks it, they will find it.

1109
02:15:53,245 --> 02:15:55,512
If anyone knocks, it will be opened to them.

1110
02:15:55,512 --> 02:15:58,705
But to those unwilling or lukewarm, divine grace is not given.

1111
02:15:58,705 --> 02:16:04,372
As the apostle Philip said to the eunuch: If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized (Acts 8:37).

1112
02:16:05,712 --> 02:16:11,088
Wanting is not excluded by grace; rather, it is incited by it, awakening the will that sleeps every day.

1113
02:16:11,088 --> 02:16:16,308
Grace is established, as it is written, in the midst of the earth it cries out: Come (Matthew 11:28).

1114
02:16:16,308 --> 02:16:21,736
This word of God anticipates the one who will come; it anticipates the one who will ask, seek, and knock.

1115
02:16:21,736 --> 02:16:24,683
If a person seeks and finds, it is thanks to God's grace.

1116
02:16:24,683 --> 02:16:26,854
God invited you to seek and made you find.

1117
02:16:26,854 --> 02:16:30,059
If you do not seek, you will not find; this is your free will.

1118
02:16:30,059 --> 02:16:34,763
You have so much free will that you can even choose to ignore your Lord who is calling you.

1119
02:16:34,763 --> 02:16:38,795
Therefore, whoever is saved, it is by God's grace, who made you want to do so.

1120
02:16:38,795 --> 02:16:43,705
He invites you daily through the prophets, through Himself, and through His apostles to desire.

1121
02:16:43,705 --> 02:16:47,737
If you want and listen, you will receive the eternal good things of that land.

1122
02:16:47,737 --> 02:16:53,217
Therefore, what you want, ask, and accomplish is by God, because in this part, grace anticipates the will.

1123
02:16:53,217 --> 02:17:00,092
For you would not know what to want unless He called you, both directly and through His people, and taught you to ask and how to ask.

1124
02:17:00,092 --> 02:17:02,728
So, what shall we say now about you who do not ask?

1125
02:17:02,728 --> 02:17:05,106
Did God not want you, or did you not want God?

1126
02:17:05,106 --> 02:17:08,414
Did God not want you to do good, or did you not want to do good?

1127
02:17:08,414 --> 02:17:11,723
Did God not want you to be just, or did you not want to be just?

1128
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:15,600
Therefore I ask you, O most holy predestinator, to make one of two choices.

1129
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:19,011
Either admit you are defeated, or be convicted of blaspheming God.

1130
02:17:19,011 --> 02:17:27,592
If you allow yourself to be defeated, say with us: Man did not want good, and therefore he is evil; because if he wants to ask, the grace of God will be given to him.

1131
02:17:27,592 --> 02:17:33,175
When you say this, you extend your hand to brotherhood and reconcile yourself to Divinity through reverence.

1132
02:17:33,175 --> 02:17:41,808
But if you say: Therefore he is evil, because God wanted it, not because man did not want it, you will be proven to have blasphemed God, whom you confirm to want evil.

1133
02:17:41,808 --> 02:17:45,891
It will be necessary for the Church to anathematize the one who blasphemes God.

1134
02:17:45,891 --> 02:17:48,734
Let's now address the false commentaries of your books.

1135
02:17:49,872 --> 02:17:59,239
He is mistaken who thinks that he can reach Christ by merely wanting to do good, since Christ himself says: "No one comes to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (John 6:44).

1136
02:17:59,239 --> 02:18:06,433
Those of you who understand Christ better, tell me if Christ lied, and only then assert that we have set our opinion against Christ's rule.

1137
02:18:06,433 --> 02:18:13,109
For if Christ spoke the truth, we do not lie when we say that those predestined are drawn to life, because life itself is Christ.

1138
02:18:13,109 --> 02:18:16,370
It is not new that fools can be deceived by the sound of words.

1139
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:21,442
So too the vain Arius, following the sound of words, says that the Father is greater than the Son.

1140
02:18:21,442 --> 02:18:25,220
And he says to us what you say: If you believe in the Son, listen to him.

1141
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:28,170
For he says, "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28).

1142
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:34,018
Those who attend to the sound of words, like the heresy of the Arians, join in the vanity of the Predestinarians.

1143
02:18:34,018 --> 02:18:38,262
For who does not know that no one can come to the Son unless the Father draws him?

1144
02:18:38,262 --> 02:18:43,748
Yet, before the Lord reveals the hidden mystery of this passage through us, we uncover your understanding.

1145
02:18:43,748 --> 02:19:04,501
You say this testimony so that no one may attentively receive the admonitions of the priests, no one may hurry to the embrace of Mother Church and be nourished by the two testaments; all flee the house of God, and each occupies himself with whatever vice he wishes, waiting for the Father to reach down from heaven to draw him unwilling and resistant, and make him chosen and holy without his consent.

1146
02:19:04,501 --> 02:19:06,623
This is your assertion and your doctrine.

1147
02:19:06,623 --> 02:19:15,525
But we say that, although anyone may be holy, whether he is an apostle, a martyr, a prophet, or a just person, he does not have the strength on his own to ascend to Christ.

1148
02:19:15,525 --> 02:19:21,321
Only the Lord ascended to heaven by his own power due to his divinity, and sits at the right hand of the Father.

1149
02:19:21,321 --> 02:19:27,014
Therefore, although anyone may be holy, or a friend of God, he does not have the strength to ascend to heaven.

1150
02:19:27,014 --> 02:19:40,263
And because the Son says to the Father: "Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am" (John 17:14), explaining the unity of the Deity, he says: "No one comes to me," that is, no one can come to me by his own strength.

1151
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:47,518
It is not possible for human holiness to reach me, where I sit at the right hand of the Father, unless the Father draws them.

1152
02:19:47,518 --> 02:19:55,603
Therefore, in the person of one, the entire assembly of saints says to God:
You have held my right hand, guided me with your will, and taken me up in glory.

1153
02:19:55,603 --> 02:19:56,225
Psalm 73:24.

1154
02:19:56,225 --> 02:19:59,749
And it adds: For those who distance themselves from you will perish.

1155
02:19:59,749 --> 02:20:00,371
Psalm 73:27.

1156
02:20:00,371 --> 02:20:11,514
It does not say, those whom you distance from yourself; but those who distance themselves from you will perish, showing that it is not by God's rejection, but by the distancing of man, that destruction comes to man.

1157
02:20:11,514 --> 02:20:13,846
Now listen to what the book Predestined says.

1158
02:20:13,846 --> 02:20:27,424
And if the weight of the Gospel testimony burdens you, and you cannot give us an answer because of the weight of the statement, at least explain to us the Apostle's statement, who says:
It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.

1159
02:20:27,424 --> 02:20:28,046
Romans 9:16.

1160
02:20:28,046 --> 02:20:35,665
We have declared the Gospel testimony with true assertions, and we clearly demonstrate this statement of the blessed Paul with evident inspiration.

1161
02:20:35,665 --> 02:20:40,744
But first, we uncover your understanding, so that holy testimonies may not be wrongly used by you.

1162
02:20:40,744 --> 02:20:52,249
You want no one to desire good, no one to run towards good, but to say in their heart:
No matter how much I desire, no matter how much I run, nothing will benefit the one who desires, nothing will benefit the one who runs.

1163
02:20:52,249 --> 02:20:56,188
It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.

1164
02:20:56,188 --> 02:21:04,636
However, we assert that no one obtains the grace of God unless they run with faith: and when they have obtained it, they are warned by the Apostle not to be proud.

1165
02:21:04,636 --> 02:21:08,989
For they did not receive the grace of God according to their running and their will.

1166
02:21:08,989 --> 02:21:15,053
For their running and will, no matter how great, no matter how vast, have limits, but the grace of God has no limits.

1167
02:21:15,053 --> 02:21:20,443
And therefore, even when the righteous reach the crown, they are not allowed to be proud of their crown.

1168
02:21:20,443 --> 02:21:25,988
For the Holy Spirit says:
He crowns you not because of your merit, but because of his mercy and compassion.

1169
02:21:25,988 --> 02:21:26,610
Psalm 103:4.

1170
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:29,927
And the Apostle says: What do you have that you did not receive?

1171
02:21:29,927 --> 02:21:33,555
And if you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?

1172
02:21:33,555 --> 02:21:34,695
First Corinthians 4:7.

1173
02:21:35,784 --> 02:21:39,153
So, he directed his path and will towards receiving from the giver.

1174
02:21:39,153 --> 02:21:43,478
But the gift surpasses the merit of the one working because of the grace of the giver.

1175
02:21:43,478 --> 02:21:46,847
Our will is between us and God, just like a beggar is with a giver.

1176
02:21:46,847 --> 02:22:23,760
The one who gives alms wants to give to everyone, as indeed our giver of grace calls out daily: "Come to me, all of you." And again: "Ask and you will receive."
For example, a needy person ran and received from the giver, and having received riches, he started to be wealthy who had been needy and poor. What will he say now? "I became rich from my work because I wanted to, because I ran?" He does not say this, but he says: "I am certain that I have something not because of the merit of my will or my running, but because of the grace of the one who gave everything."
And with this said, he can truly say with the Apostle, because "it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Romans 9:16).

1177
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:31,153
Here we have spoken about the one who wanted and ran, because the gifts of God are so great that they surpass both the running and the will of man.

1178
02:22:31,153 --> 02:22:36,383
For the running and effort of man, unless they are helped by the invisible supports of God, are in vain.

1179
02:22:36,383 --> 02:22:47,145
For even the Apostle, fighting the good fight, finishing the race, and keeping the faith, and now only awaiting the crown (Second Timothy 4:7), says: "By the grace of God, I am what I am" (First Corinthians 15:10).

1180
02:22:47,145 --> 02:22:50,816
And again he tells us: "By grace you have been saved" (Ephesians 2:5, 8).

1181
02:22:50,816 --> 02:22:55,644
He is greatly unfortunate who thinks he can obtain the gift of God by the merit of his own will.

1182
02:22:55,644 --> 02:22:59,768
Every good and perfect gift is from above, from the Father of lights (James 1:17).

1183
02:22:59,768 --> 02:23:03,942
We claim nothing for human power; we attribute all good things to the mercy of God.

1184
02:23:03,942 --> 02:23:09,725
So we say that all good things are gifts from God, such that we attribute all the evil we do to our own negligence.

1185
02:23:09,725 --> 02:23:16,514
For otherwise, we do not deserve pardon unless we truly show that we have sinned by our own fault, not by any prejudice of the Creator.

1186
02:23:16,514 --> 02:23:24,762
And as we have said about good, that all the good he has done is by the grace of God, so whatever evil he has done, he should consider it due to his own negligence.

1187
02:23:25,416 --> 02:23:34,126
Wherefore the Holy Spirit cries out:
If you are willing and listen to me, you will eat the good of the land;
but if you refuse and rebel, the sword will devour you.

1188
02:23:34,126 --> 02:23:36,888
For the mouth of the Lord has spoken" (Isaiah 1:19).

1189
02:23:36,888 --> 02:23:52,982
Through the occasion of good testimony but a bad interpreter, you say:
"Do not will, for it is not of the willing";
the Holy Spirit says:
"If you are willing."
You say:
"Do not run, for it is not of the running";
the Holy Spirit says:
"Run in such a way that you may obtain it" (First Corinthians 9:24).

1190
02:23:52,982 --> 02:23:58,559
The Lord Jesus Christ cries out:
"Run while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you" (John 12:35).

1191
02:23:58,559 --> 02:24:01,905
Therefore, rejecting your notion, we adhere to the Holy Spirit.

1192
02:24:01,905 --> 02:24:06,792
For it is better, as the apostle Peter says:
"We must obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

1193
02:24:06,792 --> 02:24:07,961
But what are we doing?

1194
02:24:07,961 --> 02:24:30,534
Once again, your erroneous teachings grow, in which it is read:
"However much human will exerts its strength to build, it strives in vain;
or what does human frailty think its vigilance will benefit eternal desires, when the prophet cries out with evident documents, saying:
'Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.
Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain' (Psalm 127:1)?

1195
02:24:30,534 --> 02:24:40,467
What is it that someone hopes to study for building against divine principles and against their own conscience, when these sacred words teach that human building is not certain, but vain?

1196
02:24:40,467 --> 02:24:42,963
First of all, I ask, what building do you mean?

1197
02:24:42,963 --> 02:24:47,000
If you are talking about bricks and mortar, discuss that with the Egyptians.

1198
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,921
But we here understand the building of the Word of God.

1199
02:24:49,921 --> 02:24:55,658
The Word of God is presented throughout the whole world by God's priests for the building of God's churches.

1200
02:24:55,658 --> 02:24:58,101
Is the speech of the priest therefore useless?

1201
02:24:58,101 --> 02:24:59,110
The doctrine empty?

1202
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,960
The effort vain?

1203
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:04,209
And if the building of this work is in vain, why is it commanded by the Apostle?

1204
02:25:04,209 --> 02:25:11,274
For the apostle Paul says:
"Encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing" (First Thessalonians 5:11).

1205
02:25:11,274 --> 02:25:15,363
And again:
"As a wise builder, I laid a foundation" (First Corinthians 3:10).

1206
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:24,516
If anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, the quality of each person's work will be tested by fire.

1207
02:25:24,516 --> 02:25:25,937
First Corinthians 3:10-12.

1208
02:25:25,937 --> 02:25:33,696
And the Lord in the Gospel praises the wise man because he builds his house on the rock, which is not brought down by the winds or the floods.

1209
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:34,406
Matthew 7:24.

1210
02:25:34,406 --> 02:25:36,592
So, do priests build the Church in vain?

1211
02:25:36,592 --> 02:25:41,291
Do they watch in vain to protect the simplicity of the sheep from the bites of wolves?

1212
02:25:41,291 --> 02:25:46,264
And how do they guard the flock of Christ by condemning all heretics with eternal anathema?

1213
02:25:46,264 --> 02:25:55,225
Everywhere, the sheep of the Catholics are nourished, and in the flourishing pastures of pure faith, the mountains leap like rams and the hills like lambs of sheep.

1214
02:25:55,225 --> 02:25:55,881
Psalm 113:4.

1215
02:25:55,881 --> 02:26:04,514
Everywhere from the rising of the sun to its setting, there is one flock and one shepherd, by whom the wolves are killed so they do not harm the flock of God.

1216
02:26:04,514 --> 02:26:09,050
And do you still not see that the building of good will is not in vain but certain?

1217
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:14,186
Every day, the house of God is built through good words, holy examples, and excellent efforts.

1218
02:26:14,186 --> 02:26:22,984
Every day, the Lord cries through the prophet: Build houses for yourselves, not those of mud that are moved by the wind, but those that remain solid like a rock.

1219
02:26:22,984 --> 02:26:23,749
Jeremiah 29:5.

1220
02:26:23,749 --> 02:26:27,137
But to you, all these things we have said seem empty and vain.

1221
02:26:27,137 --> 02:26:30,470
Your books say: The building of man is not certain, but vain.

1222
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:34,677
From the beginning, all the saints have contributed to building up the minds.

1223
02:26:34,677 --> 02:26:48,884
For example, Abel first built justice, Noah innocence, Abraham faith, Isaac sacrifice, Jacob ambition for holy things, Joseph chastity, Moses priesthood, Joshua son of Nun steadfastness of spirit, David defense of God's people, Solomon wisdom, John repentance.

1224
02:26:48,884 --> 02:26:57,190
We mentioned these few among many, so that through these, the reader might recall the others we have not mentioned and inquire whether they were humans.

1225
02:26:57,190 --> 02:27:02,108
If they were humans, how do their books say: The building of man is not certain, but vain?

1226
02:27:02,108 --> 02:27:07,026
Therefore, we now conclude with the Catholic assertions against the words of the heretics.

1227
02:27:07,026 --> 02:27:14,020
Either they were not humans because their building remains, or they were humans, and the assertion of these others has vanished.

1228
02:27:15,168 --> 02:27:27,915
But if you come against us, they say, it is not against us that you come, but against Him who said: "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. And: Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchmen stay awake in vain" (Psalm 127:1).

1229
02:27:27,915 --> 02:27:35,343
So, did he not know that it was not useful for the people of God who had this written and directed to future generations until the end of the world?

1230
02:27:35,343 --> 02:27:43,172
Therefore, you who criticize these things, remove them from the book of Psalms, because, as you say, those who read and sing these verses cannot be edified.

1231
02:27:43,172 --> 02:27:49,396
We praise, approve, confess, confirm, and sing the words of the prophet, and we explain them according to the Catholic rule.

1232
02:27:49,396 --> 02:27:56,221
From the beginning, as we said, from righteous Abel to Zechariah and John, all built the house, not with stones, but with holy examples.

1233
02:27:56,221 --> 02:28:03,097
However, unless the Lord Jesus Christ had come and built this house in which they labored, those who built it would have labored in vain.

1234
02:28:03,097 --> 02:28:10,926
For they watched over the flock diligently, but unless the Lord Jesus Christ had provided His guardianship, those who kept watch would have labored in vain.

1235
02:28:10,926 --> 02:28:15,192
Hence, it also follows: "It is in vain that you rise before the light" (Psalm 127:2).

1236
02:28:15,192 --> 02:28:19,709
For Christ is declared to be the light by the prophets, the evangelists, and the apostles.

1237
02:28:19,709 --> 02:28:24,126
All the prophets, therefore, rose before the light, that is, before the birth of Christ.

1238
02:28:24,126 --> 02:28:29,747
It was in vain for them to rise before the light; for they could not show the truth to those enduring the night.

1239
02:28:29,747 --> 02:28:35,870
But the light came and revealed the hidden things of darkness, and only then did praise begin to be for each one from God.

1240
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:40,738
Therefore, if He had not come and built the house, those who built it would have labored in vain.

1241
02:28:40,738 --> 02:28:45,205
Now, because He has come and built the house, those who build it no longer labor in vain.

1242
02:28:45,205 --> 02:28:49,421
And because He came to guard the city, those who keep watch no longer watch in vain.

1243
02:28:49,421 --> 02:28:54,540
And because the light has come and shines in the darkness, we no longer rise before the light in vain.

1244
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:59,207
And because the bread of joy has descended from heaven, we no longer eat the bread of sorrow.

1245
02:28:59,207 --> 02:29:01,114
Hence, the verse follows in the psalm.

1246
02:29:01,968 --> 02:29:15,362
"You," he said, "wake up early for no reason, you who eat the bread of sorrow. But we, who eat the bread of salvation, should build our house on the rock and stay watchful, waiting for the Lord, because we do not know the day or the hour"
(Matthew 25:13).

1247
02:29:15,362 --> 02:29:19,879
Blessed is that servant whom the Lord, when He comes
(Luke 12:37), will find watching.

1248
02:29:19,879 --> 02:29:22,295
If it seems right, let us proceed to the rest.

1249
02:29:22,295 --> 02:29:23,923
But what do these people think?

1250
02:29:23,923 --> 02:29:31,644
Do they believe they can achieve edification by their own will, when even the chosen vessel himself asserts that he could not fulfill his own will?

1251
02:29:31,644 --> 02:29:39,313
For the Apostle says about himself: "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing"
(Romans 7:19).

1252
02:29:39,313 --> 02:29:46,247
If the Apostle cannot achieve the good he wants to do, how can these people say they can reach the fruit of grace by their own will?

1253
02:29:46,247 --> 02:29:49,346
He who wants his sin to endure never hastens to repentance.

1254
02:29:49,346 --> 02:29:54,703
Grant pardon, teacher of the nations, we beseech you, and do not allow us to partake in your injuries.

1255
02:29:54,703 --> 02:30:00,586
So let us see what the Apostle wanted to do but could not, and what he was compelled to do that he did not want.

1256
02:30:00,586 --> 02:30:04,788
He wanted to speak the truth and did not want to lie at all; therefore, he lied.

1257
02:30:04,788 --> 02:30:08,360
He wanted chastity and abhorred impurity; therefore, he was defiled.

1258
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:14,453
He wanted contempt for the world and detested all worldly glory; therefore, he was vain and desirous of empty glory.

1259
02:30:14,453 --> 02:30:23,487
Finally, he wanted all that is good and utterly loathed all that is evil; therefore, he did not perform any good that he wanted to do but committed all that is most wicked.

1260
02:30:23,487 --> 02:30:31,629
For you say: The Apostle says about himself: "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing"
(Romans 7:19).

1261
02:30:31,629 --> 02:30:36,724
Do you see, I implore you, into what pit of blasphemies your blind sense has thrown you headlong?

1262
02:30:37,512 --> 02:30:56,382
You want to show that the Apostle was involved in crimes so that no one laments being a sinner, no one sighs deeply for their sins, and no one strives to wash away with tears what they have stained with their desires when they hear that the chosen vessel, the teacher of all the Churches, did not do the good he wanted to do, but the evil he did not want to do.

1263
02:30:56,382 --> 02:31:00,198
You have opened the gates, not of justice, but of iniquity to all people.

1264
02:31:00,198 --> 02:31:08,510
From the words of the Apostle, you have taken up arms against the Apostle, wanting to be teachers, even though you have never shown yourselves to be disciples.

1265
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:13,005
Attending to the sound of the letter, you have suddenly begun to be your own teachers.

1266
02:31:13,005 --> 02:31:15,828
What do we do now, who cannot endure your blasphemies?

1267
02:31:15,828 --> 02:31:20,585
If we remain silent, you seem to have spoken rightly, and not only spoken but also written.

1268
02:31:20,585 --> 02:31:28,478
We speak, with the Lord's help, fleeing the glory of men, teaching the ignorant, instructing the eager, delighting the knowledgeable, and exposing you.

1269
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:36,476
The scripture of your book is such that, what is worse, it does not die with you who are dying, and it creeps like a cancer to overturn the unsuspecting.

1270
02:31:36,476 --> 02:31:39,665
Let us see what follows in the book written from your vanity.

1271
02:31:39,665 --> 02:31:42,905
These are the words of the Apostle; we add nothing of our own.

1272
02:31:42,905 --> 02:31:49,858
He says about himself: "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing" (Romans 7:19).

1273
02:31:49,858 --> 02:31:59,319
Arius placed an epigram of this sort in the third book of his, saying:
We have received the words of the Son of God, and we believe them to be true, we also confess them to be true.

1274
02:31:59,319 --> 02:32:08,049
He says: "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28), and: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30), because "I am in the Father, and the Father is in me" (John 14:11).

1275
02:32:08,049 --> 02:32:29,272
He did not want to read; for he could have joined these two, that is, "The Father is greater than I" and "I and the Father are one"; and by joining these two, he would have found the Son of Man and the Son of God. For all kinds of suffering, removed from the Deity, could only apply to the Son of Man. For God is neither lesser nor greater, but He is always the same, lacking neither increase nor decrease.

1276
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:38,604
Never grows by adding, never lessens by subtracting; it remains the same before and after all things, and in everything past, present, and future, it stays unchanged.

1277
02:32:38,604 --> 02:32:41,107
Consider these words as if said in another work.

1278
02:32:41,107 --> 02:32:50,958
We have mentioned that the accursed Arius spoke this in the chapter of his third book, following the order of the Predestined:
The words are the Apostle's; we have added nothing of our own.

1279
02:32:50,958 --> 02:32:55,546
He himself says:
Not what I want to do, this good I do, but what I hate, this evil I do.

1280
02:32:55,546 --> 02:32:56,171
Romans 7:15.

1281
02:32:56,171 --> 02:32:57,422
Now we seek your wisdom.

1282
02:32:57,422 --> 02:33:04,251
We read that the Apostle said:
I live, but not I, Christ lives in me; and the life I live now in the flesh, I live by faith in God.

1283
02:33:04,251 --> 02:33:05,032
Galatians 2:20.

1284
02:33:05,032 --> 02:33:06,075
What do you say now?

1285
02:33:06,075 --> 02:33:07,795
Was this man carnal or spiritual?

1286
02:33:07,795 --> 02:33:12,747
If you say carnal, you will be refuted, for he exclaims:
I live, but not I, Christ lives in me.

1287
02:33:12,747 --> 02:33:16,605
If you agree that he was spiritual, you will explain this passage with us.

1288
02:33:16,605 --> 02:33:22,755
You will find the head of this passage in the speech which begins:
We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.

1289
02:33:22,755 --> 02:33:23,381
Romans 7:14.

1290
02:33:23,381 --> 02:33:30,783
If you are carnal, blessed Apostle, how do you rebuke the carnal, saying:
And I, brothers, could not speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal.

1291
02:33:30,783 --> 02:33:31,930
First Corinthians 3:1.

1292
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:35,839
And again:
When there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal?

1293
02:33:35,839 --> 02:33:36,986
First Corinthians 3:3.

1294
02:33:36,986 --> 02:33:40,166
And again:
As many of us as are spiritual, we think this way.

1295
02:33:40,166 --> 02:33:51,477
But we are taught by your writings, man of God, that not only were you spiritual, and rightly said that your conversation was in heaven while placed on earth; but we are also taught that your disciples were spiritual.

1296
02:33:51,477 --> 02:33:58,462
For you say to them:
If anyone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.

1297
02:33:58,462 --> 02:33:59,192
Galatians 6:1.

1298
02:33:59,192 --> 02:34:03,518
What then do you now say to us:
We know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.

1299
02:34:03,518 --> 02:34:04,144
Romans 7:14?

1300
02:34:04,144 --> 02:34:11,702
To this, he himself will deign to give us an answer:
I became as one carnal to those who were carnal, so that I might gain those who were carnal.

1301
02:34:11,702 --> 02:34:15,976
The truth has revealed itself to us, and falsehood has been excluded by the truth.

1302
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,415
The spiritual teacher took on the role of a worldly person.

1303
02:34:20,415 --> 02:34:25,517
To avoid seeming offensive and pushing his listener away, he rebukes himself to correct another.

1304
02:34:25,517 --> 02:36:03,469
He even mentions this elsewhere, saying: "Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted?" Second Corinthians 11:7.
So what then?
He says, "I am worldly: who are you? I am the one who was sold under sin" Romans 7:14.
Apostle, were you sold under sin, you who, once redeemed by the blood of Christ, redeemed countless people for God through Christ?
It is clear, therefore, that the Apostle did not want to declare his own role here, but that of another, a worldly man.
He is the one sold under sin, who has not yet been redeemed by the blood of Christ, who is still worldly; and so it is said: "What I do, I do not understand" Romans 7:15.
For he does not understand that his actions are against his salvation; although he is a Gentile, he wants good things to come to him, to achieve good, to possess good, to acquire the good of his salvation, the good of his life: but he does not do the good he wants, but the evil he hates, he does.
He hates death but performs the deeds of death; he hates danger, but his actions are full of danger; he hates all evil, but does what he hates.
Why?
Because, he says, "Good does not dwell in my flesh," that is, the true God does not dwell in me.
The desire is present in me; it is certain that I want the true God, but I do not find this good that I want Romans 7:18.
For all these things happen to me, a worldly man, a man sold under sin, a man who does not understand what I do, a man who does not do the good he wants but does the evil he does not want, a man in whose flesh good does not dwell; all these things happen to me, so I do not find the good to complete it.
However, I delight in the law of God according to my inner man Romans 7:22; that is, my inner man, in which my intellect resides, delights in the law of God, which says that one invisible God must be worshipped.

1305
02:36:03,576 --> 02:36:06,960
Although I am fleshly, I know that wood and stone cannot be gods.

1306
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:13,469
But I see another law opposing my understanding, conflicting with the law of my mind, which proves that these cannot be gods.

1307
02:36:13,469 --> 02:36:20,758
However, this fleshly law conflicts with the law of my mind, taking me captive under the law of sin, which is not in my mind but in my body.

1308
02:36:20,758 --> 02:36:23,570
I am led by my body, even when my mind does not agree.

1309
02:36:23,570 --> 02:36:24,768
Wretched man that I am!

1310
02:36:24,768 --> 02:36:26,694
Paul does not say this about himself.

1311
02:36:26,694 --> 02:36:29,089
For he was not wretched, but blessed and holy.

1312
02:36:29,089 --> 02:36:30,287
Wretched man that I am!

1313
02:36:30,287 --> 02:36:32,526
Who will rescue me from this body of death?

1314
02:36:32,526 --> 02:36:34,973
The grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1315
02:36:34,973 --> 02:36:40,909
(Romans 7:24)
So the grace of holy baptism will come and make this fleshly man spiritual, and redeem him from sin.

1316
02:36:40,909 --> 02:37:40,164
He will no longer say, "I do not understand what I do," for he will not do what he hates but will do what he wants, which is good. He knows that now good dwells in his body, that is, the Holy Spirit, through whom he both wills and finds the power to act according to his good will. Now he is secure and delights in the law of God according to his inner self, because he does not see another law in his body. He has only the law of Christ in him, which does not conflict with the law of his mind and does not lead him captive under the law of sin but leads him free to eternal life.
And now he is not a wretched man but a happy man, because he has escaped all these evils and found all these good things. If you ask who granted this to me: The grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. To avoid any ambiguity in this explanation, lest it be thought that the Apostle said this about himself, he puts it in a reproachful way, saying: "Therefore, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh, the law of sin." (Romans 7:25)
So there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.

1317
02:37:40,164 --> 02:37:47,714
(Romans 8:1) This means, if I, who am an Apostle, am considered fleshly, will there be no condemnation for those who live according to the flesh?

1318
02:37:47,714 --> 02:37:54,067
And he added: "The law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death." (Romans 8:2)

1319
02:37:54,744 --> 02:37:59,999
Hence, in another place, it says: When you were slaves to sin, you were free from righteousness.

1320
02:37:59,999 --> 02:38:03,666
But now, having been freed from sin, you have become slaves of God.

1321
02:38:03,666 --> 02:38:04,433
(Romans 6:20).

1322
02:38:04,433 --> 02:38:09,852
However, God boasts in the servitude of all, because His servitude cannot be compared to any other.

1323
02:38:09,852 --> 02:38:19,815
For all other forms of servitude are known to be forced, but God's servitude, unless it is voluntary, cannot stand, according to what is written: The Father draws no one unwillingly.

1324
02:38:19,815 --> 02:38:25,125
Hence the prophet, filled with the Holy Spirit, cries out: I will confess to the Lord by my will.

1325
02:38:25,125 --> 02:38:25,836
(Psalm 27:7).

1326
02:38:25,836 --> 02:38:28,136
And again: I will freely sacrifice to you.

1327
02:38:28,136 --> 02:38:28,847
(Psalm 54:8).

1328
02:38:28,847 --> 02:38:44,448
But contrary to all these things, they present to us a book filled with blind ambiguities, repeating the same points and saying again:
Only the predestined are called; for the grace of God precedes the will of man; God is prior in man's goodness, but man is found last in all goodness.

1329
02:38:44,448 --> 02:38:48,116
Give the first place to God, so that you may eliminate human pride.

1330
02:38:48,116 --> 02:39:06,345
But if you wish to nourish pride in men, it appears you seek the ruin of the human race, teaching that in good works, God does not precede, but man's will, suggesting to God to do good, as if He would not do good unless they had told Him; when it is clear that God, without anyone suggesting or asking, grants all good things to men.

1331
02:39:06,345 --> 02:39:16,253
For the Apostle does not say: When we begged, and asked, and ran, and kept watch, but, When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God; not by our will, but by the death of His Son.

1332
02:39:16,253 --> 02:39:17,019
(Romans 5:10).

1333
02:39:17,019 --> 02:39:18,114
Where is man's will?

1334
02:39:18,114 --> 02:39:18,935
It is excluded.

1335
02:39:18,935 --> 02:39:25,888
Therefore, not everyone who wills is saved; because if everyone who willed were saved, no one could be excluded from salvation.

1336
02:39:25,888 --> 02:39:29,281
Thus, every man wants to be saved, but not every man is saved.

1337
02:39:29,281 --> 02:39:30,978
For he is saved whom God wills.

1338
02:39:30,978 --> 02:39:37,000
Certainly, I say, whom God wills; so that, with man's will excluded, He may fully manifest His complete grace.

1339
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:40,503
Blessed are our ancestors, who knew not the use of such a crime.

1340
02:39:41,544 --> 02:39:48,216
Who would ever suspect that good things could be done against goodness and that the weapons of justice could be used against justice?

1341
02:39:48,216 --> 02:41:27,093
"Only those predestined are called," he says. And we say with you: Only those predestined are called. For He who commanded His disciples to call all nations, saying, "Go and baptize all the nations" Matthew 28:19, predestined everyone before His coming. Therefore, He predestined all nations to life because He called all nations to life. Whoever comes will credit divine mercy for both predestining and calling; but whoever does not come should blame their own neglect for both rejecting and refusing. For it is not divine predestination that results in human destruction, nor is it God's will when the devil's will is fulfilled. These wills are indeed hostile and contrary to each other, and one cannot be fulfilled without contempt for the other. If some are not called to life, in those who are not called, the devil's will is fulfilled. And I wonder with what face you enter the Church if you are not afraid to say that someone is subject to the devil's will; for it is shown that the devil's will is fulfilled in those who do not want all men to attain salvation. Just as it is believed that His will is fulfilled in those He wants to save, so in those He does not want, the devil's will is fulfilled. But the good God wants everyone to be good; and here you suffer from error because not all whom He wants to be good are good. You usually say: Those who are not good are bad because God repels them from Himself, so that those who sin appear to be sinning not by their own fault. If you suffer from this error because God's will is not fulfilled, why do you not rather pass judgment on the sinners, whereby God is praised for His patient mercy, and man is blamed for the impatience of his own will? You say: "So man defeats God." Man indeed defeats God if God wants him to be good, and he is not good. What do you observe here? Do you see God and man wrestling, so that you say such things? If you saw them wrestling, you would rightly assign victory to one party.

1342
02:41:27,144 --> 02:41:37,226
Now, since the Savior of humanity, acting like a doctor, offers advice not for his own benefit but for our salvation, he commands certain actions to grant us life and forbids others to prevent death.

1343
02:41:37,226 --> 02:41:45,028
If you listen, you will credit the Savior for your life; if you ignore him, you will blame your own laziness when you start to feel the torments of death.

1344
02:41:45,028 --> 02:41:51,463
But if you claim that a patient's death is due to the doctor's incompetence, we assert that the doctor is perfect in every way.

1345
02:41:51,463 --> 02:43:13,288
And if you say that death happens by his will, he himself says to you, quoting Ezekiel thirty-three eleven: "I do not desire the death of the sinner."
If you are worthy to ask him, and you say: "If you do not want this, show what you do want"; he will answer: "I want him to turn from his ways and live."
Hence, we also make a universal statement against your cunning arguments. If a man can sin against God's will, how much more can he end sin with God's will? If a man can desire what God does not want, how much more can he desire what God wants? If a man can perish against God's will, how much more can he be saved with God's will? If a man could fulfill the devil's will against God's will, how much more can he fulfill God's will with God's will? If a man could reject God's predestination, how much more can he fulfill God's predestination by his own conversion?
Therefore, God said: "This I do not want, that I do want"; meaning, "I do not want the death of the dying, I want him to turn from his ways and live." What he said he wants, he predestined, for he predestined nothing unwillingly; what he said he does not want, he abandoned.
If a man can desire and do what God does not want, how much more can he desire and do what God wants? This is about human destruction and salvation. God wants us to be saved, the devil wants us to perish. If human destruction, which the devil wants, can happen through our negligence, how much more can human liberation, which God wants, happen through the diligence of good and faithful will?
Seventeen. But your book says: "The grace of God precedes the will of man."

1346
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:17,918
We say: Not only does God's grace come before, but it also follows the will of man.

1347
02:43:17,918 --> 02:43:21,749
Before we show how it precedes and follows, let's clarify what we mean.

1348
02:43:21,749 --> 02:43:29,843
You say: God's grace comes before man's will, so when someone hears such a worthy and true statement, they might not pay attention to what comes next.

1349
02:43:29,843 --> 02:43:32,810
Your explanation suggests that man's will should cease.

1350
02:43:32,810 --> 02:43:36,210
Before he even begins to want, God seems to arouse him to zeal.

1351
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:42,523
He should wait for grace to come first, which drags the unwilling, compels the reluctant, and holds back the fleeing.

1352
02:43:42,523 --> 02:43:49,105
Man wallows in filth, becomes the dregs of sewers, is submerged in the whirlpools of crimes, and feels secure in his vice.

1353
02:43:49,105 --> 02:43:52,343
For if preceding grace comes, man will turn away from crime.

1354
02:43:52,343 --> 02:43:56,767
Man will not be ahead of God's grace, but God's grace will be ahead of man's will.

1355
02:43:56,767 --> 02:43:58,980
We have revealed this intention of yours.

1356
02:43:58,980 --> 02:44:03,890
Now, it is necessary to demonstrate with clear assertions what Catholics hold against this.

1357
02:44:03,890 --> 02:44:07,127
Remember that we agree: God's grace comes before man's will.

1358
02:44:07,127 --> 02:44:09,447
We have said: It both precedes and follows.

1359
02:44:09,447 --> 02:44:16,084
It precedes because the Son of God came to save the whole world from death, not waiting for us to ask, plead, or even want.

1360
02:44:16,084 --> 02:44:20,185
And as we have already said, for man to ascend to God, God descended to man.

1361
02:44:20,185 --> 02:44:31,084
He came to invite the hungry to a feast, the thirsty to a fountain, the wretched to strength, the poor to riches, the sad to joy, the sold to redemption, the slaves to freedom, and the captives to rest.

1362
02:44:31,084 --> 02:44:33,836
Here we teach that God's grace precedes man's will.

1363
02:44:33,836 --> 02:44:36,372
Now let us see how it follows what it preceded.

1364
02:44:36,372 --> 02:44:40,419
The grace that preceded shows what to ask for, whom to ask, and how to ask.

1365
02:44:40,419 --> 02:44:43,332
It shows what to seek, how to seek, and where to seek.

1366
02:44:43,332 --> 02:44:46,570
It shows what to knock on, where to knock, and how to knock.

1367
02:44:46,570 --> 02:44:48,566
It excludes no one from this inquiry.

1368
02:44:48,566 --> 02:44:58,548
Not only does it exclude no one, but it also universally invites everyone: For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened (Matthew 7:7).

1369
02:44:59,736 --> 02:45:03,951
And he said again:
If a son asks his father for bread, will he give him a stone?

1370
02:45:03,951 --> 02:45:06,744
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?

1371
02:45:06,744 --> 02:45:15,122
If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?

1372
02:45:15,122 --> 02:45:15,912
Matthew 7:9-11.

1373
02:45:15,912 --> 02:45:17,230
Indeed, to those who ask.

1374
02:45:17,230 --> 02:45:30,245
As I mentioned before, because the grace of God precedes the will of man, now let's say together that the will of man precedes the grace of God; not through pride, but by asking; not by exalting, but by seeking; not by struggling, but by knocking.

1375
02:45:30,245 --> 02:45:42,469
For unless someone wills from faith, no one receives the gift of divine grace through baptism; unless they will to believe from faith, they will not partake in mercy; unless they desire from faith, they cannot reach the gift of God.

1376
02:45:42,469 --> 02:45:47,317
For if a Gentile coming to Christ says: I do not want to be baptized, he cannot be baptized.

1377
02:45:47,317 --> 02:45:52,534
If a delinquent coming to repentance says: I do not want to be reconciled, he cannot be reconciled.

1378
02:45:52,534 --> 02:46:01,017
The priestly judgment examines both cases, and cannot grant grace unless it learns their complete will from their own mouth: or if he dared, you yourselves know.

1379
02:46:01,017 --> 02:46:02,809
Let us consider something greater.

1380
02:46:02,809 --> 02:46:09,290
If the force of illness takes away the ability to speak, the abundance of God's grace cannot be administered to the silent.

1381
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:13,716
For unless the secret of the mind is declared by the tongue, it cannot attain grace.

1382
02:46:13,716 --> 02:46:19,934
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation Romans 10:10.

1383
02:46:19,934 --> 02:46:29,998
Therefore, as the Lord says: Everyone who asks receives Matthew 7:7, it seems that the will of the one asking must precede, so that the grace of the one giving may be granted to those asking.

1384
02:46:29,998 --> 02:46:44,752
And lest I seem to leave you wavering, you who attribute all good to grace, do not struggle with me: not only do I say that grace preceded when God, not disdaining to be joined to man, came to us who were not asking; but even to this day, the will of God precedes the will of man.

1385
02:46:44,752 --> 02:46:47,492
For He wishes us to be saved, and we do not wish it.

1386
02:46:48,336 --> 02:46:57,590
Woe to me and those like me, because every day, God's grace, invitation, will, compunction, promise of eternal joy, and fear of eternal punishment come before our own wills.

1387
02:46:57,590 --> 02:47:04,384
Every day, God's grace comes before our wills, full of countless supports, but our will does not follow all these gifts of God.

1388
02:47:04,384 --> 02:47:05,829
So what does your book say?

1389
02:47:05,829 --> 02:47:07,487
God's will precedes man's will.

1390
02:47:07,487 --> 02:47:08,503
And what do we say?

1391
02:47:08,503 --> 02:47:10,055
It both precedes and follows.

1392
02:47:10,055 --> 02:47:14,655
So why did we labor to speak, since you say it only precedes and deny that it follows?

1393
02:47:14,655 --> 02:47:24,338
But what you say, that it precedes, you say so that a man in sin may let his will rest and wait for grace to come to him first, lest he begin to put his own will before God's grace.

1394
02:47:24,338 --> 02:47:37,070
But we Catholics abhor this and say: Grace goes before the will of men by showing eternal life in which they may delight, showing the eternal fire in which they may be terrified, so that they may be called back from the pleasures of sins.

1395
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:42,099
Grace, I say, comes before our wills every day, but our will, which is worse, does not follow.

1396
02:47:42,099 --> 02:47:52,691
This is why we weep praying, groan repenting, because we do not follow the one who goes before, we disdain the one inviting, and neither do we honor the father as sons nor fear the lord as servants.

1397
02:47:52,691 --> 02:48:03,069
Hence, he himself speaks to us through the prophet: "A son honors his father, and a servant fears his lord. If I am a Lord, where is my fear? If I am a father, where is my honor?" (Malachi 1:6).

1398
02:48:03,069 --> 02:48:06,867
We now ask, does the preceding grace require something from us, or not?

1399
02:48:06,867 --> 02:48:08,419
Without a doubt, it requires.

1400
02:48:08,419 --> 02:48:09,542
What does it require?

1401
02:48:09,542 --> 02:48:12,270
Certainly what you yourselves say, the will itself.

1402
02:48:12,270 --> 02:48:13,661
Therefore, grace precedes.

1403
02:48:13,661 --> 02:48:14,410
What is grace?

1404
02:48:14,410 --> 02:48:16,764
That what you ask for, you receive for free.

1405
02:48:16,764 --> 02:48:33,615
And so he did not say: "Buy and it will be given to you," but: "Ask and it will be given to you."
And so that the simplicity of the brothers may more clearly recognize this meaning, let us offer a comparison.
Wisdom was shown to Solomon: behold grace; now listen to what Solomon himself, to whom it was shown, says.

1406
02:48:34,632 --> 02:50:17,088
"I have fallen in love with her beauty," he said. "I sought to make her mine and ran after her, but the more I pursued, the more she moved away from me." Wisdom 8:2. Doesn't it seem like a beautiful girl enticing and provoking a lover in a race?
Why mention this now? Listen to the grace of God. Let's consider the daughter of a father. This daughter, know, O man, is shown to you by her father with clear signs, so you may see her and become a lover of her beauty. He shows you how great her riches are, how great her love is, how great her kindness is, and how great her faith is. She is beautiful, rich, faithful, wise, and the daughter of the highest king.
Her father has shown her to you, O man, so that, becoming her lover, you might ask for her in marriage, and from her, bear children to God. Just as he who said: "Even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the gospel." First Corinthians 4:15. From this union, Paul gave us birth to God, certainly through the grace of Christ, whose lover he became, asserting that he found all sufferings sweet for the love of Christ.
Take, therefore, from the example of the flesh a comparison with the girl, so you may better reach the spiritual sense. The girl is shown to you by the father: behold, the grace of the father precedes your will. Now you begin to desire. The grace of him who shows her is indeed shown, so you may consider how much you ought to believe he loves you, because to make you his own, he showed you his daughter, beautiful, rich, wise, so you might take her in marriage.
Behold, the grace preceding the will, the grace stimulating the heart, the grace enticing the mind, the grace awakening the sleeper. What do you now order the father to do for someone who does not ask, seek, desire, or show the warmth of love? Will he take his daughter and join her to you, who are preoccupied with disgust or surrounded by other loves? He does not do this.

1407
02:50:17,088 --> 02:50:29,051
But unless you seek it like silver, and unless you search for it like treasure, and unless you want it with faith, and unless you run with faith, and unless you show your true affection, you will not truly perceive it.

1408
02:50:29,051 --> 02:50:39,972
It is enough for you that, though you are a beggar, and it is rich, it enriches you with its wealth; you are baseborn, it is the daughter of the highest empire, and it ennobles you with its nobility.

1409
02:50:39,972 --> 02:50:48,039
But listen carefully to what her father says to her lovers, anxiously:
Whoever loves, he says, father and mother more than me, is not worthy of me.

1410
02:50:48,039 --> 02:50:57,643
Matthew chapter ten, verse thirty-seven:
He did not say: Whoever is poor, or who is baseborn, or who is wretched; but whoever loves anything more than me, is not worthy of me.

1411
02:50:57,643 --> 02:51:00,607
Oh, grace that precedes the will, demanding only love!

1412
02:51:00,607 --> 02:51:04,009
Oh man, love and receive; but if you love, show it with deeds.

1413
02:51:04,009 --> 02:51:18,332
Everyone who loves, wants, desires, asks, watches, runs, hastens, strives through friends, through children, through family, through servants, through himself opportunely, inopportunely, with entreaties, promises, fixed agreement, and complete evidence of love.

1414
02:51:18,332 --> 02:51:28,814
And to open your eyes, you who think you can be united with divine grace unwillingly and reluctantly, what is it when the father gives it, through his household grace is expressed beforehand?

1415
02:51:28,814 --> 02:51:39,186
It is asked of him who receives it, how it comes, if he renounces all worldly loves, all the enemy's pomp;
who unless he expresses his will in words, does he receive the grace he asked for?

1416
02:51:39,186 --> 02:51:43,083
What then does the man want, what does he run for, what does he desire?

1417
02:51:43,083 --> 02:51:45,388
To obtain grace; and what does he promise?

1418
02:51:45,388 --> 02:51:47,912
I renounce all the devil's pomp and pleasures.

1419
02:51:47,912 --> 02:51:59,382
He shows that he does not want what he wanted, and begins to want what he did not want; and then he begins to take pleasure in the participation of grace, by which he is called both rich and the son of a king.

1420
02:51:59,382 --> 02:52:03,004
Behold, we show you the grace of God both preceding and following.

1421
02:52:03,004 --> 02:52:11,126
It precedes, because it calls, because it provokes, because it invites you to come; it follows, because when you come, and want, and ask, it grants.

1422
02:52:11,126 --> 02:52:13,431
Let us see now where your intention leads.

1423
02:52:13,431 --> 02:52:16,833
For the accursed book written from your vanity says: Eighteen.

1424
02:52:17,712 --> 02:52:25,834
We did not reconcile with God by asking or begging, but while we were still enemies, we were reconciled to God, not by our will, but by the death of His Son.

1425
02:52:25,834 --> 02:52:33,853
So, you command that people should not ask God to be reconciled to Him, but rather become His enemies, so that the words of the Apostle Paul may hold true.

1426
02:52:33,853 --> 02:52:41,199
You also say that people should not rely on their own efforts because reconciliation with God is not by our will, but by the death of His Son.

1427
02:52:41,199 --> 02:52:45,751
Therefore, according to you, those who were enemies of God must be reconciled and saved?

1428
02:52:45,751 --> 02:53:20,258
Those who crucified Christ must be saved, and those who said, "We do not want this man," must be freed? But those who were friends and willing to give their lives for His love will be cursed by the Most High?
You are proving yourselves to be blaspheming more sharply than all heretics, who, not wanting to follow the right path, have handed themselves over to winding errors. The Apostle does not invite our enmity towards God, but our love. He says: "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him" (Romans 5:8-9).

1429
02:53:20,258 --> 02:53:30,036
Therefore, He demonstrates His love through this work within us, so that by offering our love to Him completely, we may seem to repay with the vow of love what we cannot do by our strength.

1430
02:53:30,036 --> 02:53:33,450
For God's love benefits us; if we love God, we cannot benefit Him.

1431
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:38,417
God needs nothing, is exalted by no one honoring Him, and is diminished by no one despising Him.

1432
02:53:38,417 --> 02:53:40,590
So why does He demonstrate His love in us?

1433
02:53:40,590 --> 02:53:51,609
Certainly, so that we may say: If when we were enemies, He loved us so much that He allowed His only Son to be killed for our salvation, how much more now, having been reconciled, will He save us through His life?

1434
02:53:51,609 --> 02:53:57,610
Hence, excluding your special defense, He introduced general grace, saying: Considering this, that one died for all.

1435
02:53:58,128 --> 02:55:47,232
And he added: "Therefore, all have died because He died for all, so that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for all" Second Corinthians 5:14-15.
At this point, your perplexing book comes to mind and says:
"You say, whenever you read 'all,' you want it to be understood generally, even though 'all' often means a part. For instance, when it says: 'All have turned away' Psalm 14:3; not everyone had turned away. And: 'Every man is a liar' Psalm 116:11; not every man is a liar, because we read of someone: 'He was a truthful man.' So, a large part seems to signify all, although it is clear that not all are meant."
"We find no place in your book without blasphemies. What is this assertion paying attention to? It aims to make those who agree with you say that Christ did not suffer for all. If you do not want to understand it this way, then the Apostle did not name 'all' here for a part, but he mentioned 'all' generally."
"So correct your book, because Christ suffered for all. He hurries to help all people. He calls all, He invites all: whoever is saved will credit the grace of God who calls, invites, and helps; whoever is not saved will blame themselves for neglecting, despising, and abandoning. For all good things are given to us by the grace of the Lord when we ask; all bad things, however, are inflicted on us by the devil when we despise God."
"For the devil cannot exercise his power over those who live by divine protections. Can a captive subject the vessels of his conqueror? No one, says the Lord, can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house" Matthew 12:29.
"You consider the enemy strong; but we believe he is bound and subject to the trophy of the cross. We show his deceit, but also his traps exposed. Can the defeated prevail to touch the one armed with the sign of victory? Can they invade with arrows the one shielded by the Lord, clothed with the armor of faith, and protected by the helmet of hope and salvation" Ephesians 6:16-17?

1436
02:55:47,232 --> 02:55:51,479
A person is not overcome by the devil unless they have strayed from their protector.

1437
02:55:51,479 --> 02:55:57,141
The Apostle says, "Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7).

1438
02:55:57,141 --> 02:56:00,125
The invisible enemy is defeated by the invisible protector.

1439
02:56:00,125 --> 02:56:10,237
But your misguided book contradicts this and dares to claim that the devil has the power to drag people against their will, even those whom Christ has redeemed with His blood and made children of God.

1440
02:56:10,237 --> 02:56:16,506
You say: With closed eyes, you overlook the snares of the enemy, insisting that human will has some power to acquire virtue.

1441
02:56:16,506 --> 02:56:23,989
You fail to consider how much harm God suffers daily, how many acts of chastity are ruined by the devil, and how many cravings for crimes there are.

1442
02:56:23,989 --> 02:56:29,703
If you saw these things, we wouldn't need to labor to show you the damages to virtues and the victories of vices.

1443
02:56:29,703 --> 02:56:35,770
Tell me, please, the damages that God suffers daily-do they occur because the devil wins, or because humans neglect Him?

1444
02:56:35,770 --> 02:56:41,433
If you say the devil wins, we reject your blasphemy; if you say humans neglect Him, our assertion stands strong.

1445
02:56:41,433 --> 02:56:44,315
The devil is neither a lord, nor a creator, nor a father.

1446
02:56:44,315 --> 02:56:46,641
However, God is our Lord, Creator, and Father.

1447
02:56:46,641 --> 02:56:49,776
He joined His victorious body to ours to overcome our frailty.

1448
02:56:49,776 --> 02:56:54,326
He mixed His blood with ours to calm the heat of our natural fervor with His divine blood.

1449
02:56:54,326 --> 02:56:59,028
He anointed us with the power of His chrism so we could defeat the devil fighting against us.

1450
02:56:59,028 --> 02:57:07,978
He promises to protect us with the shield of His goodwill: "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name" (Psalm 91:14).

1451
02:57:07,978 --> 02:57:20,618
Hence, the prophet says of Him: "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High" (Psalm 91:1), that neither the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction, nor the demon at noonday can harm him, and so on.

1452
02:57:20,618 --> 02:57:27,343
Therefore, it is clear from these signs that the devil has power only when he finds us negligent, when he finds us sleeping in faith.

1453
02:57:28,152 --> 02:57:31,982
For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Romans 10:13.

1454
02:57:31,982 --> 02:57:38,724
But what good is it to show that humanity is freed from the devil by God's victory if people are still captured by their own faults?

1455
02:57:38,724 --> 02:57:41,074
We are faced with another point of opposition.

1456
02:57:41,074 --> 02:57:46,130
Their book says:
Through the transgression of the first man, freedom of choice was lost by mankind.

1457
02:57:46,130 --> 02:57:52,873
But we say: Through the transgression of the first man, freedom of choice was revealed, allowing man to want what God does not want.

1458
02:57:52,873 --> 02:57:55,682
If freedom of choice was lost, then how are we sinners?

1459
02:57:55,682 --> 02:58:01,556
We are not sinners for any other reason than because we want what God does not want and do not want what God wants.

1460
02:58:01,556 --> 02:58:04,620
We commit what He forbids and refuse to do what He commands.

1461
02:58:04,620 --> 02:58:07,378
How can we do such great evil if we do it unwillingly?

1462
02:58:07,378 --> 02:58:12,180
Someone else must be acting through us; therefore, the law should be given to them, not to us.

1463
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:18,309
The law is not given to the sword so that it kills a man; instead, the law is given to the one who kills with the sword.

1464
02:58:18,309 --> 02:58:24,847
For the sword is the same whether it kills or does not kill; it neither earns praise by being still nor incurs blame by killing.

1465
02:58:24,847 --> 02:58:31,946
If we are being driven and not acting ourselves, then we are excluded from sins when we transgress and excluded from faith when we believe.

1466
02:58:31,946 --> 02:58:33,836
Thus, defeated, they turn to slander.

1467
02:58:33,836 --> 02:58:40,272
Their book says: You are reviving the Pelagian heresy by saying that through freedom of choice, humans can put an end to sins.

1468
02:58:40,272 --> 02:58:41,498
Matthew 7:7; John 16:24.

1469
02:58:41,498 --> 02:58:44,154
The Church did not condemn Pelagius for this reason.

1470
02:58:44,154 --> 02:58:48,495
It accused him of exaggerating freedom of choice so much that he rejected God's help.

1471
02:58:48,495 --> 02:58:55,493
But we say: Through freedom of choice, we commit every sin; but from every sin, we are freed by God's grace with the agreement of choice.

1472
02:58:55,493 --> 02:59:02,490
We have taught from this passage that God does not give His grace to those who do not ask for it, for He said: Ask and you shall receive.

1473
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:11,122
It has been shown to us what to ask for without asking; it has been shown to us what to seek without seeking; it has been shown to us what to knock for without knocking.

1474
02:59:12,144 --> 02:59:18,052
If we don't ask, we won't receive; if we don't seek, we won't find; if we don't knock, it won't be opened for us.

1475
02:59:18,052 --> 02:59:23,595
For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.

1476
02:59:23,595 --> 02:59:26,366
This is from the book of Matthew, chapter 7, verse 8.

1477
02:59:26,366 --> 02:59:34,576
Therefore, free will is so strong in us that it can obey God; yet it is weakened in us so that it can even despise God, from whom this very freedom is given.

1478
02:59:34,576 --> 02:59:38,916
Indeed, this freedom was given so that only the devil would be despised through it.

1479
02:59:38,916 --> 02:59:48,381
For if free will had ceased because of the transgression of the first man, then the law would certainly have ceased, which can only speak to one who can both despise it and hear it.

1480
02:59:48,381 --> 02:59:57,374
But the law did not cease, whether it is natural law, through which Abel, Enoch, Noah, Shem and Japheth, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and others pleased God.

1481
02:59:57,374 --> 02:59:59,675
They pleased by the instinct of natural law.

1482
02:59:59,675 --> 03:00:06,787
On the other hand, those displeased, whether those whom the whirlpool of the flood swallowed or those whom the sulfurous flame consumed.

1483
03:00:06,787 --> 03:00:13,898
For neither would those have pleased, nor these displeased, if natural law had not existed, and if freedom of will had not been in them.

1484
03:00:13,898 --> 03:00:14,892
What then do we do?

1485
03:00:14,892 --> 03:00:18,343
We do not avoid criticism unless we say it is only by God's grace.

1486
03:00:18,343 --> 03:01:04,724
For their book shouts, saying: "You exclude grace through free will." Either we are freed by free will, or we are rescued by the grace of God. Choose what you will say. If you give everything to grace, we are one; if to free will, know that we cannot agree with you. Listen, you critics, and hear what you fear. We say free will exists where divine grace is present. For without the grace of God, there is no free will, but captive will. For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. This is from the book of Second Corinthians, chapter 3, verse 17.
We do not hand over this freedom to human pride, but we define it by the grace of God and His glory: which grants so much that some do more good than is commanded, and others do more evil than is forbidden. For the hand that can rob the clothed, which God forbids, can also clothe the naked, which God commands. What do you say?

1487
03:01:05,352 --> 03:01:07,984
One hand clothes the naked and strips the clothed.

1488
03:01:07,984 --> 03:01:11,143
It's blamed when it undresses because it could have dressed.

1489
03:01:11,143 --> 03:01:14,354
It's praised when it dresses because it could have undressed.

1490
03:01:14,354 --> 03:01:20,040
Take away the free will of both acts, and it neither incurs blame from vice nor acquires praise from virtue.

1491
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:24,041
To explain free will, the choice is in the soul, and freedom is in the body.

1492
03:01:24,041 --> 03:01:27,779
Freedom without choice does not sin, while choice without freedom does.

1493
03:01:27,779 --> 03:01:34,360
For example, if you lock up a thief, you take away his freedom to steal but not his choice; you bind his hands, not his mind.

1494
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:43,679
If someone becomes blind after indulging in lustful looks, their freedom of sight is bound, but their choice remains intact; for desire is exercised by the decision of the soul.

1495
03:01:43,679 --> 03:01:51,155
Therefore, Christ calls someone who looks at a woman with lust an adulterer (Matthew 5:28); they have choice, even if they don't have freedom.

1496
03:01:51,155 --> 03:02:00,632
They are guilty through their choice without action; the perfect will is accounted as the deed by a just judge; someone is said to have done everything if they did what they could.

1497
03:02:00,632 --> 03:02:05,528
The body is prevented by the impossibility of the act because the soul's choice is not bound.

1498
03:02:05,528 --> 03:02:06,739
So, what does grace do?

1499
03:02:06,739 --> 03:02:11,372
It does not take away free will, but it heals, amplifies, adorns, instructs, and exalts.

1500
03:02:11,372 --> 03:02:14,215
However, it exalts not the unwilling, but the willing.

1501
03:02:14,215 --> 03:02:18,795
For unless you want it from faith and run from faith, you cannot be liberated by grace.

1502
03:02:18,795 --> 03:02:24,218
Let us therefore be certain that grace does not reject us when we sin, but we reject grace when we sin.

1503
03:02:24,218 --> 03:02:29,009
The judging authority considers one of two things: either rejecting grace or despising man.

1504
03:02:29,009 --> 03:02:31,325
If grace rejects, it frees the man from sin.

1505
03:02:31,325 --> 03:02:36,064
Is someone to be blamed for not dining with someone who has rejected him from their feast?

1506
03:02:36,064 --> 03:02:40,855
And is he not rather shown to be worthy of pity when others are invited and he is rejected?

1507
03:02:40,855 --> 03:02:50,595
It is extreme cruelty if someone is forbidden to dine with those who are dining; and why should he not dine, being ordered to be killed by the one who did not want him to dine together?

1508
03:02:51,648 --> 03:02:59,018
Eventually, your book, now seemingly worthless, appears to offer freedom of choice-but only when it concerns measures, not the essence.

1509
03:02:59,018 --> 03:03:05,351
Where, he asks, is there greater freedom of choice in good, and where is there less, except as judged by God's will?

1510
03:03:05,351 --> 03:03:10,756
In one person, grace appears sparingly, while in another, it's abundant and generous, as we desire.

1511
03:03:10,756 --> 03:03:14,687
I am not arguing with you here, because both Christ and Paul refute you.

1512
03:03:14,687 --> 03:03:20,037
Christ says: "He who loves more is forgiven more; he who loves less is forgiven less" (Luke 7:47).

1513
03:03:20,037 --> 03:03:25,006
Paul also says: "Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly" (Second Corinthians 9:6).

1514
03:03:25,006 --> 03:03:32,376
Therefore, grace is not given by God through favoritism, but through the love in a person's heart, whether that love is great or small.

1515
03:03:32,376 --> 03:03:34,942
For who, loving God more, is loved less by God?

1516
03:03:34,942 --> 03:03:38,163
In fact, even someone not loving God is still loved by Him.

1517
03:03:38,163 --> 03:03:39,528
But how can God be loved?

1518
03:03:39,528 --> 03:03:45,697
The Lord himself teaches, saying: "He who hears my words and does them, he is the one who loves me" (John 14:21).

1519
03:03:45,697 --> 03:03:50,120
He also tells his disciples: "If you love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).

1520
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:54,269
So, let's consider what freedom of choice does to fully receive God's grace.

1521
03:03:54,269 --> 03:03:57,381
It gives up its own freedom and becomes a servant of God.

1522
03:03:57,381 --> 03:04:09,829
The Apostle teaches this, saying: "Do you not know that when you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness" (Romans 6:16)?

1523
03:04:09,829 --> 03:04:16,489
Therefore, whoever submits to God's will, gives up their own freedom of choice, so they can be liberated by divine choice.

1524
03:04:16,489 --> 03:04:24,952
Does it not seem that someone who denies themselves bread when hungry, drink when thirsty, and sleep when drowsy, is giving up their own freedom of choice?

1525
03:04:24,952 --> 03:04:28,992
But in these sacrifices, one cannot be worthy unless they do so willingly.

1526
03:04:28,992 --> 03:04:35,161
The Apostle says: "Not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver" (Second Corinthians 9:7).

1527
03:04:35,161 --> 03:04:39,474
The prophet also says to God: "I will sacrifice to you willingly" (Psalm 54:8).

1528
03:04:40,512 --> 03:06:31,680
And again: "My flesh has flourished," he says, "and I will praise Him of my own will."
Psalm twenty-seven:seven.
But we read about the unjust: "He refused to understand in order to do good."
Psalm thirty-six:four.
Hence, the blessed Jacob says: "Simeon and Levi, brothers, completed iniquity of their own will."
Genesis forty-nine:five to six.
So, if before our true and complete freedom came, the Lord Jesus Christ, the just one, voluntarily sacrificed to God and confessed of His own will, while the sinner sinned of his own will; how much more now, with our freedom restored through Christ, are all things given back to us by right, not by the dominance of nature as Pelagius and Coelestius defined it, but by the grace of Christ granting it?
Not claiming strength for ourselves, but relying on God's help; not taking anything for ourselves, but attributing everything to God's grace. Everything, I say, everything; I repeat, everything, but the good. The evil, however, we incur from our own fault, from our own negligence, and from our own will.
Why do you turn to accusations and throw Pelagius' teachings at us? We anathematize all who say that, without God's help, a person can be without sin if they want. We anathematize those who say neither death came through Adam nor life through Christ. We anathematize those who say of two baptized parents that their child cannot need baptism. We anathematize those who say infants should not be considered sanctified by baptism for the remission of sins. We anathematize everything condemned by the Church in all heretics. We anathematize your book with you, which says:
We acknowledge that human nature was so corrupted by Adam's transgression that it achieved its restoration through Christ not in reality but in hope, as the Apostle says: "For in hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is not hope."
Romans eight:twenty-four.
So, if we were saved in hope, we do not yet possess the reality in this present age. Therefore, even the baptized still desire carnally and suffer those bodily impulses, because they have received the help of restoration in hope, not in reality.

1529
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:38,237
If they had achieved their goal, after receiving the grace of baptism, there would be neither the possibility nor the desire to sin.

1530
03:06:38,237 --> 03:06:47,428
However, because the power of baptism is so great that it wipes away all sins, the tendency to sin is not washed away by the waters of baptism; it remains naturally present due to Adam.

1531
03:06:47,428 --> 03:06:55,129
Those parts of the body that are free from shame at the moment of baptism later become subject to shame, avoiding sight and seeking privacy out of modesty.

1532
03:06:55,129 --> 03:06:58,855
The parts that God made were turned into sources of shame by transgression.

1533
03:06:58,855 --> 03:07:04,618
At the moment of baptism, these sources of shame become parts again, but soon they revert to being sources of shame.

1534
03:07:04,618 --> 03:07:06,853
They are renewed not in reality, but in hope.

1535
03:07:06,853 --> 03:07:15,647
The desire of the flesh, which opposes the body as the law of sin due to Adam's transgression, once again claims the baptized person and tries to completely overturn their mind.

1536
03:07:15,647 --> 03:07:18,081
This is the root of the wound that Christ healed.

1537
03:07:18,081 --> 03:08:09,898
As the Apostle says: "We were saved by hope." He commands us to turn our minds to contemplate the unseen things, not to fall because of the visible things.
Therefore, he says: "Hope that is seen is not hope," so it should not be thought that sins are so removed by baptism that the very roots of sins are also taken away. The movement of defilement that invaded nature through transgression remains in the baptized person, just like the root of hair remains when the surface is cleaned and shaved with a razor. It is shaved to clean the area, not uprooted so that it would not grow again.
If every weakness of Adam's transgression were completely removed by baptism, all the baptized would not be drawn to crimes by any heat of passion, no one would be defiled by human filth, and no one would be pricked by the sting of desire. But because we are saved by hope, what we do not yet see, we wait for with patience.
The time will come when neither women will marry nor men will take wives, but they will be like angels in heaven (Matthew 22:30).

1538
03:08:10,296 --> 03:08:19,077
When this perishable body puts on the imperishable, and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: Death is swallowed up in victory.

1539
03:08:19,077 --> 03:08:20,683
Where, O death, is your victory?

1540
03:08:20,683 --> 03:08:22,188
Where, O death, is your sting?

1541
03:08:22,188 --> 03:08:25,149
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.

1542
03:08:25,149 --> 03:08:28,812
Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1543
03:08:28,812 --> 03:08:33,027
This is your little book, which you do not give to anyone to read except under oath.

1544
03:08:33,027 --> 03:08:36,139
Be careful not to betray it; do not let the unskilled read it.

1545
03:08:36,139 --> 03:08:37,845
The kingdom of God is for the few.

1546
03:08:37,845 --> 03:08:43,164
This shows that God has predestined you for life if you guard this little book as you would your own soul.

1547
03:08:43,164 --> 03:08:46,325
Most women earn the right to receive this little book from you.

1548
03:08:46,325 --> 03:08:56,964
Finally, the one who betrayed it, a woman in body but a man in mind, when she received this little book from you under oath, shuddered as she read it and gave it to those she knew to be Catholics for examination.

1549
03:08:56,964 --> 03:08:58,971
We read it too, which you always feared.

1550
03:08:58,971 --> 03:09:06,899
With the Lord's help, clearly exposing its blasphemies, we warn all Catholics to avoid this little book, to curse it, and to condemn it with eternal anathema.

1551
03:09:06,899 --> 03:09:10,613
Its damnability is such that it nullifies all the mysteries of the Savior.

1552
03:09:10,613 --> 03:09:14,075
It says that Christ's baptism has no benefit at all when it is given.

1553
03:09:14,075 --> 03:09:22,205
Hope, it says, which is seen is not hope, that is, the forgiveness of sins: and whatever is promised in the present is not, because it is reserved for the future.

1554
03:09:22,205 --> 03:09:24,413
Yet, here in this world, it is not received.

1555
03:09:24,413 --> 03:09:27,022
For the Apostle says: Hope that is seen is not hope.

1556
03:09:27,022 --> 03:09:29,581
Did the Apostle say this according to your meaning?

1557
03:09:29,581 --> 03:09:39,868
Therefore, we will first explain the meaning of blessed Paul with due reverence, and then we will cut your book to pieces, especially where its conclusion seems to have found perfect completion against us.

1558
03:09:39,868 --> 03:09:45,238
The Apostle, bringing consolation to the children of God, says that they should seek nothing in this world.

1559
03:09:45,238 --> 03:09:55,274
Lest, perhaps, seeing the wicked and unbelievers rejoicing in their successes, but themselves afflicted, they would say, Look at these sinners, and those who prosper in the world have obtained riches.

1560
03:09:56,328 --> 03:10:00,869
But we, even up to this very moment, are hungry, and thirsty, and naked, and beaten.

1561
03:10:00,869 --> 03:10:02,112
First Corinthians 4:11.

1562
03:10:02,112 --> 03:10:05,572
Therefore, considering the present age, he promises future joys.

1563
03:10:05,572 --> 03:10:14,438
And although, he says, we are worn out by great sufferings, these sufferings of the present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.

1564
03:10:14,438 --> 03:10:15,086
Romans 8:18.

1565
03:10:15,086 --> 03:10:17,141
And so, he says, we are saved by hope.

1566
03:10:17,141 --> 03:10:17,789
Romans 8:24.

1567
03:10:17,789 --> 03:10:20,925
Note that he says we are saved, not that we will be saved.

1568
03:10:20,925 --> 03:10:24,385
He made salvation a past event; when we believed, we were saved.

1569
03:10:24,385 --> 03:10:25,033
Why by hope?

1570
03:10:25,033 --> 03:10:28,115
Because we hope to rise again, for we have not yet risen.

1571
03:10:28,115 --> 03:10:36,548
So, because we hope to receive rewards for good deeds and possibly incur punishments in hell for evil deeds; hoping for good and fearing evil, we are saved.

1572
03:10:36,548 --> 03:10:39,684
We who were children of wrath have become children of God.

1573
03:10:39,684 --> 03:10:40,440
Ephesians 2:3.

1574
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:44,116
Hence another Apostle cries out: Beloved, we are God's children now.

1575
03:10:44,116 --> 03:10:44,927
First John 3:2.

1576
03:10:44,927 --> 03:10:49,468
Therefore, the adoption of children is not promised in baptism, but it is conferred.

1577
03:10:49,468 --> 03:10:53,739
But you say about what we have already received: Hope that is seen is not hope.

1578
03:10:53,739 --> 03:11:00,388
For us, all hope seems to be established in the sanctification of baptism; therefore, what seems to us as hope is not hope.

1579
03:11:00,388 --> 03:11:06,443
We see the foundation of our hope in the anointing of Christ's chrism; therefore, hope that is seen is not hope.

1580
03:11:06,443 --> 03:11:10,768
We see our hope in the body of Christ; therefore, hope that is seen is not hope.

1581
03:11:10,768 --> 03:11:15,741
We look to the blood of Christ for our redemption; therefore, hope that is seen is not hope.

1582
03:11:15,741 --> 03:11:26,067
You have nullified all the sacraments, emptied the mysteries, and like trustworthy and capable surveyors of the Antichrist, you have prepared a place for him by expelling us from some places.

1583
03:11:26,067 --> 03:11:32,987
For what the Apostle says about the joys of this world: Hope that is seen is not hope, you have transferred to divine mysteries.

1584
03:11:32,987 --> 03:11:38,122
What he mentions about perishable and transient things, you have ascribed even to holy baptism.

1585
03:11:38,122 --> 03:11:43,312
May we have no part with you forever, nor let our minds be further tainted by these blasphemies.

1586
03:11:44,664 --> 03:11:52,705
Therefore, they say, those who are baptized are again defiled and carnally desire, because they have not received the help of renewal in reality, only in hope.

1587
03:11:52,705 --> 03:11:57,864
But we hope for future rewards in such a way that we do not deny what we have received in the present.

1588
03:11:57,864 --> 03:12:02,517
For we deserve to receive benefits, as long as we do not deny what we have already received.

1589
03:12:02,517 --> 03:12:05,652
If you deny what you have received, you are proven ungrateful.

1590
03:12:05,652 --> 03:12:11,468
Therefore, if you have not yet received grace but are going to receive it, why do you communicate secretly with us?

1591
03:12:11,468 --> 03:12:16,829
Wait for another body of Christ, another blood of Christ; for you say this one is in hope, not in reality.

1592
03:12:16,829 --> 03:12:23,455
For if we had received in reality, they say, after the grace of baptism there would be neither the possibility nor the will to sin.

1593
03:12:23,455 --> 03:12:30,384
Therefore, you wish to show that the grace of baptism has not bestowed reality, because after baptism we can still want evil and do evil.

1594
03:12:30,384 --> 03:12:34,531
To whom would the law of God be given, if the possibility of evil were taken away?

1595
03:12:34,531 --> 03:12:38,880
Who would ask for a reward for keeping God's commandments, if he could not transgress?

1596
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:42,977
Just as neither a mute person is praised for silence, nor a eunuch for virginity.

1597
03:12:42,977 --> 03:12:46,416
For they lack praise in good, who are denied the transition to evil.

1598
03:12:46,416 --> 03:12:50,462
Therefore, we say that the possibility of evil is good for those who despise it.

1599
03:12:50,462 --> 03:12:53,142
I will give a brief response to each of these points.

1600
03:12:53,142 --> 03:13:01,437
Someone could strip the clothed: behold, he could do evil; but because he did not want to, the possibility of evil became good, as he despised it with wise counsel.

1601
03:13:01,437 --> 03:13:12,917
Someone could steal money entrusted to him, could commit adultery: behold, the possibility of evil; and he who despised it, this very possibility made him be praised for not stealing money, and crowned for maintaining chastity.

1602
03:13:12,917 --> 03:13:18,076
We have spoken of one point, that is, the possibility of evil, which is good for those who despise it.

1603
03:13:18,076 --> 03:13:22,780
Now let us see how, conversely, the possibility of good becomes bad for those who despise it.

1604
03:13:22,780 --> 03:13:27,635
Someone has deposited money: behold, the possibility of good, for he can help all those in need.

1605
03:13:27,635 --> 03:13:35,879
But if he despises this possibility of good, it becomes a bad possibility, and so bad that it is proven to be the root of all evils, as mentioned in First Timothy.

1606
03:13:36,840 --> 03:13:37,978
But what are we doing?

1607
03:13:37,978 --> 03:13:41,495
Our baptism is in danger, and we are discussing the poison of greed.

1608
03:13:41,495 --> 03:13:49,617
Everyone knows that the sin of greed is serious, but the grace of baptism being nullified by unfaithful people has only recently come to light for Catholics.

1609
03:13:49,617 --> 03:13:53,446
They say that through baptism, sin is removed like hair shaved by a razor.

1610
03:13:53,446 --> 03:13:56,963
It's shaved to clean the area, not uprooted so it never grows again.

1611
03:13:56,963 --> 03:14:06,068
If all the frailty of Adam's transgression were entirely removed, all baptized people would not be drawn to sin by any stirring of passion or pricked by any stimulus of desire.

1612
03:14:06,068 --> 03:14:13,414
Therefore, the holy mysteries of baptism are nullified because, as you say, desire is the law of sin, and it claims the baptized person again.

1613
03:14:13,414 --> 03:14:19,364
If you were excluded from this desire, there would be full remission of sins and true comfort of graces in baptism.

1614
03:14:19,364 --> 03:15:13,890
I used "graces" in the plural because, although grace is one, it becomes multiple like a vine that produces many branches. There are as many vines as there are branches growing from one vine. From the single source of baptism, remission of sins is given in the present, and the kingdom is promised in the future. A man becomes a son of God, a son by adoption, a co-heir of the kingdom. He becomes a citizen from a foreigner, free from being a servant of the enemy, wealthy from being poor, and illustrious and great from being ignoble. But your book nullifies all these things, and you say:
If what is promised in baptism were given, no one would be pricked by the stimulus of desire after the water of baptism. Let's see whether this desire, as you say, is the law of sin. We say that desire is a natural struggle, deeply rooted in humans by God the Creator for the propagation of mankind. Even the first humans had not yet tasted from the tree of transgression when God blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth (Genesis 1:28).

1615
03:15:14,304 --> 03:15:21,594
Therefore, He who commanded the human race to multiply by blessing it before sin, undoubtedly provided this nature with the means to propagate.

1616
03:15:21,594 --> 03:15:26,489
For the different sexes could not have multiplied at all if there were no natural sexual desire.

1617
03:15:26,489 --> 03:15:32,098
The Lord said, "It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make a helper suitable for him" (Genesis 2:18).

1618
03:15:32,098 --> 03:15:37,247
Do you think this helper of the opposite sex was made by the Lord for consolation or for procreation?

1619
03:15:37,247 --> 03:15:46,731
If sexual desire is bad, which is shown to be the material of generation, then according to you, it is clear that God did not make woman as a helper for good, but as an occasion for sin.

1620
03:15:46,731 --> 03:15:57,540
But if you say that the woman's help was given not for restoration but for some consolation, then the different sexes were created in vain by Him, of whom we read that He made everything in wisdom (Psalm 104:24).

1621
03:15:57,540 --> 03:16:04,627
However, if the authority of the Old Testament does not hold you, listen to what our Lord Jesus Christ Himself said about the first humans.

1622
03:16:04,627 --> 03:16:14,416
He who made them male and female blessed them and said, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh" (Matthew 19:4-6).

1623
03:16:14,416 --> 03:17:02,496
And after saying this, He added: "Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate." We read that they were made by God, blessed by God, and joined by God.
And I wonder with what face you can say that this desire, through which marriages are celebrated, was inflicted upon the human race by the devil. For who would doubt that a bad thing, if it is bad, could not have been given to man by the good God? For if it was given by God, it is recognized as good; but if it is bad, it is clear that it was instilled by the devil. Your book says so:
"The parts that God made, they made shameful by transgressing." If this is not in the parts that God created, and the enemy appeared over God's creation and, against God's will, made His creature contain a different order than He instituted, then marriages are cursed, and the entire mass of the human race coming from this curse exists under the devil's influence. Choose one of the two.

1624
03:17:02,904 --> 03:17:08,352
Either the generation of humans is good, and desire is good; or marriages are bad, and desire is unjust.

1625
03:17:08,352 --> 03:17:15,267
So, correct the rule of the Church; condemn the priests worldwide who bless, consecrate, and join marriages in the mysteries of God.

1626
03:17:15,267 --> 03:17:20,977
I wonder with what face you enter the church, where you recognize that everything done is against your sects.

1627
03:17:20,977 --> 03:17:24,068
You deny that God gave this desire, from which we are born.

1628
03:17:24,068 --> 03:17:27,892
Therefore, we are not His creation if marital desire is not His creation.

1629
03:17:27,892 --> 03:17:32,502
Take away this, which you say is the law of sin, and let's see who can adhere to a wife.

1630
03:17:32,502 --> 03:17:41,513
But He who gave the power of the seed for blessing, He Himself, to multiply offspring, implanted love in desire and wanted what He established to be multiplied to be loved.

1631
03:17:41,513 --> 03:17:43,923
The increase of the species is natural desire.

1632
03:17:43,923 --> 03:17:56,077
If through this, as you say, everything is the cause of sin, then He created the crime in the species, who wanted posterity to be multiplied through love, and commanded that the wife be loved beyond the rights of paternal affection.

1633
03:17:56,077 --> 03:18:48,464
Finally, our Lord Jesus Himself, when He says: Matthew 19:6: "What God has joined together, let no man separate," it is as if He said: You are not allowed to hate your wife, whom you began to love with me as the author. For He was jealous that the union made by Him should be stained by marital hatred. What a strange perversion of things! While hatred of a wife is punished by God, marital desire is condemned by men. But the just judge does not condemn natural desire, who, to multiply offspring, therefore implanted love.
For when matters of marriage and divorce were discussed, the Lord then dictated this sentence, saying: "What God has joined together, let no man separate." He said this to show that the union of marriage is specifically from God. For there could not be union without coupling, nor coupling without union. If marital desire is not from the Creator's creature, but from sin, they say, then according to you, God joined in blessing what the devil inserted through transgression.

1634
03:18:48,935 --> 03:18:52,213
If that is the case, he was not an adversary but a helper of God.

1635
03:18:52,213 --> 03:19:00,884
If those whom God wished to be one in the flesh were made inseparable through desire, and what He commanded to increase and multiply, he found a way for it to be fulfilled.

1636
03:19:00,884 --> 03:19:06,834
How unfortunate it is for the Predestinarians to claim that a blessing from the Creator came from man's transgression!

1637
03:19:06,834 --> 03:19:12,027
You call this the law of sin, but we affirm it as the law of nature, which you accuse of being a crime.

1638
03:19:12,027 --> 03:19:16,211
We say this is the cause of virtues, which you want to show as the source of vices.

1639
03:19:16,211 --> 03:19:22,009
While it helps parents to be fruitful in offspring, it also provides for the chaste and the virgins to be glorious.

1640
03:19:22,009 --> 03:19:27,202
And lest you think it is detrimental anywhere, it provides greater rewards by opposing than by helping.

1641
03:19:27,202 --> 03:19:31,941
When it helps, it shows the fruit of nature; when it opposes, it awards the prize of chastity.

1642
03:19:31,941 --> 03:19:35,017
There, it works without fault; here, it fights with a reward.

1643
03:19:35,017 --> 03:19:39,302
Remove desire, and marriages cease; remove desire, and the rewards of chastity cease.

1644
03:19:39,302 --> 03:19:43,386
What kind of evil is this, I ask, that is shown to be the cause of a double good?

1645
03:19:43,386 --> 03:19:47,067
It brings some to the joy of generation, others to the triumph of virtue.

1646
03:19:47,067 --> 03:19:50,192
Some act upon it lawfully, others fight against it gloriously.

1647
03:19:50,192 --> 03:19:58,057
If this is said to be sin in everyone, then spouses, the chaste, and virgins alike are condemned by it; for it is known to be present in everyone by nature.

1648
03:19:58,057 --> 03:19:59,267
We do not feel this way.

1649
03:19:59,267 --> 03:20:03,150
Instead, we praise it for maintaining its order and showing reverence to God.

1650
03:20:03,150 --> 03:20:08,141
Therefore, even in the baptized, it is blessed, not avoided, and it is adorned rather than removed.

1651
03:20:08,141 --> 03:20:14,998
For He who blessed the fountain of eternal water so that we are spiritually reborn, also blessed spouses so that we are born physically.

1652
03:20:14,998 --> 03:20:19,636
Therefore, we received this movement of desire from the Creator, just like other body parts.

1653
03:20:19,636 --> 03:20:26,594
If desire is evil because through it adultery is sometimes committed, then the hand is also evil because through it murder is carried out.

1654
03:20:27,551 --> 03:20:33,330
Blame the tongue, because through it, God is blasphemed; condemn the foot, because it leads a person to a brothel.

1655
03:20:33,330 --> 03:20:36,574
In this way, not only desire but all your members are condemned.

1656
03:20:36,574 --> 03:21:00,906
I will respond to you with a Catholic perspective, because just as the hand was made not for killing, but for working;
and the tongue not for blaspheming, but for the glory and praise of the Creator;
and all members not to serve vices, but to follow divine commandments;
so too is desire naturally implanted, not for adultery, but for generating:
which we have proven not only as a help to the fertility of spouses but also as a means to bring the palm of virtue to the continent.

1657
03:21:00,906 --> 03:21:03,187
Do you want to know that this desire is good?

1658
03:21:03,187 --> 03:21:05,113
I will compare it to divine mysteries.

1659
03:21:05,113 --> 03:21:08,459
For not only bad desires but even good presumptions are condemned.

1660
03:21:08,459 --> 03:21:15,708
Imagine someone presuming to take the body of the Lord before the light of baptism;
would not this person be condemned for presuming upon good?

1661
03:21:15,708 --> 03:21:22,906
What is given to some according to order brings salvation, while to others it brings condemnation outside of order, outside the accepted time.

1662
03:21:22,906 --> 03:21:30,763
Similarly, if a layperson usurps the priesthood, or presumes to offer sacrifice, would not this person be condemned for assuming power not granted to them?

1663
03:21:30,763 --> 03:21:43,385
If presumption of such holy things makes one guilty, not the action itself, how much more in desire, not the action keeping its order but going outside of order, is it called a crime, and makes cursed what the Creator placed as blessed in its order?

1664
03:21:43,385 --> 03:21:54,486
If this is so, or rather because it is so, why do you suffer, unhappy ones, who wanting to nullify the restoration of baptism, say that this desire remained so that all sins would not seem entirely forgiven to a person?

1665
03:21:54,486 --> 03:21:59,960
Why should you not rather suspect from this that it is not a sin, since it is not erased in baptized people?

1666
03:21:59,960 --> 03:22:03,255
For if it were a sin, it would surely be removed like the others.

1667
03:22:03,863 --> 03:22:10,696
Therefore, those of you who strive to diminish the gifts of baptism through desire are showing that the creator of desire is the devil.

1668
03:22:10,696 --> 03:22:17,478
By doing this, you imply that the Creator failed in His work during creation and that He could not fully provide help through baptism.

1669
03:22:17,478 --> 03:22:20,161
Those who willingly welcome you will share your fate.

1670
03:22:20,161 --> 03:22:25,374
For it is written that not only those who commit iniquity are guilty, but also those who consent to it.

1671
03:22:25,374 --> 03:22:25,981
Romans 1:32.
