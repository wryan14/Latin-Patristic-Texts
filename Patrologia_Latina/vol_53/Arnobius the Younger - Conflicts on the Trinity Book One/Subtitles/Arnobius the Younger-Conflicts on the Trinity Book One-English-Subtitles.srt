Book One

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:15,415
The Egyptians who arrived wanted to show themselves as students of their province's ancient teachers, namely Jannes and Jambres, who were mentioned by the Apostle Paul in First Timothy three, eight, as having resisted God's servant Moses with certain tricks.

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,190
So too did they resist the truth.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:25,905
When they tried to accuse us by saying that our faith in the Lord's incarnation deviated from the right path, we finally managed to secure from them an agreement.

5
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:37,202
Setting aside the arguments, individual speakers from each side would debate while the rest sat as observers, allowing only a few to act as judges who could give a verdict based on the merit of the conclusions.

6
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:44,411
It came to pass that Arnobius was the defender on behalf of the apostolic seat and Serapion was the debater from the Egyptian council.

7
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:49,468
The judges were Decius Constantius from the Catholic side and Ammonius from the Egyptian side.

8
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:49,629
II.

9
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,620
The proceedings began in this manner.

10
00:00:51,620 --> 00:01:01,088
Serapion said: Before we come to the point where we accuse you of being Homuncionates, claiming there are two natures and two substances in Christ, I want to know, who are you?

11
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:06,737
Arnobius said: I am clearly a servant of Christ and a proponent of both the Catholic faith and the truth.

12
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:09,319
Serapion said: Declare what your faith believes.

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,816
Arnobius said: I believe in one almighty God, the creator of all.

14
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:18,410
Serapion said: How do you know this God, whom you believe to be one, is almighty and the creator of all?

15
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,575
Arnobius said: Because he has deemed it fitting to reveal himself to humanity with great powers.

16
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:25,027
Serapion said: What powers?

17
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:38,154
Arnobius said: To skip over earlier events, the land of your province is a testament, as it was struck by ten plagues, losing its king and his army, with almost all elements raging against it because it rebelled against God, the creator of all.

18
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:47,138
Through his servant Moses, he delivered the people from the sword with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, showing that he is God and there is no other besides him.

19
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,397
If you intend to dispute this, declare it.

20
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:53,055
Serapion said: Let us move past these points where our faiths agree.

21
00:01:54,024 --> 00:03:32,040
Constantius and Ammonius, the appointed judges, said:
"It is clear that Arnobius has satisfied the matter concerning the one almighty God, and that Serapion has agreed with his assertion. Or, if that is not the case, let Serapion speak."
Serapion said:
"I am eager to know from Arnobius whether his faith does not err in other matters, lest by possibly addressing other issues beyond those in question-which could rightly be refuted-and neglecting the opportunity of this time, we seem to have achieved nothing here."
The investigators said:
"Let Arnobius say whether he permits this man to inquire about other matters besides those about which the contention seems to have arisen."
Arnobius said:
"I do not refuse to be questioned by him on whatever he wishes, lest I seem to cut off the opportunity for me to inquire from him whatever I wish."
The aforementioned judges said:
"Let Serapion say what it is that he wishes to learn from him."
Serapion said:
"Will you say that this one God, the deliverer of the Hebrews, is the only God, or perhaps another?"
Arnobius said:
"The God of the Hebrews is one God. Deuteronomy 6:4. When you hear 'God is one,' do not at all seek another God."
Serapion said:
"Therefore, is the Jewish assertion to be maintained, which declares and believes that the God of the Hebrews is the only and one God?"
Arnobius said:
"The Jews proclaim God as solely such that they deny His Son. They deny that the one who was born of the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary is one with Him."
Serapion said:
"The one who was born of the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary, is He the same one or another?"
Arnobius said:
"In divinity, He is one. In generation, however, He is another in such a way that the Father and the Son do not cease to be one God."

22
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,066
For God is truly believed to be one, and the complete Divinity is not denied in Him.

23
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:41,255
Serapion said: And how is the complete Divinity to be believed in Him?

24
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:50,350
Arnobius said: The complete Divinity is not denied in Him, if the Father, together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, are not entirely denied as one God.

25
00:03:50,350 --> 00:04:00,463
Serapion said: By leading me away from the synagogue's council, you have led me into the madness of Sabellius, who confesses one God as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

26
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:06,328
Arnobius said: If Sabellius truly spoke of one God, he would not deny His Son and the Holy Spirit.

27
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:15,962
For he denies the true Father, who does not speak of the true Son, and he denies the Holy Spirit, who does not believe that God is whole in the complete Trinity.

28
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:24,818
Serapion said: I read to you that Sabellius says anathema to those who dared to deny the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit to affirm the Trinity.

29
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:33,495
Arnobius said: But he, with the most impious defense, argues that he himself is the Father, he himself is the Son, he himself is the Holy Spirit.

30
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:40,077
But we say and believe that the Father, who begot the Son, is the Father of His only Son begotten before time.

31
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:46,600
Serapion said: I don't want you to take me to lofty heights; discuss this now, what was begotten before time.

32
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,669
First, let me exit this, because I understand you to say three gods.

33
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,840
Arnobius said: Your understanding suffers from error.

34
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:08,680
For you should remember me saying that you truly confess one whole God when you have believed the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit as one God, so that you do not merely say the Father as a concept, but the true Father, who begot the true Son.

35
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,331
Serapion said: So there is another, and another, and another.

36
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,579
Arnobius said: There is another, and another; and yet there is one God.

37
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:26,931
Serapion said: It cannot stand that the Father, who begot, is another; and the Son, who is begotten, is another, so that the Father is not the Son, and yet there is one God.

38
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:31,659
Arnobius said: I will show you yourself to have two persons with one substance.

39
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,411
Serapion said: Let the art of dialectic cease.

40
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:40,754
Arnobius said: The art of dialectic enters into obscure matters, so that what is true may be seen as true.

41
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:49,886
I promise to show you that two persons have one substance: in you, I mean, because I am discussing this, and you do not simply assert it.

42
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:54,237
Serapion said: Then simply show me how two persons can have one substance.

43
00:05:54,237 --> 00:06:04,290
Arnobius said: Look, in one of your heads there are two eyes, but they have one sight:
two nostrils, but they have one sense of smell:
two ears, but they have one hearing.

44
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:13,814
If these pairs in you, being of one substance, contain unity, do you not want to believe that in God the Father and the Son, two persons truly have one substance?

45
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:21,046
Serapion said: This comparison is recognized as unsuitable, as you use physical body parts as examples for the incorporeal.

46
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:26,631
The judges said: You are in vain questioning the example taken by Arnobius from the body parts.

47
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:47,502
For if the physical parts of the eyes, nostrils, and ears, divided in their forms and remaining as if in their own chambers, obtain this unity of substance, enjoying one light, one smell, and one hearing:
how much more should God, who must be acknowledged as incorporeal, having one substance with His Son, also obtain the majesty of omnipotence with Him?

48
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:56,439
Serapion said: I indeed agree with the reasoning about the physical:
but unless there are incorporeal examples, I cannot relate them to the incorporeal.

49
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,142
Arnobius said: I ask, Judges, that you bear with your dissenting opinion kindly.

50
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:04,258
For I do not fear seeking those incorporeal examples.

51
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:11,196
I confess the true Father, the true Son, and the true Holy Spirit, truly three:
truly one, almighty, and I believe it.

52
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:22,448
Serapion should indeed be compelled to admit silence on this question, as I have given examples of both physical and non-physical things to prove that there are three persons in one substance.

53
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:30,390
The judges said: Serapion should admit that for the proof of this matter, only examples of non-physical things need to be provided by Arnobius.

54
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:37,777
Serapion said: I will certainly admit that it is enough when the non-physical examples are as clearly expressed as the physical ones.

55
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:43,776
Arnobius said: Can we say that perfect wisdom exists in a person who lacks memory, creativity, or intellect?

56
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:48,941
Serapion replied: How can wisdom be considered perfect if it lacks one of these three things?

57
00:07:48,941 --> 00:08:12,102
Arnobius said: Therefore, if this is the case, and indeed it is; just as in one wisdom these three non-physical persons exist, that is, memory, creativity, and intellect, and though they are three, they do not make three but one perfect wisdom, if all three are perfect: so, in our faith, there will be one perfect deity when we believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit hold the omnipotence of one deity.

58
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:25,932
And just as there is no complete wisdom where something is lacking in creativity, memory, or intelligence, so there is no complete faith in a person who offends in any way against the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit, even to the smallest degree.

59
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:46,538
For faith is the light of the inner eyes; and just as if you prick any part of the eye with a sharp needle, you disturb and weaken the whole light, so too when an error is made in any part of this holy Trinity, even as small as an atom, or moment, or point, it turns the whole clear light of faith into a cloud: and once the mind is wounded, it sees nothing but darkness.

60
00:08:46,538 --> 00:09:00,923
The judges said: Serapion, who did not agree to the physical examples because he thought they could not be applied to non-physical things, must yield to the provided non-physical examples, to reasonably admit that one deity is truly assigned to three persons.

61
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:04,843
Serapion said: Allow me, Judges, to ask him about what follows.

62
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:13,008
The Judges said: Just as you are not allowed to repeat what has been rightly concluded, you are not forbidden to present what has not been revealed.

63
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:20,565
Serapion said: You taught one Divinity in these two, that is, in the Father and the Son, first comparing them bodily, then incorporeally.

64
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:26,303
Now I want to know what you say the Holy Spirit is, because I sense you believe the Father has two sons.

65
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:30,771
Arnobius said: Unless I lead you to human reasoning, you cannot reach the divine.

66
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:36,784
Serapion said: Lead me wherever you wish, as long as you make me understand the reasoning of the Holy Spirit.

67
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:48,038
Arnobius said: I ask you to tell me, when the king says: Let a forum or a palace or something like this be built, I think that this command from the king made something that was not there come into being.

68
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:54,769
Serapion replied: It is agreed that this command from the king's mouth makes something that was not there come into being.

69
00:09:54,769 --> 00:10:01,168
Arnobius said: Therefore, the word proceeding from the Father's mouth, full of power, creates all visible creatures.

70
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:08,671
Serapion said: Again, you have brought me back to the Father and the Son, when I am inquiring about the Holy Spirit proceeding from you.

71
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:12,753
Arnobius said: You cannot find the Holy Spirit being born, but proceeding.

72
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:15,125
Serapion said: Show me this procession now.

73
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:22,517
Arnobius said: I did not tell you this because you listen impatiently to things that could have led you to the investigation of truth.

74
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:28,641
Serapion said: I will listen patiently, follow wherever you wish, now show me what you mean by the Holy Spirit.

75
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:35,371
Arnobius said: First, you must admit that the Father said of His Son: My heart overflows with a good word from the Psalms.

76
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:41,253
Serapion said: Even if I wanted to deny it, everyone present who hears me would refute me.

77
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:52,379
Arnobius said: When the Word was born from the mouth of the Father, who created all visible and invisible things with His power, the Word could never proceed without the breath of the Holy Spirit.

78
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,964
Serapion said: Therefore, there are two sons that came from the mouth of the Father, namely the Word and the Spirit.

79
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:02,029
Arnobius said: You are mistaken in your understanding.

80
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:08,671
You have forgotten that I first led you to the example of a king who commanded markets, palaces, or baths to be made.

81
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,007
And I added: The command of his word had such power that things that never existed came to be.

82
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,880
You confirmed this before people.

83
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,413
Answer now again, is it so?

84
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,775
Serapion said: It is so.

85
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:27,631
Arnobius said: Therefore, if it is so, indeed because it is so: answer me: Is this Word born from the mouth of the one commanding, confirmed by just reason?

86
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:31,151
Serapion said: I agree that the Word is born from just reason.

87
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:44,094
Arnobius said: When the commander's word was born, which went out from the mouth to create what was not, was the breath that proceeded from the one who issued the word born rather than proceeding, able to be shown by any reason?

88
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:47,954
If this cannot happen for a commanding human, how much more for God?

89
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:55,220
The Word from the generating mouth cannot fall in such a way that the breath itself, full of the Holy Spirit, is called the Son.

90
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:03,565
But there is the Father who uttered the Word; and the Holy Spirit, who does not cease to proceed from the Father, having the same power as the Son.

91
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:09,412
For by the Word of the Lord the heavens were made firm, and by the breath of His mouth all their power.

92
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:13,101
(Psalms 33:6)
If you remember it is written this way, declare it.

93
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:18,778
Serapion said: It is written this way in the book of Psalms; there is no one who does not know this.

94
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:29,110
The judges said: Concerning the Holy Spirit, it is evident to you, the assertion is clear, which your agreement proves: now let us approach those things which have not yet been said.

95
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:40,009
Serapion said: Behold, just as in one perfect wisdom I agree with memory, intelligence, and understanding; so too I confess that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit exist in one Divinity.

96
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,804
But I ask you: Did the Father truly beget?

97
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:48,395
Arnobius said: You will find nothing in God that is made, only what is.

98
00:12:48,395 --> 00:12:56,349
That is, the Father is indeed a true Father, a true begetter of the Son: a true Son, truly the only-begotten of the Father.

99
00:12:56,349 --> 00:13:01,458
Serapion said: Before He begot the Son, was He only God and not yet the Father?

100
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:07,149
Arnobius said: You are mistaken in your question, for He was always both God and Father.

101
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,124
Serapion replied: Then He did not truly beget.

102
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,064
Arnobius said: He truly begot.

103
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:20,794
Serapion replied: If He truly begot, then before God begot, He was God; but He could not have been both God and Father before He begot.

104
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:26,873
Arnobius said: You are mistaken because you are comparing human frailty to divine omnipotence.

105
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:39,419
A man, before having a son, is only a man: but after he begins to have a son, he is still a man, as he was; and he also begins to be a father, which he could not have been before he begot a son.

106
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,005
Do not attribute this limitation to God.

107
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:58,302
God is unchanging and enduring, He accepts nothing new within Himself: for He has always been both God and Father, and this name of fatherhood was not added to Him: because anything that is incidental can also depart; and what can depart can also fail.

108
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:04,316
However, the divinity, which remains unchangeable, accepts nothing within itself by accident.

109
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,903
For it is today what it always has been.

110
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:22,941
Nothing from the past diminishes for Him, nor will anything grow from the future: nor do time periods rule over Him as they do over you, who were once a little child, then a boy, then a young man, then an old man, and after old age, your end comes.

111
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:30,701
If you think such changes can happen to God, you show yourself to be foolish and are proven to be a blasphemous outcast.

112
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:38,396
Serapion replied: May God avert this blasphemy, which now, born of foolishness, accuses one of blaspheming in ridicule.

113
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:42,923
Arnobius said: So, is God unchangeable, or does He change in some way?

114
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:49,907
Serapion replied: God is unchangeable; yet, by asserting that He begot the Son, He appears to be changeable.

115
00:14:51,071 --> 00:15:02,100
Arnobius said: We have to return to some comparisons to show that birth occurs in such a way that there can be no division of time between the one who begets and the one who is begotten.

116
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:09,096
Serapion said: I hear something new, that no time can be shown between the one who begets and the one who is begotten.

117
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:16,566
Arnobius said: That's why we have observers and judges, so that we are cautious about saying we will show something we cannot.

118
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:23,207
Serapion said: Be careful not to bring me any physical examples again, trying to apply them to the non-physical.

119
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:27,594
Arnobius said: I'm already afraid of offending your wisdom in this matter.

120
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,567
Serapion said: Not my wisdom, but that of all observers and judges.

121
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:36,192
Arnobius said: Listen then to the non-physical generation from a physical man.

122
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,393
Serapion said: You're entering into a logical fallacy.

123
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:47,872
Arnobius said: A logical fallacy can have two sides: to prove what is claimed to be true or to argue that it is not true from some perspective.

124
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:55,639
But now, what I say, since I will only show the truth without any mark of deception, how can the logic I present be argued against?

125
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,137
Surely, if I say a man's voice is non-physical, am I lying?

126
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:02,991
Serapion said: Who has ever said a voice is physical at any time?

127
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:08,327
Arnobius said: No one has said this, yet I want to say that a man's voice is non-physical.

128
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:12,181
Serapion said: You're saying something that no one is unaware of.

129
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:16,806
Arnobius said: Is the word born from the voice, or is the voice from the word?

130
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:19,177
Serapion said: From the voice, the word.

131
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:24,928
Arnobius said: The word that is born from the non-physical voice, is it physical or non-physical?

132
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,589
Serapion said: Non-physical.

133
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:32,636
Arnobius said: Behold, from the non-physical voice, a non-physical word is born, the son of the voice.

134
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,296
Can anything later be found?

135
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:43,071
If you cannot find any time between the word and the voice, how can you find any intervening time between the Father and the Son, the immutable God?

136
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:48,170
In this investigation, the third person, the Holy Spirit, must also not be overlooked.

137
00:16:49,415 --> 00:17:00,786
Since speech is born from the voice, and breath does not come from being born but from proceeding, through which the completeness of the word is preserved, in the same way, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father.

138
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:07,959
Through Him, the complete and perfect Trinity is maintained in Catholic definitions, showing that the Father was never without the Son.

139
00:17:07,959 --> 00:18:40,621
The judges appointed said, "Arnobius's statement likely also clearly explained the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son. If there are other things that have not yet been said, let them be brought forth."
Serapion said, "If I do not bring forth what concerns me, what has been explained in my mind will be nullified by what has not been brought forward to reach an explanation."
The appointed judges said, "We will seem to tire ourselves with futile labor by listening, and you will work without reason in speaking, if things known to be concluded are repeated. Therefore, you must avoid and be careful in every way not to recall the struggles of words, once explained and concluded, as if you were out of your mind."
Serapion said, "I will not be able to repeat anything that has been explained to reach my agreement; however, it is necessary for me to propose whatever arises from those things that are concluded."
And he added, "Tell me, Catholic, you who do not deny that the Son is begotten from the Father, did the Father beget Him by will or by necessity?"
Arnobius said, "Neither by will nor by necessity."
The judges said, "Explain what you have said, because it is unclear."
Arnobius said, "Every man who wants something or does not want something, if he does not have wisdom beforehand, cannot want or not want something justly. Therefore, it is first necessary for him to have wisdom before virtue, by which he can want or not want something; and thus, he begins to be wise and want, when he has learned through wisdom that he can have it.
So, Serapion asks me, 'Did the Father beget the Son by necessity or by will?' I will briefly respond to one point.
One who suffers necessity should neither be called nor believed to be God."

140
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:53,476
When the question is settled regarding one absolute matter, the other remaining one must be resolved in this order: I ask the one questioning me, is it more important to understand rationally before wanting rationally?

141
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:57,569
The appointed judges said: Let Serapion respond to what Arnobius asks.

142
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:03,125
Serapion said: Who does not know that understanding rationally comes before wanting rationally?

143
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:16,633
Arnobius said: If wisdom comes before will, then the Son precedes the will, and He was begotten before the Father wanted or did not want anything, because when the will began, the wisdom, which you admitted to, was already earlier.

144
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:38,504
And although the reasoning I provided is already supported by your agreement, when you said, who does not know that understanding rationally comes before wanting rationally, I will still reinforce this reasoning with the authority of the Apostle Paul, who says about the Son of God that He is the power and wisdom of God in First Corinthians, Chapter One, Verse Twenty-Four.

145
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:54,118
The appointed judges said: It is clear that Arnobius spoke correctly, that the Father did not beget the Son by will or necessity, because God has no need; he proved with human reason and confirmed with the authority of the Apostle that will cannot be prior to wisdom.

146
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:58,562
If there are other things to be presented by Serapion, let them be revealed.

147
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:14,059
Serapion said: I recall you mentioning three persons, the Father as the begetter of the Son, the Son begotten by the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father, and you mentioned that these three persons have their own divinity and are completely whole.

148
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,579
Arnobius said: That is so.

149
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:25,930
Serapion said: Therefore, the Father is not the Son, nor is the Son the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit the Father and the Son; but each one is a perfect God in their own person.

150
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,451
Arnobius said: That is so.

151
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:37,684
Serapion said: What then do you say now to my question when I ask you; and you tell me the Father is a perfect God, the Son is a perfect God, the Holy Spirit is a perfect God.

152
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,098
Do you say so?

153
00:20:39,098 --> 00:22:19,343
Arnobius said: "Yes, I do."
Serapion said: "And if you do say so, how is it that you don't believe there are three gods?"
Arnobius said: "Even if you forget, not everyone who knows and judges has forgotten.
They know I have one sight with two eyes; one hearing with two ears; one touch with two hands; one step with two feet; and one speech with two lips and one tongue.
And one wisdom from memory, intelligence, and understanding, these three.
One essence of life from all the bodily parts; and one understanding in the five senses.
These understand by seeing through the eyes, hearing through the ears, tasting through the mouth, and smelling through the nose.
So when our discussion has handled all these and concluded about unity, what reason brings us back again to things that are finished both by mutual agreement and by the judgment given between sides?
When I said, just as memory, intelligence, and understanding hold one function of wisdom, so the Father with the Son and the Holy Spirit remain one in their omnipotent kingdom."
Serapion said: "I did not ask about the perfection of each deity, nor did you speak of it.
I say now: the Father is a perfect God, the Son is a perfect God, the Holy Spirit is a perfect God, three make gods.
For either one God has a third part, so that by four ounces only three have one deity; or there are three gods, if each is perfect in his deity."
Arnobius said: "You meet my brevity with a lengthy argument; but as much as you want to go on, I will conclude briefly.
Place three of the most precious and incomparable pearls, all of the same value, in a dark place or in a blind night.
Yet when the light of day and the splendor of the sun comes, the greater the brightness of the light, the greater the splendor of these three precious stones will be to the eyes observing."

154
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:30,128
I ask now: These three incomparable stones, before they were revealed by the light, remained in their preciousness, and their beauty was within them, yet they were not visible to human eyes?

155
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,604
Serapion said: That is so.

156
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:37,734
Arnobius said: Is the light that revealed all three stones one, or are there two or three lights of the day?

157
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:42,672
Serapion said: Who denies that one light can reveal them, even if there are a thousand?

158
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:46,419
Arnobius said: I indeed spoke of three; you concede to a thousand.

159
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:58,395
If, therefore, a thousand precious stones show the adornment of their splendor with one day's light, how can the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit not reveal the omnipotence of their singular divinity with one light?

160
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:09,407
A divinity not seen with bodily eyes, but with the eyes of the heart, if the window of Catholic faith is opened, so that the sun of righteousness may enter through it and radiate with its light?

161
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:23,768
Therefore truly, let the three precious stones show clearly the same merit, majesty, beauty, diadem, and kingdom, not so that you think one is good, another better; so that you do not magnify one to the injury of another by thinking it more magnificent.

162
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:28,933
For each stone is so true that it lacks nothing by which another could be considered truer.

163
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:34,723
May faith alone open the windows of souls, which even God Himself has never opened without our belief.

164
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:49,083
For no one will be saved unless they subject their belief to the true faith, and it opens the windows of understanding, so that you may see these three most beautiful gems constructed in one kingdom, making one diadem and obtaining one majesty of power.

165
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:55,213
Serapion said: These three stones, although of the same preciousness and beauty, are nevertheless separated.

166
00:23:55,213 --> 00:24:00,946
Arnobius said: You have seen the division of the three, but you do not see one kingdom of one diadem.

167
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:06,736
Serapion said: I see one diadem, but in that diadem, the gems are constructed by the art of cataclysm.

168
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:11,277
Arnobius said: Just as the gems are constructed for you by the art of cataclysm.

169
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:18,281
Thus, these treasures of omnipotence are naturally placed in one, revealed only to those whose faith allows it.

170
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:31,986
Complete faith opens the door to this eternal treasure, revealing the perfect unity of the Trinity, and the most complete unity of that unity: the true Father who has always been a Father, and the true Son, of whom He has always been the Father.

171
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:36,909
For it is not as if He can become the Father of His Son if He was not the Father before.

172
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,315
Nothing changes in Him who is the true God.

173
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:44,014
He is always the same, unchanging, and He has always been God, truly one and triune.

174
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:47,985
God cannot be believed to begin to be something that He was not before.

175
00:24:47,985 --> 00:25:01,411
From what He is, that is God, and from this is God, which human language permits to say, but not the very nature of majesty: for from what God is, from that is He the Father, and from that is He the Son, from whom He is both God and Father.

176
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:06,726
For He did not begin to have within Himself something by substance that He did not have before.

177
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:11,537
Always with power, which is the Son; always with His breath, which is the Holy Spirit.

178
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:17,131
Serapion said: I remain silent on all things and confess that the entire Trinity has always existed.

179
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:24,515
But why should I not believe that the Father is greater, since the Father is not born of the Son, but the Son is born of the Father?

180
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:32,123
Arnobius said: We have already said that the word is born from the voice, and the voice is not greater because the word is born from it.

181
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:36,095
At one and the same moment, the voice, word, and breath arise together.

182
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:41,689
The greatness and diminishment cease because no time intervenes between the voice, word, and breath.

183
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:48,961
For the Father confirms that the word is the Son, as sacred Scripture testifies: "My heart has uttered a good word" (Psalms 45:1).

184
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,373
And what is as good as the Son, from whom all goodness comes?

185
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:58,303
However, a word spoken from the heart could not be born without the Spirit and breath of the one speaking.

186
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:01,492
For it is the breath that proceeds when the word is born.

187
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:11,953
Hence, I have already said a little before: "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made firm," as the prophets declare, "and by the Spirit of His mouth, all their power" (Psalms 33:6).

188
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:24,567
The appointed judges said: Let it be stated regarding the abundant and invisible majesty of the Trinity, as Arnobius mentioned, which we learned in full through Serapion's repeated intentions.

189
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:28,617
If there is anything else that Serapion implies, let him reveal it.

190
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:37,685
Serapion said: It is not inappropriate that I inquire from the impulse of my mind, for you to express in this holy Trinity, who holds the first place?

191
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:40,768
Arnobius replied: The Father holds the first place.

192
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,489
Serapion said: What do you say about the Son?

193
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,209
Arnobius said: He also holds the first place.

194
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,748
Serapion said: What about the Holy Spirit?

195
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:51,468
Arnobius said: He also holds the first place.

196
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:53,826
Serapion said: So, there is no Trinity.

197
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:59,630
Arnobius said: The Trinity is such that we do not say first, second, third: but one, two, three.

198
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:06,461
Serapion said: The Father is first, and the Son is first, and the Holy Spirit is first: three firsts, three gods.

199
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:18,068
Arnobius said: Imagine three emperors in one kingdom, in one harmony, on one throne, in one sweetness, in one bond of love, in one power, and ask among them who holds the first place of power.

200
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:26,229
Without a doubt, all three who are august are all three first: the second and third place of power will be arranged by the august ones.

201
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:32,758
Serapion said: So, isn't the first among these emperors the one who first began to have dominion among them?

202
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:46,904
Arnobius said: Among humans, indeed, the first is the one who began to reign alone; and later appointed the others either by birth or by choice: but in the divine rule, you will never find one of these three ruling without the others.

203
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:54,098
Serapion said: And why did you bring up the example of three emperors, in which we can say first, second, third, to us?

204
00:27:54,098 --> 00:28:10,360
Arnobius said: To show you that human fragility has such grace in the kingdom, that while it is taught for certain to be first, second, third, this order is excluded through the harmony of the empire, holding only the number; the order, however, is not admitted at all.

205
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:16,021
For all these three possess one kingdom, one empire, one pinnacle of august dignity.

206
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:20,268
They have this second, who was not first, just as they themselves are first.

207
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:26,693
Serapion said:
Do you think it is right for this temporal kingdom to be applied to the divine and heavenly majesty?

208
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:45,691
Arnobius said:
And if this temporal and mortal empire contains such great harmony of peace within itself, so that one who is older in age by birth and in ruling earlier:
this one is lesser, who took up the empire after many years until today; yet from the hour he became exalted, he cannot be lesser than the one who began earlier by birth.

209
00:28:45,691 --> 00:29:00,946
How much more in this divine harmony of the Holy Trinity, in which one never began to hold the power of the heavenly and eternal throne; there is such unity that, counted as three in number, having the empire of one and the same power, they are called one God and one Lord?

210
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:04,354
For the divine nature does not differ from itself in any way.

211
00:29:04,354 --> 00:29:24,078
And if the order, which earlier age admits among humans, is excluded by the equality of power; how much more the divine omnipotence where in the Trinity none is before, none is entirely after; so the unity, so the undivided majesty, that while they truly hold the number of three, they truly exist as one God, the origin of peace, calm, and tranquility.

212
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:32,404
The appointed judges said:
Either let Serapion, if he is able, offer something against these things, or let Arnobius briefly summarize his assertion.

213
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:47,044
And when Serapion used prolonged silence, Arnobius said:
Our God is one: for since He is the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, no Christian dares to say or believe in three gods; because (as I said) the divine nature does not differ from itself in any way.

214
00:29:47,044 --> 00:30:02,857
For the first and second or third order, which the first or second or third beginning among humans creates through intervals of time, in God, who is an equal beginning before time, does not admit to such an extent, that it cannot even be called a beginning, what existed before time.

215
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:12,286
Since a step cannot be made from every footstep, which cannot be subdivided, it keeps the number of the Trinity, but assigns the order of one equality.

216
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:19,853
And so, as I said earlier, because there is no second for the first, nor a third for the second, from the first nothing is born.

217
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:28,603
Remove the distance, and what you believe in the Trinity, you will find first, so that you may rejoice in having not a second or third, but one God.

218
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:33,155
Serapion said: I admit that all my objections have been reasonably satisfied.

219
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:39,481
But I still have many chapters of questions left, especially about the mysteries of the Lord's incarnation.

220
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,732
If you do not have more to say, please allow me to ask.

221
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:49,945
As I confess that I was satisfied by Arnobius, you know, chosen witnesses, that I have not acted with any legal authority.

222
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:59,876
For I see in both the Old Testament and the New, this God the Father is unbegotten, thus placed before the begotten, so that he takes the second place after the Father.

223
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:07,798
Arnobius said: Therefore, bring forth the testimonies of the divine Law, by which you will show the Father to be greater than the Son.

224
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:19,622
Serapion said: Consider the Son of God himself testifying through the words of Solomon: "The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways, in His works, before the ages He created me" (Proverbs 8:12).

225
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:32,155
But God the Father Himself speaks about the Son through the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame" (Isaiah 8:14).

226
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:36,884
Thus David sings of Him: "The stone which the builders rejected" (Psalm 118:22).

227
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:41,555
Hence also Isaiah said: "Thus says the Lord to my anointed Lord" (Isaiah 45:1).

228
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:48,590
Therefore, the Father Himself commands the Son, saying: "The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand" (Psalm 110:1).

229
00:31:48,590 --> 00:32:03,665
Thus also Stephen speaks of the Son: "I see Jesus at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56), of God the Father, who is, as testified by Paul the apostle, the head of Christ, and Christ is the head of man, and man is the head of woman (First Corinthians 11:3).

230
00:32:03,665 --> 00:32:09,636
This is the Father who says to the Son: "Before the morning star, I have begotten you" (Psalm 110:3).

231
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:15,134
And thus it is said of Christ: "For He will command His angels concerning you" (Psalm 91:11).

232
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,723
So, the one who commands is greater, and the one who is commanded is lesser.

233
00:32:20,723 --> 00:32:30,681
Hence, the Lord himself says to his apostles:
"If you loved me, you would rejoice because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I" (John 14:28).

234
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:34,774
And again: "The Father who gave me is greater than I" (John 10:10).

235
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:44,732
The Son of God himself also says to the Father: "This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" (John 17:3).

236
00:32:44,732 --> 00:32:53,468
Therefore, the Son is the second person after the Father because he is the Son, not taking away from the Father the fact that there is one God.

237
00:32:53,468 --> 00:33:09,108
If he had been unbegotten, compared to the one who is unbegotten, the shown equality would make both unbegotten, and therefore would show two gods, if the Son could exist without origin like the Father and be invisible and incomprehensible like the Father.

238
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:19,983
But now, whatever the Son is, he is not from himself, as he is not unbegotten; he is from the Father and owes his origin to his Father, as he was born from him who has no origin.

239
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:28,169
There is one God of all without beginning, about whom the Son, who has a beginning, says: "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28).

240
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:35,073
To prove this, he added: "The Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing" (John 5:19).

241
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:39,899
And he again says: "I have not come of myself, but he who sent me" (John 7:28).

242
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:45,581
And again, he says: "The works that I do testify of me, that the Father sent me" (John 10:2).

243
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:53,706
He also says: "He who speaks of himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true" (John 7:18).

244
00:33:53,706 --> 00:34:08,918
That is why he himself says: "Nothing from himself" (John 8:28), but obeys the commands and precepts of the Father in all things, so that his birth proves him to be the Son, yet his obedient submission asserts him to be subject to the Father's will.

245
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:18,021
Hence, he says: "I have not spoken on my own; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak" (John 12:49).

246
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:42,510
Here is how he obeys the Father and shows himself to be subordinate:
which demonstrates that he, by his subjection, is a servant;
yet he is approved as the Lord of others, so that rightly God the Father is almighty God, and the Son is God of all others, having every creature subject to him;
to the Father, who subjected all things to him, being subject with all creation, as stated in First Corinthians, chapter fifteen, verse twenty-six.

247
00:34:42,510 --> 00:35:55,050
Because of this, he is established as God to all creatures, saying:
"I have been appointed king by him," etcetera, as it is written in Psalm two, verse six.
Arnobius said:
If your intention truly aimed at either learning or teaching, you wouldn't cut out all these testimonies from divine books, as if throwing a bundle tied with the most twisted knots of your interpretation before the eyes of judges and those familiar with the matter.
Therefore, I address you, judges and those familiar with the matter:
I ask you, please, to insist that the order of the ongoing discussion not be changed, and that the chapters of Scripture I mentioned or others I haven't yet mentioned be presented by Serapion in your presence.
He should not be allowed to bring forward one thing after another simultaneously, unless what was first proposed is explained.
The judges said:
What Arnobius justly requests must be granted.
Hence, Serapion will hasten to resolve these testimonies, which he presented in one bundle with his interpretation, so that Arnobius may be able to respond to each testimony individually.
Serapion said:
The first objection of my testimony is from the book of Proverbs of Solomon, where you recognize the voice of the Son of God:
"The Lord created me at the beginning of his ways," as stated in Proverbs, chapter eight, verse twenty-two.

248
00:35:55,103 --> 00:36:01,086
Thus, it is shown that the Father, who created, is greater than the Son, who was created by the Father.

249
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:07,940
Arnobius said: So do you truly believe that the Son was born from the Father's substance, not so much born as created?

250
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,495
Serapion said: I do not deny the Son of God.

251
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:18,975
Arnobius said: If you do not deny that the true Son of God was born from the Father's substance, to which side did you bring forth this testimony?

252
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:22,576
Serapion said: To show that the Son is lesser than the Father.

253
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:30,882
Arnobius said: You do not attempt to show that the Son is lesser than the Father, but you try to demonstrate that the Son is a creature of God.

254
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:39,362
Serapion said: Then establish one of two things: either that this testimony does not have full authority of divine power, or show why it was said.

255
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:46,912
Arnobius said: Now you have returned to the order so that the explanation of each testimony may be granted to us, with God's help.

256
00:36:46,912 --> 00:37:56,727
Serapion said: Whose voice do you want to understand this as, "The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways"?
Arnobius said: It is the voice of the wisdom of God.
Serapion said: What is His wisdom, if not His Son?
Arnobius said: When it is necessary, it will be said in its place how this wisdom is His Son.
For now, the wisdom of God speaks through the wisest man, Solomon, saying: "The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways."
Serapion said: What is more evident than to say, "He created me"?
Arnobius said: What you are trying to demonstrate by saying "He created me," show this.
Serapion said: How did the Son, having obtained the beginning of creation from the Father, earn the right to hold authority over all creation?
Arnobius said: Surely every creature was not before it was created?
Serapion said: Certainly, it was not.
Arnobius said: Then did wisdom begin when it was created?
Serapion replied: Did it begin when it was created?
Arnobius said: So do you blaspheme the one who created it as being unwise?
Serapion said: May God avert this blasphemy from me.
Arnobius said: So you blaspheme unknowingly.
Serapion said: I do not blaspheme, but rather I praise the creator of wisdom.

257
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:06,564
Arnobius said: You are forced to conclude one of two things: either you say that he who created this wisdom already had wisdom, or he did not have it when he created it.

258
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:09,393
Serapion said: The Father was never without wisdom.

259
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:11,889
Arnobius said: Then he did not create wisdom.

260
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:18,322
Serapion said: Do not be proud, but be afraid, as it is written in the book of Romans, chapter eleven, verse twenty.

261
00:38:18,322 --> 00:38:23,313
Arnobius said: Who is proud, the one who blasphemes God, or the one who defends blasphemy?

262
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:25,365
Serapion said: Are you defending God?

263
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:33,851
Arnobius said: When I hear blasphemy, I rebuke the mouth of the blasphemer, just as I rebuke your mouth and teach you not to call God the Father foolish.

264
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:46,718
For when you said: Before wisdom was created, it did not exist, and you confirm that wisdom itself, which is created, belongs to God, you show that he who created it did not have wisdom and only began to have it after he created it.

265
00:38:46,718 --> 00:38:49,768
The judges said: This is a place of severe blasphemies.

266
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:50,655
Why do we delay?

267
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:53,206
Our ears are dulled, and do your mouths go on?

268
00:38:53,206 --> 00:39:00,361
Therefore, it is fitting that Arnobius, who has revealed the blasphemy, already presents the testimony brought forth by Serapion.

269
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:10,843
Arnobius said: Wisdom has always been stored within the heart of the Father, just like the art of rhetoric in the heart of the orator, and the art of grammar in the heart of the grammarian.

270
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:21,769
It is said that the orator created a book of the art of rhetoric, and the grammarian composed a book of arts, not because rhetoric and grammar began from the time they were given to people to read.

271
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:26,760
For those who wrote it, it has always been in their hearts from the time they were taught.

272
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,367
For us, it was created when our learning began.

273
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,580
That is why I said earlier, appropriately, that the Son of God is wisdom before he came to be.

274
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:46,116
Therefore, God, who made heaven and earth, and all things in them, created wisdom like the orator creates a book of the art of rhetoric, bringing out from his heart what he has always had since he learned it.

275
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:53,769
However, he created it for us, so that what was in his heart might also be given a beginning in our hearts through our hearing and seeing.

276
00:39:54,768 --> 00:40:07,205
Thus, God, who learned from no one and possesses eternal wisdom, when He desired to create the heavens and the earth and everything within them, first laid down the power of His wisdom, much like a house He intended to build.

277
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:16,436
The Father first made the air before He solidified the strongest ground; this means He made the heavens first and then finally solidified the earth with its mountains.

278
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:21,577
But we should speak about the creatures at the right time; now, let's talk about the Creator.

279
00:40:21,577 --> 00:41:59,306
So Wisdom itself says: "The Lord created me as the beginning of His works" from Proverbs chapter eight, verse twenty-two. A master full of wisdom, indeed the source of wisdom itself, brought forth wisdom from Himself. Listen to what wisdom says: "I, wisdom, founded the earth, prepared the heavens with understanding" from Proverbs chapter three, verse nineteen.
Since time does not arise except from days, and days from light, and light from the heavens, and since the heavens were born from wisdom, time did not exist before the heavens, except from wisdom. Before the heavens, time completely did not exist. Therefore, it is clear that wisdom always existed, and it was created in the manner we described, like creating a book for the wisest speaker. For example, Solomon created the Book of Wisdom, but wasn't wisdom already there before he wrote this book?
You might say: It wasn't there before, but it was in Solomon before he received it from God. Afterward, it was always there. So, if in a human, compared to God, albeit a very small one, once wisdom is placed in the heart, it does not leave. Whatever is believed usefully is believed to be wisdom proclaimed, whether in writings or in crafted buildings and paintings it is seen, and in all arts, it is praised. How much more in God, who is entirely wisdom and who received it from no one?
This wisdom, I say, which He always had, He created when He decided to produce it from His heart through the making of the heavens and the earth. So that the heavens and everything in them, which did not exist, came into being, not so that He would begin to be wise, for He always existed. He created the earth and everything in it, which did not exist, not so that He would begin to have wisdom, which He already had.

280
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:08,506
But you, Serapion, who did not present the full chapter of this passage, listen to the whole chapter so that you may believe it aligns with my explanation.

281
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:12,178
The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways, in His works.

282
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:22,729
He established me before time began, before He made the earth, before He set the depths in place, before He brought forth the springs of water, before He set the mountains in place.

283
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:24,885
He gave birth to me before the hills.

284
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:34,620
Therefore, God, knowing that what was said, "He created me," could lead to the danger of blasphemy, added: "Before all the hills, He gave birth to me" (Proverbs 8:25).

285
00:42:34,620 --> 00:43:03,356
By this statement, what He said, "me," was interpreted by wisdom itself as "He created me."
Hence, it follows: When He prepared the heavens, I was there with Him; and when He set apart His throne, when He made the clouds firm above the winds, and when He placed the sure springs under the sky; and when He established the strong foundations of the earth, I was there arranging everything with Him, at which He rejoiced in my presence, as He delighted in the completed world (Proverbs 8:27-36).

286
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:11,674
And he added: Let the judges now tell the objector of this statement, which was made to teach that the Son of God is not the Son, but his creation.

287
00:43:11,674 --> 00:45:10,049
Let him say if, in the order I followed, I went through the entire text of the sentence, and if what wisdom itself said, "The Lord created me," it also added, "he begot me." Either believe that wisdom was always in the Father or show that God was without wisdom before he created it.
Serapion said: I admit and fully follow, as it is written by Solomon, "before all the hills, he begot me," therefore usefully adding to show that what he said, "He created me, he begot me," was clearly evident.
Arnobius said: You certainly recall saying in the previous conflict why I brought forward incorporeal examples.
So why are you now satisfied with teaching the beginning of God's ways through mountains and hills and visible works, unless you see the mystical sense of divine Scripture only in history?
And searching for the beginning of the ways, you did not look for the ways themselves, but let us teach that God is the creator not only by the judgment of letters but also by the instinct of our own natural consideration.
These are the ways of the Lord:
The first is faith, the second is hope, the third is love, the fourth is perseverance, the fifth is goodness, the sixth is fear of the Lord, the seventh is constancy, the eighth is patience, the ninth is gentleness, the tenth is rest, the eleventh is peace, the twelfth is obedience, the thirteenth is long-suffering, the fourteenth is holy solitude, the fifteenth is contempt for the belly, the sixteenth is study of the mind, the seventeenth is chastity, the eighteenth is kindness, the nineteenth is mercy, the twentieth is justice, the twenty-first is generosity, the twenty-second is the study of the knowledge of God's law, the twenty-third is the love of the best things, the twenty-fourth is contempt for temporal glory, the twenty-fifth is the affection for eternal glory.
These are all the ways of God, in which the Father himself walked daily, as he says through the prophet: "As I live, says the Lord, because I will walk in them, and I will be their Father, and they will be my sons and daughters," says the Almighty Lord.
(Leviticus chapter twenty-six, verse twenty-two; Second Corinthians chapter six).

288
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:19,560
In all these ways of the Lord, wisdom was created first, so that anyone who begins to have the wisdom of God first will not be able to walk in just one of these ways.

289
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:31,239
Therefore, these are the twenty-four ways, corresponding to the number of twenty-four elders Revelation 4:4, who assign each book, both of the New and Old Testament, to the one book of the twelve apostles.

290
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:38,986
These three books are offered to the Creator of the Trinity through three groups of people: those of virginity, widowhood, and marriage.

291
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:46,791
These three books, walking perfectly through their ways, stand firm in one faith, one hope, one love, and are consecrated in one baptism.

292
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:54,026
They cannot walk completely through their ways unless the Lord creates wisdom in their minds at the very beginning of the ways.

293
00:45:54,026 --> 00:47:01,419
Thus, the Psalmist says: "Make your ways known to me, Lord" Psalm 25:4, because he knew he could not walk these ways unless the Lord created wisdom in his heart. He prays to God, saying: "Create a clean heart in me, God" Psalm 51:12, because wisdom does not enter into a defiled soul, nor can it dwell in a body subject to sins.
The judges said: Arnobius has more than perfectly satisfied the testimony of wisdom, and that it has always been in God and is created in the minds of those who wish to walk the paths of virtues. If there is anything Serapion would like to ask, let us hear it.
Serapion said: If God first cleanses the heart and does not create wisdom, they are not at fault if they do not walk in the ways of God.
Arnobius said: Let the state of our discussion remain sound: for we began to deal with God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and this testimony was assumed to show that the Son of God is a creation. So far, we have shown that wisdom has always been in God, and it is right that our attention should turn to the deity and our Trinity; however, here we also give a brief response. God is not at all a respecter of persons Romans 2:11; Acts 10:34.

294
00:47:01,704 --> 00:47:12,598
He examines the minds, interests, and thoughts of the children of Adam, and knows very well what he should bring forth from his treasure: and as his fairness requires, so shall he give.

295
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:20,371
Therefore, as the Apostle says: There is no favoritism with God (Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25), he himself says: Are all apostles?

296
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,372
Are all prophets?

297
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,845
(First Corinthians 12:29; Ephesians 4:11).

298
00:47:23,845 --> 00:47:35,681
Just as you are certain that there is no favoritism, be just as certain that he is not unjust in distribution: whatever he has done concerning the human race cannot be found blameworthy for any reason.

299
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:40,569
Indeed, David wept and pleaded for a pure heart to be created in him (Psalm 51:12).

300
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:48,224
Imitate David in repenting and in receiving a share in a pure heart, and you will rejoice in the wisdom of God the Creator in you.

301
00:47:48,224 --> 00:47:51,286
Now, let us return to the testimonies you mentioned.

302
00:47:51,286 --> 00:48:02,652
Serapion said: I recalled the stone which the builders rejected, because it has become the cornerstone (Psalm 118:22; Matthew 21:42); this was done by the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes.

303
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:10,660
Arnobius said: Three things must be sought in this place: who are the builders, what are they building, and who are rejecting the stone.

304
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:19,081
For the Jews, building upon the foundation of the prophets, not only rejected our Lord Jesus Christ from this building, but also crucified him.

305
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:45,816
He was rejected by unbelievers (Acts 4:11), but made by God into the cornerstone, to create two in himself (Ephesians 2:15); and the perfect structure, begun by Moses and completed in Christ from the law and the prophets, whose new covenant walls, having their own side walls, were dedicated by this cornerstone into one Church by him who said to Peter: Upon this rock, I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not overcome it (Matthew 16:18).

306
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:50,590
Matthew sixteen eighteen. Serapion said: Tell us, what are the gates of hell?

307
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,823
Arnobius said: There is still an explanation about the rock that must be given.

308
00:48:54,823 --> 00:48:58,145
When that is finished, we will answer about the gates of hell.

309
00:48:58,145 --> 00:49:03,611
Serapion said: The completeness of the sentence requires you to briefly speak about the gates of hell.

310
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:12,614
Arnobius said: We call those the gates of hell which the rulers of this world have placed as the entrance to eternal death with riches, passions, impieties, and crimes.

311
00:49:12,614 --> 00:49:19,258
Through these gates, idol worshippers enter the temples of demons, fearing the most worthless idols instead of the true God.

312
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:24,885
They also have other gates through which they enter the synagogues' council, denying Christ the Lord God.

313
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:30,190
They have other gates through which they enter into the teachings of heretics and schismatic sects.

314
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:37,049
They have other gates through which adulterers, fornicators, kidnappers, thieves, blasphemers, and all sorts of criminals enter.

315
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:43,105
To these rulers, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit cried out: Lift up your gates, etcetera.

316
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,712
Psalm twenty-four seven, nine.

317
00:49:44,712 --> 00:49:54,036
For they are truly not temporal, in which immortality reigns so that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it; for through them the King of glory entered with all his own.

318
00:49:54,036 --> 00:50:01,431
If you ask who this King of glory is, you will hear the Holy Spirit himself saying: The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.

319
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:12,577
There are the gates of justice placed in the ears of people, to which the voice of the Catholic faith calls out, saying: Open to me the gates of righteousness, and having entered them, I will praise the Lord.

320
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:14,506
Psalm one hundred eighteen nineteen.

321
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:24,527
However, once the word enters through the ears into the city of the soul, it shows it the gate of eternal life; and it says, This is the Lord's gate, the righteous shall enter through it.

322
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:35,244
It is shown by our Lord Jesus Christ to have a narrow entrance in this world, but it is affirmed that whoever walks through his very narrow and tight path will reach the wide entrance of eternal life.

323
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:40,657
It is indeed affirmed by the Lord's own mouth, encouraging and saying: Enter through the narrow gate.

324
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:45,283
The gate that leads to life is narrow, and only a few find it.

325
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:49,898
The road that leads to death is wide and spacious, and many enter through it.

326
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:58,709
(Matthew 7:13)
The judges said:
Arnobius, having been asked about the gates of hell, reveals to us both the realms of the underworld and of heaven.

327
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:02,664
If anything else is prepared by Serapion, let it be brought forth.

328
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:06,200
Serapion said:
I will lead you to the promised explanation.

329
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,137
Let us return to the place from which we strayed.

330
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:22,562
Arnobius said:
Examples of the Lord's incarnation are revealed, sometimes as a stone, sometimes as a mountain, sometimes as a rod, sometimes as an angel, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a priest, and also through testimony.

331
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:34,010
But there are many other images, which the Catholic understanding, walking along clear paths and shining with the splendor of the Holy Spirit, finds more through prayer than through analysis.

332
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:50,551
For the rock, by which God's people in the desert were delivered from the danger of thirst, the blessed apostle Paul declared to be Christ, saying:
Our ancestors drank the same spiritual drink; they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and the rock was Christ.

333
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:58,223
(First Corinthians 10:4)
And in the Song of Moses, it is said:
Honey flowed for them from the rock, and oil from the solid rock.

334
00:51:58,223 --> 00:52:03,677
(Deuteronomy 32:13)
And in the eightieth Psalm:
He satisfied them with honey from the rock.

335
00:52:03,677 --> 00:52:10,749
(Psalm 81:16)
Also in the seventy-eighth Psalm:
He brought forth water from the rock and made waters flow like rivers.

336
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:16,743
(Psalm 78:16)
Also in the twenty-sixth Psalm, the Church says of Christ:
You lifted me up on a rock.

337
00:52:16,743 --> 00:52:21,058
(Psalm 27:5)
And in the thirty-ninth, he says:
He set my feet on a rock.

338
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:24,714
(Psalm 40:2)
And in the sixtieth:
You lifted me up on a rock.

339
00:52:24,714 --> 00:52:32,565
(Psalm 61:2)
And in the one hundred thirteenth:
He turned the solid rock into pools of water, and the rock into fountains of water.

340
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:37,779
(Psalm 114:8)
And in the one hundred fourth:
He struck the rock, and waters flowed out.

341
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:49,706
(Psalm 105:41)
And in the Song of Solomon, the Holy Spirit, inviting the Church to Himself, says:
Come to me, my love, my bride, my beautiful one, and in the shelter of the rock, continued as a wall.

342
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:51,025
(Song of Solomon 2:14)

343
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:58,082
And in Isaiah, the voice of the Son of God says: "I have set my face like the strongest stone" (Isaiah 50:7).

344
00:52:58,082 --> 00:53:04,061
Also in the prophet Ezekiel, the Lord says: "I have made your face harder than flint and rock" (Ezekiel 3:9).

345
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:09,492
And in the Gospel, the Lord speaks of the wise man who builds his house on the rock (Matthew 7:24).

346
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:19,475
But what rock is this, if not the one the Apostle refers to when he says: "No one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 3:11)?

347
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:28,306
There are many other passages as well--too many to list--that teach us the rock stands for the unchanging and absolutely steadfast will of our Lord Jesus Christ.

348
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:41,306
He showed this will in his flesh: being tempted by the devil, betrayed by a disciple, nailed to the cross, given gall to eat, vinegar to drink, pierced with a spear, and humiliated even to death--the death of the cross (Philippians 2:8).

349
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:48,602
Even though he endured all these things as a perfect man, he never responded with the impatience or weakness typical of human nature.

350
00:53:48,602 --> 00:54:00,450
Through this, he showed that God, through a man, won victory for humankind--just as the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians: "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:57).

351
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:54,041
Serapion said: "Your explanation troubles me, because in how you interpret the incarnation of our Lord, you seem to be talking about a man and not about God."
"Since you have explained one of the eight symbolic images referring to the Lord--this one about the rock--so clearly with evidence from divine Scripture, I ask that you complete the remaining seven examples. Once you've done that, I will need only one explanation to understand the Lord's incarnation fully. Because this, I believe, is the whole reason for this debate."
"That's why I don't think you remembered that, at the beginning, I said I would deal with you as if you were one of the Arians, or Eunomians, or Sabellians, or Macedonians--and that I would entertain their claims while staying true to my faith."
"So, as I said, I entered this conflict with you to see whether I would find you caught in some error. If I did, then I would deal with you over that specific issue, the one where you and I disagree."

352
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:09,497
Nothing remains for me now except for you to explain those eight comparisons you mentioned in Christ, so neatly and blamelessly, that you explain the complete divinity in Christ, revealing so that you do not bring me anything less by not showing the full divine nature.

353
00:55:09,497 --> 00:55:17,536
Show now why you only mentioned eight, when there are many other representations in Christ that could have been mentioned, as you said yourself.

354
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:22,393
Arnobius said: I considered that many kinds of sacraments are contained in this number.

355
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:33,781
Firstly, how in the Old Testament, when it was the first day, on which it said, "Let there be light" (Genesis 1:3); also in the New, it was worth being made first and eighth by the resurrection of Christ.

356
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:50,473
For just as on that day the heavens were opened so that manna was poured out (Exodus 16:14 and 16), David was also the eighth son who became a slayer by defending sheep from wild beasts (First Samuel 16:11), and by defending the people, he became the slayer of the giant (First Samuel 17:49 and 50).

357
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:54,437
Firstly, when he was still a child, he was made Christ by Almighty God.

358
00:55:54,437 --> 00:56:05,379
And also in the Gospel, eight beatitudes are mentioned by the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 5), even though there were many other virtues that could have deserved the merit of beatitude.

359
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:23,969
Therefore, by this example, it seemed to me that while preserving the multitude of comparisons, I should bring forth only these eight allegories, certain that from these that have been brought forth, the others which have not been brought forth can be inquired into, understood when found, and usefully explained by reason of speech.

360
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:36,921
Serapion said: First through the occasion of my objections, you explained the stone; and when I followed the evangelical chapters, in which the Lord says, "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28), you brought forth other matters.

361
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:46,468
So that you don't seem to have brought these examples just to avoid those testimonies, after presenting what you have brought forward, you will give me an answer about them.

362
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:49,203
Then we will finally approach our specific conflict.

363
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:58,357
Arnobius said: We should have focused on this one point, on which you truly disagree, that is, on the fact that you do not wish to beneficially believe in the Catholic faith.

364
00:56:58,357 --> 00:57:05,511
That in Christ our God, there are two true and perfect natures, and to confess the true Son of God as well as the true human Son of man.

365
00:57:05,511 --> 00:57:10,876
But how do you foresee being rightfully and lawfully overcome, so that you do not feel defeated alone?

366
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:28,183
Having taken on the roles of many heretics within yourself, so that when your fellow citizens reproach you for being defeated, you may say you were overcome not by us, but by the victory of Christ, who was able to open through the amazing and most powerful gateway of the Catholic faith the sharpness of many heretics within you.

367
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:39,493
Serapion said: The wise one conquers deceit when he drives it out from within himself; and he who conquers is twice victorious, because he receives a crown for his faith assertion and gains the reward of the people.

368
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:47,804
Arnobius said: This all must be attributed to the mercy of God: we can achieve nothing by our own efforts, but we find all through the grace and mercy of God.

369
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:56,011
I will now address the remaining seven forms of analogy I proposed; then I will explain the two questions you raised from the Gospels, with the Lord's help.

370
00:57:56,011 --> 00:58:05,269
As for you, recalling those same figures with a keen memory, begin to bring them up one by one, so that I can teach from the sacred volumes that I have provided these examples.

371
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:14,843
Serapion said: First, it is clear that you have explained about the rock; secondly, you promised to show from the Scriptures that the aforementioned mountain is the Lord, so show it.

372
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:25,101
Arnobius said: In Exodus we read: The Lord said to Moses: This will be a sign for you, that I am sending you to bring my people out of Egypt, and you will serve me on this mountain (Exodus 3:12).

373
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,206
Serapion said: This is about Mount Sinai.

374
00:58:28,206 --> 00:58:37,203
Arnobius said: If you only seek history, enter the Synagogue; but we accept history so that we can explain what is within the history spiritually.

375
00:58:37,203 --> 00:58:51,191
We follow the Apostle Paul, the teacher of the Gentiles, appointed by the Lord, who stirred our minds and hearts to the point that he clearly declared the rock, which truly is a rock from which water was produced, to be Christ.

376
00:58:51,191 --> 00:58:53,225
He said: But the rock was Christ.

377
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:54,642
First Corinthians 10:4.

378
00:58:54,642 --> 00:59:35,251
The mountain where the glory of God appeared, where there was a fire that gave light but did not burn, where God spoke with man face to face,
Exodus 33:11,
where the Majesty itself wrote the will of its law on two stone tablets with its finger in the Ten Commandments;
where the book of Deuteronomy, that is, the second or repeated law, was written;
the mountain where God made known to man that in the beginning God made heaven and earth,
Genesis 1:1,
and all that is in them, and many other signs of holiness, which would take too long to say;
about which the Psalmist says: The mountain of God, a rich mountain, a mountain in which God is pleased to dwell.

379
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:37,840
Indeed, the Lord will dwell there forever.

380
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,764
Psalm 68:16-17.

381
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:45,173
To show what he was talking about in the fifteenth psalm, he said: Who shall rest in your holy mountain?

382
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:48,007
and added: He who enters without blemish, etc.

383
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:48,808
Psalm 15:1-2.

384
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:56,141
And who else is without blemish, except the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.

385
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,189
First Peter 2:22.

386
00:59:57,189 --> 01:00:02,612
For in the twenty-third psalm: Who, he said, shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord?

387
01:00:02,612 --> 01:00:05,262
And replied: The one with clean hands, etc.

388
01:00:05,262 --> 01:00:06,063
Psalm 24:3-4.

389
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:10,500
And again David sings: Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, etc.

390
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,704
; and adds: Mount Zion, the sides of the north, etc.

391
01:00:13,704 --> 01:00:14,505
Psalm 48:1-2.

392
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:22,023
Hence Isaiah also says: In the last days, the mountain of the Lord will be made manifest, and all nations will come to it.

393
01:00:22,023 --> 01:00:22,701
Isaiah 2:2.

394
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:28,062
David also says in another place: Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, etc.

395
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:28,801
Psalm 125:1.

396
01:00:30,096 --> 01:00:34,916
And so, in another psalm it says: "Mount Zion, where you dwell" (Psalm 68:17).

397
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:41,034
And about that mountain, it also says: "This is the one his right hand has acquired" (Psalm 78:54).

398
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:47,709
His right hand has acquired a man, one who is perfect, by the power of the Lord's right hand (Psalm 118:16).

399
01:00:47,709 --> 01:01:09,463
The "right hand" of the Father refers to his action and is shown by what he does.
It was the invisible Son himself who, by his omnipotence, accomplished this great work. By taking on human nature, he made himself visible so that he could say: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father, because I am in the Father and the Father is in me" (John 14:9-10).

400
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:27,448
Serapion said: "Then the Jews who saw him also saw the Father?"
Arnobius replied: "The Jews saw him, yes, but not in that way. That is why the Holy Spirit says to Isaiah: 'Go and tell this people: You will look, but not truly see; you will hear, but not understand' (Isaiah 6:9; Acts 28:26).

401
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:32,701
And that is why the Lord says to them: 'You do not know me or my Father' (John 8:19).

402
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:40,611
But to his disciples he said: 'Blessed are the eyes that see what you see and the ears that hear what you hear' (Matthew 13:16).

403
01:01:40,611 --> 01:02:07,063
"
So then, if the answer seems to be coming from the mountain imagery, remember that this is the third example I gave.
Serapion said: "First you mentioned the stone, second the mountain, and third the tower, using them as symbols."
Arnobius said: "You have remembered well. Just make sure you also accept the truth behind them. He is the one spoken of in Psalm 61: 'You have been my strong tower against the enemy' (Psalm 61:3).

404
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:15,468
This is the same tower the Holy Spirit speaks of through Isaiah: 'I built a tower in the middle of the vineyard I planted' (Isaiah 5:2).

405
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:23,378
The Holy Spirit himself explains this vineyard, saying: 'The vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel' (Isaiah 5:7).

406
01:02:23,378 --> 01:02:31,845
And the tower that he says he built in the middle of it, according to Holy Scripture, is the Son of Man, whom he established for himself.

407
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:37,098
Solomon speaks of him too, saying: 'Wisdom has built herself a house' (Proverbs 9:1).

408
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:49,768
He, who is the wisdom of the Father, built for himself, in the womb of the Virgin, a perfect man: Jesus, who was predestined to be the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness (Romans 1:4).

409
01:02:50,448 --> 01:02:53,342
I, 4), not according to the pollution of marriage.

410
01:02:53,342 --> 01:03:01,099
Serapion said: Don't call it the pollution of marriage, because marriage has no pollution, but fornication should be called pollution.

411
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:07,814
Arnobius said: Marriage has pollution, but no crime; whereas fornication is proven to have both pollution and crime.

412
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:10,419
But let me prove the indication of the tower.

413
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:27,034
The Lord Himself says in the Gospel:
A landowner planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, built a tower in it, and rented it to farmers (Matthew 21:33), who did not hesitate to beat the servants sent to them by the landowner; finally, they killed the son sent by the landowner himself.

414
01:03:27,034 --> 01:03:33,691
With this said, they are asked by the Lord, When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?

415
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:40,059
And the Jews answered, He will bring those evil men to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other farmers.

416
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:47,932
And the Lord said to them, Truly I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruit.

417
01:03:47,932 --> 01:03:48,106
18.

418
01:03:48,106 --> 01:03:57,310
Serapion said: Now, in the fourth place, the speech showing the Lord prefigured by the rod is to be sought, so that your promise may be explained in its order.

419
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:07,093
Arnobius said: In Exodus, the Lord speaks to Moses: I will stand on the top of the hill, and with this rod, which is in your hand, I will perform all the signs of power.

420
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:11,377
David also says in the spirit: The rod of equity, the rod of your kingdom.

421
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:13,056
Your rod and your staff, etc.

422
01:04:13,056 --> 01:04:13,866
(Exodus 4:17).

423
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:17,977
And David appeals to the Lord, saying: Remember your congregation, etc.

424
01:04:17,977 --> 01:04:21,392
You have redeemed the rod of your inheritance (Psalm 74:2).

425
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,765
He also says: The rod of your power, etc.

426
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:24,634
(Psalm 45:6-7).

427
01:04:24,634 --> 01:04:29,902
More clearly, it is said about the Lord: A rod will come forth from the root of Jesse, etc.

428
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:30,712
(Isaiah 11:1).

429
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:36,906
All of these were fulfilled in Him who was made from the seed of David according to the flesh (Romans 1:3).

430
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:46,227
Serapion said: Keep the discussion of the flesh, about which there will be a true and open conflict for us: now strive to explain the examples you have proposed.

431
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:53,926
For you have already mentioned why you set the rod in the fourth place, now, in the fifth place, explain why you mentioned the Angel.

432
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:06,927
Arnobius said:
Listen to the Lord speaking to Moses:
"Look, I am sending my angel ahead of you, to protect you on your entire journey: heed him and obey him, for my name is in him" (Exodus twenty-three, twenty).

433
01:05:06,927 --> 01:05:13,986
Malachi, however, says:
"The lips of the priest will preserve knowledge, for he is the angel of the Lord" (Malachi two, seven).

434
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:28,881
Therefore, regarding all the saints who are tested and suffer in this world for the sake of the holy name, it is said:
"This poor man called, and the Lord heard him," meaning the holy people, "and delivered him from all his troubles" (Psalm thirty-four, six to seven).

435
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:36,996
The Lord sent an angel to encamp around those who fear Him, meaning those who fear the Lord, and He will deliver them, that same righteous people.

436
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:51,447
Daniel also recalls an angel descending from heaven into the midst of the flames to rescue three youths from the fire, when Nebuchadnezzar had said about him, "The fourth one I see is like the Son of God" (Daniel three, forty-nine); his testimony is not a lie.

437
01:05:51,447 --> 01:06:00,840
David also, in his own psalm, says this about God:
"He sent his angel and took me from my father's sheep, and anointed me with his mercy" (Psalm seventy-eight, seventy).

438
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:08,844
Serapion said:
Move quickly to the sixth, in the likeness of a man, the Son of God seen before: for what was said about the fifth is sufficient.

439
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:17,904
Arnobius said:
We read in the book of Joshua that at that time, when Jericho was in a continuous battle, he saw a man standing before him with a sword in his hand.

440
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:28,242
When he approached him, he said to him:
"Are you one of us, or one of our adversaries?"
The man replied:
"I am the commander of the army of the Lord" (Joshua five, thirteen to fourteen).

441
01:06:28,242 --> 01:06:37,968
Likewise, the prophet Isaiah says:
"The people will cry out to their God in their distress, and the Lord will send them a man who will deliver them" (Isaiah nineteen, twenty).

442
01:06:37,968 --> 01:06:47,139
Daniel also says:
"I saw in the clouds of heaven the Son of Man coming to the Ancient of Days, and he was given authority over the kingdom" (Daniel seven, thirteen).

443
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:56,532
Daniel himself says:
"A vision like a man stood before me, and he called the archangel Gabriel, and told him to explain the vision I was seeing" (Daniel eight, sixteen).

444
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:06,755
Similarly, Daniel himself says: "I lifted my eyes and saw, and there was a man dressed in linen, and his waist was wrapped with gold" (Daniel 10:5).

445
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:12,081
Likewise, Ezekiel says: "I saw a form like a man above the throne" (Ezekiel 1:26).

446
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:22,602
Also, he says: "I saw someone calling to a man dressed in linen, who was girded with a golden belt around his waist, ascending above the cherubim" (Ezekiel 10:2).

447
01:07:22,602 --> 01:07:46,956
Serapion said: "From abundant testimonies, things that are in doubt should be clarified: but now, seeking brevity, proceed to the seventh similarity of the priesthood you mentioned."
Arnobius said: "In the First Book of Kings, God speaks to Samuel, saying: 'I will raise up a faithful priest for myself, who will act according to my heart in everything'" (First Samuel 2:35).

448
01:07:46,956 --> 01:07:52,996
And David says: "The Lord swore an oath to David and will not regret it, etc." (Psalm 110:4).

449
01:07:52,996 --> 01:08:18,974
Serapion said: "These two testimonies you provided about the seventh similarity are clear: now explain the eighth, that the covenant of God can be understood as the Son of God."
Arnobius said: "The Book of Genesis says that the Lord spoke to Noah and his sons: 'Behold, I establish my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you'" (Genesis 9:10).

450
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:28,586
Later, after other things, God says to Noah and his sons: "I will remember my covenant between me and you and every living creature" (Genesis 9:15).

451
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:39,497
Also, the voice of God says to Noah and his sons: "I will place my rainbow in the clouds of the sky, and I will remember my covenant between me and you" (Genesis 9:16).

452
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:55,863
Also, through Isaiah, the Lord says: "My covenant will be with life and peace, law and truth will be in his mouth, and wickedness will not be found on his lips. Dwelling in peace, he will guide you and turn many away from their iniquity" (Malachi 2:5).

453
01:08:55,863 --> 01:09:05,735
Also, through Isaiah, the Lord says: "I, the Lord, have called you and made you a covenant to the nations, to open the eyes of the blind" (Isaiah 42:7).

454
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:18,334
Also, through Isaiah, the Lord says: "Listen to me, and you will eat what is good, walk in his ways, and your soul will be saved, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you" (Isaiah 55:3).

455
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:24,872
Here is what the Lord says through Isaiah: I will make an everlasting covenant with you in peace and faith.

456
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:27,459
All these things foreshadow the one Son of God.

457
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:34,999
There are also many other types of figures, which, if necessary to bring forth, I will present with the authority of the Holy Scriptures.

458
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:41,878
The judges said: With both rational manifestation and legal authority, the defenses presented by Arnobius have been affirmed.

459
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:50,519
So much so that even Serapion, who is on the opposing side, admitted with his own words, without us having to speak, that everything is as Arnobius defended.

460
01:09:50,519 --> 01:10:01,086
And just as the evening finds the argument begun at dawn, after the silence of the night's rest is over, and God has graciously restored the day to us, the confession of both sides will arise.

461
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:09,011
Serapion said: I ask that our discussion today ends here, so Arnobius can explain why he wanted to bring forth these foreshadowings of our Lord.

462
01:10:09,011 --> 01:10:21,614
Arnobius said: How is it that among these foreshadowings, even the one for whom they were made, the Son of God, is considered to be accounted for, when the image of truth is in this man, whom the Virgin bore, and is truth itself?

463
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:32,346
And just as the true Son of God is God, so the true son of man is a man, not mixed in such a way that the nature of each is changed, but remaining in the truth of divinity and in his omnipotence.

464
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:39,500
The invisible Son of God having his union with man is believed to have presented the true God, the Son of God, for our liberation.

465
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,527
For otherwise, God could not be seen with fleshly eyes.

466
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:50,837
Whoever denies that God is in Christ, that is, in the man, is the Antichrist, as written in First John, Chapter Two, verses twenty-two and forty-three.

467
01:10:50,837 --> 01:10:57,332
However, anyone who denies something from these likenesses may be found either blameworthy or perhaps not blameworthy.

468
01:10:57,332 --> 01:11:04,156
For they deny the rock, they deny the rod, they deny the mountain, and whatever else can be said to be applicable to Christ.

469
01:11:04,872 --> 01:11:09,731
Whoever denies the perfect man and perfect God cannot be freed from eternal damnation.

470
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:22,162
Similarly, anyone who dares to think or believe in two sons of God-one born from the Father before time without a mother, and another born of the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary-will be struck with eternal condemnation.

471
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:44,764
However, our confession of faith, from the apostolic seat of Saint Peter, which began with the Apostle himself, is this: Believing in one Son of God from two perfect and complete substances-from the visible and invisible, from the physical and non-physical, from the comprehensible and incomprehensible, from the passible and impassible, from mortal and immortal-we profess the true God and true man.

472
01:11:44,764 --> 01:11:50,923
Declaring and believing that God is in Christ, and Christ Jesus in the glory of the Father, has one divinity.

473
01:11:50,923 --> 01:12:00,585
Just as there is one sight in two eyes, one hearing in two ears, one sense of smell in two nostrils: thus, in these two substances of God and man, there is one Son of God.

474
01:12:00,585 --> 01:12:12,677
Certainly, as I know my attentive listener is careful to remember me referring to the one substance of the Father and the Son, one sight in two eyes, one hearing in two ears, and one sense of smell in two nostrils.

475
01:12:12,677 --> 01:12:18,723
Now to you, it should not seem inappropriate to believe in one person in two substances, not one substance.

476
01:12:18,723 --> 01:12:29,628
Indeed, I have tried to show this, so that just as we believe there is one substance in three persons, so in the two substances of God and man, we believe there is one person of the Son of God.
