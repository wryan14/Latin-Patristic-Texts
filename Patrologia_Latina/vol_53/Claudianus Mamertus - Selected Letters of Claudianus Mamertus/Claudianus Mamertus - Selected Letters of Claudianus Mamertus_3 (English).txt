Letter Three 
To the most learned man, 
 SAPAUDO the rhetorician, from CLAUDIANUS.

Greece, the teacher of all disciplines and arts, advanced greatly in noble studies and encompassed almost the entire world with its diverse teachings because no one there who produced anything of good quality lacked deserved honor. Hence, some men, nearly surpassing the nature of mortals, used their exceptional talents everywhere, tirelessly investigating hidden truths, and comprehensively grasped the underlying causes of origins and the fixed limits of temporal substances, not only within the worldly but also entering the heavenly secrets.

I mention this now because, since the time of our ancestors, there has been a decline in the good arts, and humanity, neglecting the cultivation of the mind—which alone sets us above animals—serving luxury and wealth, has fallen into laziness and ignorance. 
 Thus, completely losing virtue along with learning. For, not only does no one aspire to innovate anything, but no one even seeks to unlearn without you alone. 
 Should we attribute this to human negligence or nature? 
 If we blame nature for this evil, can it be said that the human race differs from itself, or are the talents not the same as they were before?

Did Cicero, the greatest orator of his age, possess his natural talents at birth and, disregarding both domestic and civic matters, travel to Greece to acquire richer knowledge? 
 Or did perhaps Plato, the pinnacle of philosophy, content with his natural talent, not travel as far as Egypt and to the Brahmins of India and to the heirs of Pythagorean teachings, diligently seeking knowledge? 
 I remain silent about others because neither time nor the task at hand allows it. I will say one thing without a doubt: our age lacks not talents, but studies. 
 I would mourn the death of these studies with a sorrowful epitaph if you had not revived the same with your venerable profession, commendable diligence, sharp intellect, and fluent eloquence. 
 The more admirable this good is to me, the more desperate it was.

For I see that the Roman tongue is not only a matter of negligence but also a source of shame for Romans, with grammar being pushed away as if it were barbaric, dialectic feared as if it were an Amazon ready to fight with a drawn sword, rhetoric not being accepted as if it were a grand lady in a small space, and music, geometry, and arithmetic being despised as if they were three furies. Following this, philosophy is viewed as a sort of ominous beast. 
 But these points are brought up to praise you; for if many shared your dedication to studies, you would indeed be one of many, if not the best.

However, without any insult, in our Gaul, you alone are the one and only of your profession. 
 This statement is neither flattery nor adulation. Indeed, I am incapable of flattery, nor do you need false praise. The sweetness of your declamations mixed with virtue, in the manner of Attic honey, which by its very nature contains healing, strength, and sweetness, cannot be removed or separated from my mind. Just as a bird and industrious bee on the hills of Hybla draws down nectar from the heavens and infuses it into created flowers, feeding and nurturing the offspring of its virginity with the abundance of honeycombs: so you, drawing from the greatest authors as if from high mountains, gather the most learned and fragrant and fertile ideas like flowers, filling them with the honey of your intellect, producing honeycombs of eloquence, from which your numerous beloved students are formed. 
 Who, imbued with the nectar of Greek studies, and fed as if with Attic honey, when they begin to spread their wings, will themselves produce honeycombs of eloquence.

Just remember that the duty of teaching is an inheritance from your ancestors, and thus you must strive even more abundantly for knowledge.

Here is the translation of the provided Latin text into modern, easy-to-understand English:

A vast amount of knowledge from your ancestors has flowed into you. You should also remember the ancient nobility of the city of Vienna, 
 of which you are a citizen and scholar. You must fulfill your double duty, 
 which is to respond both to the fathers and to your country. At the end of this discussion, I very familiarly ask that you disregard the childish trifles of new theories, and do not waste any time reading them. 

Note: Perhaps while. And so reads Fabricius in Bibliotheca Medica, volume one, page one thousand seventy-eight.

They spin some ridiculous speeches of hollow words and weaken oratory strength with their applauding harmonies. Let Naevius and Plautus serve you for elegance, 
 Cato for seriousness, 
 Varro for expertise, 
 Gracchus for sharpness, 
 Chrysippus for discipline, 
 Fronto for grandeur, and Cicero for acquiring eloquence. 

For anyone among the recent writers who has written something worth remembering did not read these new things either. Therefore, those authors should be revisited and remembered, from whom those we admire have been able to benefit. 

Yet, I have perhaps added a bit too familiarly as a testimony to our friendship. But let your kindness pardon this boldness of love.
