00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,416
History of Predestinarianism
by Jacques Sirmond

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:13,702
Therefore, to freely express my suspicion and offer it to the readers for judgment, I truly believe that the Predestinarian heresy or Predestinarian heretics never existed in reality.

3
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:21,618
On the contrary, the Catholic doctrine taught by Saint Augustine and Prosper was maliciously misrepresented by the Massilians under the name of this heresy.

4
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:28,266
Thus, those so-called Predestinarian heretics were actually Saint Augustine, Prosper, Hilary, and all who followed their teachings.

5
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:34,203
The Semipelagians labeled them with that name and categorized them among the heretics without explicitly naming them.

6
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:38,872
Consequently, a credulous posterity has shunned certain individuals as predestined heretics.

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:50,594
Hincmar asserts in his letter to Pope Nicholas (Letter 17) and in his book on Predestination against Gothescalcus that the Predestinarian heresy, which originated from a misunderstanding of Saint Augustine's words, began in Africa.

8
00:00:50,594 --> 00:01:00,946
Prosper also indicated the same when writing to Augustine about what was troubling the Gauls regarding his opinion on predestination, stating that similar issues had already been stirred up within Africa.

9
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:07,238
Neither of them explained what was being said in Africa, but Augustine taught in the penultimate chapter of the Retractions.

10
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:11,247
Specifically, it was in the province of Byzacena, among the monks of Adrumetum.

11
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:22,411
When Saint Augustine's 105th letter to Sixtus, a priest of the Roman Church, was delivered to them, some were led by its reading to believe that Augustine was preaching grace in such a way that it denied human free will.

12
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:29,972
They adhered to this doctrine, which subsequently became the doctrine of the Predestinarians, while others fought against it in defense of free will.

13
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,761
Amidst the discord and turmoil in the monastery, two monks sought Augustine's advice.

14
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,394
Floro, who had caused the disturbances with his incorrect interpretations, was sent as well.

15
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:44,632
The holy and gentle Augustine didn't just explain the true meaning of his book to those who came to him.

16
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:49,216
Instead, to benefit everyone, he wrote two letters to Abbot Valentinus and the other monks.

17
00:01:49,216 --> 00:03:02,750
He also added two books: "On Grace and Free Will" and "On Rebuke and Grace." In these books, he refutes their errors and teaches that human free will was wounded, not destroyed, by Adam's sin, and that divine grace heals rather than perishes.
The Catholic faith holds that free will is not denied, whether for good or bad choices, but it also doesn't attribute the ability to achieve anything without God's grace. The Pelagians erred in the former, and the Predestinarians in the latter. To avoid both errors, Augustine advises them with these words in letter forty-seven:
"Do not turn to the right or to the left."
This means, do not defend free will so strongly that you credit it with good works without God's grace, as the Pelagians did; nor defend grace in such a way that you feel secure in it and love evil works, as the Predestinarians did not fear.
The beginnings of the Predestinarians, although they did not yet have this name, were found among the monks of Adrumetum. Although Augustine's testimony is sufficient evidence about them, I will add another source that Augustine would likely not deny. This comes from Evodius, the bishop of Uzalis, a man very close to Augustine in character, morality, and their shared teachings. Some of his letters are known among the Augustinian ones, and we have learned from the Corbeiensis and other manuscripts that the book "On Faith Against the Manichaeans," commonly attributed to Augustine, is actually his.

18
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:08,180
So, when he was informed about the turmoil in Hadrumetum, he wrote a letter to Valentinus and his monks.

19
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:20,697
In this letter, he briefly indicated, following the sense and example of Saint Augustine, what they should think about free will and reminded them of the writings of the elders, advising them not to criticize what they do not understand too quickly.

20
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:49,302
He said, "Honorable brothers have told us that some questions have arisen among you about free will and God's justice. We indeed praise your zeal, but we do not want it to be contentious. For contention stirs up disturbance, but zeal requires piety."
"The first man created, Adam I mean, had the fullest sense of free will. But where free will was wounded, it was weakened. Therefore, there is now free will in man, but it is wounded. Hence, it is said: 'My strength has weakened in poverty, and the light of my eyes is not with me' (Psalms thirty:11; thirty-eight:11).

21
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:54,932
To recover this, the Savior Christ was sent as a physician to save what was lost and to heal what was corrupted.

22
00:03:54,932 --> 00:04:36,809
"
And after other things, he said: "Let the holy ones of God read the sayings of the elders, as I have already said, who have a devout affection for divine grace; and when they do not understand, let them not quickly criticize, but pray to understand. I omit the rest, which are found in the book of Saint Maximinus of Trier, all worthy of light, except that they are slightly corrected. But these suffice for our matter."
Now, when we noticed that the heresy of the Predestinarians was detected among those monks and was reproved by Augustine, who does not see that they are mistaken who contend that this very doctrine was of Saint Augustine, and although he himself attests that his book was misunderstood by them, they do not hesitate to affirm that it is well understood?
These things happened in Africa, and henceforth in Gaul.

23
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,763
In the year 429, disturbances in Africa soon spread to Gaul, becoming significantly more serious and longer-lasting.

24
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:46,566
This was largely due to Augustine's views on absolute predestination by God.

25
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:53,471
Many people, including several who were highly pious and learned, particularly in Marseilles and other places, strongly opposed this view.

26
00:04:53,471 --> 00:05:00,225
They found it new and unusual, and believed it strengthened the Predestinarians' heresy, which was already beginning to spread in Gaul.

27
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:06,280
This opposition led Prosper and Hilary to write letters to Augustine, seeking his advice and help on this complex matter.

28
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,733
Prosper especially highlights this by recounting the common objections and arguments raised by the opponents.

29
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:58,115
He says:
"This plan of God's calling, by which, before the beginning of the world or during the creation of the human race, a distinction is said to have been made between those chosen and those rejected, according to which the Creator pleased, some are made vessels of honor and others vessels of dishonor, removes the care of rising again from the fallen, and brings about indifference among the saints; because any effort is unnecessary on either side, if the rejected cannot enter by any effort, nor the chosen fall by any negligence.
For whatever they do, nothing can happen to them other than what God has determined; and with uncertain hope, their course cannot be steady, since if the election of the predestinator holds something different, the intention of the one striving must be in vain.
Therefore, all effort and virtues are removed, and under the name of predestination, a certain fatal necessity is introduced."

30
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:04,824
All these points clearly relate to the teachings of the Predestinarians, who wanted Augustine to be recognized as their originator.

31
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:14,755
It's evident that the discussion centered around these topics, and Hincmar was correct in stating that the Predestinarian heresy, which emerged in Gaul, was known to Augustine through Prosper and Hilary.

32
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:24,538
Augustine wrote the books On the Predestination of the Saints and On the Good of Perseverance in response to Prosper and Hilary, affirming that these works were composed to counteract the same heresy.

33
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:37,062
Therefore, it is pointless for modern supporters of the Predestinarians to cunningly try to redirect the issue, as if the matters Prosper and Hilary addressed were unrelated to predestination and instead pertained to other controversies with the Pelagians.

34
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:45,231
This idea is clearly refuted by the words of Prosper we have cited, along with other statements where he concludes his letter, explaining what he seeks from Augustine.

35
00:06:45,231 --> 00:07:25,003
"Grant, most excellent Father," he says, "that you would deign to clarify what is obscure in these questions: how free will is not hindered by this pre-operating and cooperating grace; how, through this preaching of God's purpose, none of those who need encouragement are hindered, nor given an excuse for negligence if they despair of being predestined. How to refute the fact that, when revising previous opinions on this matter, nearly all are found to have accepted the same view, namely that God's purpose and predestination are based on foreknowledge."
What else does Prosper seek from Augustine in these words and in his entire letter, but to elucidate the complexities of divine predestination? Thus, it was this issue that nearly all of Prosper's responses to the objections of the Gauls were focused on.

36
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:44,830
If Prosper and Hilary, along with other good men in Gaul, were troubled by the teachings of the Predestinarians—which they rightly abhorred—being attributed to Saint Augustine or derived from his books, and worked hard to learn from Augustine how to clear his name, what do you think they would judge about those today who cannot distinguish the heresy of the Predestinarians from Augustine's doctrine?

37
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,876
Augustine did not disappoint their wishes.

38
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,896
As we've already mentioned, he wrote two books on this matter.

39
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:59,590
Prosper, both during Augustine's life and even after he was received into heaven, did his utmost to defend and support him, explaining the misunderstood or falsely attributed criticisms of his books.

40
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,631
But as the problem grew stronger and more dangerous after Augustine's death, Prosper believed stronger remedies were needed.

41
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:16,299
If we inquire about Prosper and Hilary's journey to Rome to meet with Pope Celestine—why they went and what they did—today's Predestinarians and their leaders would say they went to combat the remnants of the Pelagians.

42
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:21,073
This is what they commonly claim, and it was necessary for them to speak this way for their cause.

43
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:33,300
But we prefer to listen to Hincmar, who says they went on behalf of the Predestinarians to complain about them and obtained from Celestine a condemnation of the new heresy, as he narrates in a letter to Pope Nicholas, which has already been mentioned.

44
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:43,529
He says the old Predestinarian heresy, which first arose in Africa and later in Gaul, around the same time as the Nestorian heresy, was defeated by the authority of Pope Celestine and the zeal of Saint Prosper.

45
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,229
For where and when was it defeated, and when did Prosper appeal to Celestine if we deny it happened during this time?

46
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:54,928
We cannot ignore that the Predestinarian heresy was made known to Celestine and that he disapproved and denounced it.

47
00:08:55,415 --> 00:10:33,503
Our lack of knowledge does not allow us to ignore the words of the author of our predestination, especially when he speaks in the preface of a book falsely attributed to Saint Augustine, saying:
"Finally, a book has come into our hands that falsely claims to be Augustine in its title, while showing itself to be heretical in its text.
Who does not know that Augustine was always an orthodox teacher?
The most blessed memory of Pope Celestine, when this book was once offered to him, held it in such abhorrence that he ordered it to be condemned to perpetual silence.
Tell me, I beg you, why he shunned the book, why he judged it unworthy of Augustine if not for the heresy it contained?
Now, let us show that his letter, which he wrote to the bishops of Gaul after hearing their delegation, cannot be twisted into a different sense.
What does he write?
I will summarize briefly and sufficiently for our purpose:
'Our sons, Prosper and Hilary, whose concern for our God is commendable, have reported to us that certain presbyters there are permitted to engage in disputes divisive to the Churches, bringing undisciplined questions into the open and stubbornly preaching things contrary to the truth.
But we more justly blame your affection when they have the opportunity to dispute above you.
Therefore, such individuals should be corrected.
If this is the case, let novelty cease to attack antiquity, let restlessness cease to disturb the peace of the Churches.'
And after other things.
Nor can we be surprised if these individuals now dare to attempt such things against the living, who also strive to disrupt the memory of our resting brothers.
We have always had Augustine, a man of holy memory, in our communion for his life and merits, and never has even a false rumor of sinister suspicion touched him.
We remember him to have been of such great knowledge that he was considered among the best teachers even by my predecessors.
Therefore, everyone has rightly held him in common regard, as he has always been both loved and honored by all."

48
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:35,175
Here I now call upon fair judges.

49
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:47,791
The undisciplined questions raised by these priests, which Celestine mentions, along with those Prosper wrote to Augustine about, and those to which he responded in the chapters to the Gauls, all pertain to the matter of predestination we indicated.

50
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:53,516
What novelty, as he says, challenges antiquity if not the new and unheard teachings attributed to predestination?

51
00:10:53,516 --> 00:11:00,406
Finally, Augustine, taking on the role, was never tarnished by any rumor of sinister suspicion; that is, he was never accused of heresy.

52
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:09,222
Who does not see that this was said because of the Predestinarians' heresy, of which they claimed Augustine as their author, both publicly boasting and lying in forged books?

53
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:11,704
But let us also listen to Patriarch Photius here.

54
00:11:11,704 --> 00:12:13,616
His words on this matter are in chapter 54 of the Library: "After the death of the holy Augustine, some of the clergy began to establish an impious doctrine, speaking ill of Augustine, and slandering him as having introduced the annihilation of free will. But Celestine of Rome, writing on behalf of the divine man and against those stirring up heresy, put a stop to the spreading error."
He says, after the holy Augustine died, some from the clergy began to establish an impious doctrine and speak ill of Augustine, pursuing him as if he had introduced the end of free will. But Pope Celestine, writing on behalf of the holy man and against the instigators of heresy to the bishops of that region, checked the nascent error.
I am not unaware that these things are mentioned by Photius along with those of the Pelagians. But it is clear that these cannot be understood as referring to the Pelagians, whose new error at this time was not new. However, no one is ignorant of the fact that the Predestinarians' slander against Augustine was their own, claiming that his view was that there was no free will in man, and that free will was completely removed by him. Therefore, these things must absolutely be referred to them.

55
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:23,217
So, let’s stick with what we’ve established: we're discussing the Predestinarians, who were condemned by a letter sent to the bishops of Gaul, prompted by Celestine, Prosper, and Hilary.

56
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:28,016
Until now, the case of the Predestinarians was handled quietly, more through actions than words.

57
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:35,864
Although their doctrines were debated and rejected in Africa and Gaul, the term “heresy” wasn’t yet used, and their followers weren’t called Predestinarians.

58
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:43,662
After this, the matter erupted openly, was publicly classified as heresy, refuted by many writings, and finally condemned and suppressed by synodal decrees.

59
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:48,461
The first to write against them was the author of the “Predestinarian,” as he himself testifies.

60
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:52,410
His book was published a few years ago from the library of Saint Mary of Reims.

61
00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:00,857
He discovered these people hiding among the Catholics and found a book falsely attributed to Augustine to support the heresy, which was held by them as a kind of symbol.

62
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:13,404
He published and refuted it, with a preface listing all heresies and adding Predestinarianism in these words:
The ninetieth heresy, which we mentioned in our preface as falsely attributed to Bishop Augustine, has taken the name of the Predestinarians.

63
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:19,703
They define the election of the good and the rejection of the wicked as determined by God, not by any human effort or neglect.

64
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:24,651
They do not believe that God's laws can be kept by those who strive or broken by those who neglect.

65
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:34,499
They say that even if someone predestined to evil wants to do good, they cannot achieve it; and that someone predestined to good, even if they are negligent, will be led to good against their will.

66
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:37,648
They claim that the water of baptism does not cleanse all sins.

67
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:45,446
They say: Grace precedes free will so much that a person receives it before they ask, finds it before they seek, and it is opened to them before they knock.

68
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:54,694
They say that no one comes to faith in Christ unless they are dragged by the Father against their will, citing: No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them John 6:44.

69
00:13:55,343 --> 00:14:01,844
They say that everything happens not in reality, but in hope, as the Apostle says: "Hope that is seen is not hope" (Romans 8:24).

70
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:06,883
They also apply this to mysteries and say: Things that are perceived seem to exist, but they do not.

71
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:10,309
They say: Adam did more harm to humanity than Christ did in helping.

72
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:17,313
For, they say, what Adam harmed remains in such a way that neither the suffering of Christ nor the sanctification of baptism can remove it.

73
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:29,911
Struck and astonished by such a clear testimony against them, the defenders of the Predestinarian doctrine had only this one thing to weaken it, that the author is, as they want, a Semipelagian, by which label they also brand others who support them.

74
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:39,334
They do not realize that sensible people see that this has nothing to do with our question, in which we are asking only whether the Predestinarians were ever among the number of heretics.

75
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:46,892
And if this is asserted by the orthodox, we embrace it more religiously; but it is not immediately false if those who affirm it hold a false doctrine.

76
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:56,869
For what, shall we deny all credibility to the writers of ecclesiastical history like Eusebius of Caesarea, or Socrates and Sozomen, because Eusebius was an Arian, and the latter two were Novatians?

77
00:14:56,869 --> 00:15:06,393
If we do not reject them in the histories they narrate, why should we not accept the author of Predestinarianism and the rest, even if they were as they are depicted, in historical matters?

78
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:19,897
Finally, even if I do not say now that those they accuse were free from blame, why do they especially resent them for the sake of the Predestinarians' cause, if it is evident that some of their views on Predestinarians were the same as others whom they cannot suspect?

79
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:39,600
Unless perhaps they think Saint Augustine was not orthodox enough, who, as said, refuted the monks of Adrumetum for denying free will in man; or the thirty bishops who gathered at the Council of Arles to condemn the error of predestination; or Caesarius and his companions, who pronounced anathema in the second Council of Orange against those who believed that some are predestined to evil.

80
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:48,521
But if they do not dare to criticize these people, they should stop abusing our author and instead lament that his name, which deserves to be known, remains obscure.

81
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,786
Regarding Hyginus being mentioned by Hincmar, that is a mistake.

82
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:55,918
The manuscript of Hincmar included in our edition did not have the author's name.

83
00:15:55,918 --> 00:16:04,030
The name Hyginus, which appears at the beginning of the first book, is not the author's, as we have stated, but one of those who compiled catalogs of heresies.

84
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:11,478
However, in the manuscript of the rich Augia, whose copy we later saw in Rome, the author's name was indeed written, but incorrectly, as Primasii.

85
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:12,856
This mistake is not recent.

86
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:17,855
As the age of the manuscript testifies, it arose long ago through the carelessness of some critic.

87
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:33,415
When this critic noted in Isidore's book about Famous Men that Primasii, the African bishop, had written three books about Heresies to Bishop Fortunatus, he rashly concluded that these three books were by our Predestinator and arranged the Augian manuscript to label each book as Primasii's to Fortunatus.

88
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:39,945
This was absurd, since Primasii came a whole century later, and Isidore's words indicate the very different nature of each work.

89
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:46,016
They say that a third copy exists in the Dunensian monastery of the Flemings, but without an inscription, as I believe.

90
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,434
Therefore, who wrote our Predestinator remains unknown to this day.

91
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:55,658
Among those who placed the Predestinarian heresy in second place is Prosper in the Pithoean Chronicle, edited by Pithoeus.

92
00:16:55,658 --> 00:17:02,290
Whether he was the same as Prosper of Aquitaine or another, we shall soon see: what is certain now is that they had the same name.

93
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,973
This is acknowledged by old copies, and he is called thus by Sigebert of Gembloux, where he writes about the death of Saint Martin.

94
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:17,237
His words about the Predestinarians and their origin are: The Predestinarian heresy, which is said to have begun with Augustine, started to spread in these times.

95
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,552
All eyes are on the manuscript from the Library of St.

96
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,670
Victor, which Pithoeus used for his edition.

97
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:27,919
This manuscript in Paris has a matching copy that was once owned by Antonius Oisel and is now with his heirs.

98
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,082
But why, they ask, did Pithoeus choose a poorly understood reading from Augustine's books instead of what was in the manuscript?

99
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,719
Honestly, I wouldn't have done it.

100
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:45,156
However, considering that a man of sharp judgment found both readings in Oisel's manuscript and knew one was the intended meaning of both, he preferred the reading that was less open to criticism.

101
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:46,408
What is there to reproach?

102
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:54,497
Do they really believe the author of this Chronicle was so foolish and careless that he would label something a heresy and then want Augustine to be seen as its leader?

103
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:58,831
The truth is, they cannot bear to accept a reading from Augustine that they misunderstand.

104
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:15,683
For us, following the example of the monks of Adrumetum, it is firmly established that, no matter how much they flatter themselves with their understanding of Saint Augustine's books, and twist and reshape his opinions and judgments at will, they will never succeed in making him support their errors, except through false and corrupt interpretation.

105
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:20,065
But returning to Pithoeus' Chronicle, what shall we say to those who deny it is by Prosper?

106
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,606
On what grounds do they deny it?

107
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:23,628
Because, they say, he is called Tiro here.

108
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:42,118
Those who argue this way do not know that the surname belonged to Prosper of Aquitaine, and that Pithoeus, aware of this, added "Tiro" on his own, believing that the same person authored both Chronicles.
Although we reluctantly depart from the opinion of such a great man, we rather side with those who oppose it. For this Chronicle was not by Prosper Tiro, but by Prosper, as stated.

109
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:50,908
It seems unreasonable that he would write the same Chronicles of the same times twice, and it's hard to believe that if he did, he would write them so differently.

110
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:55,867
Additionally, what Prosper reported about the Predestined could not apply to or fit the Aquitanian.

111
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:59,173
So, there were two Prospers living at the same time, both in Gaul.

112
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:07,338
Both wrote a Chronicle and ended it at the same point: the eighth year of Emperor Valentinian, the consulate of Anthemius, and the capture of the City by Genseric.

113
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:16,555
However, there is a difference in their Chronicles: Prosper of Pithou seems to have only added an appendix to Eusebius and Jerome, not composing more than what was published by Pithou.

114
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:25,571
On the other hand, Tiro Prosper, according to Victorius, Gennadius, and Cassiodorus, began his work from Adam and the beginning of the world, continuing it to the Vandalic plunder.

115
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:31,081
This Chronicle, as the content shows, is an epitome of Eusebius’s Chronicle, extending to Jerome's supplement.

116
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:43,354
It's sometimes called the epitome or excerpts of the Chronicles because Prosper took everything from there, except he inserted the consuls’ lists from the baptism of Christ in their proper places and added other things up to the end of his work.

117
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:59,132
Just as Eusebius and Jerome's Prosper did, Victor of Tunnuna in Africa, a bishop, continued Prosper's history, starting his appendix where Prosper left off in the first edition of his Chronicle, from the eighteenth year of Emperor Theodosius and the consulate of Albinus, which is considered the year 444 of Christ.

118
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:05,795
It wouldn't be credible that the first edition did not go beyond this point, as Victor shows that Prosper left off in this consulate.

119
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:09,251
The published copies of his work, which all stop there, support this.

120
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:15,011
Therefore, we must admit that the eleven years leading up to the capture of the City were added in a later edition.

121
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,115
Gennadius of Marseilles succeeded Prosper.

122
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:23,276
Although he did not write before everyone else, he was the first to publicly brand the Predestined with the mark of heresy.

123
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:26,811
These doctrines can be summarized in the following words.

124
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:34,803
The Predestinarians believe that God did not create all humans with the intention of saving everyone, but rather to fill the world with a multitude of people.

125
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:45,475
Even though He says in a general proclamation, "Come to me, all who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28), He does not call everyone with the intention of having all follow His voice.

126
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:50,584
Not all who respond to the call, inspired by Him, receive the perseverance to continue in good works.

127
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:58,677
Instead, after many labors and fruits of righteousness, if they are not among those destined to be saved, their strength to persist in doing good is taken away.

128
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:11,879
Conversely, those predestined to eternal life, even if they have wallowed in unbelief or committed many sins for a long time, will eventually receive the opportunity to believe in God, live according to His commandments, and join the community of the righteous.

129
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:24,575
With such a definition, they aim to teach that God shows favoritism towards people, dragging some to salvation against their will after many evil deeds, and rejecting others after good deeds, compelling them towards evil so that they perish eternally.

130
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:30,595
When this statement came to light, it caused incredible tumults and disturbances among the new defenders of old errors.

131
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:37,373
They tried everything to undermine Gennadius's faith because they could not refute his testimony and wanted to diminish his authority.

132
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:38,991
But what do they have to oppose?

133
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:45,264
If you ask the head of the school, he accuses Gennadius of being the first to dare classify the Predestinarians as heretics.

134
00:21:45,264 --> 00:22:00,691
However, this is false, as both Prosper and the author of "Predestinati" had done so before him, not to mention others.
Moreover, what fault is there in professing the truth before others? They claim that Isidore showed it was not true, as he disapproved of and corrected Gennadius's book for this reason.

135
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:11,054
For this reason, Jansenius says that Saint Isidore of Seville, a bishop, included the Pelagians that Gennadius omitted and left out the Predestinarians that Gennadius had included.

136
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:13,724
He mentions this in Volume 1, Book 8, Chapter 23.

137
00:22:13,724 --> 00:22:18,682
So much frivolity and fiction in so few words, which are immediately disproven by one fact!

138
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:26,582
It is well-established that Gennadius did not publish any book on heresies; he only added an appendix of four heresies to Saint Augustine's book.

139
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:39,876
Let's hear from Hincmar, who recounts more well-known and truthful information in his book on Predestination, Chapter 1: “Regarding eighty-eight heresies,” he says, “the magnificent doctor Augustine wrote, and finally added the Pelagian heresy.

140
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:47,013
From there, Gennadius of Marseilles, a very learned priest, added the ninetieth heresy of the Predestinarians to the Pelagian sect.

141
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:53,878
He then listed the ninety-first, the Nestorian heresy, followed by the Eutychian heresy, and after that, the Timothean heresy.

142
00:22:53,878 --> 00:23:02,486
”
Although we don't need Hincmar's support here, as we have suitable evidence in ancient books, including the codex from the library of Saint Victor of Paris.

143
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:13,001
In this codex, after the end of Saint Augustine's book on heresies, Gennadius's appendix is included, as we mentioned, in this manner:
“The account of Saint Augustine, bishop, on heresies ends.

144
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:16,870
These that follow are set by Saint Gennadius of Marseilles, priest:
90.

145
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,703
The Predestinarians are those who say that God, etc.

146
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:19,866
91.

147
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,318
The Nestorians say that the Holy Virgin, etc.

148
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:22,481
92.

149
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,879
The Eutychians say that the Lord Jesus, etc.

150
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,042
93.

151
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:31,035
The Timotheans say that the Son of God was truly born as a man from the Virgin Mary, but not so much one, etc.

152
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,051
Then next: The book on heresies ends.

153
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:37,083
So it is clear that Gennadius did not go further, yet included these four.

154
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:37,137
”

155
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:53,467
For this reason, I really cannot quite understand how it happened that in the most famous edition of the works of Saint Augustine in Louvain, when this appendix from the Gemblacensian codex of Gennadius was brought forth, the author's name was omitted, the Predestinatiana was left out, and only three were mentioned.

156
00:23:53,467 --> 00:24:05,810
Furthermore, since it is clear from the above that Gennadius, even if he had considered it, did not actually write a book on heresies, it becomes evident how Jansenius, with what credibility, calls a non-existent book as having been plundered by Isidore.

157
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:14,120
By what right does he argue that the Pelagians were not listed by Gennadius as suspected heretics, when Gennadius did not need to repeat what Augustine had already stated?

158
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:23,012
Gennadius had no reason to hesitate to mention the Pelagian heresy, having openly called Pelagius himself a heresiarch in the catalog of illustrious writers of the Church, Chapter 42.

159
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:30,398
With what futile and empty guesswork does he finally declare that the Predestinatians were overlooked by Isidore, who he claims found them in Gennadius?

160
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:31,516
Where did he find them?

161
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:34,237
Not in the book on heresies, which he had not published.

162
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:35,549
Therefore, in the appendix.

163
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,493
But he had not seen the appendix either.

164
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:47,066
Read and compare what is written about the Nestorians and the Eutychians by both, and you will not find even a trace that the great emulator of Gennadius, in your judgment, borrowed from Gennadius.

165
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:50,613
Why then does Isidore not mention the Predestinatians among the heresies?

166
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,265
Because he had not read Gennadius.

167
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:54,889
Therefore, these are deceptive and ridiculous trifles.

168
00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:02,761
If they do not deceive the more cautious, they are surely miserable to the ears of the Marcellinas and Priscillas, who become accustomed to such fables from them.

169
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:12,188
Of all the wounds inflicted on the Predestinatians, none was more serious than that by which they were affected by thirty bishops in the Council of Arles, and again later in the Council of Lyon.

170
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:21,567
And although the acts of neither council remain today (which is common to them with many others), there still remain some things from the Council of Arles that also support the Council of Lyon.

171
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:30,945
Indeed, the letter from Faustus, Bishop of Riez, to Lucidus, a priest from the sect of the Predestinarians, was written around the year 475, during the council held in Arles.

172
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:33,828
Then, Lucidus's booklet was presented to the same council.

173
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:38,898
Finally, another letter from Faustus to Leontius of Arles, who presided over the council, was written.

174
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:43,869
We will present these three documents in order, which can somewhat make up for the loss of the acts.

175
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:51,275
First, the letter from Faustus to Lucidus, where he encourages him to retract his errors, warning that he will be condemned by the council otherwise.

176
00:25:51,275 --> 00:26:59,127
It reads as follows:
"Great love is to want to correct the error of a somewhat careless brother with the help and grace of God, rather than, as the highest bishops contemplate, to suspend him from unity.
What can I say about this opinion, as you express it in your letters, when I could never, even with many gentle and humble conversations in person, attract you to the path of truth?
Therefore, when speaking about God's grace and human obedience, we must decide to walk the royal path, neither inclined to the left nor rushing to the right.
I was amazed to hear from your reverence that no one ever, under religious profession, has written or preached against the Catholic faith, when many have believed their multiple and profane errors should be recorded in the monuments of writers, even though they gloried in the Christian name.
Briefly, then, I will say, as much as I can speak with an absent person, what you ought to think with the Catholic Church.
That is, always to join the work of the baptized servant with the grace of the Lord, and to detest with the doctrine of Pelagius anyone who asserts predestination excluding human effort.
Therefore, anathema to him who, among the other impieties of Pelagius, presumes to contend that man is born without sin and can be saved by effort alone, and who believes that he can be freed without the grace of God."

177
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:10,458
Curse upon those who claim that a person, who was solemnly baptized with faithful confession and professed the Catholic faith but later fell due to various worldly pleasures and temptations, perished in Adam and original sin.

178
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:15,088
Likewise, curse upon those who say that a person is condemned to death by God's foreknowledge.

179
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:24,791
Likewise, curse upon those who say that someone who perished did not receive the chance to be saved, whether it be a baptized person or a pagan of that age who could have believed but chose not to.

180
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:29,568
Likewise, curse upon those who say that a vessel of dishonor cannot rise to be a vessel of honor.

181
00:27:29,568 --> 00:27:34,888
Likewise, curse upon those who say that Christ did not die for all, nor does He want all people to be saved.

182
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:47,103
But when you come to us in the name of Christ, or when you are summoned by the holy priests, then, if the Lord commands, we will provide testimonies in their proper places, making clear what is Catholic and destroying what is contrary to Catholics.

183
00:27:47,103 --> 00:28:05,032
However, we truthfully and confidently assert through the illumination of Christ that a person who perished through fault could have been saved by grace if they had not denied the labor of obedience to that grace; and that a person who reached the end of good completion through the service of grace could have fallen through negligence and perished through fault.

184
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:11,484
Therefore, guided by Christ as we walk this path, we assert the labor of dutiful service after grace, without which we are nothing.

185
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:22,763
But we completely reject the arrogance and presumption of labor; so that by sweating with all our strength, grace in us is not nullified, and whatever we receive from the hand of the Lord, we proclaim to be a gift, not a payment.

186
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:30,693
Knowing that the fruit of this labor is a matter of duty, not merit; saying with the evangelist: We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty Luke 17:10.

187
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:38,771
Let your unanimous response to these points, briefly mentioned due to the brevity of the letter, either accept or reject them as the conversation comes back around.

188
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:46,669
However, anyone who does not follow this measure of truth, with grace preceding and effort arising, will be worthy of being barred from holy thresholds.

189
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:54,709
Nevertheless, I, holding onto your unwavering goodness with total sincere kindness, wish for you to remain within the embrace of Mother Church, rejecting this error.

190
00:28:54,709 --> 00:29:01,092
If it is quickly rejected, it will seem to have been out of ignorance, but if stubbornly defended, it will be considered blasphemy.

191
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:11,811
For we turn grave reproach back onto the author if we say that He was unwilling to give the possibility of attaining salvation to the one who perished, especially to the one who could already grasp the liberty of choice.

192
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:17,122
Since we cannot deny that He will condemn the transgressor of His command in the examination of His judgment.

193
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:21,945
For how can someone not be guilty of losing something if they were never responsible for having it?

194
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:27,012
Thus, we will appear to be opposing God's justice, whose grace we first affirmed, if we sin against Him.

195
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:32,080
I am keeping a copy of this letter with me, to be presented at a gathering of holy bishops if necessary.

196
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,924
If your brotherhood thinks this should be accepted, send it back signed with your own hand, or respond by subsequent writings that you entirely disapprove of it.

197
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:50,302
If you are unwilling to send it back signed, as I said, your very silence will clearly show that you persist in error, and you will thus compel me to present the matter to public gatherings concerning your person.

198
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:55,808
Therefore, respond in accordance with what I have directed, whether you acknowledge or reject it without evasion.

199
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:59,170
By another hand, Faustus, I have read and signed a copy of my letter.

200
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:06,235
For this is the true and genuine subscription of the letter, bearing only the author's name, which both Hincmar and the best old books represent.

201
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:17,246
However, the other one, which has been published in editions so far, noting the names of Auxanius and other bishops along with Faustus, although not lacking the support of some old codices, is undoubtedly spurious and foreign.

202
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:24,207
This has led some into error, believing that the letter from Faustus was signed at the Council of Arles or the Council of Lyon.

203
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:32,427
This has given our adversaries an opportunity to falsely claim that we attributed the name of the council to this one letter from Faustus, which is completely false.

204
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:35,716
Lucidus, prompted by this letter from Faustus, came to his senses.

205
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:46,178
After much hesitation, he recognized his error and retracted it according to the council's judgment, offering a document of this kind:
Your correction is for the public good, and your judgment is like medicine.

206
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:51,659
Therefore, I consider it the best remedy to accuse my past errors and cleanse myself with a saving confession.

207
00:30:51,659 --> 00:31:34,904
Hence, in accordance with the recent decrees of the council's preaching, I condemn with you the belief that human obedience should not be joined with divine grace; that after the fall of the first man, free will was completely extinguished; that Christ the Lord and our Savior did not accept death for the salvation of all; that the foreknowledge of God compels a man to death violently, or that those who perish do so by God's will; that anyone who sins after receiving legitimate baptism dies in Adam; that some are destined for death and others for life; that from Adam to Christ, no one from the Gentiles was saved by God's first grace, that is, by the law of nature, until the coming of Christ; and that free will was lost in the first parent; that the patriarchs and prophets, or the greatest of the saints, even before the time of redemption, lived in paradise.

208
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:38,142
I condemn all these beliefs as impious and filled with sacrilege.

209
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:52,043
However, I assert the grace of God in such a way that I always join human effort and striving with grace, and I declare that human free will is not extinguished but weakened and impaired, and that the one who is saved is in danger, and the one who perishes could have been saved.

210
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,587
Christ, who is also God and Savior, in His immense goodness, offered the price of His death for everyone.

211
00:31:57,587 --> 00:32:04,612
He does not want anyone to perish, as He is the Savior of all, especially those who believe in Him, rich in blessings for all who call on Him.

212
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:18,367
And because conscience must be satisfied in such matters, I recall previously stating that Christ came for those He knew would believe, following the words of the Lord, which say:
The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.

213
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:24,056
And this: This is the cup of My blood of the new covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

214
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:30,191
Or that of the Apostle: Just as it is appointed for people to die once, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many.

215
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:42,214
But now, with the authority of sacred testimonies, which are abundantly found throughout the divine Scriptures, and based on the teaching of the elders, I freely admit that Christ also came for the lost, because they perished against His will.

216
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:48,794
For it is not right that the immense riches of His goodness and divine benefits should be limited only to those who seem to be saved.

217
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:57,403
For if we say that Christ brought remedies only for those who are redeemed, we would seem to absolve the unredeemed, who are evidently to be punished for spurning redemption.

218
00:32:57,403 --> 00:33:08,684
I also assert that, through the reason and order of the ages, some were saved by the law of grace, others by the law of Moses, and others by the law of nature which God wrote in everyone's hearts, in the hope of Christ's coming.

219
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:15,215
However, from the beginning of the world, from the original bond, none were absolved except by the intercession of His sacred blood.

220
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:26,446
I also profess that eternal fires and infernal flames are prepared for mortal sins, because divine judgment rightly follows those who persist in human faults, which they justly incur if they do not believe with all their heart.

221
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,425
Pray for me, holy and apostolic Fathers.

222
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:34,758
Lucidus, the presbyter, signed this letter with my own hand, affirming what is asserted in it, and condemning what is condemned.

223
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:45,135
From this letter of Lucidus to the Synod of Arles, we not only learn the names of the thirty bishops who were present, but also the main points of doctrine they established against the Predestinarians.

224
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:51,804
The third document we mentioned is the letter of Bishop Faustus to Leontius of Arles, or the preface to his books on Grace and Free Will.

225
00:33:51,804 --> 00:34:02,512
This letter indicates that the synod was convened against the Predestinarians, and that Faustus' books were composed according to the mandate of Leontius and the synod, to arrange and explain what the synod had declared.

226
00:34:02,512 --> 00:35:20,733
Faustus therefore prefixed a title to these works, which identifies the Predestinarians and their errors with these words:
"A Profession of Faith against those who say that some are drawn to life and others are cast into death solely by the will of God, thereby asserting fate like the pagans and denying free will like the Manicheans."
The preface begins as follows:
"For the pastoral concern, blessed Father Leontius, you convened a council of the highest bishops to condemn the error of predestination, and you have conferred this to all the Churches of Gaul. However, by assigning me the task of organizing the matters you most learnedly brought forth in public discussion, you have considered your holy reputation too little, and you have burdened me with the judgment of charity, and yourselves with the risk of choice."
In these words, the preface concludes. In this small work, after the subscription of the Council of Arles, detecting new errors, the Synod of Lyon required some additions to be made.
From these points, it is clear that the three items we mentioned pertain to the Council of Arles:
The letter of Faustus to Lucidus was written when the council had already begun,
Lucidus' petition was submitted during the council,
and Faustus' books with his preface were written after the council ended.
At this point, the pursuit of truth and the love of innocence reminds us to feel sorrow for Faustus of Riez, and to show the reverence due to a holy and renowned bishop as is proper. For who would not be grieved for Faustus, who was admired and honored by all in his time, whom Sidonius (Book

227
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:25,683
In letter 9, epistle 8, Ruricius praised him as an outstanding teacher and an excellent pastor.

228
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:32,712
Hilary of Arles respected him so much that he placed him between himself and bishops Theodore and Maximus, even when he was still an abbot.

229
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:39,437
As a bishop, he earned the respect of all his fellow bishops, and Pope Hilary considered him worthy to co-preside at the Roman synod.

230
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:48,388
I ask, who can tolerate the fact that Faustus, who refuted the errors of the Predestinarians according to the synod's decision, is now being harassed and slandered as a heretic?

231
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:58,046
This is being orchestrated by John Maxentius, a Scythian monk, who secretly supported the heresy of Eutyches and schemed against the Council of Chalcedon along with Hormisdas and his legates.

232
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:10,637
It was Maxentius who, more than forty years after the Council of Arles, stirred up trouble in Constantinople over Faustus' books, loudly proclaiming them heretical, while others, led by Bishop Possessor of Africa, maintained that they were orthodox.

233
00:36:10,637 --> 00:36:20,599
When Possessor consulted Hormisdas about these books, and Hormisdas responded more mildly than Maxentius desired, Maxentius became so furious that he even attacked Hormisdas, calling him a heretic.

234
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,633
The hatred of Maxentius and his followers didn't stop there.

235
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:30,661
They tried to incite the exiled bishops of Africa in Sardinia against Faustus and sent these books to Sardinia to be refuted by Fulgentius.

236
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:37,741
It was easy to expect this from the Africans, among whom the heresy of the Predestinarians had originated and still held sway in many minds.

237
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:46,590
Even those free from this heresy were generally so affected that they found anything said against the Predestinarians suspicious and hateful, as if it were aimed at Augustine.

238
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:56,349
For what else did those hostile to Faustus' books insist upon, other than what Peter the deacon and others accused in their letter—that they were written against the doctrine of predestination?

239
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,625
But what does this have to do with Augustine?

240
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:13,182
Because Faustus did not deny the writings he had made about predestination, but opposed only those that either asserted fate or denied free will—both notions Augustine himself despised, and both often falsely attributed to Augustine, as Prosper testifies in his letter to Rufinus.

241
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:22,349
Furthermore, they say that Faustus' speech was clever and deceitful, aligning with the corruption of Pelagianism, and that he was exposed and refuted by Fulgentius, Avitus, and others.

242
00:37:22,349 --> 00:38:40,820
What could be a more fitting and truthful response for Faustus than his own well-known phrase, "IT IS NOT SO"?
Indeed, we cannot guess what deceptions Fulgentius detected in Faustus' writings or how he exposed the deep cunning they accuse him of in his seven books, as these books no longer exist. We know that Avitus of Vienne did not praise some things in other books by Faustus, but whether he wrote anything against these particular books, which Ado thought he might have, is uncertain.
Moreover, who does not know that the objections Maxentius made against Faustus were considered deceitful and insincere by many? There is no reason why we should listen to him about Faustus rather than Gennadius or Possessor, one of whom declared the work excellent and the other pronounced these books orthodox.
Even in our own time and in the previous century, there have been extremely learned and discerning men who supported their views. Among these, to name just two, the illustrious lights of the University of Leuven, Joannes Driedo and Ruardus Tapper, both called Faustus a Catholic teacher of the Church, and not without honor.
Not because they did not notice in Faustus' books some ideas where he seemed to attribute somewhat more to our nature at the beginning of faith and other matters than was appropriate, but because they understood that what he wrote at that time, when it was permissible to speak in such a way, did not require the loss of his Catholic reputation. Otherwise, what would become of so many Fathers, both Greek and Latin, who are in a similar position?

243
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:48,475
What about Augustine himself, who, writing on the Predestination of the Saints, admitted that he once held the same view about the origin of faith?

244
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:56,288
Either they must be condemned along with Faustus by the same decree, or whatever absolves them must also absolve Faustus, or a distinction must be made.

245
00:38:56,288 --> 00:39:04,974
Given these conditions, let contemporary theologians see where they stand, who, like Maxentius and his rival Gothescalcus, do not hesitate to consider Faustus heretical.

246
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:19,006
Out of reverence for the truth and the holy bishop, if a decision is to be made about Faustus's books, let them not presume to be wiser than the apostolic see and Gelasius and Hormisdas, who were content to call them of lesser authority, that is, apocryphal, not heretical.

247
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:30,828
Among those who, following Prosper's example, championed divine grace in Gaul after his death, the first was Caesarius of Arles, a bishop who was not only a passionate admirer of Saint Augustine’s teachings but also of his person.

248
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:39,258
So much so that near death, out of love for Augustine, he wished that his last day of life would be as close as possible to Augustine's last day, which he achieved.

249
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:50,668
Therefore, devoting himself more earnestly to this task, he focused on uprooting the errors of those who, remnants of the Pelagians as called by Prosper, later acquired the name Semipelagians in the schools of theologians.

250
00:39:50,668 --> 00:40:01,411
Although they were not entirely Pelagians and indeed opposed them, they indulged too much in free will, holding views on grace and free will contrary to the responses of earlier councils and the apostolic see.

251
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:06,088
From the various works of Saint Augustine, he presented arguments to refute or inform them.

252
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:12,873
He summoned neighboring bishops and nobles for the dedication of a basilica to approve these arguments and ensured they signed them.

253
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:16,317
This is the second Synod of Orange, held in the year of Christ 529.

254
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:23,050
Although convened by chance and for another reason, the Church holds it in such high regard that it has utmost authority among all.

255
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:29,985
Although many opposed Caesarius' teachings on grace with differing opinions, all their attempts were ultimately futile.

256
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:39,674
This occurred during the time of Pope Boniface, as Cyprian explains in the Life of Caesarius Book 1, when Pope Boniface confirmed Caesarius' decrees and the decisions of this synod.

257
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:43,367
Cyprian recounts: Many rivals arose to oppose his teachings on grace.

258
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,973
But what a joy to be emulated!

259
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:53,965
Indeed, whispers and malicious interpretations emerged from certain people in parts of Gaul against the preaching of this man of God, but their suspicions were in vain.

260
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:59,746
Because of this, bishops of Christ, driven by love, gathered in the city of Valence, beyond the Isère River.

261
00:40:59,746 --> 00:41:03,814
Due to his usual illness, the blessed Caesarius could not attend as planned.

262
00:41:03,814 --> 00:41:08,953
However, he sent distinguished representatives from the bishops, along with priests and deacons.

263
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:23,726
Among them, the great and renowned bishop Cyprian of Toulon stood out, affirming everything he said with divine Scriptures and proving from the ancient teachings of the Fathers that no one could achieve anything in divine progress unless first called by God's preceding grace.

264
00:41:23,726 --> 00:42:13,774
But while they sought to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God's righteousness, not remembering that the Lord said: "Without me, you can do nothing" John 15:5. And: "No one can have anything unless it is given to him from above" John 19:11. And the Apostle Paul: "By the grace of God, I am what I am" First Corinthians 13:10. And another: "Every good and perfect gift is from above" James 1:17. And the prophet: "The Lord will give grace and glory" Psalm 84:12. And that man truly regains free will when he has been redeemed by the liberation of Christ, under which absolution he can achieve the effect of perfection.
To their intentions, the man of God provided a true and evident reason based on apostolic tradition. For Pope Boniface of the Roman Church, of blessed memory, aware of this conflict, overrode the objections of the quarrelers and confirmed the pursuit of St. Caesarius with apostolic authority.

265
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:20,439
Thanks to Christ, the bishops of the Churches gradually received what the devil had tried to stop abruptly with violence.

266
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:27,746
In this very synod, which was entirely based on the teachings of Augustine, those who were predestined were condemned and struck with anathema.

267
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:33,265
This serves as a warning to those who do not distinguish Augustine's opinion from the predestinarian heresy.

268
00:42:33,265 --> 00:43:52,214
The words of the synod in chapter twenty-five are:
"We not only do not believe that any are predestined by divine power to evil, but also, if there are any who wish to believe such a great evil, we pronounce anathema upon them with all detestation."
But why, you ask, are the predestined mentioned when dealing with the remnants of the Pelagians? It's likely because the predestined, when attacked, used to incite ill will against their adversaries as if they were Pelagians. Similarly, the Semipelagians, when pressed, would raise the suspicion of the predestinarian heresy against those who opposed them. Therefore, the synod, to remove this suspicion from itself, denounces the most dreadful tenet of their heresy. The author of Predestined says:
"They say: Even if one who is predestined to evil wishes to do good, he cannot attain to good."
Among the synods that condemned the heresy of the predestinarians, the Synod of Orange is rightly and without controversy included. Although the intention was not to pursue the predestined outside Gaul, the opportunity allows us to briefly mention nearby Italy. A few years before the Synod of Orange, Ennodius, the bishop of Pavia, passed away. His letter to Constantius, found in book two, refutes someone who claimed that free will was given to man only for the worse. This was the error of the predestinarians, which Augustine had criticized at the very origin of the heresy in the monks of Adrumetum. He taught us in the book On Rebuke and Grace that we have free will to do both good and evil.

269
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:58,468
Ennodius proves and confirms this in the same letter I mentioned, so I've decided to include the entire passage here.

270
00:43:58,468 --> 00:45:36,811
He says,
"As you testify in writing, a man was found who sifted through the servants of Christ, as he himself promised would be done, under this pretext, claiming that the freedom of choice was given in only one part, which is the worse part.
O schismatic proposition, which, according to the Revelation, has blasphemies written on its forehead Revelation 13:1!
What kind of freedom is this, if it consists of only wanting what punishes; or why call it a choice if he asserts that only one part was granted?
If this were true, divine judgments would have no place. For what good could our God rightly seek from us if He had taken away our desire to seek Him?
But according to the Apostle: Is God unjust? Certainly not Romans 3:5.
Among men, one who demands from his subjects what he does not grant in power is out of line with righteousness: consider how this is perceived about God.
Where is that statement of the Apostle who cries out and testifies for the freedom of choice: 'I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out' Romans 7:18?
What else is this but saying: I know the right path to choose; but unless divine grace helps me as I walk, I will falter.
No one doubts, no one condemns that, with the grace of the author providing, even the path of righteousness is divinely revealed.
For grace is the leader and predecessor of good deeds when we are invited to rest with many encouragements, when we are told: 'Come, my children, listen to me' Psalm 34:11.
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you' Matthew 25:34.
'Where I am, there also will be my servant' John 12:26.
But unless our will, which is free, and our effort offer obedience to such warnings, we voluntarily fall into danger and hell, not by any command, but by our own choice.
Therefore, devotion brings a reward, and contempt brings punishment."

271
00:45:36,863 --> 00:45:45,227
Otherwise, there would not be just retribution, which either punishes those who sin out of necessity or rewards those who are unwillingly drawn to good work.

272
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:51,194
Therefore, we owe thanks to grace, which, unless we resist, infuses us with vital strength through hidden paths.

273
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:54,124
Yet it remains our choice to follow the shown benefits.

274
00:45:54,124 --> 00:47:35,024
For the path of crimes is not our master but a servant, as it is said about sins: "Its desire is for you" Genesis 4:7.
What does the entire expression of the prophet mean, adorned as if with garlands: "Do not be envious of evildoers" Psalm 37:1. "Do not put your trust in princes" Psalm 146:3. "Do not be like the horse and the mule" Psalm 32:9? And the Apostle: "Do not become slaves of men" First Corinthians 7:23.
What does the repeated "DO NOT" in the divine admonition imply, if it was not permitted to desire otherwise? Furthermore, even in the person of Christ, the same prophet's testimony supports us with the freedom of choice: "I desire to do your will, my God" Psalm 40:8. And elsewhere: "I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you" Psalm 54:6. And: "I will fulfill my vows to the Lord" Psalm 116:14. And again: "Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them" Psalm 76:11.
The example of the blessed Apostle, which he believes himself to be fortified by, is for us to follow if we consider what follows, when he said against the arrogance of the enemy: "By the grace of God I am what I am" First Corinthians 15:10. For soon after, lest he should heal fleeting glory in such a way that he would fall from truth by a long interval, the wise architect added: "I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me" First Corinthians 15:10. This is to say: Christ found in me someone he could reward richly or abundantly.
For divine grace is not poor, but it is thought to be diminished by a certain poverty or thinness of our merits. It is then not considered to flow in its own channels when our dry vein receives nothing from its courses. Oh, if the constraints of a letter would allow the mysteries of the sacred volumes to be revealed! But I fear that one who finds no fault with our faith inspired by God might complain about the length of the page.

275
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:42,392
What does he take with this in mind: Behold water and fire; reach out your hand to whichever you choose Ecclesiasticus fifteen verse seventeen?

276
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,971
What about the other things that you, as a prolific advocate, repeated?

277
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,349
I believe they passed by like a closed ear, as they say, of an asp.

278
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,323
I see where the poisons of the Libyan plague are spreading.

279
00:47:52,323 --> 00:47:59,078
The sandy snake does not only have these harmful things that it reveals; we must bear what it confesses to estimate the hidden crimes.

280
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:06,689
For it wants to reach the point where no one perishes due to their own fault or negligence, if a person is deprived of the power of both good and evil.

281
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:15,713
He claims that only those who could have been saved without any effort, without the friendship of the commandments, were rescued by heavenly favor while wandering away from merit.

282
00:48:15,713 --> 00:48:21,560
Therefore, with reference to himself, he understands that those perished whom divine grace did not wish to liberate.

283
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:30,684
For more than three hundred years, the heresy of the Predestinarians had been silent in Gaul, until it was revived again in the century of Charles the Bald by the priest Gottschalk.

284
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:33,356
This monk was from Orbais in the diocese of Soissons.

285
00:48:33,356 --> 00:49:15,599
Leaving the monastery, he crossed into Italy, and while sowing the seeds of perverse doctrine in the fields of Verona, he was refuted by two letters from Rabanus, which were recently published: one to Notingus, the bishop of Verona, and the other to Eberhard, the count of the same region, in which the following is read about Gottschalk:
"It is commonly known in these parts," he says, "that a certain learned man named Gottschalk is staying with you, who teaches that the predestination of God binds every person in such a way that even if someone wants to be saved, and strives with correct faith and good works to attain eternal life through God's grace, he labors in vain and to no purpose if he is not predestined to life. As if God's predestination forces people to perish, who is the author of our salvation, not our destruction."

286
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:22,565
And now, this sect has led many to despair, so much so that they say:
Why do I need to work for my salvation and eternal life?

287
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:25,899
If I do good and am not predestined for life, it does me no good.

288
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:30,668
But if I do evil, it does me no harm, because God's predestination brings me to eternal life.

289
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:34,874
Having traveled from Italy to Germany, he presented his book of errors to Rabanus.

290
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:41,951
He was condemned by Rabanus and the bishops of Germany, and sent back to the metropolis of Reims, in the council of Mainz in the year 848.

291
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:54,413
The synodal document containing the sentence of condemnation is as follows:
Let it be known to your belovedness that a certain wandering monk, named Gottschalk, who claims to be a priest ordained in your parish, came to us in Mainz from Italy.

292
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:59,900
He introduced new superstitions and harmful doctrine about God's predestination, leading people into error.

293
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:17,440
He said that just as God's predestination is in good, so it is in evil; and that there are certain people in the world who, because of God's predestination which compels them to go to death, cannot correct themselves from error and sin, as if God had made them incorrigible from the beginning and destined for punishment to go to destruction.

294
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Hearing this opinion from him recently at the synod held in Mainz, and finding him incorrigible, at the behest and command of our most pious king Louis, we have decreed to send him, condemned with his pernicious doctrine, back to you.

295
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,569
You are to keep him in your parish from which he first departed disorderly, and not allow him to teach error and seduce the people anymore.

296
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:43,902
He already has, as I have heard, many seduced, and less devoted to their salvation, who say: What will it benefit me to labor in God's service?

297
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:46,620
If I am predestined to death, I will never escape it.

298
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,236
But if I do evil, and am predestined to life, without any doubt I will go to eternal rest.

299
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:56,621
Therefore, we have written to you briefly, informing you of what kind of doctrine we have found from him.

300
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:04,428
You will also benefit from hearing directly from him, understanding his thoughts in more detail, and justly deciding what should be done about it.

301
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,998
May the Almighty Lord keep your holiness well and praying for us forever.

302
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:12,203
Following that, another synod against Gottschalk was held at the palace in Carisiacum.

303
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:24,918
He was again heard and condemned by the bishops, and the following sentence was pronounced against him:
Brother Gottschalk, you have irregularly usurped the sacred office of the priesthood and misused it in your behaviors, evil actions, and perverse teachings.

304
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:38,269
By the judgment of the Holy Spirit, whose grace is the gift of the priestly office, and by the power of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, know that it has been taken from you in whatever manner you received it, and you are completely forbidden from exercising it further.

305
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:51,131
Furthermore, because you dared to disturb both ecclesiastical and civil affairs against the purpose and name of a monk, we decree by episcopal authority that you be punished with the harshest of beatings and confined to a prison according to ecclesiastical rules.

306
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:57,684
To prevent you from further usurping any doctrinal office, we impose perpetual silence on your mouth by the power of the eternal Word.

307
00:51:57,684 --> 00:52:05,313
In that same synod, or certainly in the same place, four chapters were established to oppose the four chapters Gottschalk had written to support his heresy.

308
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:11,329
The silence imposed on him by the synod aligns with what Rabanus privately advised about Gottschalk in a letter to Hincmar.

309
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:32,895
"I, as far as I presume," he said, "advise you to prohibit these disputes in the Christian community and not allow Gottschalk, the author of this error, to harm many further by writing or speaking. I am amazed at your prudence in allowing this harmful man, Gottschalk, who has been found blameworthy in all things, who has not observed the vow of a monk, the life of holy orders, nor the office of preaching legitimately, to write anything."

310
00:52:33,335 --> 00:52:37,293
In this position, he could have caused more harm by speaking with his own voice.

311
00:52:37,293 --> 00:52:43,725
As a result, in many places, as I have heard, he intoxicated many with the cup of his poison and led them to the madness of error.

312
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:54,213
It troubles some people that the case of Gottschalk, which was taken up by the Church of Lyon and condemned by two synods at Mainz and Quierzy, was opposed by two others at Valence and Langres, which favored him.

313
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:59,654
And they would be rightly troubled if this favor extended to the defense of the heresy of the Predestinarians.

314
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:01,188
But the situation is different.

315
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:06,234
For whatever else they may disagree on, both sides agree that they are enemies of the Predestinarians.

316
00:53:06,234 --> 00:53:35,620
Although the synod of Valence opposed four chapters to the four chapters of Gottschalk refuted by Hincmar, and these same chapters of the synod of Valence were later confirmed at the synod of Langres and presented and read at the synod of Toul at Saponaria, and when they reached Hincmar, they were accurately refuted by him, and his own arguments, which they opposed, were confirmed; nevertheless, in this varied and uncertain contention, the people of Lyon never concealed that they could not approve or accept the errors of the ancient Predestinarians, which Hincmar condemned in Gottschalk.

317
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,419
These errors were mainly two: one concerned predestination itself, the other the freedom of will.

318
00:53:40,419 --> 00:54:09,756
Gottschalk taught that the reprobates were predestined by God to destruction; Hincmar argued this was false and explained his reasoning in chapter 15 of his work "On Predestination." The ancient Predestinarians, he said, acknowledged the predestination of the reprobates to destruction, and just as they claimed they were predestined by God to destruction, so also to sin. The modern Predestinarians change this in appearance but retain the same essence. They say: God predestined the reprobates to destruction, not to sin, while acknowledging that destruction can only be reached through sin.

319
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:21,727
Therefore, he did not approve of the idea that people were predestined for destruction, because he believed that if this were true, it would mean that people were also predestined to sin, which was an error of the old Predestinarians.

320
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:30,482
The authors of the Synod of Valence, although they did not think this would follow, did not shy away from saying that the wicked were predestined to death along with Gottschalk.

321
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:43,294
However, they were so horrified by the idea of predestination to sin introduced by the Predestinarians that, following the Synod of Orange, Canon 3 of the Synod of Valence III, they pronounced anathema on those who believe that God predestines anyone to evil.

322
00:54:43,294 --> 00:55:40,675
Furthermore, the same Church of Lyon and its bishop Remigius, in the book "De Tribus Epistolis," responding to Hincmar's letter against Gottschalk, although they tried to interpret more leniently what he had said about those predestined to destruction, completely rejected the necessity of doing evil and the predestination to sin taught by the Predestinarians and rightly attributed by Hincmar to Gottschalk. They utterly abhorred this teaching.
"If there are any," he says in Chapter 8, "who seem to be scandalized by this word of predestination, as if it implies a necessity for anyone to commit evil, they should be taught instead that God predestines no one to sin but to suffer punishment for sin, nor does He, by this predestination, compel anyone to do evil."
From this, it is clear that the people of Lyon, regarding this point, do not support the errors of the Predestinarians at all. As for the other point, which undermines free will, will we admit they supported it? But they are so far from favoring this error that they detest it and do not believe it could have fallen on Gottschalk. For they reason thus. "It is added," they say, in Chapter...

323
00:55:40,823 --> 00:55:49,267
In that letter, he mentioned a miserable monk, saying that after the first man fell by free will, none of us can use free will for doing good, only for doing evil.

324
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:53,359
This is not only astonishing and unheard of, but also seems unbelievable to us.

325
00:55:53,359 --> 00:56:06,983
A man among the faithful, raised and educated by the faithful, and well-versed in the writings of the church fathers, could say or believe this: that after the fall of the first man, no one among the faithful can use free will for doing good, only for doing evil.

326
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:12,992
As if within us, free will exists only for evil; but for doing good, only God's grace works in us without free will.

327
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:22,265
If he had said generally: no human, and added, without God's grace, and thus concluded, can use free will for good, it would be a Catholic sense and entirely a Catholic assertion.

328
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:43,192
However, when it is argued that he said none of us, that is, the faithful, can use free will except only for doing evil, what else is asserted by such a statement and assumption of novelty, except that the free will of the human mind, which before sin was free to love, desire, and enjoy true good, was so corrupted and lost by the first man's sin that thereafter free will remained in man only for evil.

329
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:48,010
But for doing good or having it, there is no free will in man, only the gift of divine grace.

330
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:53,293
This kind of error, we do not remember knowing or hearing of, neither among heretics nor any Catholic.

331
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:57,282
So, even concerning this, it seems incredible to us, as we have already said.

332
00:56:57,282 --> 00:57:08,989
Those who, with such a great abundance of words, through so many windings and circuits, exaggerate this error, and so diligently refute it, does anyone believe that they actually wanted to appear as patrons or defenders of it?

333
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:23,473
They explain the Catholic doctrine of free will just like Hincmar, who doesn't realize that in this debate—whether sparked by Ebo of Grenoble's personal dislike for Hincmar or some other reason—they aimed to refute Hincmar and defend Gottschalk, rather than actually achieving their goal.

334
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:30,823
Therefore, it's pointless for those who now put in the effort to compare and contrast the views of the people of Lyon with those of Rabanus or Hincmar.

335
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:38,854
Trying to convince us that the errors Hincmar noted in Gottschalk were wrongly criticized and that the people of Lyon defended these as Catholic doctrines is futile.
