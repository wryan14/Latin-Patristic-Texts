00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,832
Chapter One: On the Three Dwellings - The Kingdom of God, the World, and Hell; The Good of the Kingdom of God and the Evils of Hell

2
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:14,652
Under the hand of Almighty God, there are three dwellings: the highest, the lowest, and the middle.

3
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:24,060
The highest is known as the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Heaven; the lowest is called hell; and the middle is referred to as the present world or the earth.

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,352
The extremes are completely opposed to each other and have no connection.

5
00:00:28,352 --> 00:00:32,645
For what fellowship can light have with darkness, and Christ with Belial?

6
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,291
Second Corinthians 6:14, 15.

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,878
The middle, however, bears some resemblance to both extremes.

8
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:51,871
It contains light and darkness, cold and heat, pain and health, joy and sorrow, hate and love, good and evil, just and unjust, masters and servants, rule and subjection, hunger and satisfaction, death and life, and countless other things.

9
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:57,575
Among all these, one part reflects the image of the Kingdom of God, while the other mirrors hell.

10
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:04,689
This world is a mix of good and evil; but in the Kingdom of God, there are only good people, and in hell, only evil ones.

11
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,630
Each place draws from the middle.

12
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,569
Some people from this world are lifted to heaven, while others are pulled into hell.

13
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:26,444
For like is joined to like, meaning good people are with good people, and evil people with evil people; just humans with just angels, and transgressing humans with transgressing angels; servants of God with God, and servants of the devil with the devil.

14
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:36,616
The blessed are called to the Kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world, while the cursed are cast into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.

15
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:37,675
Matthew 25:34, 41.

16
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:49,434
However, to speak, think, or truly understand the goods of the heavenly Kingdom as they are, is beyond anyone clothed in flesh; for they are much greater and better than can be imagined or understood.

17
00:01:49,434 --> 00:02:06,486
Hence it is written: "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him."
First Corinthians 2:9.
The Kingdom of God surpasses all fame, exceeds all praise, is beyond all knowledge, and is more excellent than any imagined glory.

18
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:14,893
Even to speak or think about the evils of hell as they truly are is impossible; they are far worse than we can imagine.

19
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:27,985
The kingdom of God, on the other hand, is filled with light, peace, love, wisdom, glory, honor, sweetness, affection, music, joy, everlasting happiness, and every indescribable good beyond words or thoughts.

20
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:42,910
Hell, however, is a place of darkness, discord, hatred, foolishness, misery, disgrace, bitterness, offense, pain, burning, thirst, hunger, unquenchable fire, sadness, everlasting vengeance, and every unspeakable evil beyond imagination.

21
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,729
In heaven, the inhabitants are righteous people and angels, with Almighty God as their king.

22
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:54,421
In stark contrast, the inhabitants of hell are wicked people and demons, led by the devil.

23
00:02:54,421 --> 00:03:00,935
For the just, the vision of holy people and angels, and above all, of God Himself, brings satisfaction.

24
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:08,903
Meanwhile, the wicked and sinners are tormented by the sight of condemned people and demons, and above all, the devil himself.

25
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:13,077
Nothing is desired in the kingdom of God that isn't already there.

26
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:15,797
But in hell, nothing desired is ever found.

27
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:20,730
In God's kingdom, everything that pleases, delights, and satisfies is present.

28
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,054
In contrast, in the pit of everlasting misery, only what displeases, offends, and torments is found.

29
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:33,885
In the eternal kingdom, there is life without death, truth without error, and happiness without disturbance.

30
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:37,869
Every good abounds in the kingdom of God, with no evil present.

31
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:43,181
Conversely, every evil is abundant in the prison of the devil, with no good present.

32
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:50,138
No unworthy person is accepted into the kingdom of God; likewise, no worthy or just person is dragged to hell.

33
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,312
Chapter Two: On Infernal Punishments

34
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:59,359
There are two main torments in hell: unbearable cold and the heat of unquenchable fire.

35
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:55,573
As it is mentioned in the Gospel: "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" Matthew thirteen:fifty-one; twenty-two:thirteen; and twenty-five:thirty.
Weeping and the melting of eyes arise from heat, while the gnashing of teeth comes from the cold.
This is also reflected in the words of the blessed Job: "They pass from the waters of snow to excessive heat" Job twenty-four:nineteen.
From these two sources stem countless types of punishments: unbearable thirst, the agony of hunger, the torment of stench, the horror, the fear, the anguish, the darkness, the severity of torturers, the presence of demons, the ferocity of beasts, the cruelty of attendants, the tearing by immortal worms, the worm of conscience, fiery tears, sighs, miseries, pain without remedy, chains without release, eternal death, punishment without end, and the absence of Christ after having seen Him, which alone surpasses all the aforementioned and is more intolerable than all punishments.

36
00:04:55,632 --> 00:05:01,641
Chapter Three: On Those Whom the Eternity of Punishment Does Not Deter from Worldly Pleasure.

37
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,579
The Double Punishment of Hell.

38
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,422
One Hundred Years Is No Portion of Eternity.

39
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:12,050
Woe to those who are destined to endure all these everlasting evils for the brief pleasure of an hour.

40
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,471
The glory of this entire world, though vast, pales in comparison to eternal glory.

41
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:25,959
It would have been better for them, as was said about the unfortunate Judas in Matthew 26:24, not to have been born, than to suffer the torments of hell for their wicked deeds.

42
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:35,447
What could be more foolish or insane than being deceived by mere shadows and images of true glory, delight, beauty, and honor, like children, instead of seeking the real thing?

43
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:41,431
Who would choose a reflection of gold in water, ignoring the real gold, and not be seen as foolish by everyone?

44
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:46,660
Who would prefer a reflection of the sun in a mirror over the sun itself without being ridiculed?

45
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:55,933
In the same way, we should pity, not mock, those who pursue the fleeting pleasures of this world and the flesh, ignoring eternal glory and the indescribable joys of heaven.

46
00:05:55,933 --> 00:06:03,264
This is the sad and foolish choice of those whose minds are not sound, even if the unspeakable torments of hell weren't the consequence.

47
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:14,154
The dual punishment is indeed being excluded from the kingdom of God and being eternally in hell, condemned with the devil, losing the presence of angels, and enduring the terrifying presence of demons.

48
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:18,736
The extent to which this should be avoided, shunned, and feared cannot be overstated.

49
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:23,911
Who in their right mind would choose a hundred years of punishment for just one day of pleasure?

50
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:38,790
Yet, the miserable and utterly unwisely follow the pleasures of the flesh, failing to avoid intolerable punishments, not for a hundred years, not for a thousand times a thousand, but for eternity, for the fleeting delights of forty or sixty years, or any corruptible pleasure.

51
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:43,139
How much difference is there between one day and one hundred years?

52
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:51,602
It's not just that; there's an even greater difference between forty, sixty, or one hundred years and eternity, whether it involves future good or bad.

53
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:58,888
One day is a small part of a hundred-year span, although a very small part; but a hundred-year span is no part at all in eternity.

54
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:11,499
If, for example, a hundredth or a thousandth part were a portion of eternity, then multiplying that portion by a hundred or a thousand times would mean eternity would cease to exist, which contradicts the concept of eternity.

55
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,095
If eternity were to end in any way or at any time, it wouldn't be eternity at all.

56
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,341
Chapter Four: From the Broad Way to the Narrow.

57
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:23,969
The Happiness of the Blessed, Knowledge, and the Love of Their Own Fate.

58
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,183
On the Unspeakable Sweetness of the Vision of God.

59
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:37,032
Therefore, we must strongly resist earthly pleasures, firmly fight against the deceptive allurements of this world, and be vigilant against the various suggestions of Satan.

60
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:47,708
We must diligently avoid the broad way of the world that leads to death Matthew 7:13;
But with all the desire of the heart, we must approach and seek after the narrow way that leads to life.

61
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:56,418
This narrow way is the path of abstinence, chastity, humility, and all religious devotion, which Christ has walked before us on His journey to His kingdom.

62
00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:00,744
Let us follow in His footsteps until we reach the royal city where He reigns.

63
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:05,633
Whatever we can say about this city is like a drop from the sea or a spark from a fire.

64
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:10,465
In this city, the righteous will shine like the sun as the Lord says in Matthew 13:43.

65
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:26,816
There will be perfect peace, perfect rest, no labor, no pain, no poverty, no old age, no death, no night, and no desire for food or thirst;
The food and drink of all will be the vision of Christ and the Holy Trinity, and the contemplation with the pure eye of the heart of the Divine itself.

66
00:08:26,816 --> 00:09:05,306
And the continual reading, so to speak, of the book of life, that is, eternal truth and supreme wisdom, and the vision of the Word of God, which is Jesus Christ;
Where whatever is hidden from us now will be more clearly revealed;
Where it will be clear why one is chosen and another rejected;
Why one is taken into the kingdom and another reduced to servitude;
Why one dies in the womb, another in infancy, another in youth, and another in old age;
Why one is poor and another rich;
Why the son of an adulteress is baptized and sometimes the son of a legitimate wife dies before baptism;
Why one who begins to live well sometimes ends poorly, and one who begins poorly often ends well.

67
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:09,913
All these things and many such matters will be plain and open in the book of life.

68
00:09:09,913 --> 00:09:18,005
In the same city, the reward of each will be the reward of all, and the good of all will be evident to everyone through the love of each person.

69
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:20,702
There, the good of all will be open to everyone.

70
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:24,488
In that place, everyone will understand each other's thoughts.

71
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,308
No one will be arrogant or envious.

72
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:31,093
How could someone who loves everyone as themselves feel envy, when no one envies themselves?

73
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:37,334
No one will wish to be better or higher than they are, because being different from what they deserve wouldn't be right.

74
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:46,176
Nor will they want to be different from what they are, because being as they will be is beautiful, not just for themselves but for the entire body of the heavenly Church.

75
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:59,490
Just as a body would look deformed and unattractive if any part were placed higher or lower than nature intended, so too would someone be out of place in God's kingdom if they were positioned higher than the skill and will of the Almighty Creator intended.

76
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,443
This would bring disgrace, not only to themselves but to the whole assembly.

77
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:08,852
Even the least among them will have greater glory than owning the entire world, even if it were eternal.

78
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:16,601
It's truly insignificant to enjoy the elements compared to enjoying and rejoicing in God Himself, or to take pleasure in visible and physical things.

79
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:30,539
The beauty of justice and the joy of eternal light, which is unchanging truth and wisdom, is so profound that even if one could experience it for just a single day, innumerable years of this life filled with material pleasures would rightfully be considered worthless.

80
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:55,711
It wasn't said in vain or without deep feeling:
"For one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere" Psalm 84:10.
Nothing compares to the delight and joy that come from the invisible and incorporeal, from the company of angels and all the righteous, from the certain knowledge and understanding of the divine nature itself, and from seeing God face to face.
The angels marvel at His beauty, the dead are raised by His command, and His wisdom is beyond measure Psalm 147:5.

81
00:10:56,231 --> 00:11:38,078
Psalm one hundred forty-six, verse five:
Whose kingdom knows no end and whose glory is beyond description;
whose light is so bright that it outshines the sun, making the sun seem dim;
whose sweetness is so great that, in comparison, honey tastes as bitter as wormwood;
whose face, if seen by those in hell, would take away their pain, sorrow, and sadness;
whose presence, if it appeared in hell alongside the holy, would turn it into a paradise;
by whose will not even a leaf falls from a tree;
whose fiery eyes reach the deepest parts of hell;
whose ear hears the silent voice of the heart, which is thought;
whose eye hears as well as it sees;
whose ear sees as well as it hears, for they are not of the body, but of the highest wisdom and certain knowledge.

82
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:48,540
Whose delights satisfy without causing weariness: once found by the blessed, they are always desired, quenching hunger and thirst without pain, and always bringing joy with a burning desire.

83
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:58,341
Whose wondrous secrets remain forever new and astonishing to those who see them, causing as much wonder after a thousand and a thousand thousand years as they did at first sight.

84
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:10,290
And although angels have seen them since the beginning of the world, they admire them today just as much as on the first day; otherwise, they would have long since lost their value from constant viewing by the angels.

85
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,419
Whose knowledge of the past and future is not past and future, but present.

86
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,735
Chapter Five: All Things Are Present to God, Without Prejudice to Human Freedom

87
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:26,843
We discuss God's speech and praise, His existence before time, and how true evil is worse than false evil.

88
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:31,972
The vision God grants to the blessed, along with His eternity and knowledge, is profound.

89
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:38,022
He doesn't see the Day of Judgment or the first day of the world in the way we do, but He perceives both.

90
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:42,286
His foreknowledge doesn't compel anyone to sin, a misconception many hold.

91
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:46,492
They argue that if God foresaw Adam's sin, Adam couldn't have avoided it.

92
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:52,485
This mistake leads to the blasphemous idea that God causes sin, yet they are trapped by their own logic.

93
00:12:52,485 --> 00:13:01,647
If God's foreknowledge makes things inevitable, then man sins by his own will, not out of necessity, because God foresaw him sinning by choice, not compulsion.

94
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:10,578
Therefore, if God's foreknowledge can't be avoided, man sinned by choice, without any other force compelling him, because God foresaw him sinning this way.

95
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:13,401
Thus, if he sinned voluntarily, he wasn't forced.

96
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:19,970
If he wasn't forced to sin, he could have chosen not to; thus, he deserved punishment because he sinned willingly.

97
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,909
Otherwise, he wouldn't face God's penalty of death.

98
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:30,227
God's speech is a hidden inspiration, revealing His will and love invisibly to minds, leading Angels to obey Him in all things.

99
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:39,331
His praise for the chosen ones is the way He will showcase their good deeds to all, and the ongoing praise from the chosen is their eternal admiration of Him.

100
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:45,727
In a wondrous way, He did not precede the world and time by time itself; He always existed without a beginning.

101
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:49,127
Time didn't exist before the world; it was created with it.

102
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:52,296
If time began with the world, it wasn't made before it.

103
00:13:52,296 --> 00:14:00,709
So, as we've said, God didn't precede the times and the world, which are simultaneous with them, but slightly prior, as by His motion, they began.

104
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,956
Whatever moves precedes its own motion.

105
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:06,694
God existed before the world, beyond time itself.

106
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:09,002
There was no time before the world began.

107
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:16,883
His light dispels the darkness of ignorance, and we understand that part of this light reveals everything we've said to be true and certain.

108
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:21,048
Through this same light, we recognize that truth is better than falsehood.

109
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:27,972
However, true evil or true sin is worse than false evil or false sin-not because it is true, but because it is evil or sin.

110
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:36,022
Otherwise, it couldn't be considered evil or sin unless it was truly evil or sin; a false evil is not evil, just as false silver is not silver.

111
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:43,397
Someone might truthfully claim that evil or sin has arisen or been created, implying it's a work of truth, which is entirely false.

112
00:14:43,397 --> 00:14:48,294
Everything true comes from truth, and everything true, inasmuch as it is true, is good.

113
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:56,513
Therefore, truth gives true existence to evil or sin, but not the evil or sin itself; one thing is the evil itself, another is its true existence.

114
00:14:56,513 --> 00:15:00,622
Although the evil itself is not good, it is good that it exists as truth.

115
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:05,238
Otherwise, if it were not good for evil to exist, God wouldn't allow it to happen.

116
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:11,599
Indeed, the Almighty creates many good things from evil, like forming and making good people from human adultery.

117
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:27,868
If even a small part of that light, shining through narrow gaps, has helped us understand these truths and all other things we know, imagine the kind and amount of light of knowledge and wisdom we'll experience there, where we will see the sun of truth face to face, and truly know wisdom.

118
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:31,076
His presence makes those who are with Him similar to Him.

119
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:37,325
Whoever adheres to true wisdom, true beauty, and true eternity will indeed become wise, beautiful, and eternal.

120
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:40,196
Thus, His absence makes us unlike Him in every way.

121
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:43,010
His eternity is without beginning and without end.

122
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,007
If there were a time when He did not exist, who would have created Him?

123
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:52,693
Because He alone is God, and before Him, there was no other God, nor is there now, nor will there be.

124
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:59,842
Surely, He did not create Himself, since nothing creates itself; by what power would one who did not exist at all make himself?

125
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:03,392
This means that God was not created at all.

126
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:08,582
Since God was never created, He existed before everything else without having a beginning.

127
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:16,772
Anything that was created has a beginning, and anything with a beginning was undoubtedly made by God, who was not made but created everything.

128
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:31,133
His knowledge, without any change in understanding and without shifting back and forth, comprehends and grasps the infinite truth of all creatures-
angels, humans, stars, grains of sand, hairs, words, thoughts, every moment-together and all at once.

129
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:37,881
Therefore, God is the source and origin of all knowledge: the more someone drinks from it, the more they will thirst.

130
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,488
Chapter Six: The Knowledge of the Blessed.

131
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:46,152
On the Threefold Vision: Bodily, Spiritual, Intellectual.

132
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:55,820
As we've mentioned before, the kingdom of the whole world, even if it were eternal, is far surpassed by the company of angels and saints, and by the vision of God Himself.

133
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:03,680
In this vision, a threefold knowledge emerges: the person who sees, God who is seen, and all others who will see and understand everything.

134
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:16,742
Just as through a glass mirror we experience a threefold vision-seeing ourselves, the mirror itself, and whatever is present-so through the mirror of divine clarity, we will see God Himself as much as it is possible for a creature.

135
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:20,474
We will know ourselves and others with true and certain knowledge.

136
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:25,506
Then, by seeing God, we will perceive the hidden things of creation and even hell itself.

137
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:33,648
It will be clear to the righteous how God is invisible, incomparable, without beginning and without end, before all things and after all things.

138
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:41,056
We will understand the difference between being born, which pertains to the Son, and proceeding, which pertains to the Holy Spirit.

139
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,883
One is born from one; the other proceeds from two.

140
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:48,350
The Father did not precede the Son in time, but in origin, nor the Holy Spirit.

141
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,346
All things of God are one in God, except in relation.

142
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:57,510
The wisdom of God, truth, and eternity are not different from each other, but are one, like all other things.

143
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:04,804
The wisdom of God is not more wisdom than truth, nor more truth than wisdom, nor more than eternity, nor all other things of God.

144
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:10,515
They are one in God, and not only are these the same in God, but they are not other than God Himself.

145
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:14,982
The world was in God before it existed in itself, not as the world, but as God.

146
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:19,618
He is entirely everywhere without place, great without size, good without quality.

147
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:23,463
He penetrates all things, clean and unclean, without being polluted.

148
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:41,331
If visible light can illuminate every place, even penetrating refuse heaps without absorbing their stench or being polluted, how much more does God, who is invisible and unchanging light, penetrate, govern, sustain, surround, and illuminate all things without any change or pollution?

149
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:45,346
This applies not only in the heavens and on earth but also in hell.

150
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:54,815
Then, God's chosen ones will experience a threefold vision:
First, a physical vision, where they will see bodies shining like the sun, the moon, or the stars.

151
00:18:54,815 --> 00:19:08,119
Second, a spiritual vision, where they will perceive the likenesses of bodies in spirit, not through deceptive imagination; this vision is also enjoyed today by the spirits of the righteous beyond the confines of the body.

152
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:17,648
And third, an intellectual vision, where with the pure eye of the mind in spirit, they will see God, their own souls, their inner virtues, and angelic spirits.

153
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:26,518
Then they will give thanks to God twice:
First, for their deliverance from eternal damnation,
and second, for the indescribable reward of blessings.

154
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:33,649
At that time, the common adversary and enemy of all, the devil, will be condemned in the presence of God's chosen ones.

155
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:39,222
His condemnation and unbearable punishment will provide a delightful spectacle for the elect.

156
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:44,796
Then, with the most ardent love, they will love their liberator and giver of all good things.

157
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:54,205
With endless and unfailing heartfelt praise, they will glorify the almighty, kind, and merciful God, to whom honor and glory belong now and forever and ever.

158
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:54,504
Amen.
