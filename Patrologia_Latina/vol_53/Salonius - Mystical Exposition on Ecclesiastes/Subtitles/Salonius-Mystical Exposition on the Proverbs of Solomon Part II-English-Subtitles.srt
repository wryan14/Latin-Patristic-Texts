00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
Mystical Exposition on Ecclesiastes
by Salonius

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,343
How many names was Solomon known by?

3
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:14,064
According to the Holy Scriptures, the three names associated with Solomon are Solomon, Jedidiah, and Ecclesiastes.

4
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,751
Why was he called by these names?

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:25,775
Solomon, whose name means "peaceful," was called that because there was peace during his reign.
He was also known as Jedidiah, meaning "beloved of the Lord," because the Lord loved him.

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,655
What is Ecclesiastes called in this language?

7
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,319
Greek; in Hebrew, it is called Qoheleth.

8
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:34,751
How do Coheleth or Ecclesiastes sound in Latin?

9
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:39,340
He is properly called Ecclesiastes, the one who gathers the assembly, meaning the Church.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,773
In Latin, Ecclesiastes is rightly called the Preacher because he addresses the people.

11
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,712
His message isn't directed at one person but to everyone.

12
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:50,269
So, in the holy Church, the Preacher can indeed be called a preacher.

13
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:52,847
How many books did Solomon write?

14
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:58,367
There are only three, according to the number of their names: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.

15
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,623
What does Solomon say in the Proverbs?

16
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:04,007
What does he teach in Ecclesiastes or the Song of Songs?

17
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:08,886
In Proverbs, he guides a young child, instructing him like a son through various sayings.

18
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:19,137
In Ecclesiastes, he teaches a mature man to understand that nothing in this world's affairs is permanent, glorious, or significant; rather, everything we see is brief, fleeting, and vain.

19
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:28,018
In the Song of Songs, he unites a fully mature and perfected man, adorned with various virtues, with the embraces of the bridegroom, who is our Lord Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:33,120
But spiritually, what do Solomon, Jedidiah, and Ecclesiastes represent?

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,032
The Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Solomon—that is, the one who makes peace by His blood—made both one.

22
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,931
From two peoples, He built one Church for Himself.

23
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:45,467
Thus, the Apostle says: Christ, our peace, who made both one.

24
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:57,641
He is Yedidiah, that is, the beloved son of the Father, about whom the Father Himself said to the disciples:
This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
(Matthew Chapter 3; Mark Chapter 1; Luke Chapter 3).

25
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:12,655
He is certainly the Ecclesiastes, our preacher who gathers the assembly—namely, the holy Church from the whole world—to whom He speaks, saying:
Learn from me, because I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls
(Matthew Chapter 11).

26
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:21,815
He is the son of David, to whom the blind men in the Gospel cried out, saying:
Have mercy on us, son of David
(Matthew Chapter 9, Chapter 15, and Chapter 20).

27
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:27,612
He is also the King of Jerusalem, not earthly, but that heavenly one, which is the mother of us all.

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:49,200
What does Ecclesiastes mean when it says, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity"?
In the book of Genesis, it says, "God saw everything that he had made, and it was very good."
If everything that God made is very good, then how can everything be vanity?
And not just vanity, but "vanity of vanities"?

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,332
Heaven and earth, the seas, and everything within this world are indeed good because they were created by a good God.

30
00:02:55,332 --> 00:03:03,037
However, when compared to God, they should be considered as nothing because God will always remain as He is, while all these things will pass away.

31
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:07,335
What is seen is temporary because it is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal.

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,840
Why did he repeat his statement twice, saying: Vanity of vanities, said the Teacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity?

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,052
To emphasize the greatness of vanities, he repeated his statement.

34
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:24,504
This shows that all the glory of the world will wither like the flower of grass, and will pass away like smoke.

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:34,200
Regarding these generations, it says:
One generation passes away, and another generation comes
(Ecclesiastes 1:4).

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,493
On the generations of the Jews and the generations of the Gentiles.

37
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:43,245
The first generation of Jews passed away due to their lack of faith, and the generation of Gentiles took their place.

38
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:47,473
This new generation is the holy Church of the faithful, saved through faith in Christ.

39
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:51,259
It can also be understood this way: One generation passes, and another comes.

40
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,684
As some die, others are born.

41
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:57,306
Those you saw before are no longer here, and you begin to see those who were not there before.

42
00:03:57,552 --> 00:04:15,936
Why does Solomon say, "The earth stands forever" (Ecclesiastes 1:4), while the Lord in the Gospel says, "Heaven and earth will pass away" (Matthew 5:18 and 24:35; Mark 13:31; Luke 21:33)?

43
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:22,250
Truly, according to the Lord's judgment, Heaven and Earth will pass away through improvement, but not through destruction.

44
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,375
They will be purified by the fire of judgment, improved, and renewed, but not completely destroyed.

45
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:34,466
Indeed, Heaven above and Earth below will burn only to the extent they have been defiled by the wickedness of humans and demons together.

46
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:38,245
Therefore, according to Solomon's judgment, the Earth will stand forever.

47
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:44,456
As stated in the book of Ecclesiastes chapter one, it will never be destroyed; however, it will be renewed and improved.

48
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:56,978
What did Solomon mean when he said: The sun rises and sets, and returns to its place, and there it rises again, circles to the south, and turns to the north (Ecclesiastes 1:5-6)?

49
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:06,386
Who doesn't know that the sun rises and sets, and through paths unknown to us, returns to its place where it rose, so it may rise again?

50
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:16,383
This is why Solomon says this: to show that the sun itself, which is given to people for the light of day, by its changing nature—its rising and setting—daily signifies the end of this world.

51
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:23,348
Through these changes of time, and through the rising and setting of stars, Solomon teaches that human life also rises and sets daily.

52
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,112
What does the sun spiritually signify here?

53
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,360
The true sun, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the sun of justice.

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:53,040
The prophet says:
"For you who fear God, the sun of justice will rise"
Malachi 4:2.
This sun of justice rises every day for those who fear Him, meaning His faithful, the holy and pious people.
However, it sets at noon for false prophets, meaning heretics and bad Catholics, because their sins cause them to lose the light of His grace.
It also sets for unbelievers, as they do not deserve to be enlightened by the light of faith.

55
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:05,143
What does it mean when it says:
All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full;
To the place where the rivers come from, there they return again to flow once more
Ecclesiastes 1.

56
00:06:05,143 --> 00:06:09,222
Who knows that the rivers return to their place to flow again?

57
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:13,124
Ecclesiastes, that is, Solomon, knew through the grace of the Holy Spirit.

58
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:30,336
But our Ecclesiastes, namely Jesus Christ, who is the creator of those waters, through the power of divinity by which he is equal to God the Father, fully knows that rivers, because they flow into the sea, descend into the abyss and return to the sources of springs through hidden channels, bubbling up again from the mother abyss.

59
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,552
Spiritually, though, what do these rivers signify?

60
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:35,383
These rivers symbolize holy preachers.

61
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:39,384
When they shine with virtues and their teachings sparkle, they truly become rivers.

62
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:45,023
They nourish the dry land of carnal hearts with their holy preaching and actions, producing the fruits of good works.

63
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,432
How do these rivers flow back to the place from which they come?

64
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:52,855
Holy preachers, in all their teachings and actions, always return to the praise of their Creator.

65
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:58,829
They give thanks and praise to the Lord, their author, through whom they received the ability to do such things and all their good.

66
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:03,526
They constantly go back to the true source of light to prevent themselves from withering and drying up.

67
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:11,826
They receive from it the water of knowledge and the grace of virtues, so they can be replenished with good works and pour the streams of spiritual doctrine into the hearts of others.

68
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:15,383
All the faithful are like rivers, returning to the place from where they came.

69
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:21,539
Through holy desires, they return to the love of their Creator and give thanks and praise for all the good they have received from Him.

70
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:32,835
So, why did Solomon dedicate his heart—meaning he diligently applied himself with a concerned heart—to understand wisdom and knowledge, as well as mistakes and foolishness?

71
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:42,487
Ecclesiastes, Chapter One
It's certainly good to understand wisdom and knowledge, but what benefit is there in understanding mistakes and foolishness?

72
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:48,087
Just as it's important to know wisdom and teachings, it's equally valuable to understand errors and foolishness.

73
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:53,869
True wisdom begins with freeing oneself from foolishness, and no one can achieve this without first understanding it.

74
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:57,032
Similarly, no one can avoid mistakes unless they recognize them.

75
00:07:57,032 --> 00:08:01,579
In earthly matters, many harmful things exist, teaching us wisdom as we learn to avoid them.

76
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:07,584
Why was Solomon equally eager to understand wisdom and knowledge, as well as errors and foolishness?

77
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:14,351
So, while he seeks some things and avoids others—meaning he goes after good things and avoids bad things—his true wisdom is proven.

78
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:29,015
What does Solomon mean when he says: "For in much wisdom there is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow" Ecclesiastes 1:18?
How is there much vexation in having a lot of wisdom?

79
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:31,570
Therefore, with much wisdom comes much indignation.

80
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,682
The more wisdom a person gains, the more they become frustrated with themselves, grieving over their vices and sins and their lack of virtues.

81
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:45,543
As a person grows in wisdom, they become more upset with themselves for their past wrongdoings, feeling sorrow and grief over their sins.

82
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,646
Consequently, they also add to their toil.

83
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:56,511
The more they understand heavenly and eternal matters, the more they labor with sorrow and tears to escape the traps of errors and free themselves from the misery of this world.

84
00:08:56,711 --> 00:09:03,876
Why does it say:
aɪ said laughter is foolish, and to joy I said, 'Why are you deceived in vain?

85
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:16,847
'"
(Ecclesiastes 2),
when it is natural for humans to laugh, and the Lord in the Gospel says:
"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven"
(Matthew 5; Luke 6)?

86
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,719
Solomon does not criticize natural laughter, which is modest and honest.

87
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:24,806
Hence, elsewhere he says: A wise man will laugh quietly (Ecclesiasticus 21).

88
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:49,812
But he calls uncontrolled and excessive laughter a mistake; such laughter is called "cachinnus."
Similarly, he refers to not spiritual but temporal joy as a deception.
Those who do not mourn their past mistakes, nor understand the downfall caused by their sins, laugh loudly and rejoice in temporary things.
They think new and brief pleasures are eternal, and thus, deceived by the sweetness of the present life, they are troubled daily by the errors of this world.

89
00:09:49,919 --> 00:10:01,567
What does it mean when it says: I saw vanity and affliction of spirit in everything, and nothing lasts under the sun
Ecclesiastes
2:4, 6, 8, and 12?

90
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:10,697
How can it say that nothing lasts under the sun when earlier it said: But the earth stands forever
Ecclesiastes
1:4?

91
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:14,153
Nothing under the sun will last forever, for everything is vanity.

92
00:10:14,153 --> 00:10:18,094
In the Gospel, the Lord says: "Heaven and earth will pass away" (Matthew 24).

93
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:24,593
However, the earth will stand forever, not because it won't be destroyed, but because it will be renewed, as mentioned earlier.

94
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:32,698
Why does it say,
"A wise person's eyes are in their head, but a fool walks in darkness"
(Ecclesiastes 2)?

95
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,899
Aren't the fool's eyes also in their head?

96
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:42,597
The eyes here are not physical but spiritual: specifically, the eyes of the mind, meaning the senses and intentions of the soul.

97
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:48,080
By the head, Christ is signified, as the Apostle says: The head of the man is Christ First Corinthians 11.

98
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:58,011
The eyes of a wise man are on his head because a wise man directs all his intentions toward Christ, places them in Christ, and always lifts the eyes of his mind to meditate on heavenly things.

99
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:03,805
But a fool walks in darkness, obscured by his foolishness, the darkness of his sins, and the love of this world.

100
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:11,409
He hates heavenly things and, unlike a wise man, cannot lift his eyes to heaven because he focuses on worldly things rather than the things of God.

101
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:15,791
So, what exactly distinguishes a wise man from a foolish one?

102
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:23,238
This is different because one is illuminated and adorned with wisdom and clarity, while the other is darkened and disturbed by the errors of their foolishness.

103
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:29,233
Indeed, the difference between a wise person and a fool is as great as the difference between day and night, light and darkness.

104
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,048
How much difference is there between the wise and the foolish when the same fate awaits both?

105
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:40,997
The learned die just as the unlearned, the wise just as the foolish.

106
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:42,598
Ecclesiastes chapter 2

107
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:54,580
Even though everyone faces the same end, and the wise person's death is similar to the foolish person's, and often the wise suffer more in this life; nevertheless, their memory won't be the same in the future, nor will they receive equal rewards.

108
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:02,711
Because on the day of judgment, the wise will be elevated to the glory of the heavenly kingdom, while the foolish will be plunged into the eternal torments of damnation.

109
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,482
Who is this wise person who stands out from the fool as light differs from darkness?

110
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:12,936
Is it the one who excels in philosophical learning or shines with the eloquence of liberal arts?

111
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:22,869
Sometimes worldly wisdom goes against God's teachings, and even though carnal wisdom may be adorned with eloquence, it lacks spiritual fruit and the promise of eternal happiness.

112
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:30,849
True wisdom lies in loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and striving to fulfill His will in all things, as much as human frailty allows.

113
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:38,216
This is reflected in the scripture: "To the person who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness" (Ecclesiastes 2:26).

114
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:43,548
So, he immediately adds:
But to the sinner, he gave affliction and unnecessary worry.

115
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:53,314
If God gave the sinner unnecessary worry and concern, then why does he continue to sin despite being troubled by these worries and concerns of temporal things?

116
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:58,422
The cause of excessive worry and anxiety isn't in God, but in the one who sinned by their own choice.

117
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:02,370
Because of their sins, they deserved to experience excessive worry and anxiety.

118
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:09,116
So, when it is said, "But to the sinner, He gave excessive worry," it means that God allowed it to be given because they were a sinner.

119
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:14,846
What does he mean when he says:
Everything has its time
(Ecclesiastes 3)?

120
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:21,402
If everything has its time, does the essence of the eternal Divinity experience time?

121
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:30,944
Absolutely not; the ineffable, eternal essence of divine majesty, which created everything out of nothing, is not confined by place, constrained by time, or limited by any space.

122
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:37,590
Therefore, Solomon, to clarify his point, immediately adds, saying,
And all things under heaven pass away in their own times.

123
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:45,565
He wants to show that everything in the world is contradictory and nothing is permanent among all things under heaven; these things are bound by time.

124
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:57,854
What planting is he talking about, or what uprooting does he mean when he says:
"There is a time to plant, and a time to uproot what is planted"
(Ecclesiastes 3:2)?

125
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:02,013
Is he referring to planting or uprooting trees or herbs?

126
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:36,192
No, but concerning the birth and death of people:
For what was said earlier, "A time to be born," is the same as what follows, "and a time to plant"; because planting is the same as being born.
What was said previously, "a time to die," is the same as what follows here, "a time to uproot what is planted"; because uprooting is the same as dying.
Only God knows the beginning and end of people, that is, the time to be born, the time to die, the time to plant, and the time to uproot.
He established both the time when each person would be born and planted in life, and the time when they would die and be uprooted from this life.
This is determined by the decree of death.

127
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:42,892
What does it mean when it says again:
A time to kill and a time to heal
(Ecclesiastes Chapter 3, Verse 3)?

128
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:46,558
There is no doubt that the time to heal is granted by God.

129
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:49,972
However, God never established a time to kill another.

130
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,954
Once a man has killed, he can never heal the one he has killed.

131
00:14:54,144 --> 00:15:03,939
Certainly not; only He who speaks through Moses has the time for killing and the time for healing, saying:
"I will kill and I will make alive; I will wound and I will heal" (Deuteronomy 32).

132
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:08,940
He sets the time when sinners are killed and the sick are healed, meaning those weakened by sins.

133
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:16,312
He kills when He afflicts sinners with bodily weakness or worldly adversity so that they may be corrected, die to their sins, and live for God.

134
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:22,860
Often, God chastises the wicked to kill and heal them, so they may cease to be what they are and begin to be what they are not.

135
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:32,913
Therefore, there is a time for healing when Almighty God, through hidden inspiration, touches the hearts of those He has killed—mercifully afflicted with adversities—and calls them to repentance.

136
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,814
What destruction or building is he referring to when he says:
"A time to tear down and a time to build up" (Ecclesiastes 3:3)?

137
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:46,644
Is he perhaps talking about the construction and demolition of houses?

138
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,749
What benefit would it be for us to know this?

139
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:55,545
After all, who doesn't know that some people destroy houses while others build them?

140
00:15:55,752 --> 00:16:01,385
Solomon here is not talking about houses, but about the destruction of evil and the building up of good.

141
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:08,320
It's necessary to first destroy evil and then build up good, as the Psalmist says:
"Turn away from evil and do good" (Psalm 37).

142
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,599
Therefore, he says there is a time to destroy evil and a time to build up good.

143
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:16,987
In this present life, we are given time by God to destroy evil and build up good.

144
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:23,759
First, through repentance, we erase sins in ourselves; and then, through holy desires, we construct the buildings of virtues.

145
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:31,561
Why does it say: A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance (Ecclesiastes 3)?

146
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:35,986
Who doesn't know that we weep at one time and laugh at another?

147
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:39,639
And what was the purpose of saying, a time to dance?

148
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,853
Did he mean we should indulge in the frivolities of dancing?

149
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,341
God forbid; we should not behave foolishly.

150
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:50,047
This present life is for weeping, and the future life is for laughing.

151
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:56,031
So, whoever cleanses themselves daily with tears and weeping now will laugh in the future life—they will rejoice.

152
00:16:56,031 --> 00:17:00,480
Similarly, this present life is for mourning, while the blessed life is for dancing.

153
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,557
When we dance, we show the joy in our minds and the affection in our spirits.

154
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:13,295
Therefore, whoever strives to wipe away sins through mourning in this life will dance in the future—they will be happy and rejoice in the glory of eternal happiness.

155
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,157
What does it mean when it says: Ecclesiastes 3:5?

156
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:20,975
A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather them.

157
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:29,493
What good is it to scatter stones, or what good is it to gather them, unless perhaps someone wants to build a house?

158
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,087
Solomon doesn't mention this reason, but rather talks about the dispersion and gathering of the nations.

159
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,553
By stones, he means nations.

160
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:41,739
That's why John says, "God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones" (Matthew 3).

161
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:47,971
Before the coming of the Lord, there was a time of scattering stones because the Gentiles did not stay united in faith.

162
00:17:47,971 --> 00:17:53,419
Turning away from God, they worshiped various gods and served different idols, causing their dispersion.

163
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,452
However, after the coming of the Lord, there was a time for gathering stones.

164
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:08,660
As the Apostle says, "When the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as children" (Galatians 4).

165
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,651
That's when He began to gather stones.

166
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:22,383
After completing the mystery of His passion and resurrection, He sent His apostles into the world, saying, "Go, teach all nations, baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28).

167
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:29,349
Then, after celebrating His ascension into heaven on the fortieth day, the fame of His name spread far and wide through the apostles.

168
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:33,801
Stones, meaning the Gentiles who were scattered by various idolatries, were gathered.

169
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:37,991
Repenting and turning away from idols, they came together in the unity of faith.

170
00:18:38,568 --> 00:19:08,437
Why does it say again:
There is a time for love and a time for hate;
yet the apostle John says:
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer First John three;
and in the Gospel, it is said:
Whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life John twelve;
likewise:
Whoever does not hate his father and mother, brothers and sisters, wife and children, and even his own life, cannot be my disciple Luke fourteen.

171
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:13,344
So tell me, when is the time for love, and when is the time for hate?

172
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:19,883
Now is the time for love because, after the Lord, we must love our father, mother, wife, children, and other relatives.

173
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:32,873
But there is also a time for hate because, for the sake of confessing Christ, we must scorn and even hate our father, mother, and all relatives if they are against us in the way of the Lord, as the holy martyrs are often read to have done.

174
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:39,261
What does it mean when it says: "A time for war and a time for peace" (Ecclesiastes 3)?

175
00:19:39,261 --> 00:20:01,103
How can there be a time for war when the Lord says in the Gospel: "Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him;"
and also: "If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also, and if anyone wants to take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well" (Luke 6)?

176
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:05,017
Truly, as long as we are in this life, it is always a time of war and struggle.

177
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:10,950
We constantly need to fight against the traps of the ancient enemy and defeat the powers of the air—that is, evil spirits.

178
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,966
However, the time of peace will come when we leave this world.

179
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:19,510
If we have fought well here, we will be crowned in the future and rest in eternal peace in the heavenly Jerusalem.

180
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:26,173
Why does it say that God made everything good in its time, when earlier it said that everything is vanity?

181
00:20:26,173 --> 00:20:29,002
If everything is vanity, how can they be good?

182
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:31,411
Everything is fleeting because it is temporary.

183
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:37,006
However, all things are good because they are created by God and indeed are good, but only in their proper time.

184
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,753
It is good to stay awake, and it is also good to sleep.

185
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:43,050
But always staying awake or always sleeping is certainly not good.

186
00:20:43,200 --> 00:21:03,810
Why does Solomon speak hesitantly, saying:
"Who knows if the spirit of the children of Adam ascends upward, and the spirit of the animals descends downward?"
Ecclesiastes 3.
For who does not know that the spirit of the animals
(that is, livestock and all other brute animals)
perishes together with the body?

187
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:15,989
But the spirit of the children of Adam
(that is, humans)
does not perish with the body; rather, as soon as it leaves the body, it is either taken to glory or plunged into punishment.

188
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:22,238
Earlier, Solomon demonstrated that, in terms of physical usefulness, there is no difference between an animal and a human.

189
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:24,316
Just as an animal dies, a human dies too.

190
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:34,603
However, to highlight the difference in the value of their souls, he said:
"Who knows if the spirit of the children of Adam goes upward, and the spirit of the animals goes downward?"
(Ecclesiastes 3:21).

191
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:45,903
This indicates that the only difference between humans and animals is that the human spirit ascends to heaven, while the spirit of an animal or livestock descends to the earth, as it dies and dissolves along with its flesh.

192
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:52,728
So why does Solomon say:
"Who knows?"
as if no one can understand this!

193
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,332
Therefore, he says: Who knows? to show the difficulty of the matter.

194
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:01,314
For who in the sacred Scriptures usually signifies not impossibility but difficulty or rarity.

195
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:04,812
Just as in this:
But who shall declare his generation
(Isaiah 53)?

196
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:07,038
This means, either no one, or very rarely.

197
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,696
For what is impossible cannot be done at all, even with great effort.

198
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,286
Therefore, he says: Who knows?

199
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:22,409
because a spiritual person who can perfectly understand at the moment when the spirit leaves the body, whether it ascends or is led to punishment, is very rare or certainly difficult to find.

200
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:26,951
What do these sons of Adam, or those beasts, mean spiritually?

201
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:33,631
The sons of Adam represent holy and chosen men, who are rightly called humans because they live rationally, holy, and spiritually.

202
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:41,337
On the other hand, animals represent the carnal ones, who are called animals because they live in a bestial and carnal way, like beasts and livestock.

203
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:45,601
Hence, the holy prophet David says: "You save humans and animals, Lord" (Psalm 36).

204
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:57,059
It often happens that those who seem to be righteous humans sin, turn away from their righteousness, and commit iniquity; conversely, those who are wicked and impious turn away from their iniquity and do justice and equity.

205
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:14,938
Therefore, Solomon says: "Who knows if the spirit of the sons of Adam rises upward and the spirit of animals goes downward?"
Because the state of this life is so uncertain, the sinner who is called an animal may rise and ascend to heaven through repentance, and the righteous one may fall into sin from his righteousness and be submerged into hell.

206
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:22,233
What does it mean when it says: A fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh (Ecclesiastes 4)?

207
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:25,965
Who would be so foolish as to eat their own flesh?

208
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:34,990
This fool, this lazy person, is described in Proverbs:
"The lazy person buries their hand in the dish, and won't even bring it back to their mouth"
(Proverbs 19).

209
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:45,210
This lazy and foolish person folds their hands and consumes their own flesh, preferring to live in idleness and laziness
with a handful of grain, rather than working to earn their food.

210
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,249
However, "consumes their own flesh" is an exaggeration.

211
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,489
What is hyperbole?

212
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:54,446
Hyperbole is an exaggerated statement or claim not meant to be taken literally.

213
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,458
It's often used for emphasis or to make a point.

214
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:30,213
For example, when someone says, "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse," they don't actually mean they could consume an entire horse.
They're just expressing that they're very hungry.
Hyperbole can be found in many forms of communication, from everyday conversations to literature and even the Bible.
In the Bible, hyperbolic language is used to convey strong emotions or emphasize the significance of an event or teaching.
For example, in the Book of Psalms, it says, "My tears have been my food day and night" (Psalms 42:3).

215
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:33,978
This doesn't mean that the person is literally eating tears.

216
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:36,175
It means they are deeply sorrowful.

217
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:47,595
Another example can be found in First Corinthians, where Paul says, "I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some" (First Corinthians 9:22).

218
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:52,050
Paul isn't claiming to have actually transformed into different people.

219
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,886
Rather, he's emphasizing his efforts to relate to others in various ways to share the gospel.

220
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:03,533
Understanding hyperbole helps us appreciate the depth and emotion behind these statements.

221
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:09,620
It's a powerful tool for communication that, when used appropriately, can leave a lasting impact.

222
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:12,647
Hyperbole is when you say something unbelievable.

223
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:18,983
So, how is it said in exaggeration, ɪɡˌzædʒəˈreɪʃən? "He eats his own flesh?"

224
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,654
It's hard to believe anyone would eat their own flesh.

225
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:32,087
But to highlight just how lazy this fool is, it says, "He eats his own flesh." This shows the fool would prefer to let his body waste away in starvation and misery rather than support himself through hard work.

226
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,877
Who is the one that Solomon talks about?

227
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:43,943
There is one, and he has no second, no son, no brother, yet he never stops working, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches.

228
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:50,305
He is the one who, being alone and without a second—that is, without a son, brother, or any relative—never stops working.

229
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:54,458
He is constantly gathering wealth, yet never gathers enough to satisfy himself.

230
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:59,294
Therefore, it is the greatest vanity to amass wealth and not know to whom you will leave it.

231
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:02,831
Who does the one with no spiritual equal signify?

232
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:09,599
The Lord Jesus Christ, by nature, is the only Son of God the Father and the only one who descended from heaven to redeem the human race.

233
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:17,519
How can someone not have a son or brother when, through holy baptism, all Christians become children of God and brothers of our Lord Jesus Christ?

234
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:24,240
He is the only true and natural Son; all others are adopted, making them his brothers not by nature, but by grace.

235
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,784
So, why doesn't this one stop working?

236
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:32,976
Because He patiently endures our sins and mercifully waits for us to repent, He intercedes for us every day with God the Father.

237
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,880
Why aren't his eyes satisfied with riches?

238
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,944
Because he always wants what's best for us.

239
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:42,367
Who is this threefold cord that Solomon speaks about?

240
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:47,208
A threefold cord is not easily broken. Ecclesiastes 4:12.

241
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:53,231
The unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; there are three persons in divinity, but only one nature.

242
00:26:53,231 --> 00:27:03,647
Why then does he say, "It is difficult to break"? For something difficult can still be done, though with great effort. So, can this cord be broken?

243
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,916
Truly never, because the nature of the Holy Trinity is indivisible.

244
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:12,671
In this case, "difficult" should be understood as "impossible," because the nature of the Divinity cannot be divided.

245
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:23,999
Who is that poor and wise boy that Solomon talks about:
"A poor and wise boy is better than an old and foolish king"
(Ecclesiastes chapter 4)?

246
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:28,293
The Lord Jesus Christ is called a child because of His innocence and simplicity.

247
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:31,835
He did not sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth First Peter two.

248
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:34,786
Although He was rich, He became poor for our salvation.

249
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:39,294
He is truly wise, because in Him dwells all the fullness of divinity in bodily form.

250
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,831
Who is that old, foolish king?

251
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:47,196
The devil, who has ruled over humanity since nearly the beginning of time, is often called an old man.

252
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:52,770
He's truly a foolish king because the more he deceives, the greater the punishment he brings upon himself.

253
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:00,974
In the realm of this old and foolish king, the devil, a remarkable child was born—our Lord Jesus Christ, who became the King of kings and the Lord of lords.

254
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:11,495
What does it mean when it says, "Watch your step when you enter the house of God"?
Is it warning us to be careful not to trip over stones when we enter the house of God, meaning the church?

255
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:19,876
Even though we should always enter the house of God with honesty, fear, and silence, it teaches us to guard not just the foot of the body, but the foot of the soul.

256
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:24,322
This means the step of the mind, so that we may offer pure prayers in the sight of God.

257
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:32,396
The idea is that when you enter the house of God that is, the church guard your foot, meaning the step of your mind, so you do not stumble with evil thoughts.

258
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:35,462
This ensures that your prayer may be directed purely to God.

259
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:42,441
What does it mean when it says, "Do not let your mouth lead you into sinning" (Ecclesiastes 5)?

260
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:46,536
How can a person let their mouth cause their body to sin?

261
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,550
When someone speaks empty words and lustful talk that incite the flesh to sin.

262
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:58,941
But the true meaning of this passage is:
Do not let your mouth lead your flesh to sin; in other words, do not make empty excuses that give your flesh a chance to sin.

263
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:04,097
Do not say: It is not I who sin, but the sin that dwells in me, referring to the weakness of my flesh.

264
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:09,304
Because if you say this, you provoke the Lord to anger, as if He were the author of wickedness and sin.

265
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:22,127
What does it mean when it says, "All of a person's labor is for their mouth, yet their soul is not satisfied" in
Ecclesiastes 6:7?
How can everything a person works for be just for their mouth?

266
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,259
The wise and learned churchman dedicates himself to his words.

267
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,906
Everything he learns from the Holy Scriptures, he meditates on daily, preaches, and teaches.

268
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:34,755
His soul will never be completely satisfied because what he has learned is never enough for him.

269
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:37,432
He always desires and strives to learn more and more.

270
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:46,356
What does it mean when it says: "It is better to see what you desire than to long for what you don't know" (Ecclesiastes 6:9)?

271
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:52,274
How can a person see what they desire, or how can they long for what they don't know?

272
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:57,651
The person who uses their mind to distinguish between good and evil sees that they desire good and reject evil.

273
00:29:57,651 --> 00:30:04,440
However, the one who follows their heart and desires often wishes for what they don't understand, because they want to grasp what they cannot.

274
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:11,951
About this, Solomon says:
"Who is to come has already been named, and it is known that he is a man."

275
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:17,095
The Lord Jesus Christ, whose name was foretold in the Holy Scriptures, took on flesh from the Virgin.

276
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:20,661
The prophets and saints of God knew that a true man was going to come.

277
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:29,550
If this is said about the Lord Jesus Christ, what does it mean when it follows with: And he cannot argue against someone stronger than himself in judgment?

278
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,998
Who is this stronger one that the Lord Jesus cannot argue against in judgment?

279
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:38,471
God the Father is stronger because the Son, in His humanity, is lesser than the Father.

280
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:47,207
What does it mean when it says, "Anger is better than laughter" in Ecclesiastes chapter 7, when laughter is natural, but anger is a vice?

281
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:49,966
Anger isn't always a vice; sometimes, it's a virtue.

282
00:30:49,966 --> 00:30:55,482
When we get angry at ourselves or at others who are sinning, this kind of anger is better than laughter.

283
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:59,088
Laughter can weaken the mind, and joy can corrupt a person's spirit.

284
00:30:59,088 --> 00:31:01,952
However, this type of anger can correct and amend sin.

285
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:10,511
What does it mean when it says: "Slander troubles the wise person and destroys their strength of heart" (Ecclesiastes 7:7)?

286
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:17,067
For someone who is truly wise is not troubled by any slander, nor brought down by any adversity.

287
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:25,831
The wise person in this passage should not be seen as someone who is perfect and complete in wisdom, but rather as someone who has just begun to acquire wisdom and is still imperfect.

288
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:32,009
Such a wise person can be easily disturbed and lose the strength and courage of their soul due to human slander or some adversity.

289
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:35,952
They become troubled with impatience when they do not endure adversities patiently.

290
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:40,919
What does it mean when people say that the earlier days were better than the times we live in now?

291
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,607
Therefore, it's not appropriate to say this, because he himself said: Such a question is foolish.

292
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:52,149
It's a silly question to ask:
Why were the old days better than now?

293
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:53,534
Ecclesiastes 7:10

294
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:59,303
Therefore, it's a foolish question because there's one God who is the creator of all time and all days.

295
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:05,831
Even though there is one God, the creator of all times and all days, aren't there good times and bad times?

296
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:08,715
Indeed, they existed, but virtues bring us good times.

297
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:10,370
Vices and sins bring bad times.

298
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,855
So, we should always live well to make the present days better than the past ones.

299
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:29,471
What does Solomon mean when he says, "Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise" Ecclesiastes 7?
What harm is there if a person is very righteous, or who can be wiser than necessary?

300
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:34,250
He is excessively just when his justice is harsh and cruel, causing others to complain and murmur.

301
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:41,807
For example, someone who sees his brother sinning and prefers to condemn and punish him rather than guide him to repentance is certainly excessively just.

302
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:44,351
How does a person know more than they need to?

303
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:47,932
When someone thinks arrogantly, the Apostle advises:
Do not be proud.

304
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,942
Romans
11,
meaning do not think arrogantly, but be afraid.

305
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:56,080
A person thinks more than necessary when they try to understand things that are beyond their grasp.

306
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:16,751
Why does Solomon say, "Whoever fears the Lord neglects nothing,"
Ecclesiastes
7:18,
while the apostle James says, "We all stumble in many ways,"
James
3:2?
Did James or the other apostles not fear God, since they confessed that they stumble in many ways?

307
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:21,455
They were genuinely afraid and made many mistakes, because no one on earth does good without sinning.

308
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:30,095
So, how can it be true then when it says: "Whoever fears the Lord, neglects nothing."
Ecclesiastes 7:18.

309
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:33,315
Those who possess a holy and pure fear of God neglect nothing.

310
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:36,795
They are neither uplifted by prosperity nor cast down by adversity.

311
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:39,184
Whatever happens to them does not sadden them.

312
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:43,199
So, who is the one who truly has the holy and pure fear of God?

313
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:49,919
Who does not want to offend the Lord in any way,
and as far as he is able,
strives to fulfill His will and commandments in everything.

314
00:33:49,919 --> 00:34:01,583
What does it mean when it says:
"Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten rulers of the city"
Ecclesiastes 7:19?
What is this wisdom, or who are these rulers?

315
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:06,146
Wisdom in this context signifies the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God.

316
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:10,958
The princes of the city are understood to be holy angels, the princes of the heavenly Jerusalem.

317
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:15,019
They are also the princes of the Church, as they govern and protect it every day.

318
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,784
So, why are they called the ten?

319
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:20,737
There were ten orders of angels, but one fell due to pride.

320
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:27,144
As a result, the good angels work towards fulfilling this number with humans, aiming to reach the perfect number, which is ten.

321
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:30,816
How does wisdom strengthen the wise more than ten rulers of a city?

322
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:34,320
Because the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ is greater than that of the angels.

323
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:51,984
What does Solomon mean when he says,
"I
found one man among a thousand, but
I
did not find a woman among them all"?
Were there not many holy women, both virgins and widows, who pleased God with their chastity and good works, many of whom were crowned with martyrdom?

324
00:34:51,984 --> 00:34:56,527
Indeed, there have been, and still are, many virgins and widows acceptable to God.

325
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:01,569
But Solomon says this because, in his time, he could scarcely find one good man among many.

326
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:06,057
Among women, he found none, as they all led him not to virtue, but to indulgence.

327
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:09,384
Can we interpret this sentence on a spiritual level?

328
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:15,594
It can truly be, for by man is meant a good thought of the mind, while by woman is meant a carnal and dissolute thought.

329
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:29,828
Therefore, among one thousand men, one is found, that is, one pure and clean thought which is not disturbed by perverse thought, that is, not polluted externally; but among women, none is found that pleases God, because a carnal and perverse thought is not acceptable to God.

330
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,409
What does it mean when it says, "Whoever keeps God's command will experience nothing bad" (Ecclesiastes 8)?

331
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:45,562
How can those who keep God's commands experience nothing bad, when holy men who followed God's commandments have endured many hardships in this world?

332
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:52,137
It's true that anyone who follows God's commandments—everything He has commanded and instructed—will not face any evil in the future.

333
00:35:52,137 --> 00:35:55,860
This means they won't suffer harm or endure any evil on the day of judgment.

334
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,876
While they might face some challenges in this life, these are light and temporary.

335
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:04,725
However, in the afterlife, those who attain the glory of eternal happiness will experience no evil.

336
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:16,728
What does it mean when it says, "A living dog is better than a dead lion" in Ecclesiastes 9?
What is Solomon referring to with a living dog or a dead lion?

337
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:22,397
A living dog represents the Gentile people, while a dead lion symbolizes the Jewish people abandoned by God.

338
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:31,584
This living dog is better before God than the dead lion, because we who believe from the Gentiles, alive through faith, recognize God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

339
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:38,409
A living dog can also be seen as a sinner who acknowledges being dead in sins; and through repentance, begins to live righteously.

340
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:47,544
A dead lion, on the other hand, represents a righteous person who relies on their own righteousness and boasts of their merits; and thus, lifted by pride, is dead before God.

341
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:52,321
Therefore, a humble sinner corrected by repentance is better than a proud righteous person.

342
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:55,681
The former is acceptable to God, while the latter is abominable.

343
00:36:55,944 --> 00:37:03,628
What does it mean: "Let your clothes always be white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head" (Ecclesiastes 9)?

344
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:06,100
Can anyone always have white clothes?

345
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:15,454
And if someone is wealthy enough to always have white clothes, which is very difficult, how can it be that oil never runs dry on their head?

346
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:19,263
Who could bear to always have anointed oil on their head?

347
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:23,064
This statement should be understood not historically, but spiritually.

348
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:30,522
Clothing represents virtues with which the soul is dressed and adorned, while oil symbolizes the work of mercy, such as charity or spiritual joy.

349
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:37,261
The meaning is: Let your clothes always be white; that is, whatever good you do, be clean and pure, so it may be acceptable to God.

350
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:40,861
Never fail in works of mercy, and always strive to have spiritual joy.

351
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:49,392
What are the flies that Solomon refers to when he says, "Dead flies ruin the sweetness of it?"
(Ecclesiastes 10)

352
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,608
Surely, Solomon truly understands spiritual flies.

353
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,984
What are these spiritual flies?

354
00:37:54,984 --> 00:38:01,440
Demons, vices, and sins: all these ruin the sweetness of the ointment here, which is the grace of the Holy Spirit.

355
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:10,944
What does it mean when it says:
"The heart of the wise is on their right, and the heart of the fool is on their left"
(Ecclesiastes 10:2)?

356
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:15,627
After all, who has their physical heart in their right or left hand?

357
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:20,112
Truly, no one should take this statement literally; it should be understood spiritually.

358
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:22,560
How can we understand it spiritually?

359
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,377
The heart represents intention or thought; the right hand represents good deeds; and the left hand represents evil deeds.

360
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:34,915
Therefore, the heart of a wise person is on their right hand, because their intentions and thoughts aim towards always doing good deeds.

361
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:41,982
So that on the day of judgment, they may be found at the right hand of the Lord, among the righteous, and may glory with them in eternal happiness.

362
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:46,790
However, the heart of a fool is on their left hand, because they accumulate evil thoughts and deeds.

363
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:52,895
For which, on the day of judgment, they will be placed on the left, among the wicked, and will be punished with them eternally.

364
00:38:53,088 --> 00:39:07,248
Who is that spirit of whom it is said, "If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place?"
Who is this powerful being, whose spirit, if it rises against us, we should not abandon our position?

365
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:11,136
The devil, the ruler of this world, embodies an evil suggestion.

366
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:13,848
How does the spirit of the devil come upon us?

367
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:18,347
When the devil suggests bad thoughts, we shouldn't let them take root in our hearts.

368
00:39:18,347 --> 00:39:23,703
Instead, we need to fight against them strongly to prevent these thoughts from turning into actions.

369
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:33,558
Think of it this way: if you possess humility, purity, chastity, patience, and love, and the devil tempts you with pride, lust, impurity, anger, and hatred, don't abandon your virtues.

370
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:36,504
For example, don't let go of humility and become proud.

371
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,289
This principle applies to all other virtues as well.

372
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:58,944
Why does Solomon say:
"Woe to you, land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning?"
Wasn't the land of Israel blessed with a young king, namely David, who was thirty years old when he took the throne?
And wasn't Josiah a good king, who began to reign in his youth?

373
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,632
Truly, King David was good, and so was Josiah.

374
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:11,040
But woe to the land whose king is young, where wisdom is scarce and fragile, and worldly prudence follows youthful desires, hating justice, truth, and judgment.

375
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,176
How do princes eat breakfast?

376
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:16,182
The leaders eat in the morning when they lead a luxurious life.

377
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:23,628
Therefore, woe to the land whose leaders eat in the morning, for they cherish worldly pleasures and fleshly delights more than the well-being of the people.

378
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,680
By living in luxury, they distort judgment.

379
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:30,456
How blessed is the land whose king is noble and whose leaders eat at the proper time?

380
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:38,065
If the king is noble—distinguished by wisdom, shining with justice, and adorned with good morals and actions—truly blessed is the land he rules.

381
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,395
He governs it with judgment and fairness, and elevates justice.

382
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:44,040
Who are the princes that eat at the right time?

383
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:54,087
Certainly, those who avoid excess, who don't love worldly pleasures, and who live without gluttony and drunkenness, but seek food only for the body's sustenance: blessed is the land that has such leaders.

384
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:58,126
Because while they love justice and fairness, they surely do not pervert judgment.

385
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:04,873
What does it mean when it says:
"Give portions to seven, and also to eight"
(Ecclesiastes 11)?

386
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:09,432
What are those seven or eight portions we are commanded to give?

387
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:14,701
The number seven represents the Old Testament because of the Sabbath, the seventh day made holy by the law.

388
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:21,599
In contrast, the number eight signifies the New Testament due to the Lord's Day, the eighth day made holy by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

389
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:29,280
How should we understand what he said: "Give portions to seven, and also to eight"
Ecclesiastes 11:2?

390
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:38,040
This means: hold both Testaments namely the Old and New in equal reverence by believing in them and diligently striving to fulfill their commandments.

391
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:47,412
What does it mean when it says:
"If a tree falls to the south or to the north, in whatever place it falls, there it will lie" (Ecclesiastes 11:3)?

392
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:53,575
Doesn't a tree that falls to the north or the south often get moved to other parts of the world?

393
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,320
No one doubts this, but this statement should be understood spiritually.

394
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:02,023
A man is represented by a tree because each person is like a tree in the forest of humanity.

395
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:05,295
The south wind, which is warm, symbolizes the peace of paradise.

396
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:08,465
The north wind, which is cold, symbolizes the torment of hell.

397
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:17,718
The meaning is: Wherever a person prepares their future home—if to the south, when they die, they will remain in the peace of paradise and the glory of the heavenly kingdom forever.

398
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:23,648
But if by living badly they prepare a place to the north, they will suffer the punishments of hell for all eternity.

399
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:32,923
What does it mean when it says, "Those who watch the wind will not sow, and those who look at the clouds will never reap" (Ecclesiastes 11)?

400
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:39,559
Who is so foolish to always watch the wind and not sow, or to always look at the clouds and never reap?

401
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:48,867
This sentence should be understood spiritually: just as wind and clouds often bring about storms, the devil is represented by the wind, and the adversities of this present world by the clouds.

402
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:59,748
Therefore, whoever fears the persecution of the devil or the adversities of this world does not sow, meaning they do not preach the word of God, nor do they perform the good works they are capable of, and they will never reap.

403
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:03,647
Because even if they start some good deeds, they do not bring them to completion.

404
00:43:03,744 --> 00:43:05,424
What should be done then?

405
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:10,271
Without worrying about the clouds or fearing the winds, we must sow even in the midst of storms.

406
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:16,584
In other words, despite all adversities, we must preach the word of God and always do the good works that we are able to do.

407
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:25,607
What does it mean when it says, "In the morning, sow your seed, and in the evening, do not let your hands be idle" (Ecclesiastes 11:6)?

408
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:34,229
How can anyone always sow both in the morning and in the evening, especially when no one dares to sow during the freezing season?

409
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:45,144
In this context, "seed" shouldn't be thought of as grain or any other kind of seed. Instead, it represents the seed of good works, from which the fruit of justice grows, leading to the reward of eternal recompense.

410
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:52,080
So, what does it mean when it says: "In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not let your hands be idle"?

411
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,582
So that at no time, in no age, should we stop doing good works.

412
00:43:55,582 --> 00:44:01,365
Let the evening find us with our morning righteousness, and let the rising sun add to our evening mercy.

413
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:05,702
In both youth and old age, the abundance of virtues always commends us to God.

414
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:10,761
Therefore, in the morning, sow your seed, and in the evening, do not let your hand be idle.

415
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:13,486
This means, always engage yourself in good works.

416
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,154
Ecclesiastes Eleven, Verse Six

417
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:24,657
What does it mean when it says, "And the almond tree will blossom, the locust will grow fat, and the caperberry will be scattered" (Ecclesiastes 12)?

418
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:32,026
Why mention this, when everyone knows that the almond tree blossoms, the locust grows fat, and the caperberry scatters?

419
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:36,317
This saying should be understood spiritually, and it holds a profound mystery.

420
00:44:36,317 --> 00:44:38,703
The almond represents the Lord Jesus Christ.

421
00:44:38,703 --> 00:44:44,559
Just as the almond consists of a shell, a stone, and a kernel, Christ consists of flesh, soul, and divinity.

422
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,565
The almond stone symbolizes divinity.

423
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,751
What do the locust and the caper bush represent?

424
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:53,903
Through the locust, the Gentile people; through the caper bush, the Jewish people.

425
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:57,096
How, then, should we understand this sentence?

426
00:44:57,096 --> 00:45:01,459
The almond tree will bloom, signifying the birth of Christ and the miracles he will bring.

427
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:06,889
The locust will become fat, symbolizing that the Gentile people will believe and be filled with spiritual gifts.

428
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:11,399
The caper will be scattered, representing the Jewish people's downfall due to their unbelief.

429
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:16,244
Why are the words of the wise compared to goads and nails?

430
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:24,432
Solomon says,
"The words of the wise are like goads and like nails driven deep"
Ecclesiastes 12:11.

431
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:31,270
The words of the wise are best compared to nails and goads because they don't just gently touch the faults of sinners—they pierce them.

432
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,207
Truly wise individuals use their words as nails and goads.

433
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:38,057
They don't flatter sinners; instead, they rebuke them with stern reprimands.

434
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:43,528
These words prick the hidden parts of their conscience, causing pain and lamentation, leading to correction.

435
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:59,496
What does it mean when it says,
"What was given by one shepherd through the advice of teachers"
Ecclesiastes 12:11?
Who are these teachers through whose advice the wise words were given, or who is that one shepherd from whom they were given?

436
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:01,623
The teachers are the prophets and apostles.

437
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:05,334
There is one shepherd, God, from whom all the words of the wise were given.

438
00:46:05,334 --> 00:46:12,261
He taught the teachers, that is, the prophets and apostles, and rebuilt their understanding, for He placed words in their hearts and mouths.

439
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,853
What does Ecclesiastes say at the end of his book?

440
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:20,743
Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.

441
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:24,585
How can it be that this is all there is to being human?

442
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:27,450
To fear God and observe His commandments?

443
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:33,248
Surely, a much larger portion of people neither fear God nor keep His commandments.

444
00:46:33,528 --> 00:46:44,592
Truly, there are more bad people than good, because as the Lord says, "Many are called, but few are chosen." Matthew chapter twenty. The number of unbelievers far exceeds the number of believers.

445
00:46:44,592 --> 00:46:47,304
What is Solomon trying to show us here?

446
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:52,008
This is evident in these words: there is no one who does not fear God and keep His commandments.

447
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:54,384
Why isn't he considered a man?

448
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:57,264
Because he doesn't adhere to the measure and reason of his nature.

449
00:46:57,264 --> 00:47:00,048
What is the nature and condition of human nature?

450
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:05,268
To live reasonably, because among all living creatures, only humans were created as rational beings.

451
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:13,099
Humans received reason and understanding from God so they could recognize their Creator, love Him, fear Him, and praise Him with both heart and mouth.

452
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:15,696
What does it mean to fear God?

453
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:19,080
To carry out His will and accomplish the good things that need to be done.

454
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,528
So, if someone doesn't fear God and doesn't follow His commandments, what does that make them?

455
00:47:24,528 --> 00:47:25,608
The beast is.

456
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:29,208
How can it be a beast when it has human substance and personality?

457
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:36,432
Although it seems to have human qualities and personhood,
since it lives not rationally but like an animal,
it should be called not a human but a beast.

458
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:38,280
What is the beast called?

459
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,085
If someone is cruel to their family, subjects, or neighbors, they are a lion, not a human.

460
00:47:43,085 --> 00:47:45,648
If they are a thief, they are a tiger or a wolf.

461
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:49,546
If they are an adulterer, fornicator, or impure, they are a dog or a pig.

462
00:47:49,546 --> 00:47:52,270
If they are foolish, they are compared to a donkey.

463
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:56,862
Therefore, if they are deceitful or a hypocrite, they are fittingly compared to a fox.

464
00:47:56,862 --> 00:48:00,333
This pattern can be understood for other characteristics as well.

465
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,712
Who then is truly human?

466
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:05,064
The one who fears God and keeps His commandments.
