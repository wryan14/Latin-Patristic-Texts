00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,184
Mystical Exposition on the Proverbs of Solomon
by Salonius

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:08,807
What language were the parables spoken in?

3
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:11,928
In Greek, but in Latin, they explain the parables.

4
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,760
Why did Solomon choose that name for the book?

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,560
This shows us that we shouldn't take what is said literally, but rather interpret it in a spiritual way.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,728
What does Solomon mean when he speaks in parables?

7
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:29,952
The Lord Jesus Christ spoke to the crowds of Jews in parables because, even by his own name, he signifies the same Lord Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,231
So, how does Solomon interpret it?

9
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:56,304
Peaceful or loving; it refers to the one about whom the Apostle says, "Christ is our peace, who has made both one." Ephesians chapter 2, verse 11.
And also, "Making peace through his blood, whether things in heaven or things on earth." Colossians chapter 1.
Solomon, which means loving, very fittingly signifies him to whom the Father speaks, saying: "You are my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." Matthew chapter 3.

10
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,520
What does the peaceful state of his kingdom signify?

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,264
The everlasting kingdom of Christ and the Church, as it is written:
And of His kingdom, there will be no end
(Luke chapter 1).

12
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:13,176
Why, according to the translation of the seventy interpreters, are these sayings of Solomon called proverbs and not parables?

13
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:16,716
Parables are named so because they signify hidden and secret mysteries.

14
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:23,347
Similarly, proverbs are fittingly named because they are meant to be often spoken, committed to memory, and retained by the faithful.

15
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,940
As it is written in the Book of Proverbs, chapter 1.

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,848
What benefits do Solomon's parables offer?

17
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:33,264
Wisdom and discipline, of course; and this is what he says:
Learn wisdom and discipline.

18
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:36,528
What is the difference between wisdom and discipline?

19
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:38,990
Wisdom is the understanding of divine things.

20
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,384
Discipline, however, is the way to live a holy and pure life.

21
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,168
So, what does it mean to learn wisdom?

22
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:47,520
Know and understand how to believe correctly.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,968
What does it mean to learn discipline?

24
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:58,728
To understand how each person should live, what actions are right to take, and where to focus their intentions, it follows:
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

25
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,936
How many are the fears of the Lord?

26
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:03,216
Two, meaning the servant and the holy one.

27
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,592
Why is it called "servile"?

28
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:10,248
Because we serve the Lord like servants out of fear of hell, we avoid being led to torment.

29
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,384
Why is it called holy fear?

30
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:19,872
Just as a good son fears disappointing his loving father, even in the smallest way, those who are perfect in the Church fear offending God by sinning.

31
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,888
Who is the wiser of the two?

32
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:30,575
Servile, because anyone who starts to gain wisdom, meaning they realize after sinning that they have gone astray, is first corrected by divine fear to avoid torment.

33
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,120
What does holy fear actually do?

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,613
Increasing wisdom, because perfect love casts out fear.

35
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:39,980
First John, chapter 4, talks about that servile fear.

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,885
But holy fear remains forever.

37
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:42,457
Psalm 18.

38
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:49,515
What does Solomon say: "In vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird" (Proverbs Chapter 1).

39
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,489
Yet, don't birds often get caught in nets?

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,192
They are indeed accustomed to it.

41
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:57,192
So, who exactly are these winged ones?

42
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:04,107
Holy and chosen men possess the wings of faith, hope, and charity, along with other virtues that enable them to contemplate heavenly things.

43
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:09,590
They also have spiritual eyes, allowing them to foresee the snares of the ancient enemy and guard against sins.

44
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,245
Therefore, casting the net is in vain before the eyes of those with wings.

45
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:22,531
In other words, the snares of the devil's traps are set before holy and chosen men in vain, because they can easily overcome the devil's snares on earth, as their way of life is in heaven.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,841
What is the wisdom Solomon speaks of? Wisdom calls out in the street.

47
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:29,496
She raises her voice in the public squares.

48
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:33,695
Jesus Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, as the Apostle says.

49
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:36,599
So, how does this wisdom get shared outside?

50
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,311
Inside, he preached in secret before he suffered, revealing the mysteries of his divinity only to his disciples.

51
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,708
But after his resurrection, he preached openly.

52
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:50,369
With the Holy Spirit sent from above, he declared through the apostles to the world that he was the Son of God.

53
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,135
How did he raise his voice in the streets?

54
00:03:53,135 --> 00:04:00,917
Because what he had previously taught in secret and in hiding, only among the Jewish people, he later proclaimed openly to all nations through the apostles.

55
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:10,294
He commanded them, saying:
What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, meaning openly;
and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the rooftops, that is, openly and in front of everyone.

56
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:14,087
What does he say? In the midst of the crowds, he cries out.

57
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,434
The leaders of the Jews are represented by heads.

58
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:25,151
He shouted among the crowds, openly reminding the Jewish leaders, through the apostles, of the murder they had committed against him, and he called them to the remedy of repentance.

59
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,964
How should this be understood as it follows?

60
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:31,031
At the gates of the city, she speaks her words.

61
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:35,604
Throughout the city, the holy Church is represented, gathered from both the Jews and the Gentiles.

62
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:41,295
The doors of this city's gates were the holy teachers who, by preaching the word of the Gospel, brought believers into it.

63
00:04:41,295 --> 00:04:45,914
Wisdom was speaking at the doors of the city's gates when Christ was speaking through his apostles.

64
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:51,374
What does it mean when it says: "Incline your heart to understanding wisdom" (Proverbs 2)?

65
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,580
How can a person incline their heart?

66
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:02,663
He inclines his heart to understand wisdom, humbles himself, and cleanses his soul from sins, so that he may become worthy to receive the mysteries of the Divinity.

67
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:09,168
What does it mean when it says, "Do not rely on your own wisdom"?
Who actually relies on wisdom?

68
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:12,864
He who trusts in his own wisdom or strength to fulfill God's commandments.

69
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:20,010
Here it says again: Do not be wise in your own eyes. Proverbs Chapter 3.

70
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,988
Who is wise in their own eyes?

71
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:28,944
The one who elevates himself above others as a teacher and boasts about his understanding and knowledge of the words of the Fathers.

72
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,080
What is true human wisdom?

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,100
Fear the Lord and turn away from evil.

74
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,504
Here's what comes next:
Fear the Lord, and turn away from evil.

75
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,936
How can you tell if this is truly human wisdom?

76
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:46,656
As it is written in the Book of Job:
"Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to turn away from evil is understanding."

77
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:52,320
Who is the man Solomon refers to when he says,
"Blessed is the man who finds wisdom"?

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,672
A faithful and devoted Catholic Christian.

79
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,784
When did he discover wisdom?

80
00:05:56,784 --> 00:06:04,176
When he truly understands the teaching of the Gospel with both his mind and heart, and through the Holy Scriptures, he strives to know the will of the Lord.

81
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:06,096
When does wisdom flow?

82
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:11,400
When they listen to the divine commandments with great love and affection for their Creator, and strive to fulfill them.

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:21,816
What does it mean when it says: "Her ways are beautiful, all her paths are peaceful"? What are these ways of wisdom, or what are her paths?

84
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:27,880
The ways of wisdom are the actions of the Lord that He performed in the flesh, or His teachings found in the books of the Gospel.

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,183
These ways are beautiful because they are divine.

86
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:34,414
The paths of wisdom are the commandments and orders of the Lord, leading to eternal peace.

87
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:37,610
Peaceful, because all the Lord's commandments lead to eternal peace.

88
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:43,512
What law or advice is Solomon referring to when he says: Keep the law and advice?

89
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,127
The law and the wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,120
What is the law of wisdom?

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,628
The law of wisdom says:
If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.

92
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:57,541
That means, you shall not murder,
you shall not commit adultery,
you shall not steal.

93
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,604
As mentioned in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,640
What is the plan of wisdom?

95
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,024
If you want to be perfect, sell everything you have and give it to the poor.

96
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:12,768
What does it mean when it says, "Every mocker is an abomination to the Lord"?
And who exactly is a mocker?

97
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:17,044
A mocker is someone who distorts God's words by misunderstanding and misteaching them.

98
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:20,675
A mocker looks down on their humble and poor neighbors by insulting them.

99
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:27,836
A mocker despises God's great promises, treating them as insignificant, and scoffs at the punishment of eternal damnation, as if it is bearable.

100
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,477
The Lord detests all such people.

101
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:34,649
He converses with the simple, as they are enlightened by the grace of heavenly wisdom, free from deceit.

102
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:51,624
Why does Solomon say, "And I was a son to my father, tender and the only one before my mother," Proverbs chapter 4? How could he be the only one before his mother when his half-brother preceded him, as the holy Scripture of the Book of Kings First Kings chapter 12 testifies?

103
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:56,132
It's true that his half-brother was born before him, but he passed away shortly after birth.

104
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,632
Without even a name, it was as if he never existed.

105
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:00,837
That's why he considers himself the only son.

106
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:04,731
Why does it say: Do not turn to the right or to the left?

107
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:11,256
Who can control themselves so perfectly that their body doesn't lean to the right or to the left?

108
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:16,742
No one, but by the right hand, the good path is indicated, and by the left hand, the bad and wicked path.

109
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:21,235
It does not prohibit walking on the right path, but rather turning aside to the right.

110
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,879
Who then turns to the right or to the left?

111
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,980
The righteous person turns to the right, relying on their own justice and strength.

112
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,167
The unrighteous person turns to the left, despairing of being saved because of the weakness of the flesh.

113
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:37,711
The one who wants to know more than they should, as stated in Romans 12, turns to the right.

114
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,675
Meanwhile, the one who serves foolishness turns to the left.

115
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:46,175
Why then does he say a little later: "The Lord knows the ways that are right?"

116
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:49,640
Through the right paths, holy actions and good works are indicated.

117
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,691
The Lord knows these; He directs them, and they please Him.

118
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:56,518
Conversely, in judgment, He will say to the reprobates: I do not know you.

119
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:59,569
Meaning, I did not choose you because you do not please me.

120
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:03,345
Since I do not see you in my light, I do not see you in my righteousness.

121
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:11,100
What does it mean when it says:
"Do not give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel" (Proverbs 5)?

122
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,978
What honor is it referring to, and who are these others?

123
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:18,665
Speaking of honor, it is said that man was made in the image of God.

124
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:26,111
It refers to strangers as demons to emphasize this: Do not subject your honor, created in God's image, to unclean spirits by living poorly.

125
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:29,759
Who does he call cruel, and which years is he talking about?

126
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,029
Years are referred to as the spans of life.

127
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,519
The cruel devil, and the message is: Do not hand over the spans of life, which God gave you, to the devil by living badly.

128
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:50,639
From which cistern does Solomon teach us to drink water, or from which well does he teach us to drink streams, when he says:
Drink water from your own cistern, and flowing water from your own well?

129
00:09:50,639 --> 00:10:24,479
He calls the cistern "catholic," referring to the teachings of the Old and New Testaments. The well, on the other hand, signifies the depth and height of the same catholic teaching. Water symbolizes knowledge, and streams represent the abundance and richness of knowledge—that is, the various understandings of the Holy Scriptures.
With these words, he advises us to beware of the doctrines of heretics and to focus on the readings of the Holy Scriptures. The idea is: Drink water from your own cistern, meaning, uphold and practice the teachings you preach to others. And streams from your own well, meaning, let the abundance of your words or knowledge overflow in you through good works.

130
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:40,583
Why does Solomon say, "Let your fountains be dispersed abroad," and "divide your waters in the streets,"
when he immediately adds, "Have them yourself alone, let not strangers be partakers with you"?
If we disperse our fountains abroad and divide our waters in the streets, how can we have them alone?

131
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:46,309
Although it may seem contradictory, there is no inconsistency because these statements can only be understood spiritually.

132
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:52,974
We channel our sources outward when we inspire others through the power of preaching, and when we share the words of Holy Scripture with them.

133
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,978
We distribute water in the streets when we preach to the people.

134
00:10:55,978 --> 00:11:06,867
The term "street" comes from the word for width; it is a Greek term.
Therefore, we distribute water in the streets when we spread words of knowledge to a large audience and share divine teachings according to each person's capacity.

135
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:11,135
If we have to share water in the streets, how can we keep it just for ourselves?

136
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:18,360
We share water in the streets when we spread divine words to others, but we alone hold the water because we do not seek human praise from that preaching.

137
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:27,024
What does it mean when it says, "Let your springs be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers" (Proverbs 5:17)?

138
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:36,202
He calls them foreign demons, about whom the Psalmist said: "Foreigners have risen up against me, and the mighty have sought my soul" (Psalm fifty-three, verse five).

139
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:44,440
We invite evil, that is, unclean spirits, to be our partners and associates in preaching when we become proud and seek vain glory from our preaching.

140
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:52,991
About whom does Solomon speak:
A deceitful and useless man walks with a perverse mouth
Proverbs 6:12.

141
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:58,295
He calls a man who abandons the faith a schismatic, someone who works to divide the unity of the Church.

142
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,671
In what language is 'apostate' said?

143
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,319
Greek translates into Latin as "one who flees and departs from the truth."

144
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,607
Why, then, is a schismatic called an apostate?

145
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:11,749
Like a proud angel, he first swells with pride and then falls from his mental state.

146
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:15,200
As a result, he turns away from the love of his Creator and the truth.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,341
If he hadn't turned away from the truth, he wouldn't spread injustice in the Church.

148
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:27,383
Why is it said about him:
He winks with his eyes,
shuffles with his feet,
and speaks with his fingers?

149
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:30,781
Guarding the mind internally helps keep the outer actions orderly.

150
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:37,679
This apostate, having lost his state and self-control, ultimately disrupted the outer aspects given by the Lord, leading to disorder.

151
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:46,849
What does it mean when it says about the law: "Bind it on your fingers, write it on the tablets of your heart" (Proverbs 7:3)?

152
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:53,399
How can someone bind the law on their fingers, and if they do, what purpose does it serve?

153
00:12:53,471 --> 00:13:00,342
It says, in actions, meaning in deeds: for whoever strives to fulfill and adorn the law through good works binds it in their actions.

154
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,958
It says, in the tablets of the heart, meaning in the depth of thought.

155
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,640
Therefore, whoever receives the law with joy and commits it to memory writes it in the tablets of their heart.

156
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:21,672
What does Wisdom mean when it says:
Through me, kings reign, and lawmakers make just decrees;
Through me, rulers govern, and the powerful decide what is right?

157
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:23,951
Christ, the power and wisdom of God.

158
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:28,559
Does Christ give the kingdom and power to all wicked tyrants and rulers?

159
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:51,383
Certainly not, but with his permission, wicked kings and rulers take on kingdoms or empires, because it is written in the book of Job: "He allows the hypocrite to reign because of the sins of the people" Job 34. But in this context, the apostles are called holy kings, who first know how to faithfully govern themselves, and then the Church entrusted to them. Or he calls all the saints kings, who know how to govern themselves and others well.

160
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:54,119
Who does he refer to as the founders of laws?

161
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,967
The authors of both Testaments.

162
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,751
Whom does He consider leaders and powerful ones?

163
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:05,158
Other teachers and leaders of the faithful have received the kingdom, leadership, and authority through the wisdom of God the Father.

164
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:12,575
This means they received it through Christ, so they could accomplish good works, as he himself says:
"Without me, you can do nothing."
(John, Chapter 15).

165
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:17,831
What does Wisdom say? "I was delighted every day, playing in front of Him."

166
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,311
That means always being in the presence of the Father while living in the world.

167
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:25,439
Did Wisdom, the Son of God, play childishly before the Father?

168
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:29,465
Of course not. But what he says while playing must be understood as rejoicing.

169
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:37,775
He was playing every single day, meaning he was celebrating being one; that is, of one substance with the Father, from the beginning, from the days of eternity.

170
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:42,215
How did he manage to play all the time, no matter where he was in the world?

171
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:49,175
Since the beginning of the world and creation, the Son has always rejoiced, because he has always remained in the Father, just as he was.

172
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:57,839
What does it mean when it says, "Wisdom has built herself a house"?
Proverbs 9.
And what kind of house has she built for herself?

173
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,695
Wisdom, who is the Son of God, built Himself a house.

174
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:05,327
He created man in the womb of the Virgin, whom He took on in the unity of His person.

175
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,231
How did he manage to destroy the seven pillars?

176
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:14,474
He built seven pillars because, through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit, he established churches around the world.

177
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:19,892
These churches, like pillars, sustain and preserve his memory, reflecting the mystery of his Incarnation.

178
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,863
Can it be understood differently?

179
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:24,919
It is truly possible: The House of Wisdom is the Church of Christ.

180
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,142
The pillars of this house are the holy teachers.

181
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:32,883
These pillars are rightly said to be seven because the holy teachers are filled with the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit.

182
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,263
So, how did Wisdom carve these columns?

183
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:43,559
He cut down the columns because he separated the minds of the preachers from the love of this present age
and raised them up to support the structure of the Church.

184
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:53,020
Regarding these maidservants, he mentions a bit later:
He sent his maidservants to call out to the citadel and the city walls.

185
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,996
Proverbs 9:3.

186
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:56,735
He refers to the holy apostles as his servants.

187
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,751
Why does he call them maids?

188
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:04,579
Because of foolishness, weakness, and poverty; He chose uneducated, weak, poor, and despised people as apostles.

189
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:12,331
He sent them into the world to preach so they might call the faithful to the citadel of eternal happiness and to the walls of the heavenly Jerusalem.

190
00:16:12,383 --> 00:16:15,417
Who is the wise son that makes his father happy?

191
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:19,271
And who is the foolish son that brings sorrow to his mother?

192
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:25,285
He who receives the mysteries of faith and baptism, keeps them well, and fulfills them through actions, is a wise son.

193
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,782
Without a doubt, he brings joy to God the Father.

194
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:34,662
But he who receives the sacraments of faith and baptism and then corrupts them with evil deeds or heretical depravity is a foolish son.

195
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:39,351
He is certainly a source of sorrow to his mother, namely the Church, because he grieves her.

196
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:47,231
What does it mean when it says, "A fool will be beaten with lips"?
How can a foolish person be beaten with lips?

197
00:16:47,231 --> 00:17:07,751
In this context, "beating" signifies condemnation.
Therefore, the fool will be beaten with words, as he will be condemned for the wicked and evil things he has said.
Hence, elsewhere Moses (or rather Solomon) says:
"Life and death are in the power of the tongue"
(Proverbs 18),
because each person will either be condemned or justified by their words
(Matthew 12).

198
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:12,071
Why do we say "hands of the tongue" when a tongue can't have hands?

199
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:18,409
It is metaphorically said, through a figure of speech, just as the winds are said to have wings Psalms 17, 103, etc.

200
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:25,238
: the hands of the tongue represent the very words by which one earns life by speaking good, or earns death by speaking evil.

201
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:41,081
In the Holy Scriptures, works are often referred to as "hands," as in the phrase: "You shall eat the labor of your hands" Psalms 127.
He says "in the hands of the tongue," meaning in works. For the works of the tongue are good or evil conversations, from which either death or life is born.

202
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:51,983
Who is that lazy person of whom it is said:
Just like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy one to those who send him
(Proverbs 10:26)?

203
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:56,527
A lazy and poorly living Catholic is someone who does not strive to earn eternal happiness.

204
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:59,423
The deceit of heretics is symbolized by vinegar and smoke.

205
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:02,519
The eyes and teeth represent the preachers of the holy Church.

206
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:08,911
They are called eyes because they foresee the right paths, and teeth because they provide spiritual nourishment to the faithful.

207
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:22,243
Just as vinegar is to the teeth and smoke is to the eyes — meaning the deceit of heretics causes sadness, distress, and tears to good teachers — a lazy person, or a bad Catholic, is a burden to those good teachers who command him to fulfill his faith through actions.

208
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:25,838
It is even more burdensome because he destroys his faith with bad deeds.

209
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:33,296
What does it mean when it says, "Hand in hand, the wicked will not go unpunished" (Proverbs 11:21)?

210
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:38,903
How is the wicked person "hand in hand," and why will they not go unpunished?

211
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,433
The one who joins hands in wrongdoing accomplishes nothing at all.

212
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:47,148
Therefore, as long as the wicked person holds hands with another, he will not be innocent.

213
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:54,010
Because even if he temporarily withdraws his hands from evil work, as long as he remains wicked, he cannot have innocence of heart.

214
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,573
As it is said above: A perverse heart is an abomination to the Lord.

215
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,830
Proverbs eleven, twenty.

216
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,535
What is at hand? The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel.

217
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,151
A guilty conscience comes from doing something wrong.

218
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:14,351
How should we understand this:
"A gold ring in a pig's snout is like a beautiful woman without good sense"?

219
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,922
Imagine putting a gold ring in the nose of a pig.

220
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:22,219
As the pig digs around in the ground, the gold ring gets plunged into a mud pit and loses its beauty.

221
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:33,759
Similarly, a foolish woman, no matter how beautiful she is or how much fine jewelry and clothing she has, tarnishes her own beauty and loses her elegance if she soils herself with lust and corrupts herself with adultery.

222
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:37,343
How can we understand this sentence from a spiritual perspective?

223
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,427
Whoever studies the Holy Scriptures carefully and continuously examines the divine words, gains the adornments of knowledge.

224
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:52,454
But if they live poorly and destroy what they have understood well, they are like a pig with a golden ring in its nose; digging in the earth, defiling, and immersing themselves in mud.

225
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:57,065
The ornament they gained through knowledge of the Scriptures becomes soiled by impure actions.

226
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:03,884
Such a soul is like a beautiful and foolish woman: beautiful through knowledge, but given to carnal pleasures, foolish through her actions.

227
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:16,055
What does it mean when it says, "The soul that blesses will be enriched, and the one who refreshes others will also be refreshed?"
There are many who refresh others, but they themselves are not refreshed.

228
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:19,571
He doesn't speak of physical drunkenness, but of the spiritual soul.

229
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:25,724
If it blesses, it will be enriched, because whatever it blesses outwardly by preaching, it receives spiritual blessing.

230
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,722
In other words, it increases and grows in spiritual grace.

231
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:36,684
Similarly, the one who strives to intoxicate the minds of listeners with sacred words is also intoxicated and filled with the infusion of the Holy Spirit.

232
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,959
Why did it not say: Man, but rather Soul which blesses will be enriched?

233
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:48,328
In the Holy Scriptures, it's common for a part to represent the whole, or the whole to represent a part.

234
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:50,651
This figure of speech is known as synecdoche.

235
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:58,807
In this instance, a part represents the whole person, and the whole represents a part, as in the phrase:
"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb" (John 20).

236
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:01,285
Here, "The Lord" refers to the body of the Lord.

237
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:13,871
Who is the one about whom it is said:
"He who withholds grain will be cursed by the people"
Proverbs
11:26?
Should someone be cursed just because they don't distribute their grain to everyone?

238
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,970
Grains symbolize the words of holy preaching.

239
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:23,385
So, if anyone hides these grains—the words of holy preaching—keeping them to themselves and not sharing them with others, they will be cursed among the people.

240
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:27,022
They will be condemned for the sin of silence, as they could have helped many.

241
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:30,940
But since they chose not to, they will justly be punished for the suffering of many.

242
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,751
Who are the ones who sell grain, as it soon follows:
"But blessings will be on the heads of those who sell"?

243
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:42,215
Those who share words of life and holy teachings with their listeners are like sellers of grain.

244
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,159
What price do they get from them?

245
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,175
The price of faith and holy confession.

246
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:48,551
How will the blessing come upon their heads?

247
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:56,039
Because the Lord will say to each of them: "Well done, good and faithful servant," as it says in Matthew 25, etc.

248
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:03,407
What does it mean when it says, "He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind"?
How can someone inherit the wind?

249
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:08,989
The house, in this context, refers to the mind, where each person lives as in a home through their thoughts.

250
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,849
The winds represent unclean spirits.

251
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:18,136
So, anyone who isn't afraid to disturb their house, that is, their mind, with evil and harmful thoughts, will surely end up possessing winds.

252
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:22,271
Through bad thoughts, they have made a way for demons to enter and live in them.

253
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:25,785
They will possess winds, that is, demons, to their own condemnation.

254
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:33,887
A loving woman is a crown to her husband,
but a disgraceful woman is like rot in his bones.

255
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:34,929
Proverbs 12.

256
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:38,072
A good and chaste woman honors her husband in everything.

257
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:43,433
Because she loves him and manages his household well, she is his crown, adding grace to his virtues.

258
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,202
Thus, she is crowned by the Lord.

259
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:50,564
However, an adulterous woman, although she may appear beautiful on the outside, is rot in the bones.

260
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:54,049
Inside, she pollutes her members with the stench of her own lust.

261
00:22:54,263 --> 00:23:01,223
How should we understand this saying:
A poor person who is self-sufficient is better than a glorious person who lacks bread?

262
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:08,892
Indeed, a brother who is uneducated and simple, but does the good things he knows, thereby deserving to have eternal life in heaven, is better than a glorious one.

263
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:18,206
That is, one who is renowned for his knowledge and learning of the Scriptures or adorned with the office of a teacher, who lacks the bread of love because he neither loves the Lord nor his neighbor.

264
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:22,393
Or certainly, he lacks bread because he does not practice what he understands or teaches.

265
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,917
Who is the clever person that hides knowledge?

266
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:29,495
As it is said: A clever person hides knowledge.

267
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:33,227
Clever, in this context, is used positively, meaning wise and prudent.

268
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:44,261
So, a clever man—a wise and prudent man—sometimes deliberately hides knowledge for two reasons:
First, because he cannot speak to weak listeners as if they were spiritual, but rather as if they were worldly.

269
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:51,776
First Corinthians chapter 3 states that he does not dare reveal the great mysteries of the Holy Scriptures to them, lest they be scandalized.

270
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:56,787
Second, because he does not want to give what is sacred to dogs, nor throw pearls before pigs.

271
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:57,746
Matthew chapter 7.

272
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:03,945
What does it mean when it says, "The lazy person wants and does not want" (Proverbs 13:4)?

273
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:06,605
If they want, then how do they not want?

274
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:10,267
Laziness identifies a person who does not want to engage in good works.

275
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:14,014
The lazy person wants to reign with God but does not want to work for God.

276
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:18,774
They seek happiness but do not want to follow Christ's commandments to deserve that happiness.

277
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:22,875
Regarding this, James says:
A double-minded person is unstable in all their ways.

278
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,445
James chapter one, verse eight.

279
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:32,111
About hard work, he says:
"But the soul of those who work will be made rich."
Proverbs 13:4

280
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:35,904
It talks about those who do good deeds and strive to follow the Lord's commandments.

281
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:40,103
Their souls will be enriched with spiritual grace and the sweetness of the heavenly kingdom.

282
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,391
Why will the souls of those who do good be enriched?

283
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:47,663
Because after the labors of this life, he will be rewarded with unfading compensation.

284
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:51,959
There's a saying that goes: "The messenger of the wicked falls into evil."

285
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:59,194
The messenger of the wicked, meaning the angel of the devil—Arius, Sabellius, and the other heretics—are considered the angels of Satan.

286
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:02,970
They certainly fell into evil, which means the torment of eternal hell.

287
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:11,663
Who is the faithful messenger mentioned in the saying: "A faithful messenger brings healing" (Proverbs 14:5)?

288
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:17,999
Every faithful Catholic preacher and teacher is an ambassador, gaining eternal health and salvation for themselves and their listeners.

289
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:30,383
Why does it say: The wicked will hide from the good, and the unrighteous will be at the gates of the righteous, when in this life it's more common for the good to lie before the wicked, and the righteous before the gates of the unjust?

290
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:36,148
In the final judgment, the righteous will be crowned, and the wicked, who afflicted them in this life, will be condemned.

291
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:59,064
Therefore, it is said: "The wicked will lie before the good, and the impious before the gates of the righteous."
However, when it says "before the good" and "before the gates of the righteous," it does not refer to physical proximity, because the wicked and the good will not be close to each other then. Rather, it refers to the vision of the good, as they will always see the torments of the wicked, from which they will offer greater thanks to God, their deliverer, without end.

292
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:08,427
What does it mean when it says, "The Lord's decisions are like weights and scales, and all His works are measured accurately" (Proverbs 16:11)?

293
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:12,270
How are weights and scales related to the Lord's decisions?

294
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:16,667
Because the Lord established everything in weight, measure, and number, Wisdom 11.

295
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,255
Weight and balance are the judgments of the Lord.

296
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:24,062
As He willed, He distributed to each the measure of faith and the grace of the Holy Spirit.

297
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,495
Who are known as the stones of the age?

298
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:32,518
The righteous and strong in faith: all the stones of the world, meaning the holy and chosen men, are works of the Lord.

299
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:38,541
No one is chosen by the Lord for the heavenly building by their own strength or merit, but only by His grace and mercy.

300
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:53,399
What does it mean when it says:
"The crown of the elderly is their children's children, and the glory of children is their fathers," in
Proverbs 17?
If the grandchildren are bad, how can they be a glory in this context?

301
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,969
He calls the patriarchs and prophets, whose sons are the holy apostles.

302
00:26:56,969 --> 00:27:00,891
The successors of the apostles are the holy preachers, the sons of their sons.

303
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:05,918
All these form the crown of the elders—the patriarchs and prophets—honoring them with worthy praise.

304
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:09,689
Through their examples and prophecies, they came to the knowledge of grace.

305
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,576
How are fathers influencing their sons?

306
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:20,064
The preachers of the New Testament hold great honor because they have earned the right to be called the children of the ancient fathers, the patriarchs, and prophets.

307
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:25,079
Why does it say: The one who releases water is the start of conflicts?

308
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,880
Isn't it the one who lets water flow freely that stirs up disputes?

309
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,896
Or isn't it more common for wine rather than water to cause arguments?

310
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,853
This is spoken figuratively:
Water represents a loose and unrestrained tongue.

311
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:42,276
Those who let their tongue run excessively are the source of quarrels.

312
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:46,774
Because failing to restrain their tongue incites arguments and disputes, disrupting harmony.

313
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:55,440
Tell me, how does wisdom shine on the face of the wise, as Solomon says:
"But the eyes of fools are on the ends of the earth?"

314
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,804
A wise person often reflects the depth of their thoughts and the clarity of their understanding in the brightness of their face.

315
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:05,533
But fools, trying to imitate this seriousness, fail to elevate their minds.

316
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:09,212
Instead, they focus on how to achieve the fulfillment of carnal pleasures.

317
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,880
Should we understand it only this way?

318
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,928
We should especially understand this as referring to Christ.

319
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:24,379
In the face of the wise one, namely the Savior, the wisdom of divinity shone, which He, appearing in the flesh, demonstrated and confirmed through the testimony of virtues and teachings.

320
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:31,290
But the eyes of fools—that is, the unbelieving Jews—were more inflamed with earthly desires than with His saving warnings and teachings.

321
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:39,895
What does it mean when it says: A person's gift makes room for them and brings them before great people (Proverbs 18:16)?

322
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:46,009
What is this gift that creates opportunities and leads them to influential individuals?

323
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,501
This gift is one of charity and other virtues, which the faithful receive from the Lord.

324
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:53,064
It broadens a person's path, meaning their actions.

325
00:28:53,064 --> 00:29:01,154
The more each faithful person is filled internally with the grace of the Holy Spirit,
the more they expand their path externally by multiplying their good works.

326
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:04,169
They grow and increase daily in holy desires and good deeds.

327
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,712
How can this gift pave the way for someone to stand before rulers?

328
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:14,736
Because among the great leaders of the Church, he grants him the highest honor in the public sphere and the glory of eternal happiness.

329
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:29,496
Why does it say: "The lazy person hides his hand under his armpit and does not bring it to his mouth" in Proverbs 19 and Proverbs 26?
Who is so lazy that, even while eating or drinking, wouldn't bring their hand to their mouth?

330
00:29:29,496 --> 00:29:33,601
Someone who hides their hand under their armpit certainly does not want to do any work.

331
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:37,707
Therefore, a lazy person represents a preacher who doesn't follow through with actions.

332
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:42,001
Indeed, someone who extends their hand to their mouth strives to practice what they preach.

333
00:29:42,096 --> 00:30:01,440
Who is that lazy person mentioned in the saying:
"Because of the cold, the lazy person did not want to plow, so he will beg in the summer and nothing will be given to him"
from the Book of Proverbs, Chapter 20?
If the lazy person didn't want to plow during the cold season, will he find anyone in the summer who will give him anything?

334
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,884
Often, lazy people find others who will give them alms during both cold and hot times.

335
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:14,617
In this context, the lazy person is someone who, due to their laziness and the hardships of this world (represented by the cold), neglects to work in the service of God.

336
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:20,560
Therefore, on the future day of judgment, they will beg because they will not have good works to deserve happiness.

337
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,092
Whatever a person sows, that they will also reap.

338
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,849
As it says in Galatians chapter 6.

339
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,256
So, why is the day of judgment and the kingdom of God compared to summer?

340
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:35,808
Because then, all the clouds of our sorrow will pass away, and the days of that life will shine with the brightness of the eternal sun.

341
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:42,024
Which king is it said:
"The king who sits on the throne of judgment dispels all evil with his gaze"?

342
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:48,421
About Him who is the King of kings and Lord of lords, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, who sits on the throne of judgment.

343
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:52,175
The Father does not judge anyone but has given all judgment to the Son.

344
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,818
As it is written in the Gospel of John, chapter 5.

345
00:30:54,818 --> 00:31:01,850
He dispels all evil with His gaze, penetrating even secret thoughts by His power, to repay each one according to what they have done.

346
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:09,304
In the Gospel of Luke, chapter 12, He says: Nothing is so covered that it will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that it will not be known.

347
00:31:09,304 --> 00:31:14,327
While the righteous are crowned with the Lord, only the wicked will undergo eternal punishment.

348
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:24,864
What does it mean when it says:
"A weight and a weight, a measure and a measure, both are detestable to God"
(Proverbs 20:23 and 21:22)?

349
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:27,997
Weights and measures, different weights and different measures.

350
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:36,153
Whoever has varying weights and measures in their house does so to weigh and measure differently for themselves and their neighbor, which is detestable to the Lord.

351
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:41,972
Hence, in the law of Moses, the Lord commanded, saying:
You shall have honest scales and honest weights
Leviticus 19.

352
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:45,024
So, how should we understand it spiritually?

353
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:52,946
He keeps different weights and measures in his house, always looking for ways to be praised in his actions, while scrutinizing others to find reasons to blame them.

354
00:31:52,946 --> 00:32:00,143
Such a person is certainly detestable to God, displeasing Him as much as he desires to please himself, for God searches all the secrets of the heart.

355
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:11,928
How should we understand this saying:
"It is bad, it is bad," says every buyer,
and when he has gone away, then he boasts
(Proverbs 20:14)?

356
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:20,951
According to the letter, buyers usually criticize what they want to purchase, saying: "It's bad, it's bad." However, if they get a good deal, they will boast about it when they leave.

357
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:23,903
But how do you understand it on a spiritual level?

358
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:27,105
He truly seeks to earn eternal rewards in heaven for himself.

359
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:33,822
He strives to exchange earthly things for heavenly ones, fleeting things for lasting ones, and temporal things for eternal ones.

360
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:39,543
Therefore, he acknowledges that whatever he suffers in the present is bad because he understands it that way.

361
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:47,362
However, because he patiently endures all adversities for God, when he departs from this world, he will rejoice, as he will have reached blessedness.

362
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:55,655
Also, how should we interpret the phrase that comes shortly after:
"An inheritance gained hastily at the beginning will not be blessed in the end"?

363
00:32:55,655 --> 00:33:08,700
This inheritance can be understood as the acquisition of greed:
Therefore, whoever desires to multiply riches for themselves in this life through the wickedness of greed, must understand that in the future they will lose the happiness of eternal inheritance.

364
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:18,307
Alternatively:
Whoever seeks human praise for good deeds may rush towards inheritance in the beginning:
but in the end, they will lack blessing, because they will receive no reward from God.

365
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:23,514
For it is written about such people:
"Truly I tell you, they have received their reward" (Matthew 6:2).

366
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:32,855
What does it mean when it says:
The downfall
of a person is to consume the holy ones, and to handle things rashly after making vows
(Proverbs twenty-six)?

367
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:35,435
What does it mean to consume the holy ones?

368
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:37,927
To devour the saints is to bind oneself by a vow.

369
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:48,000
The wicked devoured the saints when they vowed to persecute and kill them, just like the forty Jewish men mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles:
They vowed not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.

370
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,572
Similarly, the pagans often vowed the blood of Christians to their gods.

371
00:33:51,672 --> 00:34:06,264
What does it mean when it says: "And after making vows, to consider them"?
Proverbs chapter 20, verse 25 states: "It is a trap to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider one's vows."

372
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:12,216
After making promises, it feels like persecuting and tearing apart the saints, treating them like worthless slaves.

373
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:18,096
How, then, does it become the downfall of man to devour the saints and to handle things after making vows?

374
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:23,573
If it's a sin to harm anyone, it's an even greater sin to persecute, offend, or injure the saints of God.

375
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:28,267
Therefore, those who persecute the saints are setting themselves up for eternal damnation.

376
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,569
How should we understand this: Just as the divisions of water, so is the heart of the king in the hand of God?

377
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:47,499
Why does it say that only the heart of the king is in the hand of God, and not everyone's hearts, when it is written elsewhere: In his hand are all the ends of the earth (Psalm 95)?

378
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:53,892
If all the ends of the earth are in God's power, aren't the hearts of all people in his hand too?

379
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:58,134
We shouldn't see the king in this passage as just a temporary ruler in name only.

380
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:07,269
Instead, we should view him as any holy, faithful, and religious Christian man, whose soldiers are sacred virtues, and who knows how to conquer the battles of vices within himself.

381
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:15,389
Just as God, through various divisions of waters, fills the wide boundaries of the earth and air, He will also incline the heart of the king wherever He wishes.

382
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:17,927
That is, to whatever good He desires to direct it.

383
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:27,925
Just as He grants divisions of graces to angels and humans according to His will, He also fills the hearts of kings, meaning the saints, with various gifts and adorns them with different blessings.

384
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:37,460
What does it mean when it says, "A man who strays from the path of understanding will rest in the assembly of the giants" (Proverbs 21:16)?

385
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:43,972
Who are these giants, in whose assembly will he rest if he strays from the path of understanding?

386
00:35:44,040 --> 00:36:01,752
Giants are referred to as unclean spirits, or demons, about which blessed Job says:
"Behold, the giants groan beneath the waters, and those who dwell with them" Job 26.
This means that demons and all those they have deceived, and who have agreed with them, are tormented under punishment.
Veronus, why are demons called giants?

387
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:05,723
Demons are proud, arrogant, evil, and strong, much like giants once were.

388
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:11,380
In the gathering of these giants—that is, demons—all who have strayed from the path of truth will dwell.

389
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,515
Together with the demons, they will endure the torment of eternal damnation.

390
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:28,320
What is the city of the strong, or who is the wise one referred to in the saying:
"The wise one ascends the city of the strong and pulls down the strength of its confidence"
(Proverbs 21:22)?

391
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,117
He calls the world a city and the strong, demons.

392
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:42,192
This world was once a city of the strong, dedicated to the worship of idols,
serving demons, and placing its trust in the worship of those who are not gods,
but merely the works of human hands.

393
00:36:42,192 --> 00:36:45,864
Who is that wise person who ascended to this city of strength?

394
00:36:45,864 --> 00:36:53,007
That Son of the Virgin, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, who came to this city when born in the flesh, appeared visibly to the world.

395
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:59,949
He destroyed the strength of its confidence by overthrowing and removing the worship of gods, in whom the pagans trusted, from the world.

396
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,116
What does the proverb mean:
Train up a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old he will not depart from it
(Proverbs 22)
?

397
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:12,082
Don't many people leave the bad path they walked in their youth?

398
00:37:12,143 --> 00:37:17,421
Indeed, many people, inspired by divine grace, turn away from the vices of their youth as they grow older.

399
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:19,562
Solomon does not deny that this can happen.

400
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:24,442
However, it is more common for the habits a person learns in youth to remain unchanged in old age.

401
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:31,761
While he doesn't confirm that this always happens, he offers this proverb to remind everyone to strive from an early age in virtues and good works.

402
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:38,632
This is to avoid the possibility that in old age, they cannot learn the pursuit of good works which they neglected in their younger years.

403
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:45,235
What does it mean when it says, "A deep pit is the mouth of a strange woman" (Proverbs 20:19)?

404
00:37:45,235 --> 00:37:50,139
Who is this strange woman, and why is her mouth described as a deep pit?

405
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,014
The mouth of a stranger is like the mouth of a prostitute.

406
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:59,933
So, anyone who eagerly listens to a prostitute's words and enjoys her kisses is like someone knocking on the door of a deep pit, which is hell.

407
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:06,949
Unless he quickly distances himself from her conversation or kiss, and if God abandons him, he will immediately be plunged into the pit of death.

408
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:11,110
And this is what is meant by: "The one whom the Lord is angry with will fall into it."

409
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:15,525
What does he mean when he says: Apply your heart to my teaching?

410
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:25,797
And shortly after, he adds: Look, I have described it to you three times in thoughts and knowledge, to show you firmness and words of truth (Proverbs 22).

411
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:29,800
How has he described his teaching and knowledge three times?

412
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,735
And what does it mean to apply and understand the teaching?

413
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:39,887
He describes his teaching in three ways: urging everyone to strive to fulfill it in thought, word, and deed.

414
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:47,088
Regarding these boundaries, he advises:
Do not cross the ancient boundaries set by your ancestors.

415
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:48,190
Proverbs 23:10.

416
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:53,963
The ancient boundaries refer to the boundaries of truth and faith, established from the beginning by the Catholic teachers.

417
00:38:53,963 --> 00:39:02,212
Therefore, it was commanded that no one should accept the truth of the holy faith and the doctrine of the Gospel in any way other than how it was handed down by the holy Fathers.

418
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:08,283
Likewise, no one should interpret the words of the holy Scriptures in any way other than according to the intention of each writer.

419
00:39:08,376 --> 00:39:10,411
What are the riches he talks about?

420
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:16,576
Don't set your eyes on riches you can't have, because they'll make wings for themselves and fly to heaven.

421
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:20,763
What wings can riches, meaning wealth or abundance, make for themselves?

422
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,922
These riches are the secrets of Divinity and the mysteries of heavenly matters.

423
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:31,625
The idea is: Do not lift the eyes of your mind to scrutinize these secrets and mysteries, which you cannot penetrate or understand.

424
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:36,281
They are revealed only to eagles; in other words, they are clear only to heavenly citizens.

425
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,013
What are the storerooms he refers to?

426
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:47,327
In teaching, the storerooms will be filled with all kinds of wealth, precious, and beautiful things
(Proverbs 24:4).

427
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:53,327
The hearts of the righteous are like storerooms, filled with precious and beautiful treasures through the teachings of wisdom.

428
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:56,280
In other words, they are enriched with virtues and good deeds.

429
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:07,800
What does it mean when it says:
"For a righteous person falls seven times, and rises again"?
If they are righteous, how is it that they are said to fall, meaning to sin?

430
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,447
Here Solomon speaks about minor and everyday sins, which none of the righteous could avoid in this life.

431
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:17,954
As he says elsewhere: "I will bless the Lord at all times." Seven times (Psalm 34).

432
00:40:17,954 --> 00:40:26,372
Sometimes, seven times signifies often and frequently, which can be most appropriately understood here: the righteous will often fall and often rise again.

433
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:31,205
Or certainly, at all times he falls and rises, namely by divine grace, as was said above.

434
00:40:31,368 --> 00:40:39,506
How should we understand:
Prepare your work outside, and diligently tend to your field, so that afterwards you can build your house
?

435
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:41,770
What should a person prepare outside?

436
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:47,425
The work calls for a good action, and therefore he added, yours; that is, useful and necessary for you.

437
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:51,553
So, we prepare our work outside when we arrange our actions well externally.

438
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:53,291
And, to please God, we organize.

439
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,064
How do we carefully cultivate our field?

440
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:00,216
We can diligently cultivate the field if we clear our bodies of the thorns of vice.

441
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:03,264
After working in the field, how will we build our house?

442
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:13,296
If we properly arrange our actions outwardly, we build a good house for ourselves by maintaining a pure life and keeping even our thoughts clean, adorning the dwelling of our mind with pious thoughts.

443
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:25,488
Who is the Lord, and who are the kings mentioned in the phrase:
"The glory of the Lord is to conceal a matter; the glory of kings is to investigate a matter"
Proverbs 25:2?

444
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:29,524
This Lord, the Son of God, known as Lord Jesus, chose to hide His divine nature.

445
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:34,318
When He appeared in the flesh, He wanted to be recognized more as a man than as the Son of God.

446
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,918
This was so the devil would not recognize Him, and thus, through His suffering, He could redeem the human race.

447
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:43,955
If the devil had known He was the Son of God, he would never have crucified Him.

448
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:48,294
Therefore, the glory of the Lord was in concealing His divinity by appearing as a man.

449
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:52,836
By showing the weakness of the flesh, the devil was not prompted to prevent His suffering.

450
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:56,721
Through ignorance of His suffering, He reached the glory of the resurrection.

451
00:41:57,024 --> 00:42:00,720
So, who are the kings whose glory is to search out a matter?

452
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,302
These holy kings were apostles who diligently sought to understand the words of the Lord, signifying their devotion to Him.

453
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:15,703
When He did not openly reveal Himself as the Lord but wanted to be understood in a mystical way, they carefully examined His words with the utmost diligence.

454
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:36,252
An example of this is: "I and the Father are one" John 10.
When He concealed His divinity and revealed the weakness of the flesh, He asked these kings, saying: "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
To this, the most distinguished of the kings, the blessed apostle Peter, who had often heard His words before, immediately replied: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

455
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,128
They say heaven above, earth below, and the hearts of kings are unsearchable.

456
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:43,701
Proverbs twenty-five.

457
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:49,792
The prophets and apostles, who were worthy of knowing divine secrets through the revelation of the Holy Spirit, are called kings.

458
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:54,409
The knowledge and understanding of the prophets and apostles are symbolized by the hearts of kings.

459
00:42:54,456 --> 00:43:02,376
So, how should we interpret this statement:
Heaven is above, Earth is below, and the heart of kings is unfathomable.

460
00:43:02,376 --> 00:43:11,136
Just as we can't fully comprehend the height of the sky or the depth of the earth, our fragile minds can't grasp the profound knowledge and understanding of the prophets and apostles.

461
00:43:11,136 --> 00:43:16,102
How do these statements agree with each other, or how can they fit together?

462
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:27,016
"Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you become like him," and "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he appear wise in his own eyes" (Proverbs 26).

463
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:30,349
These statements certainly seem very contradictory.

464
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,353
They really match well when we consider them carefully.

465
00:43:33,353 --> 00:44:03,816
By saying, "Do not answer a fool according to his folly," it advises us that since a fool does not grasp wisdom, we should not imitate his foolishness, but rather scorn and despise it.
And whenever we speak to him, we should not do so rudely, angrily, or arrogantly, but honestly, patiently, humbly, and wisely, so we do not become like him.
However, by what follows, "Answer a fool according to his folly," it advises us to wisely rebuke and refute the fool and clearly show how great his foolishness is, lest he might think he is wise if he does not recognize his own foolishness.

466
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:06,273
Who is that whisperer everyone talks about?

467
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:11,760
"The words of a whisperer are like simple things, reaching the innermost parts of the stomach."

468
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,068
He calls the whisperer a creator of conflict and a double-tongued person, who pretends to praise with words.

469
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:21,344
His words may seem simple, but they reach deep into the innermost parts of the stomach.

470
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:28,029
The whisperer is always on the lookout for opportunities to sow quarrels, which the stomach resents, disturbing all the innermost parts.

471
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:37,320
Who is that hidden love, about which it is said:
"Open rebuke is better than hidden love" (Proverbs 27:5).

472
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:44,231
Love hidden in this place refers to illicit love, such as adulterous love, which is kept secret out of shame to avoid rebuke from the wise.

473
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:53,182
Therefore, open correction is better than hidden love, because it is much better to openly rebuke someone to correct them than to secretly love with the intent of sinning together.

474
00:44:53,232 --> 00:45:04,128
What does it mean when it says, "A satisfied soul will trample on honeycomb; a hungry soul will take bitter for sweet"?
How can a satisfied soul trample on honeycomb?

475
00:45:04,128 --> 00:45:10,817
According to the letter, a satisfied soul tramples on a honeycomb because anyone who is full of food despises and scorns sweet food.

476
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:14,973
But whoever is hungry, even if they taste bitterness in their food, does not mind.

477
00:45:15,024 --> 00:45:18,672
But spiritually, how should we understand this statement?

478
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:25,390
A soul that is full is the soul of the rich, who in this present life have their consolation because they abound in worldly goods.

479
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:51,956
Hence the Lord says in the Gospel:
"Woe to you who are full, for you shall hunger"
Luke 6.
Therefore, the soul of the rich tramples the honeycomb because, for earthly goods, it despises the sweetness of the heavenly kingdom.
But a hungry soul will take even the bitter as sweet, because those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
Matthew 5
take all bitterness as sweetness, since they patiently endure all the adversities of this present life for the love of the supreme sweetness, that is, eternal blessedness.

480
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:59,825
Who is Solomon addressing when he says, "Diligently know the face of your flock, and consider your herds" (Proverbs 27)?

481
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:03,342
Is he teaching us to think about actual woolly flocks?

482
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:08,030
It speaks to the shepherd of the Church, urging them to carefully take care of those under their care.

483
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,795
They must recognize the minds and actions of each individual.

484
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:13,877
If any faults are found, strive to correct and cleanse them quickly.

485
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:21,864
Why does he immediately add, "For you will not have power forever, but a crown will be given for generations upon generations?"

486
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:26,217
So that the shepherd of the Church continually takes care of the sheep entrusted to him.

487
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:38,040
The meaning is: You will not always have the power to feed the Lord's sheep, but a crown will be given from generation to generation, meaning an eternal crown is prepared, which you will also receive if you have well fed the Lord's sheep.

488
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:48,624
Why did Solomon need to say: "The meadows are open, the green grass has appeared, and the hay has been gathered from the mountains?" Who doesn't already know this?

489
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:51,504
Truly, no one, if we take these words literally.

490
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:54,120
So, how should we understand this?

491
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,680
Truly only spiritually.

492
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,056
What do the meadows signify?

493
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:02,977
The meadows symbolize heavenly mysteries and are called meadows because they nurture faithful souls.

494
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:06,816
These divine mysteries have long been hidden under symbols and legal figures.

495
00:47:06,816 --> 00:47:08,952
When and how are these meadows open?

496
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:14,728
The meadows are indeed open, because through the grace of the Lord Savior, the heavenly mysteries have been revealed.

497
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:20,652
He opened the minds of His disciples
so they could understand the Scriptures,
as stated in the book of Luke, chapter 24.

498
00:47:20,652 --> 00:47:25,293
Then the green grasses also appeared, symbolizing the new teachings of gospel truth and glory.

499
00:47:25,392 --> 00:47:28,392
What does the hay gathered from the mountains signify?

500
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:32,810
The mountains signify the holy Fathers of the Old Testament, and the hay represents their writings.

501
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:40,488
The hay is gathered from the mountains because the writings of these holy Fathers are collected to nourish and refresh the Lord’s sheep, meaning the souls of the faithful.

502
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:48,042
What does it mean when it says, "The poor and the creditor met together; the Lord is the maker of them all" (Proverbs 22)?

503
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:51,634
Who are the poor person and the creditor who met together?

504
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:54,271
The poor person is humble, a listener of the word.

505
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:59,784
However, the creditor is the one who, by preaching the word of God, entrusts money to the humble listener.

506
00:47:59,784 --> 00:48:02,160
What happens when the poor and the creditor meet?

507
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:10,212
When the listener and the preacher come together in the grace of divine mercy, something beautiful happens:
The Lord illuminates both
Proverbs
twenty-nine.

508
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:15,356
Without the grace of divine mercy, the preacher couldn't preach, and the listener couldn't believe.

509
00:48:15,408 --> 00:48:26,664
What does it mean when it says, "When prophecy fails, the people will be scattered"?
What is this prophecy, and why will its absence cause the people to be scattered?

510
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:29,622
Prophecy refers to the teaching and instruction of priests.

511
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:33,533
So, when these teachings and instructions cease, the people will be scattered.

512
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:41,155
Without the admonition and rebuke of priests, people are left to their own will and judgment, and soon, they become corrupted by various sins and vices.

513
00:48:41,256 --> 00:48:51,960
How every word of God is like a fiery shield: for Solomon says, "Every word of God is a fiery shield to those who trust in Him" (Proverbs 30).

514
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,826
Every word of divine authority is called a fiery shield because it ignites the hearts of those who place their hope in God.

515
00:48:57,826 --> 00:49:01,070
With its brightness, it enlightens them with the knowledge of truth.

516
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:07,032
It consumes and cleanses the filth of vices it finds in them, protecting them from the snares of enemies and all adversities.

517
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:10,803
What is the leech, which is said to have two daughters?

518
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:17,352
It is said that the leech has two daughters who always say, "Give," and they are never satisfied.

519
00:49:17,352 --> 00:49:20,152
The leech is like the devil, always thirsting for blood.

520
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:24,504
He desires to lead people into sin and constantly ignites their thirst for wrongdoing.

521
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:27,000
What are those two leech daughters saying?

522
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,616
"Give, give," and they are never satisfied?

523
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:33,509
Luxury and greed clearly mirror the spiritual thirst and burning of the devil.

524
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:37,152
Just as he is never satisfied with sinning, neither are greed and luxury.

525
00:49:37,152 --> 00:49:40,945
The more someone indulges in luxury and fornication, the more they enjoy it.

526
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:45,138
Similarly, the more someone accumulates wealth, the more they desire to increase it.

527
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:55,272
Why did Solomon use the example of the lizard, saying, "The lizard is caught with hands, yet it lives in kings' palaces"
(Proverbs 30:28)?

528
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:59,424
To motivate those who are lazy and slow-witted to work and receive blessings.

529
00:49:59,424 --> 00:50:01,560
What kind of animal is a stellio?

530
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:09,816
The lizard, known for being very lazy and displaying various colors, got the name stellio because it is marked and varied with spots, almost like stars.

531
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:12,288
So, what does the lizard mean?

532
00:50:12,288 --> 00:50:17,736
It refers to those who are slow to learn, but through daily effort and diligence, they ascend to the eternal hall.

533
00:50:17,736 --> 00:50:24,475
This means that, although they reach knowledge of the Holy Scriptures with great labor, they can penetrate the secrets of heavenly mysteries.

534
00:50:24,475 --> 00:50:29,828
About such people, it is written in the Gospel: Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance.

535
00:50:29,828 --> 00:50:33,748
Because whoever has the diligence to read will be given the ability to understand.

536
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:34,512
(Matthew 13:12).

537
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:37,461
What are the three things that Solomon mentions?

538
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:42,288
There are three things that move gracefully, and a fourth that strides confidently.

539
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,386
The lion is the strongest of the beasts, fearing no encounter.

540
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:48,485
The rooster stands tall, and the ram. No king can resist them.

541
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:50,684
These are the ones who walk with confidence.

542
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:53,160
Who does this lion symbolize?

543
00:50:53,160 --> 00:51:07,536
The one about whom it is written:
"The Lion of the tribe of Judah has triumphed," etc. (Revelation five),
namely the Lord Jesus Christ, who is called the strongest of beasts,
because what is weak in God is stronger than humans (First Corinthians one).

544
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:09,480
What is God's weakness?

545
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,415
God's weakness was taking on the flesh of our mortality.

546
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:16,608
But this is stronger than men, because He, born of the Virgin, was perfect God.

547
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:19,776
Why is this lion unafraid of any encounter?

548
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:31,344
Because he committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth First Peter chapter 2 hence he himself says in the Gospel: Behold, the ruler of the world is coming, and he finds nothing in me.

549
00:51:31,344 --> 00:51:34,464
What does it mean when a rooster has girded loins?

550
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:35,472
Holy preachers

551
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:37,608
Why are roosters called preachers?

552
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:45,048
Amid the darkness of this present life, they proclaim the true morning, the true light, by preaching the glory of eternal happiness.

553
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:48,264
Why do people say these roosters have their loins girded?

554
00:51:48,264 --> 00:51:51,912
Because the holy preachers suppress indulgence and lust within their followers.

555
00:51:51,912 --> 00:51:56,136
What does the ram, which faces no king to oppose him, signify?

556
00:51:56,136 --> 00:51:59,145
Through the ram, holy confessors and priests are symbolized.

557
00:51:59,145 --> 00:52:02,657
Like rams leading the flock, they guide the faithful by their example.

558
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:07,372
These rams, if they live spiritually and righteously, have no king who can stand against them.

559
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:14,897
No persecutor is so fierce that they can hinder their purpose, for even when evil is inflicted upon them, they endure everything patiently for Christ.

560
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:18,216
What is that fourth thing that walks so gracefully?

561
00:52:18,216 --> 00:52:21,168
He seemed foolish after being elevated to a high position.

562
00:52:21,168 --> 00:52:22,272
Who is he?

563
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,296
The Antichrist will be revealed in a high, exalted position.

564
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:31,800
Despite being the most wicked man, he will consider himself worthy to be called the Son of God and will falsely claim to be God.

565
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,848
How does a fool appear when elevated to a high position?

566
00:52:34,848 --> 00:52:39,264
Because in his arrogance and pride, he will suddenly be struck down by the divine sword.

567
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:45,850
Why does he say about the previous ones: "There are three things that move gracefully" (Proverbs 30)?

568
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,045
But about the fourth one that moves successfully?

569
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:55,501
Why didn't he say the same about this one: "It moves gracefully"; instead, he says, "successfully"?

570
00:52:55,632 --> 00:53:01,104
Just because something goes well doesn't mean it's always successful, and not everything that's successful is always done well.

571
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:04,848
What are the things that go well, or what things bring happiness?

572
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:09,642
Those who walk holy and justly walk well; those who find success in this life walk happily.

573
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:18,809
The lion, the rooster, and the ram walk well, but not happily, because even Christ fulfilled the will of God the Father in all things, yet endured many adversities and death.

574
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:25,290
Similarly, holy preachers and confessors strive to fulfill the divine will, but they endure many persecutions in this life.

575
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,400
The Antichrist, however, will not walk well, because he will act proudly against the will of God.

576
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,669
But he will walk happily, as he will experience great glory and prosperity, albeit for a short time.

577
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:42,384
Who is King Lemuel, mentioned as:
"The words of King Lemuel, a vision his mother taught him?"

578
00:53:42,384 --> 00:53:44,031
In Hebrew, it's called Lamuhel.

579
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:56,256
In Latin, it means "In whom God."
This undoubtedly refers to Solomon, the king of Israel, in whom God resided.
Without God's presence, he wouldn't have been able to understand or write such profound and numerous divine mysteries.

580
00:53:56,256 --> 00:54:00,072
Who was his mother, the one who raised him and taught him vision?

581
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:04,394
According to the letter, his earthly mother, Bathsheba, the queen, wisely taught him.

582
00:54:04,394 --> 00:54:15,480
However, in this context, the mother is better understood as spiritual and divine grace, which invisibly instructed him in his heart and imparted the understanding of wisdom that he preached and wrote about to people.

583
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:22,728
Who is that strong woman of whom it is said:
"Who can find a strong woman?"
Her worth is far above rubies.

584
00:54:22,728 --> 00:54:25,359
The strong woman is known as the Holy Catholic Church.

585
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,720
She is called a woman because she spiritually gives birth to God's children through water and the Holy Spirit.

586
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:38,566
She is called strong because, out of her faith and love for her Creator and Redeemer, she scorns and despises all the adversities and prosperities of this world.

587
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:42,768
Why did Solomon say, "Who can find a strong woman?"

588
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:51,292
Through the Holy Spirit, it was revealed that no prophet or chosen one could redeem the human race, except for the one mediator between God and humans, Christ Jesus.

589
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,772
And so it was said: Who can find a strong woman?

590
00:54:53,772 --> 00:54:55,528
This is understood to mean Christ.

591
00:54:55,632 --> 00:55:01,800
Why did he soon add:
Is her value far above that from the ends of the earth?

592
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:15,298
To show that Christ, a man pure from the stains of sins, would not come in his time but long after him, and that no one like him was coming; at the end of the ages, the Son, who would be born of a Virgin, would descend from the heavens, and he would be perfect God and man.

593
00:55:15,298 --> 00:55:26,374
This is what is meant by "far off," meaning long after. It signifies the time from the days of Solomon up to the birth of the Virgin.
And concerning the last boundaries, it says that his departure is from the highest heaven.

594
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:29,064
What price did the Lord pay for this woman?

595
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:37,920
He himself, as the Apostle says,
"Who loved us and gave himself up for us as an offering and sacrifice to God for a pleasing aroma."
Ephesians chapter 5.

596
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,689
How has a strong woman become like a merchant's ship?

597
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:47,592
Solomon says: She has become like a merchant's ship, bringing her bread from afar.

598
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:53,152
The merchant is called a trader because he is always striving to acquire and multiply his goods and profits.

599
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:59,691
Therefore, a merchant's ship, loaded with various commodities abundant in his homeland, sails across the sea to foreign places.

600
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:03,965
There, after selling all the goods he brought, he returns with more valuable items.

601
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:11,327
In the same way, the strong woman, that is, the holy Church, always desires to be laden with the riches of virtues and to abound in good works.

602
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:17,146
Navigating through the sea of this world, she aims to acquire greater things, that is, the gifts of divine grace.

603
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:19,176
Who's the captain of this ship?

604
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:23,099
The Lord Jesus Christ paid the price with His blood and redeemed the Church.

605
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:35,488
Therefore, the Holy Church, following the example of its teacher—its Lord and Redeemer—strives to multiply the virtues and good works, so that through them, it may deserve to acquire greater rewards, namely, the prizes of eternal happiness.

606
00:56:35,488 --> 00:56:45,760
This is what is meant by "Bringing her bread from afar"; in all the good things she does temporarily, she desires only the satisfaction of wine and bread, because she expects only the eternal reward.

607
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:54,864
What does it mean to say, "She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies belts to the merchant" (Proverbs 31:24)?

608
00:56:54,864 --> 00:57:00,130
The Church created and sold the shroud because the faith it had woven through belief, it shared through words.

609
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,050
It received the faith of proper conduct from the unbelievers.

610
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:09,944
Therefore, it handed over the belt to the Canaanite, because through the strength of demonstrated justice, it bound the loose works of paganism.

611
00:57:09,944 --> 00:57:12,816
This ensured that what is received may be held by living it.

612
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:21,912
What does it mean when it says, "She made a bedspread for herself, fine linen, and purple are her clothing"?
What exactly is a bedspread?

613
00:57:21,912 --> 00:57:25,560
A striped garment typically features a very strong, varied weave.

614
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,112
So, what exactly is meant by the embroidered garment?

615
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:38,441
The mighty works of the holy Church and the various adornments of virtues, of which the prophet says:
The queen stands at your right hand in gold-woven clothing, surrounded by variety.

616
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:39,405
(Psalm Forty-Four).

617
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:44,400
How are byssus and purple similar to the clothing of that woman, which is the holy Church?

618
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,362
Byssus is a type of very white linen, representing bodily chastity and the purity of holy conduct.

619
00:57:49,362 --> 00:57:52,401
Purple, on the other hand, symbolizes the shedding of blood.

620
00:57:52,401 --> 00:58:01,415
Therefore, the strong woman, which is the holy Church, clothes herself in the byssus of God, meaning she maintains bodily chastity and shines with the brightness of holy conduct.

621
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:06,328
She also clothes herself in purple when the holy martyrs shed their blood for the name of Christ.

622
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:17,856
If fine linen and purple are the clothing of the holy Church, then why does it say in Proverbs 31:
"Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come"?

623
00:58:17,856 --> 00:58:24,560
There is no contradiction because strength is associated with the purple, while beauty is associated with the whiteness of fine linen.

624
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:33,016
Therefore, strength is the garment of the holy Church, as it patiently endures the wickedness and persecution of evil people for the sake of faith in Christ and justice.

625
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:37,819
And beauty is also its garment, as it works justice and adorns itself with the grace of virtues.

626
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:48,934
So, why does it say: She will laugh on the last day, when the Lord says in the Gospel:
Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.

627
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:50,105
Luke Chapter 6?

628
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:53,054
In the Holy Scriptures, laughter usually signifies joy.

629
00:58:53,054 --> 00:59:11,736
As the Lord says in the Gospel,
"Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh," meaning, you will be joyful.
And blessed Job says,
"The mouth of the truthful will be filled with laughter," meaning with joy.
Therefore, the strong woman, that is, the holy Church, will laugh on the last day, meaning she will rejoice in the reward of the heavenly kingdom.

630
00:59:11,736 --> 00:59:16,006
Who are the children of the woman who is called most blessed?

631
00:59:16,006 --> 00:59:18,736
And who is her husband who praises her?

632
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:24,966
For it says: Her children rise up and call her most blessed, and her husband praises her.

633
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:25,806
Proverbs 31.

634
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:29,549
The children of this woman, which is the holy Church, are all the elect.

635
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:31,364
Her husband is the Lord Jesus Christ.

636
00:59:31,364 --> 00:59:37,105
On the last day of judgment, the children of the Church, meaning all the elect, will rise from the dust of the earth.

637
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:41,227
Adorned with the glory of immortality, they will proclaim their most blessed mother.

638
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:47,017
In other words, they will praise the holy Church, which gave birth to them for God, through water and the Holy Spirit.

639
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:53,789
Her husband will also rise, meaning the Lord Jesus Christ, when on the day of judgment he will appear manifestly in the power of divinity.

640
00:59:53,789 --> 01:00:03,161
He will praise her, saying in judgment:
"Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. I was hungry, and you gave me food."
Matthew 25.

641
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:09,840
So why did he use the past tense, saying, "They have risen?" He should have said, "They will rise."

642
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,570
Solomon was absolutely certain about what would happen.

643
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:16,392
So, like a prophet, he spoke about the future as if it had already happened.

644
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:22,885
It is said: Many daughters have gathered riches, but you have surpassed them all.

645
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:23,847
Proverbs 31.

646
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:29,112
The Church refers to many groups as the churches of heretics and the gatherings of misguided Catholics.

647
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:32,544
Who are referred to as the daughters of Christ or the Church?

648
01:00:32,544 --> 01:00:35,808
And why are they called the sons of Christ or the Church?

649
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:41,040
Because of the sacrament of faith and baptism, and the adoption as children that they received during baptism.

650
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,608
Which daughters have gathered these riches?

651
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:58,242
Prayers, fasting, almsgiving, affliction, and chastity of the flesh,
restraining the tongue,
meditation on the Scriptures,
and the wealth of other good works:
these are true riches if done with a spiritual intention, aiming for the reward of the heavenly kingdom.

652
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:01,302
Otherwise, they are of no benefit to those who do them.

653
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:13,043
Hence, the daughters, namely the heretics or the multitude of evil Catholics, have gathered riches in vain;
because either they erred in faith, or certainly did not do such good works with a spiritual intention.

654
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:27,511
About these, the Lord says in the Gospel:
Many will say to me on that day,
"Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
And then I will declare to them,
"I never knew you"
(Matthew 7).

655
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:37,193
But the holy Catholic Church has surpassed all of these,
meaning it has transcended them all,
because whatever it does, it acts only with right faith and spiritual intention.

656
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:50,808
What grace and beauty is he referring to when he says:
"Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised"
(Proverbs thirty-one).

657
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:54,675
The deceitfulness of human praise is something hypocrites seek from everyone.

658
01:01:54,675 --> 01:02:01,104
Beauty is vain; it's the beauty of chastity or good deeds that hypocrites want to display to others in order to receive praise.

659
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:04,632
Why are grace and beauty said to be deceptive and vain?

660
01:02:04,632 --> 01:02:06,232
Pretenders deceive and mislead.

661
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:09,691
They seek rewards in this life but will receive none in the future.

662
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:13,408
Even if they maintain chastity or do good works, all they do is in vain.

663
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,672
Who is the woman fearing the Lord?

664
01:02:15,672 --> 01:02:21,096
The holy Church, which always lives in reverence of the Lord, constantly strives to follow His commandments.

665
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:23,496
How will this woman be praised?

666
01:02:23,496 --> 01:02:31,872
Solomon clearly demonstrates this at the end of the book, where he says: "Give her the reward of her hands, and let her works praise her in the city gates." (Proverbs 31)

667
01:02:31,872 --> 01:02:33,552
Whose words are these?

668
01:02:33,552 --> 01:02:35,904
Men of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

669
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:38,280
When will he say these words?

670
01:02:38,280 --> 01:03:14,184
On the day of judgment, when the angels are commanded to lead the Church to the joys of the heavenly kingdom after the end of this life, the angels will be instructed as follows:
"Give her the fruit of her hands," meaning the reward for her good works. Hands represent deeds; it's as if to say clearly, because she has taken care to do good works, such as love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, modesty, self-control, faith, and patience, give her a reward worthy of these fruits.
And let her works praise her at the gates: in other words, in judgment or at the entrance to the heavenly homeland, let the very works she did praise her; let her be rewarded for the good works she performed.
