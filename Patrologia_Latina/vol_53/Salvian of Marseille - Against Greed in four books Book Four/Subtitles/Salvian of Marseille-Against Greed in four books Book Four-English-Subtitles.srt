Against Greed Book Fourby Salvianus of Marseilles

2
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:13,021
My dear Church, nurturer of blessed hope, I understand that what we've discussed in previous writings may upset some of your children who don't love Christ enough.

3
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:19,827
But we don't give much weight to their opinions because it's not surprising that they dislike words about God, as they might not like God Himself.

4
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:25,327
We shouldn't expect those who don't love salvation and their own souls to love the message that brings them salvation.

5
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:30,268
So, just as in other matters, the opinions and judgments of the saints are enough for us in this case too.

6
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,416
With them feeling the same as we do, we're confident that God feels the same way with us.

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:39,544
Since the Spirit of God dwells in His saints, it's clear that God is present where the Spirit does not depart.

8
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:45,790
Therefore, the opinions of wicked people, like pagans or worldly people, should be considered of little value or completely worthless.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,197
As the Apostle says, "If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ" (Galatians 1:10).

10
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:59,727
What's more troubling and difficult is that some of your children, under the guise of religion, dissent from it and show more worldly behavior in their appearance than in their minds.

11
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:05,880
Their opinion, if I'm not mistaken, suggests that every Christian should consider familial ties at the end of life more than Christ.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:17,020
Because this opinion is completely profane and detestable, they try, I think, to cover their unfaithful preaching with a kind of shadowy addition, saying that all who believe in God should only serve Christ while they are healthy and well.

13
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,520
But when they are departing from this world, they should remember their fleshly relatives more than their divine duty.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,275
As if Christian people should be different when they are healthy and when they are leaving this world.

15
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:32,682
Everyone should present themselves to Christ in health and in death, in their earlier life, and in their later life.

16
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:41,533
If that is so, then one person would have Christ as a young man, and another as an old man; and people would need to change their faith as often as they change with age.

17
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:54,266
If a person is to be different in their worship of God when they are strong or weak, healthy or sick, then as the state of the human body varies, so would God Himself be changeable to them; and as often as a person's health changes, so too would their religion.

18
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:57,925
As if those who are healthy in Christ should not also be Christ's in death.

19
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:03,048
And what about this: "The one who perseveres to the end will be saved" (Matthew 10:22 and Matthew 24:13)?

20
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:09,488
Or that saying in the sacred Proverbs of divine wisdom: "Wisdom is praised at the end" (Proverbs 1:20, according to the Septuagint)?

21
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:19,977
This shows that although wisdom is beneficial at every age, it is especially important that everyone is wise at the end of their life because the wisdom of earlier years will not be praised unless it concludes well.

22
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,587
For wisdom is praised at the end.

23
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:28,369
It is enough, says the harmful preaching, it is enough for a person if they have done good in the past, even if they do nothing at the end.

24
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:32,955
I add much more, or at least not less; if possible, one must do even more as death approaches.

25
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,345
First, because there is never too much good work.

26
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:41,639
Then, because as one approaches God's judgment, they should strive more to please the judge, as if they were already in judgment.

27
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:49,835
Finally, if they have done some good before the end, they should do much more at the end, so that the end of their life does not seem worse than their previous actions.

28
00:02:49,835 --> 00:03:06,374
If, however, they have done little good work, they should certainly do much more at the end; so that what they failed to do earlier in life, they at least make up for at the end; and if they are guilty of neglecting it before, they may at least be somewhat excused before their Lord by compensating for past inhumanity with final devotion.

29
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:08,131
But let us return to the main point.

30
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:10,716
Divine wisdom says that wisdom is praised at the end.

31
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,572
Why didn't he praise her in childhood, in youth, during times of safety, or in times of prosperity?

32
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,491
Clearly, because in all these situations, whatever is praised is uncertain.

33
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:27,649
As long as someone is subject to change, they cannot be praised with security; and that is why, as he says, wisdom is praised at the end.

34
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:34,076
When someone leaves the uncertainties of dangers, they deserve certain praise for having escaped all the varied situations.

35
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:39,510
At that point, the praise is stable and firm, because the merit of the praised one can no longer perish.

36
00:03:39,510 --> 00:04:55,898
"Wisdom," he says, "is praised at the end."
What is the wisdom of a Christian, I ask? What but the fear and love of Christ? For the beginning of wisdom, he says, is the fear of the Lord Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 1:7 and 9:10; Sirach 1:16. And elsewhere: Perfect love, he says, casts out fear First John 4:18. Therefore, as we see, the beginning of wisdom is in the fear of Christ, and its perfection is in love. Thus, if the wisdom of a Christian is the fear and love of the Lord, we are truly wise only if we always love God above all things; and this at all times, but especially at the end, because wisdom is praised at the end.
Therefore, if wisdom is praised especially at the end through this, if God is loved above all things, what madness is it, then, for someone to say that Christ should be preferred to carnal relations by the healthy, but not by the dying? For why should the healthy prefer Him, if the dying should not? Or if someone can religiously put their kin and relatives above Christ in death, why didn't they religiously do so before? Or if there is any moment in life when someone should love others more than themselves and God, why don't they do so in their earlier life?
And so, everything becomes loose, vanishes, and perishes, and no one holds anyone cheaper than themselves, nor anyone inferior to God. For if there is any time when God can justly be placed after relatives or kin, there is none when He can justly be placed before them.

37
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,282
But if it is true, there is never a time when it shouldn't be preferred, never a time when it can justly be postponed.

38
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:02,956
None, indeed.

39
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:09,856
And therefore, not even in the extreme: because even a righteous man, says the prophet, on the day he errs, will perish Ezekiel 3:20.

40
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:22,360
Therefore, if every error of the erring is punished with destruction, and human life is endangered by those errors that commonly pollute human innocence; what do we think will happen when there is a detestable infidelity against God Himself?

41
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,364
For if, says the Apostle, every disobedience receives a just reward Hebrews 2:2, how will we escape if we neglect such great salvation?

42
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:33,151
No one neglects true salvation more than he who puts anything before God.

43
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:41,504
Since our salvation is the gift and mercy of God, what means of attaining salvation does he have who despises God Himself, in whose mercy our salvation consists?

44
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:51,413
Or since God is the judge of the living and the dead, what hope can there be in God's judgment for him who, even in dying, despises the judgment of Him by whom he is immediately to be judged?

45
00:05:51,413 --> 00:06:01,582
And therefore, as the divine Scripture says, in the judgment by which he judges, he will be judged Matthew 7:2: that is, by the judgment with which he judges God, he himself will be judged by God.

46
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:14,656
Nor could he think it unjust if in the future the Lord places him after all others, who in the present places God after all others; nor can he complain if God considers him more damnable than all, since he himself considers God more worthless than all.

47
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:23,684
But someone might say he does not do these things with the intent to despise God or to think Him worthless, but rather to love those whom he has made heirs, or to honor them.

48
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:29,806
Let us agree that this is so: this excuse is almost always available to even the most flagrant and criminal offenders.

49
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:37,225
For even fornicators can say they do not fornicate with the intent of despising God, but because they are overcome by bodily heat and weakness.

50
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:43,107
Murderers might claim they do not shed human blood out of contempt for God or hatred, but only out of greed.

51
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:45,591
However, this excuse is meaningless for the wicked.

52
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,731
The reason behind sin does not matter since all sin is an offense against the Divine.

53
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:55,770
Let's agree, as I mentioned earlier, that no one commits their actions more against others than against God out of contempt.

54
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,374
They are either motivated by the honor of their heir or compelled by love.

55
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:03,417
But what do we do when this very fact shows even more neglect and contempt for God?

56
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:11,355
If you indicate that you honor and love those to whom you leave your possessions, surely you do not indicate that you honor or love God, to whom you leave nothing.

57
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,472
So, whatever you say in your defense actually works against you.

58
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:18,466
The love and honor you show to others reflect your contempt and insult toward God.

59
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:23,677
When you leave things to others because you honor them, you are not honoring God to whom you leave nothing.

60
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:29,960
When you leave many things to others because you love them, you clearly do not leave anything to God because you do not love Him.

61
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,980
Imagine a man and God stand before you as you die and testify.

62
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,804
It’s clear and without doubt: whom you choose, you prefer.

63
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:39,019
If honor is with one, it must be found as contempt with the other.

64
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:45,691
If the man who is preferred rejoices because he is loved by you, it is necessary that God, who is bypassed, grieves that He is not loved.

65
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:53,386
You might think that God does not need man's generosity, and therefore you say, what need is there for man to give anything to Him who gave everything to all?

66
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:57,429
Whether the Lord needs our generosity or not, or how He might need it, we will see.

67
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:04,978
Meanwhile, because you do not dare deny that He provides everything to everyone, He is undoubtedly more worthy of our generosity since He first gave to us.

68
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:10,043
The more we are unequal to His benefits, the more just it is that we try to repay Him with our services.

69
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,122
Because both human nature and common custom bind us all with a general law: we owe more gratitude to those from whom we've received generosity.

70
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,640
The gift we receive indeed compels us to repay it.

71
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,123
Before experiencing someone's generosity, we're free, not burdened by the debt of favors.

72
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:28,850
However, once we become debtors, our conscience compels us to reciprocate.

73
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:38,621
Therefore, we owe even more to God, from whom we receive everything; and we can repay His benefits even less because, even if we want to return what we owe, we're giving back what's already His.

74
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:41,189
Thus, no one should take pride in their generosity.

75
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:45,974
Just as everything we receive from the Lord isn't ours, everything we return isn't ours either.

76
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:54,285
So, indeed, punishment is due to the unfaithful who deny God what was loaned to them by Him; but someone who returns what was received cannot count it as generosity.

77
00:08:54,285 --> 00:09:46,565
But you might say, "God doesn't need repayment." He needs it less than anything else. He doesn't need it according to His power, but according to His command; not according to His majesty, but according to His law; and in Himself, He doesn't need it, but in many, He needs it. He doesn't seek generosity for Himself, but for His followers. Therefore, He doesn't need it according to omnipotence, but according to mercy; not as God for Himself, but out of compassion for us.
For what does God say to the pious and generous stewards? "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink." And lest this argument seem insufficient, He added the opposite, saying to the greedy and unfaithful: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; I was naked, and you did not clothe me"

78
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:51,330
Where, then, are those who say that the Lord Jesus Christ does not need our services?

79
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,846
Look, He recalls being hungry, thirsty, and cold.

80
00:09:53,846 --> 00:10:00,005
Let any of them answer if He does not need when He complains of hunger, if He does not need when He testifies of thirst.

81
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:04,830
I will add even more, that Christ not only needs as others do but needs much more than others.

82
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,858
For among all the poor, there is not one universal poverty.

83
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:19,202
There are some who, even if they lack clothing, do not lack food; many lack shelter but not clothes; many lack a home but not substance; there are also those who, even though they lack many things, do not lack everything.

84
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:23,616
Only Christ alone is the one who lacks nothing that is not lacking in all of humanity.

85
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:29,057
None of His followers are exiled, none are tormented by cold and nakedness, without Him also feeling cold.

86
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:32,804
He alone is hungry with the hungry, He alone is thirsty with the thirsty.

87
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:36,911
And therefore, as far as His compassion is concerned, He needs more than others.

88
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:43,378
For every poor person only needs for themselves and in themselves: only Christ alone begs in the universality of all the poor.

89
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:47,741
And since these things are so, what do you say, oh man, who claims to be a Christian?

90
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:51,950
When you see Christ in need, do you leave your wealth to those who do not need it?

91
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,081
Christ is poor, and you accumulate the riches of the wealthy?

92
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,263
Christ is hungry, and you prepare delicacies for the affluent?

93
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:02,780
Christ also complains of lacking water, and you fill the cellars of drunkards with wine?

94
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,297
Christ is consumed by a lack of all things, and you heap up abundance for the luxurious?

95
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:13,765
Christ promises you eternal rewards for the gifts you give, and you lavish everything on those who give you nothing in return?

96
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:21,413
Christ offers you immortal goods for good deeds and eternal evils for bad ones; and you are neither moved by heavenly goods nor by everlasting evils?

97
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:26,648
And you say you believe in your Lord, whose reward you do not desire, nor do you tremble at His anger?

98
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:30,346
So, as we mentioned in the previous book, you don't believe.

99
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:40,644
Even though you appear to be part of the respected group of converts, even though you dress religiously, even though you claim to have faith, and even though you falsely show holiness with your attire, you don't believe at all.

100
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:41,460
You don't believe.

101
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,772
I've said this about both men and women of this kind: they don't believe.

102
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:52,757
Anyone can adopt the habit of a saint's name and write the title of sacred religion; if they prioritize others over themselves with their wealth, they definitely don't believe.

103
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:57,339
No one who truly believes would prefer to benefit others with their resources rather than themselves.

104
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,150
No one would be content to buy happiness for others at the cost of their own misery.

105
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,142
No one would choose to suffer eternal poverty to provide temporary pleasures for others.

106
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:11,811
Therefore, anyone who prioritizes others over themselves with their inheritance doesn't truly believe that what they give to God will benefit them.

107
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,624
Let any of them explain why they leave their wealth to others.

108
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,845
Isn't it because they believe it will benefit the one they leave it to?

109
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:18,298
Certainly.

110
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:27,326
So, whoever you are, if you leave things to others because you are sure it will benefit them, then if you believed that religious gifts would benefit you, you would definitely keep them for yourself.

111
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:34,812
Because the more you love yourself than those to whom you leave things, the more you would keep for yourself if you believed even slightly that it would benefit you.

112
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:38,214
You don't hate yourself, so you wouldn't want to avoid benefiting yourself.

113
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:41,481
But you don't believe that what you leave for the poor will benefit you.

114
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:46,970
And that's why you prioritize others over yourself, because you don't believe the religious work will benefit you at all.

115
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,603
As you believe, so you will receive.

116
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,688
You think little of the Savior, and the Savior thinks little of you.

117
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,592
You put Christ after others, and Christ puts you after everyone.

118
00:12:54,592 --> 00:13:00,126
To you, the Lord is worthless compared to even the most lost people, and you will be counted among the lowest of the lost.

119
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:04,255
But perhaps you flatter yourself, as I said before, with some view of religious profession.

120
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,348
You are deeper in debt because you make grand promises with your vow of holiness.

121
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:13,694
Therefore, you will face more punishment because you fulfill fewer of those promises.

122
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:23,714
The divine word says, "A servant who does not know his master's will and does not do it will receive few blows; but the one who knows and does not do it will receive many blows" (Luke 12: 47, 48).

123
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:28,162
You, under the guise of profession, make grand promises but deliver nothing in reality.

124
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,076
You are guilty of forgery, lying to God about everything.

125
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:36,137
It's not surprising that the sacred word testifies that judgment must begin with the temple of God.

126
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:40,278
For it says, "Judgment must begin with the house of the Lord" (First Peter 4:17).

127
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,447
Elsewhere it also says, "Begin at my sanctuary" (Ezekiel 9:6).

128
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,492
But let's go back to the previous point.

129
00:13:45,492 --> 00:14:48,475
God says to the greedy and unbelieving, "Go into the eternal fire which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels." Do you think that some good physical deeds will save you from this evil?
You boast that you have loved chastity. But remember, even those whom the Savior condemned to eternal punishment in the Gospel were not marked by impurity. You recall that sobriety pleased you? Yet those of whom Scripture speaks are not punished for drunkenness.
You say you have fasted? Yet those people were not made guilty by feasts. But evidently, you have a great reason for pleasing yourself with your abstinence and fasting, for you fasted and lived sparingly not to feed the poor with your wealth after your death, but to increase the riches of your heir.
You indeed reap great fruits of abstinence. You ate less bread so another could have more gold. Your stomach shrank from frugality so that perhaps the treasure of some immoral person could grow.
So when you come to God's judgment, will you rightly attribute your fasting to Him, saying: "I fasted, Lord, and abstained, and for a long time, I refrained from all delights. And the result proves it. For now, my heirs are affluent because of me, abounding in vast riches."

130
00:14:48,936 --> 00:16:30,624
To take something from the Gospel reading, this is what the Savior said about the most lost rich man, and you can say the same about your heirs:
"They are clothed in purple and fine linen, and they feast splendidly every day.
They lie on the talents I buried, and they press down on the heaps of silver and gold I collected.
I also prepared for them the material of all pleasures; they are filled with the delights I left behind.
So I refrained for a long time so that they could now indulge.
My frugality is their excess.
The floors of their overflowing dining rooms are swimming in wine; they make mud with noble Falernian wine.
Their tables and carved decorations are constantly drenched, always moist.
They luxuriate on the tapestries I made, and they fornicate on the silks I left behind.
And when you have said all these things for yourself, how can you not deserve eternal reward from Christ, for whom you have prepared such abundance of delights?"
Oh, how much better, whoever you are, how much better and healthier it would have been for you to be poor and needy than rich!
For poverty could have presented you to God; wealth has made you guilty.
Therefore, it would have been more right for you to be saved through need than to have burdened both yourself and others with your wealth:
yourself, by leaving it poorly to others; and others, by possessing what you left with the most inhumane use, and then poorly leaving it to others after them.
If you want to be well-advised, if you want to have eternal life and wish to see good days, leave your wealth to the needy saints, to the crippled, to the blind, and to the sick.
Let your resources be the food of the poor, let your wealth be the life of the needy; so that their refreshments are your rewards, and their nourishment refreshes you.
For if they eat from what is yours, you will be satisfied; if they drink from what is yours, you will quench your thirst and heat; their clothing will clothe you, and their warmth will delight you.
Therefore, do not think it vile and contemptible to leave your wealth to the wretched and needy: you will make Christ their heir.
And what shall I say about the name of Christ?

131
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:34,988
Christ will be your heir, and through Him, you will reap the benefits of the inheritance.

132
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:38,420
Whatever you leave to Christ, you will possess everything through Him.

133
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,785
But I think you see these things as trivial and dismiss them as mere dreams and nonsense.

134
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:45,040
You don't believe that Christ spoke the truth.

135
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,737
Your actions show that you don't believe in Him at all.

136
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:52,641
You neither follow His commands nor regard them as important, or you outright condemn them as false.

137
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:58,427
Because of this, all the saints should mourn and weep, for you and others like you believe in no one less than Christ.

138
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:06,567
If an innkeeper promised you something, you wouldn't deny them trust; if a merchant or fishmonger asked for a loan, you wouldn't doubt they would repay what you gave.

139
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:11,373
Sometimes, things are trusted to liars and perjurers, provided they give a guarantee and a surety.

140
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:23,044
Christ gave you both the most faithful guarantee and the best sureties: the guarantee in the Gospel, His apostles as sureties, and if that's not enough, His patriarchs, prophets, martyrs, and indeed the entire series of divine scriptures.

141
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,692
And yet, you don't believe Him or give Him your trust?

142
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:31,331
I ask, who among men could you find so reckless and miserable that you would deny them trust with so many sureties?

143
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:39,962
Therefore, you give your possessions to the rich and deny them to the needy; you give to the extravagant and deny the saints; you give to perhaps any scoundrel and deny Christ.

144
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:43,492
As you judged, so you will be judged; as you chose, so will you receive.

145
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:48,739
You will not have a part with Christ whom you despised; you will be with those whom you preferred over Him.

146
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:55,751
But perhaps someone from the number of unbelievers will say that the cause is not worthy enough to move God or to bring men into eternal peril.

147
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,939
I know that everyone always thinks their own guilt is forgivable.

148
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:05,166
Thieves consider theft a minor fault, drunkenness seems harmless to the drunk, and fornication is not a crime to the shameless.

149
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,629
There is no crime so great that it is not excused by the judgment of the one committing it.

150
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:15,704
But if anyone wants to know how seriously great crimes are judged by God, let them learn from the saints.

151
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:21,934
Aware of the future judgment based on God's words and their Lord's teachings, the saints punish even minor sins in themselves.

152
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:26,483
Therefore, they are always engaged in God's work, always in repentance, always on the cross.

153
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:34,642
Blessed are those who, while having compassion for everyone, never totally forgive themselves, sparing themselves in nothing, but fully dedicating themselves to God.

154
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:40,230
Hence, they are worthy of reward in the future judgment because they continually consider themselves guilty here.

155
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,422
What can I say about their mercy and generosity, which is almost the initiator of all virtues among them?

156
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:49,625
Many of them have these as the beginnings and almost the cradles of their conversion.

157
00:18:49,625 --> 00:19:00,356
Before entering the threshold of holy profession, they leave nothing of their own possessions behind, following our Lord's saying: "Sell all your possessions, and give to the poor, and come follow me" (Matthew 19:21).

158
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:04,213
Those intending to follow God's call first sell everything before they follow.

159
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:10,790
Considering wealth a burden and obstacle, they do not think they are ready to follow God until they cast off all earthly impediments.

160
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,229
It's like people moving homes: they first transfer their belongings to the new place before moving themselves.

161
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:27,553
They transfer everything they own, so they can move to a house full and overflowing with immortal goods, confident that nothing will be lacking for them, having left nothing behind in the soon-to-collapse house that would perish.

162
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:30,173
This, therefore, is the hope and trust of the saints.

163
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:36,701
They provide for themselves by abundantly transferring their possessions, so they may enjoy the eternal abundance of immortal goods.

164
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:52,169
But you, whoever you are, male or female, who have forgotten your soul and salvation, how do you expect to find what you have not set aside and prepared for the future, when you rob yourself of your resources here, giving them to those who do not need them or who already have abundance?

165
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,198
How do you believe that God will return to you what you do not trust Him with?

166
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,298
Finally, how do you want to receive what you do not believe?

167
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:06,374
No one expects to be repaid what they have not lent; nor is anyone so foolish as to think they will get back what they have not invested.

168
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:12,315
And so, you cannot hope that God will return to you what you did not trust Him with, as you did not believe in Him.

169
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:22,336
Therefore, the divine saying must be fulfilled in you: "Because you have left your wealth to others or strangers, your tomb will be your home forever" (Psalm forty-eight, eleven through twelve).

170
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:32,306
And also what the Savior says to someone like you: "Because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will begin to vomit you out of my mouth" (Revelation three, sixteen through seventeen).

171
00:20:32,306 --> 00:21:02,577
You say: "I am rich, and I have wealth, and I need nothing"; and you do not know that you are wretched, poor, blind, and naked.
Therefore, no one who values human over God in life, in death, in action, in gift, or in will, should flatter themselves about the prerogative of life and profession. This security is penal and pernicious: presumptive hopes are burdens of guilt; assumed absolution brings condemnation. Whoever excuses themselves, accuses God, according to this: "For if anyone thinks they are something when they are nothing, they deceive themselves" (Galatians six, three).

172
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:05,521
Therefore, no one should easily consider their own cause.

173
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:09,344
No one escapes more difficulty than the one who presumes they will escape.

174
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:11,358
These things may seem harsh and severe.

175
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:11,772
Why not?

176
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:16,834
For all discipline, as the divine word says, is not of joy, but of grief (Hebrews twelve, eleven).

177
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,590
These things are harsh and severe.

178
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,727
But what are we to do?

179
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:26,649
It is not permitted to change the nature of things; and truth cannot be expressed otherwise than as the force of truth itself demands.

180
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:30,058
Some think these things are harsh, I know, and I am quite certain.

181
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:31,195
But what are we to do?

182
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,726
Without hardship, one does not reach the kingdom.

183
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:37,654
Narrow and tight is the way that leads to life, says the Lord.

184
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:45,197
And the Apostle says, I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us (Romans 8:18).

185
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:48,921
He means that all human effort is unworthy in comparison to the future glory.

186
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:57,576
Therefore, nothing should seem hard or severe to Christians, because whatever they offer to Christ for eternal happiness is trivial compared to the great reward they will receive.

187
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:01,880
Nothing great on earth is given by man to God, whereas what is in heaven is the greatest.

188
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,637
It is hard for the greedy to give away their possessions.

189
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:05,410
What a surprise?

190
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,876
Everything is hard when commanded to the unwilling.

191
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:11,165
As many types of commands as there are, so many are the adversaries.

192
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:16,000
If the Lord commands generosity, the greedy get angry; if He requires frugality, the wasteful curse.

193
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,799
The wicked consider holy words as their enemies, thieves dread anything written about justice, the proud dread anything commanded about humility, the drunkards oppose where sobriety is commanded, and the impure detest where chastity is ordered.

194
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:32,538
Therefore, either nothing should be said, or whatever is said will displease some of these people.

195
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:38,679
Any wicked person would rather curse the law than correct their mind; they prefer to hate the commands rather than their vices.

196
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,355
In this situation, what should those do who are assigned by Christ to speak?

197
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,981
They displease God if they are silent; they displease people if they speak.

198
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:50,285
But, as the apostles responded to the Jews: We must obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29).

199
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:57,248
I give advice to all who find the law of God heavy and burdensome, if they are willing to accept it, on how the commands of God can please them.

200
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:01,310
For all who hate the holy command, the cause of their hatred lies within themselves.

201
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,792
The aversion is not in the commands of the law, but in their own morals.

202
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,823
The law is good, but their morals are bad.

203
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:10,063
Therefore, let people change their intentions and their affections.

204
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:14,560
If they make their morals acceptable, nothing that the good law commands will displease them.

205
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:23,867
When someone starts to embrace goodness, they naturally grow to love God's law because it resides within them, just as it does in the actions of righteous individuals.

206
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:26,796
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

207
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:27,044
Amen.
