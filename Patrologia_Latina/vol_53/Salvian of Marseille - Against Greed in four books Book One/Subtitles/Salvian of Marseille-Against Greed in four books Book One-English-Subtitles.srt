00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,416
On the Prophet Hosea
by Haymo Bishop of Halberstadt

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,264
Chapter One

3
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:15,913
The word of the Lord came to Hosea, son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.

4
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:23,242
We should understand that the word of the Lord here refers to what John says at the beginning of his Gospel: In the beginning was the Word.

5
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:27,618
This Word is not made in its nature but begotten by God the Father before all ages.

6
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:35,000
Therefore, when it is said here that the word of the Lord came to Hosea, it means that the word of God the Father was to be spoken to Hosea.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,534
By speaking the word of the Lord to Hosea, He made him a god and savior of His people.

8
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:57,145
Hosea means "savior," as he was the one who, through teaching and the example of holiness, worked to save the people to whom he was sent.
However, the same Hosea and the other prophets who were called gods to whom this word came, the Lord reveals in the Gospel: If you (says the Lord) call them gods to whom the word of God came, etc.

9
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:02,365
Therefore, just as God makes people gods by speaking to them, so the Savior makes them saviors too.

10
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:07,322
Saints are called gods and saviors by grace, while there is only one Savior and God by nature.

11
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:18,869
It is important to note that it does not say: The word of the Lord came in Hosea, so it is not understood as if the word came through him to another, but to Hosea, to show that the word was specifically directed to him.

12
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,983
As Blessed Jerome explains, it is one thing for the Lord to speak in Hosea, and another to Hosea.

13
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:35,267
In Hosea, Hosea himself does not speak, but the word is directed through Hosea to others, as the Prophet says in the Psalm: I will hear what the Lord God will speak within me, for He will speak peace to His people.

14
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:39,222
This shows that through the one who spoke this, God was speaking to others.

15
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:46,551
But speaking to Hosea, He shows that the prophecy that follows specifically pertains to him when he is told: Go, take yourself a wife, etc.

16
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:56,184
He prophesied during the same time as Isaiah, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, and Jonah, as evidenced by the names of the kings mentioned in the titles of these prophets.

17
00:01:56,184 --> 00:02:00,522
From this, we understand that he prophesied both before and after the captivity.

18
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:05,402
He predicted the captivity of the ten tribes, which he later lamented after witnessing it.

19
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:06,324
The son of Beeri.

20
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:14,783
The Hebrews say that whenever the names of the fathers or grandfathers of prophets are mentioned, the fathers or grandfathers themselves were also prophets.

21
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:19,012
Thus, it is clear that Beeri was a prophet, whose son is referred to as Hosea.

22
00:02:19,012 --> 00:03:30,586
Hosea means, as we have said, "savior," and therefore signifies the Lord Christ, who is truly the Savior of the world. Hence, he is also called Jesus, to whom the following pertains. Thus, Hosea is called the son of Beeri, which means "my well." God the Father also says through the Prophet: "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water."
The difference between a well and cisterns is that a well has perpetual water flowing from a living source, while a cistern has external, temporary water. The Prophet speaks of this source: "My soul thirsts for God, the living source." In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. Uzziah is also called Azariah elsewhere, who ruled in Jerusalem over the two tribes called Judah for 52 years. He was succeeded by his son Jotham, who ruled for 16 years. After him, his son Ahaz ruled for 16 years, in the eleventh year of whose reign the ten tribes were taken into captivity to the mountains of the Medes and Persians by Shalmaneser, king of the Chaldeans. After Ahaz, his son Hezekiah ruled for 29 years.
From this, it is clear, as we said above, that Hosea prophesied both before and after the captivity and the impending captivity itself. In the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash.

23
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,880
We shouldn't confuse this Jeroboam with the first king of the ten tribes, who was the son of Nabat.

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,745
The Jeroboam mentioned here was the son of Joash, the great-grandson of Jehu.

25
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:52,141
Jehu, after killing the wicked queen Jezebel and the two wicked kings, Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Samaria, along with his seventy brothers, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, was promised that his descendants would reign until the fourth generation.

26
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:56,909
However, since they returned to the sins of the kings of Israel, they quickly lost the kingdom.

27
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,117
The beginning of the Lord speaking in Hosea.

28
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:12,517
These words can be understood in two ways: either because the captivity of the ten tribes was first announced to him before Isaiah and the others who were his contemporaries, or because the first message given to him by the Lord was about the union with a prostitute.

29
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:22,906
Hence, it is immediately added: And the Lord said to Hosea: Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution, and have children of prostitution, because the land will surely prostitute itself away from the Lord.

30
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:33,646
Although some argue that these things were done literally, excusing the prophet from the sin of prostitution since he obeyed God's commands, they do not consider that God never commands anything unjust or shameful.

31
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:45,089
However, it is better understood in a mystical sense, just as what was said to Ezekiel: You will lie on your left side for 390 days, and you will not turn to the other side, and again you will lie on your right side for 40 days.

32
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:54,072
Also, what was commanded to Jeremiah, who was imprisoned, to go to the Euphrates and hide the loincloth he possessed among the neighboring nations hostile to the people of Israel.

33
00:04:54,072 --> 00:05:06,218
Although he could not even go out to sell his field among his own people, he was captured and bound by his own citizens as a traitor and informer and placed in prison, especially since Jerusalem was already besieged and surrounded by enemies.

34
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:14,595
As for the literal meaning, the wife of fornications is an adulteress who exposes herself to the lust of many and brings a stranger into her husband's life.

35
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,724
The children of fornications are those born from such a union.

36
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:21,864
He went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore a son.

37
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:28,881
Since all these things, as mentioned earlier, are to be understood spiritually, Hosea, which means savior, signifies the Lord Jesus Christ.

38
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:36,756
Through the mystery of the Incarnation, he took a wife of fornications—the Jewish people—who, abandoning the one true God, worshipped various demonic idols.

39
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:40,694
From this, he begot children of fornications, showing that all were under sin.

40
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:48,518
Hence, it is fitting that the wife of fornications is called Gomer, which means perfect or complete in evil work, undoubtedly referring to the same people.

41
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:55,232
Therefore, it is also fitting that she is called the daughter of Diblaim, which means pleasure, who always pursued her own pleasures.

42
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,908
She bore a son, representing a strong people in evil.

43
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:12,043
However, if we wish to scrutinize this more deeply and interpret it in a positive sense, the son born from the Israelite people is understood to be the Lord Jesus Christ, who, having joined the same people to himself through divinity, wished to be born from them through humanity.

44
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:50,207
This interpretation aligns with the meaning of the name by which the son is ordered to be called, for Jezreel means "seed of God."
Hence, it follows: And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu. Jezreel means "seed of God."
In the literal sense, it was a metropolitan city in the kingdom of the ten tribes where Naboth was killed, for whose blood Jehu was raised up to avenge, destroying the house of Ahab and Jezebel. But because Jehu himself was the avenger of the blood of the righteous, and his sons did evil in the sight of the Lord, the blood of Ahab was poured out on his house, meaning it came back upon them when his sons were led into captivity and killed.

45
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,021
Not long after, both the kingdom and the kings ceased to exist.

46
00:06:54,021 --> 00:07:00,534
Jeroboam, the great-grandson of Jehu, under whom Hosea began to prophesy, died, and his son Zechariah succeeded him as king.

47
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:05,840
In the sixth month of Zechariah's reign, he was killed by Shallum, who came from a different lineage.

48
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:14,717
Immediately, the Assyrian kings captured Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, who were across the Jordan, then Naphtali, and eventually all the remaining tribes.

49
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:20,338
From Zechariah to Hosea, under whom all ten tribes were taken into captivity, only forty-nine years passed.

50
00:07:20,338 --> 00:08:39,289
Hence, it is said: "Yet a little while, and the punishment of the house of Jehu will be completed."
Spiritually, Jehu, through whom the blood in Jezreel is said to be avenged, signifies the Jews, by whom the blood of Christ was shed. We have described this as being designated by the name Jezreel, whose blood was avenged upon them when they were killed by the Romans and taken into exile into all lands. To this day, they remain exiles from their own land.
"And I will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease, and on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
We mentioned earlier that Jezreel was the capital city of the ten tribes, near which lies a vast valley, stretching more than ten thousand paces. In this valley, Israel of the ten tribes was slaughtered by the Assyrians, whose strength is symbolized by the bow.
According to mystical interpretation, all who think ill of Christ, such as heretics who depart from the house of David, that is, from the Church, are represented by the name Israel. In the valley of Jezreel, meaning in the humility of the seed of God, they are crushed, because the Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son.
And she conceived again and bore a daughter, and He said: Call her name "No Mercy," for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel but will utterly forget them. However, I will have mercy on the house of Judah and will save them by the Lord their God, not by bow, sword, war, horses, or horsemen.

51
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:45,744
When the Jews were stripped of their strength, they were referred to in the feminine, symbolizing fragility and weakness.

52
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:51,937
Thus, they were aptly called a daughter because they had a feminine spirit; they abandoned God and worshipped vain idols.

53
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:57,771
They were shown no mercy and were forgotten, continuing to serve the Persian kings with no end to their captivity.

54
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:03,247
However, the house of Judah and the two tribes allied with it received mercy because of their trust in God.

55
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:08,006
An angel was sent to strike down Sennacherib's army, one hundred eighty-five thousand strong.

56
00:09:08,006 --> 00:10:07,424
"I will save them," He said, "in the Lord their God," meaning under the protection of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Just as the Lord rained fire from the heavens, the Son from God the Father,
He will not save them through bow, sword, battle, or horses—no human strength or cavalry—but through the Lord their God, who will send His angel to defeat their enemies.
If this applies to those present at the coming of the Lord, they too are called a daughter, not a son, because they pursued their desires and called down God's seed's blood upon themselves, saying, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Thus, without mercy, they were handed over to the Romans, condemned to perpetual servitude, and forgotten.
But the house of Judah—meaning confession, such as the apostles and others who believed or taught in Christ's name—were saved not by sword or bow, but by the Lord their God, Christ, who chose them by His grace.
By the name daughter, we can also understand heretics, who, following vain doctrines and weakening the divine Scripture's meanings, are consigned to the devil, facing eternal damnation without mercy, perpetually forgotten by God.

57
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,623
The house of Judah, which is the Catholic Church, faithfully confesses the faith of the Holy Trinity in an inseparable unity.

58
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:18,283
They will be saved in the Lord their God, not by the multitude of armies or by their own strength.

59
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,233
And she who was without mercy was weaned.

60
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:25,511
One who is weaned leaves the mother and does not feed on the parent's milk but is sustained by different foods.

61
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:32,500
In ancient times, it was customary to hold a feast for neighbors and friends on the day of an infant's weaning, marking their separation from milk.

62
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,774
Therefore, the mother of Samuel said she would not go to the temple of the Lord until the child was weaned, meaning until he reached the age when he could be moved from milk.

63
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,437
In Holy Scripture, milk represents simple understanding.

64
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:48,001
The Jews were nourished by milk as long as they stayed within their law, reading the Scriptures.

65
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:53,755
But after being taken into captivity, they began to be fed by the food of the Gentiles and ate what was offered to idols.

66
00:10:53,755 --> 00:11:01,886
From this, they fell into such misery that they lost even the small amount of knowledge they had, to the point where they could not even understand the surface of the law.

67
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:08,352
She conceived and gave birth to a son and said: Call his name, Not My People; because you are not my people, and I will not be your God.

68
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:13,488
The number of the children of Israel shall be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted.

69
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:19,764
And in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; it shall be said to them, You are the children of the living God.

70
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:29,132
These words can also refer to those who were captured by the kings of Assyria and taken into captivity, and to those who after the coming of the Lord were dispersed by the Romans among all nations.

71
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:35,646
They rejected God through idol worship, and after the denial and betrayal of the Son of God, they cannot have the Father without the Son.

72
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:41,525
Therefore, God rejected them so they would no longer be His people, but instead become servants of the devil.

73
00:11:41,525 --> 00:13:23,592
And it would be said to them:
"Because you are not My people, I will not be your God. I will judge you unworthy of My possession and presence, and I will reject you forever."
This can also be understood to refer to heretics, who, by rejecting God and holding twisted beliefs about Him, are completely repelled by Him. They cannot say with the chosen ones:
"The Lord is my inheritance."
The number of the children of Israel will be as mentioned above. Although the Jews were oppressed back then and are now under severe captivity, they are still innumerable. As Isaiah says:
"If the number of the children of Israel is like the sand of the sea, the remnant will be saved."
This can be understood as being fulfilled both at the coming of the Lord and at the end of the world. After the people of Israel have been scattered throughout the world and their multitude has surpassed all counting, Israel, which is now in captivity, will have freedom.
And it will be in the place where it was said to them:
"You are not My people," as mentioned above.
We should understand this place to be Jerusalem, where it is now said to them:
"You are not My people," but it will be said to them, "Children of the living God," in the time of the Lord's Incarnation.
This was fulfilled in the apostles and other believers. For, as John says, all who believed in Christ were given the power to become children of God.
If we want to refer this to the Jews of today, the place where it is said to them:
"You are not My people," is understood to be the whole world. Because now, Jews in all nations are confirmed to be not servants of God, but of the devil.
However, when they believe through the preaching of Elijah and Enoch, they will be called children of God by all nations.
The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint one leader for themselves. Judah signifies those two joined tribes, namely the tribe of Benjamin and the priestly tribe, the Levites. Because of the tribe of Judah, from which the kings who ruled over these tribes originated, these two tribes were also called by the name of Judah.

74
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:31,502
Most of the ten tribes retain the original name of Israel because, before the division of the ten tribes and the two, everyone was generally called by this name.

75
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:36,434
So, to those who were divided, it is promised that they will be gathered together as one by the Lord.

76
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:46,493
Indeed, at the time of the Lord's incarnation and resurrection, those who had returned from captivity, both from the ten tribes and the two tribes, were living in Judea, and many of them believed in Christ.

77
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:55,674
It is said here: The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, that is, believers from the two and the ten tribes will come together into one flock of Christ.

78
00:13:55,674 --> 00:14:03,292
And they will appoint for themselves one leader, namely the Lord Jesus Christ, about whom Ezekiel says: And one prince will be among them, my servant David.

79
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:12,033
Or we can understand Israel as representing the Gentiles and Judah as representing the Jewish believers; or Israel as representing heretics and Judah as representing Catholic men.

80
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:17,698
All of them, having converted to the unity of Christian faith, will appoint for themselves one leader, Jesus Christ.

81
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:28,050
And they will ascend from the earth, meaning from earthly senses and the humility of the declining letter; and they will be elevated to spiritual and vital understanding, because the great day of Jezreel is near.

82
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,717
Here, the day represents the entire time from the Lord’s birth to the end of the world, about which we sing in the Psalms: This is the day the Lord has made.

83
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:43,384
This is a great day, meaning it is a great period during which the remission of sins is granted to believers, and the door to the heavenly kingdom is opened.

84
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,168
Chapter Two

85
00:14:45,168 --> 00:16:24,552
Tell your brothers, "You are my people," and your sisters, "You have received mercy."
If we want to apply this to the Jews, it encourages the people of Judea not to lose hope about the salvation of the ten tribes. Instead, they should daily encourage them to repent through words, prayer, and letters, because they are called brothers and sisters.
Brothers, as it says, "My people"; sisters, as it is called, "She who has received mercy."
If we want to apply this to the Gentiles, it tells them to say to those who remain in unbelief: "You will be my people if you believe in me and are willing to transition from old ways to a new life."
Or, you who believe in me and adorn your faith with good works, tell the remaining believers: "They will be my people if they believe in me, remain in the faith they were called to, and strive to adorn it with good works."
Also, tell your sister—that is, the same people who believe in Christ—that she has received mercy by believing in me.
Judge your mother, judge her, because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband. This is said to the apostles and other believers to judge, that is, to rebuke their mother, the synagogue, which, having become a wife from a harlot, does not abandon her old ways.
But again, rebuke your mother because she has committed adultery with her lovers again. Consider the patience and mercy of this man, who again urges his children to rebuke their mother because she has remained in unbelief while they believed.
This was fulfilled then when Peter told the weeping Jews: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you," etc. He says, show her that she is not my wife, and I am not her husband.
Because she has rejected me, I will also reject her so that I am not her husband. Indeed, Christ is the husband of the Church, about whom the heretics say to the same Church: "There is no husband in her house."
Let her remove her fornications from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts.

86
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:30,275
Sexual immorality or adultery in sacred scripture is understood in two ways: as impurity of the flesh and as idolatry.

87
00:16:30,275 --> 00:18:11,063
As it is written: "You will destroy all who are unfaithful to you."
A woman commits sexual immorality or adultery when she is open to the lust of many or brings another man into her husband's life. Because God is the husband of the soul, the people of Israel had subjected themselves to many acts of unfaithfulness. They abandoned the almighty God and worshipped many demonic idols.
Therefore, it is now said: "Let her remove her sexual immorality from her face," meaning, let her remove the worship of gods from her love and presence. For she had been open to the lust of many by worshipping the gods of all nations. Let her also remove her adulteries from between her breasts, meaning from her heart, where evil deeds are first conceived.
The heart is indeed between the breasts, from which, as the Lord reveals, evil thoughts come. They first thought evil in their heart, and thus eventually brought these thoughts into wicked actions. Therefore, the divine word urges her to remove all these things from herself, lest she lose the good things given to her by God because of her committed crimes.
He says, "Lest I strip her naked and set her as on the day of her birth." The garment with which that people were covered is understood as God's help, the teaching of the law and the prophets, and the protection of angels. All these things God Almighty threatens to take away from her unless she repents of her committed crimes, so that she becomes naked and full of shame, as she once was.
And He says, "I will set her as on the day of her birth," meaning she will lack all these things, as she once did while living in Egypt. "And I will make her like a wilderness, and set her like an impassable land." A house becomes a wilderness when it loses its proper master. This people were reduced to a wilderness when God Almighty departed from them because of their sins.
Hence the Prophet says: "I have left my house; I have abandoned my inheritance," etc. And in the Gospel, He Himself threatens them that He will leave them, saying: "Behold, your house is left to you desolate."

88
00:18:11,112 --> 00:19:57,144
There was also a kind of wasteland, because having lost the right path of faith, it lost God the Father and His Son who says, "I am the way."
And I will kill her with thirst, that is, with the lack of all good things, or with the thirst the prophet Joel speaks of: "I will send a famine and thirst upon them, not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but a famine for hearing the word of God."
Or the water that was taken away from them, we can understand as the grace of the Holy Spirit, about which He Himself speaks in the Gospel, inviting all to Him to receive this water from Him: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink, and rivers of living water will flow from his belly."
All these things apply to the Jews who deny Christ, and to heretics abandoning the true faith, following various erroneous doctrines in their hearts, words, and actions. Unless they repent, stripped of all virtues they received in the Church, they will be reduced to their state on the day of their birth, and having become a wasteland and impassable land, will suffer the thirst or dryness of Holy Scripture, so that even what they falsely seemed to have will be reduced to nothing.
And I will not have mercy on her children, because they are children of fornications, because their mother has committed fornication. When the Jews came out of Egypt, the Lord, angry with their fathers, killed them in the desert.
However, He had mercy on their children, preserved them for life, and gave them the land He had promised to their fathers. But now He threatens not to act this way, saying: "I will not have mercy on her children, but they will go into captivity along with their fathers, and there they will die, and they will never see the land of their birth again, because they are children of fornications," that is, they were born in the worship of idols. As their fathers held such faith, so they taught their children. Hence it is added: "Because their mother has committed fornication." Just as a viper gives birth to a viper, so this people have produced children like themselves. She was confounded, that is, astonished and turned to wonder, the one who conceived them and made them children of the devil.

89
00:19:57,144 --> 00:21:42,935
Because she said: "I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and water, my wool and linen, my oil and drink." The Jews said this while worshiping the gods of various nations.
"I will go," she said, "after my lovers," meaning, I will follow the gods with faith and love, or I will imitate the nations whose gods I worship, who give me bread and water, etc. For all the good things that the same people had received from God from heaven, they thought they had from demons, and they attributed everything to them.
This can also be spiritually referred to those who denied the Son of God, choosing Barabbas, the author of rebellion, for themselves, and crucifying the Son of God, the giver of all good things. Therefore, they were confused, and not only cursed themselves but also their descendants with a terrible curse, saying: "His blood is on us and on our children."
These words can also be understood literally in their explanation about heretics, who are confused; but also their children, born from bad doctrine, are ashamed with them. The reason for their confusion is revealed when it is added, because she said: "I will go after my lovers," meaning, I will follow the various doctrines of heretics, whose bread is eternal sorrow. And the water is perverse and foolish doctrine, by which they even kill those baptized. This water is contrary to that which is written: "Deep water from the mouth of a man."
By wool and linen, their simulated sanctity and purity are expressed. The Lord warns to beware of them, saying: "Because they will come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves." By oil, their flattery is understood. Of which the Prophet says: "Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head." Their drink also is understood as the holy Scripture, which they make muddy by misunderstanding.
Therefore, behold, I will block your way with thorns, and I will block it with a wall, and she will not find her paths. By thorns, the pricks of sorrow and the hardness of adversity are expressed. By the wall, an obstacle is meant, so that what she was seeking, she could not find.

90
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:48,028
I will block your path with thorns, meaning I will entangle your actions with the hardest of labors.

91
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:51,491
I will also block it with a wall so you can't reach what you desire.

92
00:21:51,491 --> 00:23:27,594
Furthermore, the phrase "and she will not find her paths" has the same meaning. But as is common in prophetic speech, it abruptly shifts from one person to another.
She will follow her lovers, the Assyrians or Chaldeans, seeking help from them when faced with severe tribulation. However, she will not find them willing to help her; instead, she will be captured by them and taken captive. She will seek them but will not find them favorable. Then she will say: I will go back to my former husband. That is, I will return to Almighty God, who once betrothed me through the given law, because it was well with me then, as long as I obeyed His commands.
More so now, when I am afflicted by various tribulations because of idol worship. Indeed, the people of Israel, often raised by prosperity, would turn away from God by worshiping idols. But again, when afflicted by calamities, they returned to God, who raised up a Savior for them and delivered them.
These words apply both generally and specifically to us, who, raised by prosperity, sometimes go against God's commands. Yet again, when worn down by afflictions, we return to ourselves, recognize our sins, and seek His mercy, remembering how well it was under His protection. This often happens to those who, placed in the world, seek the riches and honors of the world. But, unable to attain them, are so troubled by various tribulations that they reluctantly leave the world: and, setting aside temporal cares, which they cannot achieve as they wish, they flee to a monastery.
And those who were once distressed because they did not have everything they wanted, rejoice, content with food and clothing, according to the Apostle, and serve God in poverty, who previously served the world and its desires. And she did not know that I gave her grain, wine, and oil, and silver, and I multiplied gold for her, which they used for Baal.

93
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:37,322
It was mentioned earlier that the people of Israel attributed all the temporary blessings they received from God to idols, not realizing that God Almighty had made them abundant in all these things.

94
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:47,095
Therefore, abandoning God, they made for themselves the idol Baal of the Sidonians from the gold and silver they had received for adornment, as the prophet Ezekiel describes in more detail in his book.

95
00:23:47,095 --> 00:24:10,093
If we want to understand these words spiritually, we should take the grain to mean the law by which they should have been nourished; the wine, spiritual joy, which they should have had not in temporary goods, but in God; the oil, the illumination of understanding; the silver, the brilliance of eloquence, of which it is written: "The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace" (Psalms 12:6); and the gold, the commandment to love God and neighbor.

96
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:15,344
In all these things, where they should have glorified God, they preferred to worship demons rather than God.

97
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:21,810
Therefore, says the Lord, I will turn from my mercy to cruelty, and I will take back my grain in its time, and my wine in its season.

98
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:28,666
The time for these fruits is when they are brought to maturity and gathered, and stored in cellars to provide sustenance throughout the year.

99
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:36,202
If at that time, when maturity is imminent, they are taken away from the people who should have gathered them, they are afflicted with the greatest sorrow.

100
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:40,918
He threatens to take this away from the Jews so that they suffer from famine throughout the year.

101
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:47,823
For often God, because of the sins of the people, sends a storm at harvest and vintage time, and takes away the fruits prepared for gathering.

102
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:50,837
And I will rescue my wool and my linen that covered her shame.

103
00:24:50,837 --> 00:25:12,473
In some manuscripts, it is falsely written as "I will balance," whereas it should be read as "I will rescue." For they had the wool and linen under their servitude, while they themselves were servants of the devil. Therefore, God says: I will rescue my linen and my wool, so they are not possessed by wicked masters. Furthermore, the shame that these covered refers to their idols, whose altars were adorned with various decorations of garments.

104
00:25:12,959 --> 00:25:16,369
Spiritual garments symbolize God's help and the protection of angels.

105
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:24,176
When people fail to recognize the giver, God removes these blessings, leaving them in their wickedness and handing them over to the devil for eternal torment.

106
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:27,091
And then I will reveal his folly in the eyes of his lovers.

107
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:29,957
He calls idols folly, which they had placed in the temple.

108
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:35,194
And he calls the lovers the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, and the Edomites, with whom they had long had peace.

109
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:40,432
In whose eyes the folly of the Jews was revealed when Jerusalem was captured and the temple was destroyed.

110
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:47,942
Seeing the images of Cherubim and the idol Baal, the aforementioned enemies began to say:
Behold, the Israelites, like all other nations, worship idols.

111
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:51,598
Which is why they rightfully fall under our power due to their wickedness.

112
00:25:51,598 --> 00:25:53,575
And no man will rescue her from my hand.

113
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:57,083
This means that by no force or strength will she be freed from my hand.

114
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:01,579
But I will deliver her to the enemies by just judgment, and I will lead her into captivity.

115
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:03,408
And I will put an end to all her joy.

116
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:08,694
This was fulfilled in those who were taken captive by the Assyrians and Chaldeans, where they lost all joy.

117
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:13,191
And later in those who heard from the Lord: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you.

118
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,068
And: Your house will be left desolate.

119
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:20,257
Her solemnity, her new moon, her Sabbath, and all her festive times, it is implied, I will put to an end.

120
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,431
When he says solemnity, he puts one for all.

121
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:30,979
Or certainly in this specific name, he wants to be understood as the festival of Passover, which they were accustomed to celebrating honorably in memory of their liberation.

122
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:37,353
He calls the new moon the renewal of the moon, as they used to celebrate such a festival with joy at the beginning of each month.

123
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:40,119
On the Sabbaths, they also rested in leisure and feasts.

124
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:46,642
They also had other festivals, such as Pentecost, the festival of Tabernacles, the dedication of the temple, and other similar ones.

125
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:56,178
All of which were taken away from them when they were placed in captivity, where they were not permitted to celebrate these festivals with joy according to their custom, nor to rest in leisure.

126
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:01,143
All these things taken away by them are now celebrated spiritually in the Church.

127
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:06,912
And I will destroy her vineyard and her fig tree, namely by hail, drought, and frost, so that she has no fruitful tree.

128
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:14,087
Spiritually, the vineyard signifies the joy of the heart, while the fig tree represents sweetness and pleasantness, which have been taken from them.

129
00:27:14,087 --> 00:28:38,494
Hence they are in sorrow and bitterness, as it was said: "These are my wages which my lovers gave me."
He explains why he took away the goods mentioned earlier, saying, "These are my wages," etc.
For he thought these were given to him by demons as a reward because he worshiped idols.
And I will make her a forest so she no longer has fruit-bearing trees but is entirely reduced to desolation.
This was partly done by the Assyrians and Chaldeans, but more fully completed by the Romans, who destroyed their land, reduced it to desolation, and also made them exiles with the final captivity from their land.
Hence it follows, "and the beast of the field will eat her," referring to the Roman army.
About this beast, the Psalmist says: "The wild boar from the forest ravaged it."
Or certainly, we can understand this beast as the devil, who devours them when he draws them to his cult, for which they later suffered destruction.
What was said about the Jews can also be applied to heretics, who, when they leave the Church, are abandoned by God, and their foolishness is revealed to those who were previously their admirers.
And being handed over to the beast, that is, the devil, they are torn by his bites and punished with eternal death.
And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals, during which she burned incense, adorned herself with her earrings and jewelry, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says the Lord.
He still maintains the persona of the harlot woman, who adorns herself with gold and gems to please her lovers, and whatever beauty she lacks by nature, she acquires by art.
"I will visit upon her the days of the Baals," meaning, for the days she worshipped Baal, I will bring upon her the affliction of tribulation.

130
00:28:38,639 --> 00:30:24,167
Here, "visitation" is placed in a negative context, referring to the distress, tribulation, slaughter, and captivity that came upon the Jews because of idol worship.
However, "visitation" is also used in a positive context, as in:
"The rising sun will visit us from heaven" and "Visit us with your salvation."
He says, "I will visit upon her," undoubtedly referring to Judea during the days of Baal, when they burned incense not to God but to demons.
Baal in the singular and Baalim in the plural, both masculine, refer to the same idols. Whenever the syllable "im" is found at the end of a Hebrew word, it indicates a masculine plural. However, when it is "oth," as in "sabaoth," it indicates a feminine plural.
Thus, cherubim and seraphim are masculine plurals, while sabaoth, which means "armies" or "hosts" or "virtues," is a feminine plural. Therefore, Baalim is a masculine plural, although some incorrectly read it as feminine.
The Jewish people adorned themselves with earrings and necklaces to please their lovers, that is, demons; they should have adorned their ears to conceive the spiritual precepts of God in their hearts, and their necks to proclaim them to others. They acted this way because, by following demons, they forgot God, who should have been their husband.
Heretics burned incense to Baalim when they followed the perverse doctrines they created as idols for themselves. They also adorned their ears, with which they hear words, and their necks, with which they speak, to please those they ensnare with the charm of their speech.
For divine words are also understood as necklaces, about which it is said to the Church:
"Your neck is like necklaces,"
which they would not do if they had not forgotten God.
Therefore, behold, I will allure her and lead her into the wilderness. For the Lord is merciful and gracious. Although He had previously threatened them with evil, He promises salvation to the same people so they do not despair, saying:
"Therefore, because I am merciful, I will allure her, that is, I will coax her to return to me."

131
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:28,918
Where it says: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near; and: Come to me, all who labor, etc.

132
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:36,094
And I will lead her into the wilderness—that is, I will free her again from captivity, just as I previously led her out of Egyptian servitude.

133
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:46,251
Just as I then led them through the desert wilderness, protecting and freeing them from every enemy, I will do the same when I bring them back from the land of their captivity to their own native soil.

134
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:52,417
And I will speak to her heart—that is, I will offer her gentle and comforting words, so I may relieve her sorrow with joy.

135
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,843
For this is what it means to speak to the heart.

136
00:30:54,843 --> 00:31:01,766
Where it says: Shechem spoke to the heart of Dinah; and Joseph, after being recognized by his brothers, is said to speak to their hearts.

137
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:17,381
This was fulfilled when the Son of God, who speaks here through the prophet, appearing in the flesh, says to the apostles, indeed to all his disciples from that people who believe in him: I no longer call you servants, but my friends; he even calls them children, saying: Little children, I am still with you.

138
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:20,110
And I will give her vine-dressers from the same place.

139
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,315
Isaiah shows what this vineyard is, who says: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.

140
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,488
And David: You brought a vine out of Egypt.

141
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:36,181
Vine-dressers were given to it, first when coming out of Egypt, Moses and Aaron, and others who at that time, by word and example, cultivated that vineyard with good works.

142
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:43,255
Then, when returning from Babylonian captivity, Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, and Ezra, and other prophets, who were good cultivators of it.

143
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:50,886
Also, at his coming, he gave her the best vine-dressers, namely the apostles, who were all from the same place—that is, from the same Israelite people.

144
00:31:50,886 --> 00:31:53,059
And the valley of Achor for a door of hope.

145
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:55,333
Here it is necessary to recall the old story.

146
00:31:55,333 --> 00:32:01,549
We read in the book of Joshua, that when the children of Israel had taken Jericho, Joshua cursed it and all that was in it.

147
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:08,119
And Achan son of Carmi, seeing certain things among the spoils of the city that were pleasing to him, took from the cursed things.

148
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:17,097
Since the children of Israel could not withstand their enemies and had consulted the Lord about it, He responded that they were defeated because of what Achan had done.

149
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,626
Joshua had him stoned by all the children of Israel.

150
00:32:19,626 --> 00:33:49,246
The place of his execution was called the Valley of Achor, which means the Valley of Trouble, because Joshua said, "You have troubled us, the Lord will trouble you this day."
After his execution, the children of Israel had hope for future victory, and they went on to capture the town of Ai, killing its inhabitants. Their sorrow turned into joy, and they found hope where there had been despair.
Since it is certain that this happened, as stated, let's see what the prophetic words mean, which speak of the future, saying: "And the Valley of Achor will be a door of hope." Therefore, it must be understood that just as after Achan was killed, the Jews had hope of defeating their enemies, and they were not disappointed; likewise, after Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans, the temple was burned, and the Jews were killed and scattered throughout the world, the apostles and other believers had hope of victory. They brought the entire world to the faith of Christ, and what had been foreshadowed—the temple and all the ceremonial observances—was turned into spiritual understanding, as is now done in the Church by the faithful.
This was their hope of victory, of which it is spoken here: "And the Valley of Achor will be a door of hope," implying "I will give." And she will sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the days when she came up from the land of Egypt.
Even now, history maintains a similarity. In Exodus, it is read that after Pharaoh and his army were drowned in the Red Sea, the children of Israel sang a song to the Lord, saying: "Let us sing to the Lord," etc. That time of their youth is called a day because then the same people grew in faith and religion of God, for before they worshiped idols, that is, the calves of the Egyptians. Hence, later they made a calf, saying: "These are your gods, Israel," etc.

151
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:56,665
It's fittingly said: In the days of His ascension from the land of Egypt, because Egypt is in the plain, but the land of promise is mountainous.

152
00:33:56,665 --> 00:34:04,342
Therefore, those traveling from Egypt to Judea are said to ascend, just as the Lord frequently reminded them: I made you ascend from the land of Egypt.

153
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,918
Now, let's explore the mystery.

154
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,935
Egypt, interpreted as darkness or sorrow, signifies the infidelity of the Jews.

155
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:13,748
The Red Sea represents baptism, consecrated by faith in the Lord's passion.

156
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:19,696
Pharaoh and his army drowning in the Red Sea symbolize the devil and original sins, which are washed away in baptism.

157
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:26,967
The desert, through which they traveled after crossing the Red Sea, being fed with manna and water from the rock, symbolizes this present life.

158
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:34,186
Here, the faithful receive manna and water from the rock, which represents the body and blood of Christ, or the teachings of divine eloquence.

159
00:34:34,186 --> 00:34:39,576
The land of promise signifies the heavenly homeland, reached after baptism and the struggles of this life.

160
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:56,862
It is promised to the congregation of believers that, just as the believers then sang a song to the Lord after Pharaoh's destruction, they, after emerging from the darkness of infidelity, will, after the devil's defeat and the suppression of vices, transition with joy and gladness to the heavenly homeland, where the land of the living is.

161
00:34:56,862 --> 00:35:04,946
Rightly, those traveling from Egypt are said to ascend, because we ascend when we strive to move from earthly things to heavenly things, from vices to virtues.

162
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:10,640
And it shall be on that day, says the Lord, every man will call Me his husband, and will no longer call Me Baal.

163
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,267
I will remove the name of Baal from his mouth, and they will no longer remember their name.

164
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:26,910
Regarding the name of Baal, literally, this must be said: Belus was the father of Ninus, the first king of the Assyrians, who named the city he built after himself, calling it Ninus, which the Hebrews and our people call Nineveh.

165
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,096
He made his father Belus into a god, creating an idol named Bel, which he desired everyone to worship.

166
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:43,131
By what name it is called by the Babylonians, as it is written in Daniel: the Sidonians and Phoenicians call it Baal, but the Hebrews call it Beelzebub due to the filth and impurities of sacrificial blood.

167
00:35:43,131 --> 00:37:15,285
This means "the man of flies" or "having flies." Because it was worshiped in many places, it is pronounced in the plural as Baalim.
Now, let's see what these words of the Lord mean when He speaks of the faithful people, saying: They will no longer call me Baalim. As we mentioned, Baalim is the same as Baal, translating to "Baal possessing," but Baalim means "possessing me." Hence, Hebrew and Syrian women call their husbands by this name, saying: My Baal, meaning "possessing me" in marriage.
There's also another name in the same language with the same meaning, Is, which sounds like "man." Therefore, a woman is called Issa, as if "virago," because she was taken from her man. Those who do not want to call their husbands Baal or Baalim, call them by another name, Is meus, meaning "my man," signifying possession in marriage.
Thus, when the Lord says: They will not call me Baalim, but will call me "my man," it is to be understood as wanting to show me as their man. They will never call me Baalim, which could be said well, but will call me Is, meaning "my man." For God so dislikes the names of idols that He does not even want His chosen ones to remember them. Therefore, He says of the faithful people: They will no longer call me Baalim, because of the ambiguity of the word. Lest, while saying one thing, they remember another, and by calling a man, think of an idol.
Hence, it is also added: And I will take away the names of the Baalim from their mouths, and they will no longer remember their names. And I will make a covenant with them in that day, with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the creeping things of the earth. Here, the union of the Jews and the Gentiles in the unity of the faith of Christ is clearly described, as they were separated from each other before His coming.

168
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:18,517
So, the Jews used to exclude the Gentiles from their community.

169
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:25,639
But later, as they came together into one fold of Christ, they now boast of having peace and brotherly love in one faith in the Almighty God.

170
00:37:25,639 --> 00:38:59,226
Hence, Isaiah says to this same people: "Your former stranger will join you, so that he will no longer be a stranger, but will be recognized as a brother." For the Gentiles are represented by the names of animals, birds, and serpents, because they worshiped these as gods. But having been purified from these, they are no longer called by these names, but are called rational humans.
So, when Peter saw the sheet sent down to him from heaven, in which animals, birds, and serpents were shown, and he heard that he had to kill and eat them, he responded, "No, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth." It was said to him, "What God has purified, do not call common." And I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle from the earth. That means, I will give the utmost peace and tranquility on earth, that is, in the Church. Although many wars increase on earth, yet compared to that time, great is the peace among people, especially among the elect, among whom no seed of discord finds a place.
About this time Isaiah says: "Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore." And I will make them sleep securely, that is, I will make them rest in my faith and peace. Or certainly, this sleep is understood as the rest of the elect, who now quietly sleep in the hope of the future resurrection. And I will betroth you to me forever, and I will betroth you to me in righteousness and justice, and in mercy and compassion, and I will betroth you to me in faith; and you will know that I am the Lord. It should be noted that He promises to betroth the same people to Himself three times. First, He betrothed them in Abraham, to whom He gave the sign of circumcision to be a sign between God and his offspring forever, or also when He led them out of Egypt. Second, on Mount Sinai, giving them the law.

171
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:17,528
Therefore, it is said in the second place: I will betroth you to me in justice, which means observing the law and following my commandments, so you can live justly and understand the difference between good and evil; and in mercy and compassion, so that if you are handed over to captivity because of your sins and then repent, you will receive mercy once again.

172
00:39:17,528 --> 00:39:24,014
Thirdly, with the coming of the Son of God, it is also said: And I will betroth you to me in faith, that is, in the holy Trinity.

173
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:31,003
About this betrothal, the Apostle, speaking of Christ, says: I have betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.

174
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:36,383
And again, speaking of Christ, he says: He has betrothed the Church to himself, not having spot or wrinkle.

175
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:40,556
But the Synagogue, betrothed three times by the Lord, made all the betrothals void.

176
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:44,226
It did not keep the first betrothal in Egypt and worshipped foreign gods.

177
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:53,528
Then, it was taken again by the law and the sacred Scriptures of the prophets of the Old Testament, as if confirmed by second betrothals, so that it would not withdraw from the embrace.

178
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:58,857
Thirdly, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, wished to unite it to himself through the grace of the holy Gospel.

179
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:09,466
However, with few believing, the majority neglected the presented betrothals and remained in unbelief, as the blessed Stephen reproaches them, saying: You always resist the Holy Spirit, just as your fathers did.

180
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:16,706
However, those who received his faith were joined to him by the bond of love, believing that he was Christ God, whom they had previously denied.

181
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:23,544
Among these were those who, at the preaching of the blessed Peter, believed—five thousand in one day, and three thousand on another day.

182
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:34,957
And it will be on that day: I will respond, says the Lord, and I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth, and the earth will respond to the grain, the wine, and the oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.

183
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:39,834
According to the letter, this means the Lord promises material goods to those who believe in him.

184
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:45,767
Spiritually, the heavens represent the apostles, of whom the Psalmist says: The heavens declare the glory of God, etc.

185
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,728
These heavens were heard in their time.

186
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:52,927
Asking for the Lord's incarnation, praying for the Canaanite woman and Peter's mother-in-law.

187
00:40:52,927 --> 00:41:01,823
Now, the heavens listen to the earth, meaning the people living in the Church, and this earth listens to the wheat, which represents the simple teachings of the Old and New Testaments.

188
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:09,219
This fulfills the Lord's saying: Blessed is that servant whom his Lord has set over his household to give them their measure of wheat at the proper time.

189
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:14,343
The wine will be heard, providing spiritual understanding and bringing joy to the hearts of the listeners.

190
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:18,114
The speech of the teachers should be tailored to the quality of the listeners.

191
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:22,610
It also hears the oil, as bishops and priests give the faithful the grace of the Holy Spirit.

192
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,042
This is heaven and earth, namely the apostles and the universal Church.

193
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:33,487
And these will listen to Jezreel, the seed of the Word of God, leading to action so that this seed produces a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold fruit.

194
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:36,243
Furthermore, it follows: And I will sow her in the lands.

195
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:44,751
This pertains especially to the apostles who were sown from Jerusalem, so that through their preaching and miracles, the earth (the hearts of their listeners) would bear fruit.

196
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:48,135
Of these, it is written: These are the seed whom the Lord has blessed.

197
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:55,532
For the apostles themselves are both the seed, because they are dispersed throughout the whole world, hearing from the Lord and going into all the world.

198
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:59,641
They are also the sowers, as it is said: Their sound has gone out into all the earth.

199
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:09,406
And I will have mercy on her who was without mercy, that is, the Synagogue now believing in me, which before, while it wandered through many demonic wonders and worshiped them as God, was without mercy.

200
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:13,902
And I will say to not my people: You are my people; and they will say to me: You are my Lord.

201
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:22,556
This is what he says to his faithful from that same people: You are the ones who have remained with me in my trials, and I appoint to you, as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom.

202
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:29,082
And he himself says: You are my God, just as Peter said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; and Thomas: My Lord and my God.

203
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:36,023
The words can specifically refer to the ten tribes and generally to all Israelites, particularly those who believed.

204
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:37,367
Chapter Three

205
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:47,424
And the Lord said to me: Go again, and love a woman who is loved by a friend and is an adulteress, just as the Lord loves the children of Israel, but they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.

206
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:53,478
Through these two women, the former prostitute named Gomer, and the adulteress, we should understand Israel and Judah.

207
00:42:53,478 --> 00:43:00,354
This refers to the ten tribes in Samaria under King Jeroboam from Ephraim, and Judah, who reigned in Jerusalem from the line of David.

208
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:03,740
Ezekiel describes these two women as sisters, Oholah and Oholibah.

209
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:12,155
If we want to distinguish them more carefully, the former, called a prostitute, represents the ten tribes, while the latter, called an adulteress, represents Judah.

210
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:18,004
In general, through both of them, the entire Israelite people can be understood, as will be shown in what follows.

211
00:43:18,004 --> 00:43:21,801
According to the letter, it is to be understood as it says, Go again, etc.

212
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:26,059
The sense is this: You love her, but she does not love you in return as she should.

213
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:31,447
She neglects your love and is an adulteress, as she is joined to another man and loves him more than you.

214
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:35,603
This is revealed when it is added: Just as the Lord loves the children of Israel.

215
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:42,016
Just as you love that woman, yet she loves another more than you, so the Lord loves the children of Israel with supreme love.

216
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:46,788
But they, spurning Him, turn to other gods, venerate and worship them, and love raisin cakes.

217
00:43:46,788 --> 00:43:51,868
He calls raisin cakes what we call grape skins, the husks of grapes thrown out after being pressed.

218
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:59,564
Spiritually, these raisin cakes represent demons, who, when they were in their dignity, were like grapes, filled with the richness of the Holy Spirit.

219
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:05,156
But after they, in their pride, wanted to become like God, they were emptied of the grace of the Holy Spirit.

220
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:11,878
They became barren and, as if useless, were cast out of heaven, withering in old dryness and possessing none of their former grace.

221
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:19,056
Thus, the Jews, due to their lack of faith, were abandoned by God and now love demons that are void of any sweetness of goodness.

222
00:44:19,056 --> 00:45:59,998
Or we can understand by "dregs" the traditions of the scribes and Pharisees, completely empty of truth and full of superstition, which the Jews loved, abandoning the traditions of God for the traditions of men.
And I bought her for fifteen silver pieces, and a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley, and said to her, The seventy translators, as the blessed Jerome says, for what our interpretation has as "I bought," they put "I hired," which indeed pertains to a woman, because she is hired for this purpose, to remain faithful to her husband, and not to join another while he lives. But when he says, "I bought her for myself as a wife," he shows he wants to signify the vineyard, which, as the prophet testifies, is the house of Israel, of which it is written: "You brought a vineyard out of Egypt."
Therefore, this woman is bought and hired for fifteen silver pieces, and a homer of barley, and a half homer of barley, which is forty-five measures, for a homer has thirty measures, and a half homer has fifteen. And having been hired for this price, she heard from the Lord: "You will wait for me many days; you will not commit adultery, and you will not be for another man." This means: you will not disgracefully prostitute yourself to lovers, nor will you be joined to me, your lawful husband, from whom you were hired, and don't think you have been wronged; for I said: "You will wait for me," I will repay you equally, for I too will wait for you.
Mystically, the fifteen silver pieces pertain to the fifteenth day of the first month, that is Nisan, when the Jews left Egypt, after the firstborn of the Egyptians were struck down. For on that very day, that is the fifteenth moon, the Lord brought them out of Egypt and hired them into His service, liberating them by the slaughter of the lamb from the plague brought upon the Egyptians. And He began to teach them, establishing for the firstborn of His sons, who did not feel the common plague, five silver shekels to be offered in the offerings of the house of God.

223
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:05,365
On the forty-fifth day, which is symbolized by forty-five measures of barley, they arrived at Mount Sinai.

224
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:11,635
The next day, Moses was instructed to sanctify the people for three days, abstain from women, and prepare to receive the law.

225
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,397
After three days, on the fiftieth day, Moses received the Ten Commandments.

226
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:22,470
Thus, those who arrived at Mount Sinai on the forty-fifth day are rightly said to have been carried there with forty-five measures of barley.

227
00:46:22,470 --> 00:47:39,471
The phrase, "You will wait for me many days," refers to the present time, when the Jewish people, who were once symbolically hired for fifteen pieces of silver and forty-five measures of barley, await the coming of the Lord after His incarnation. This waiting continues until, as the Apostle says, the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, and thus all Israel will be saved.
The instruction, "You will not commit adultery, and you will not be with a man," indicates that, in the meantime, although the Jewish people do not serve idols, they also do not have God. They are deprived of both lovers and a husband; because they lack a husband, they do not partake in the food of men, which is wheat, but consume the barley of irrational beasts. This signifies that they do not grasp the life-giving spiritual sense but follow the killing letter.
The phrase, "but I will wait for you," applies to those who hope to be received into the embrace of Christ at the end of the world, when Jews and Gentiles will unite into one flock with one shepherd, who declares, "I am the good shepherd."
For many days, the children of Israel will be without a king, a prince, a sacrifice, an altar, an ephod, and household idols. The Jews often relate these things to the seventy years of their captivity, but as the blessed Jerome suggests, it is better to understand these words as referring to the present time or the final conversion of the Jews. These words align with the earlier statement: "You will wait for me many days, you will not commit adultery."

228
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:44,010
For now, the Jews remain in a contracted state because they lost their upright status.

229
00:47:44,010 --> 00:49:22,128
They are without Christ the King, who says, "But I have been appointed king by Him," and without a leader, that is, the Savior Himself, or even a high priest, about whom it is written: "You shall not curse the ruler of your people."
They are also without sacrifice and an altar, because they lost the place where they had the temple and altar, as commanded in the law: "In the place which the Lord chooses, you shall offer sacrifices to Him, and not in every place," thus they do not offer legal sacrifices.
And without the ephod. The ephod is properly called a shoulder garment, but here it means any garment. Sometimes it also refers to linen garments, as we read about Samuel, who was dressed in a linen ephod.
Theraphim are properly called figures and idols. In this context, they do not refer to cherubim and seraphim or other temple ornaments, but to all priestly ornaments.
After the Jews lost all these things, they were spiritually given to us in the Church. For we have the true king and priest, Christ, who is a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek; we have the true sacrifice of the body and blood of the Lord; we also have the ephod, the garment of innocence and simplicity, having been made priests and kings ourselves, as Peter says: "You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation."
We also have the theraphim, the sign and memory of God imprinted in our hearts, as we sing to Him: "The light of your face is signed upon us, Lord."
And after these things, the children of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king.
After these things, that is, after all these have been fulfilled, when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, the children of Israel will return through the preaching of Elijah and Enoch, and seek the Lord their God and David their king, that is, the Father and His Son Jesus Christ, confessing Him as the one true God with their hearts, mouths, and deeds.

230
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,701
And they will be in awe of the Lord and His goodness in the last days.

231
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:30,805
The Holy Spirit, who is not separate from the Father and the Son, but together with them is one God.

232
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:39,737
He says to His disciples:
If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!

233
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,184
Chapter Four

234
00:49:41,184 --> 00:49:47,059
Listen to the word of the Lord, children of Israel, because the Lord has a judgment against the inhabitants of the land.

235
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:56,951
These words specifically pertain to those who were present at the coming of the Son of God, although they can also apply to those who lived at that time in the twelve tribes, to whom the prophet speaks.

236
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:07,429
This shows that God's anger and severe punishments were not in vain, as He threatened and inflicted them so that the people would be without a king and without the other things in which they had previously gloried.

237
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:18,789
But because they were without truth, mercy, and the knowledge of God, and because curses, lies, murders, and many other sins had flooded in, by God's just judgment, all these things were taken away from the inhabitants of that land.

238
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:23,049
They were handed over to captivity, adding sin to sin, and piling new sins on old ones.

239
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:30,590
However, as we have said, this mainly refers to those who saw and heard God in the flesh but did not want to believe in Him, as well as their descendants.

240
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:47,190
For it is said to them: Listen to the word of the Lord, children of Israel, because the Lord has a judgment against the inhabitants of the land, that is, against the Jews who always desire earthly things, in contrast to those who are called heavenly, who consider themselves strangers and pilgrims in this life, aiming for heavenly things.

241
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,429
With these inhabitants of the land, He conducts judgment, promising to hand them over to eternal damnation.

242
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:57,521
He explains why He does this, adding, For there is no truth, but everyone speaks lies with his neighbor.

243
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:02,467
Or there is no truth, because He who says of Himself: I am the truth, does not dwell in their hearts.

244
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:07,902
And there is no mercy, because they persecute their subjects and do not have mercy on the orphan and the widow.

245
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:15,786
Thus, they did not even spare Christ Himself, but like rabid dogs, opened their mouths against Him, saying: He is guilty of death, and: Crucify Him, crucify Him.

246
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:17,402
And there is no knowledge of God.

247
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:22,739
That is, faith and the knowledge of God's name are not in their hearts, as they only think of earthly things.

248
00:51:23,376 --> 00:53:16,584
Certainly, here is the text translated into modern, easy-to-understand English:
Or certainly, knowledge, that is, the wisdom of God the Father, who says of Himself through Solomon:
"I, wisdom, dwell in counsel and am present in learned thoughts."
And of whom the Apostle says, "Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God."
He does not dwell on earth, meaning He does not rest in the minds of those who are alien to His faith.
It follows: "Cursing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery have overflowed."
Cursing pertains to their insults and reproaches, like when they said: "You have a demon," and, "You are a Samaritan," and other such things.
Lying pertains to what they said: "He is guilty of death," and, "This man is a glutton and a drunkard."
Murder pertains to the fact that they handed Him over to death and all the prophets, as He Himself reproaches them, saying: "Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. Behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes," etc.
And blessed Stephen says: "Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers."
Theft pertains to the fact that they stole themselves and their children, saying: "His blood be on us and on our children."
Or when they bought Christ secretly with thirty pieces of silver.
Adultery pertains to immorality or idolatry.
All these things had overflowed among the Jews, meaning they had become abundant.
For by the word "overflow," the greatness of the crimes is shown.
"And blood touched blood." Blood touches blood when murder is joined to murder, and when sin is increased by sin.
For by the name of blood, sin is designated, as in "Deliver me from bloodguiltiness."
Because of this, the land will mourn, and everyone who lives in it will languish, along with the beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky; even the fish of the sea will be gathered.
Because for good deeds, the aforementioned vices have overflowed, the land will mourn.
The land seems to mourn when it remains uncultivated, with its inhabitants removed, and what once produced joyful fruits now begins to bring forth thorns and thistles.

249
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:21,589
Therefore, the desolation of the twelve tribes is highlighted here when it says: The land will mourn.

250
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:26,099
We can interpret the Jews themselves as the land, seeking it and possessing earthly wisdom.

251
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:32,542
Thus, it immediately follows: And everyone who lives in it will weaken—referring to those who remain there out of love and desire.

252
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:42,851
Having been captured by their enemies, they mourned and weakened because they were losing the things they had loved deeply and taken pride in, whether it was the beast of the field or the bird of the heavens.

253
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:49,194
As the blessed Jerome mentions, it is natural that if the land is abandoned by its inhabitants, the beasts and birds also leave.

254
00:53:49,194 --> 00:54:00,593
On a deeper level, the beasts of the field symbolize fierce peoples oppressed by beastly stupidity; the birds represent the proud, the haughty, and the frivolous, similar to the Jews who boasted of their merit and despised others.

255
00:54:00,593 --> 00:54:05,649
The fish of the sea can be understood as those immersed in the depths of vice and the darkness of sin.

256
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:11,596
Alternatively, the fish could represent the philosophers of the world, who ponder deep questions about temporal matters.

257
00:54:11,596 --> 00:54:14,966
The fish of the sea, he says, will be gathered, implying into death.

258
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:17,940
Another translation suggests: The fish of the sea will fail.

259
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,724
He advises no one to judge or blame.

260
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:28,199
He had earlier called them to judgment so they might recognize they were being judged justly, not oppressed by God's power but handed over to enemies because of past sins.

261
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:33,006
Yet, because they worsened, they became so imprudent that they felt no shame even when convicted.

262
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:37,516
He instructs the just not to judge or blame the unjust, as they are unworthy of correction.

263
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:45,991
Let each just person, he says, refrain from judging the unjust, and let the impious not be blamed by the pious, because the enormity of their crimes renders them unworthy.

264
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,816
For your people are like those who contradict the priest.

265
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:57,641
Just as an ordinary person disobeys a priest whose commands they don't want to follow, and just as a student disobeys a teacher, so your people contradict my words.

266
00:54:57,641 --> 00:55:01,632
Therefore, they are not worthy of being rebuked by a prophet or anyone righteous.

267
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,391
You will fall today, and the prophet will fall with you.

268
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:18,287
Earlier, he addressed the prophet about the people, but now he speaks directly to the people themselves, specifically the ten tribes, saying: You will fall today, meaning in the present time, or certainly in broad daylight, and you will be led into captivity before everyone’s eyes.

269
00:55:18,287 --> 00:55:20,011
And the prophet will fall with you.

270
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:30,654
We can understand the prophet here in two ways: either as a false prophet, because it is an ambiguous term, or as the prophetic dignity, because we do not read that the ten tribes had a prophet after their captivity.

271
00:55:30,654 --> 00:55:37,504
As long as the ten tribes were not captured, they had Elijah the prophet, Elisha, and other sons of the prophets who prophesied in Samaria.

272
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,904
Indeed, the two tribes had prophets during and after their captivity.

273
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:45,880
But the ten tribes, after being taken to the Medes and Persians, are reported to have had no prophet.

274
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:55,686
Therefore, it is said to them: The prophet will also fall with you, meaning the prophetic dignity will perish from you, or the false prophets who gave you false prophecies will perish along with you.

275
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,460
And at night I silenced your mother.

276
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,924
The mother refers to the Jewish people in general.

277
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:05,492
The children of this mother are either individuals from the people or those scattered through towns and villages.

278
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:14,065
So at night, meaning in the darkness of captivity, sorrow, and pressing distress, I silenced your mother because she did not dare to grieve her misfortune before the enemies.

279
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:16,628
My people were silent because they had no knowledge.

280
00:56:16,628 --> 00:56:20,767
This means, captured by the enemies, they withered in silence, not daring to resist.

281
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:27,123
The reason given for this is that they had no knowledge of God’s law and did not keep His precepts, to serve Him and scorn idols.

282
00:56:27,912 --> 00:56:35,844
Because he had previously closed his mouth to the praises of God, he justly came to this misery, so that he did not even dare to lament his evil among enemies.

283
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:40,683
Because you rejected knowledge, I will reject you, so that you will not serve as a priest for me.

284
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:47,367
The people themselves rejected knowledge, that is, God, when they began to worship the work of their hands with the most foolish mind.

285
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:51,907
Abandoning the Creator of heaven and earth, they venerated golden calves in Dan and Bethel.

286
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:58,742
Therefore, they were rejected, so that there would not be priests from them in the house of the Lord, but rather in the temples of idols.

287
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:03,032
And you have forgotten the law of your God, which forbids the worship of foreign gods.

288
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:10,814
I will also forget your children, handing them over to eternal captivity, nor will I have mercy on them, as I once had mercy on their fathers in the desert.

289
00:57:10,814 --> 00:57:12,810
For the one who ignores will be ignored.

290
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:19,295
All these things can also be referred to heretics, who have left the house of David and Jerusalem, that is, Christ and the Church.

291
00:57:19,295 --> 00:58:20,407
Therefore, covered with eternal night, they fall silent from the praises of God, as it is written: "In hell, who will confess to you?"
This is because they did not have the knowledge of God, that is, Christ, to believe his true faith. Hence, they are justly rejected by the Lord, so that they do not serve as priests for him. Often, such people, taken from this life by untimely death, perish eternally. Neither they, unworthily handling the body and blood of the Lord, would be a stumbling block to others, nor would their evil doctrine, by living long, be a cause of perdition for many.
Their children are also said to be forgotten by God, that is, those who are generated from their perverse doctrine. They will be handed over to eternal damnation along with their fathers. According to their multitude, they have sinned against me. That is, as many people as Israel had, so many altars they built for demons, in whose sacrifices they sinned against me. I will turn their glory into disgrace. He calls their glory the idol in which they gloried, and in whose veneration they rejoiced, which was then turned into disgrace, because for this crime, along with it, they were led into captivity.
The sins of my people they eat.

292
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:23,297
This statement needs to be understood in two ways.

293
00:58:23,297 --> 00:58:27,886
The priests consume the sins of the people by accepting the sacrifices offered for those sins.

294
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:32,768
These offerings, whether made in the past or now in the temple of the Lord, are used by the priests.

295
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:37,650
Hence, it is also stated in the canons that laypeople should not eat from what has been consecrated.

296
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:42,484
But those who consume the alms of others without praying for them properly are similar to the Jews.

297
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:45,901
Those who pray properly for them live by the works of their own hands.

298
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:52,248
Alternatively, the priests consume the sins of the people by flattering those who do evil, thus taking their sins upon themselves.

299
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:56,301
For those who consent to the sins of others become participants in those same sins.

300
00:58:56,301 --> 00:59:01,036
When they see others sinning, not only do they not rebuke them, but they also praise the sinners.

301
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:04,552
Hence, it is added: and they will lift up their souls to their iniquity.

302
00:59:04,552 --> 00:59:15,000
While they served sins, the priests lifted up their souls, saying: Because you are the people of God, descended from the lineage of Abraham, God will spare you for the sake of his friendship if you sin against him.

303
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,737
Taking confidence in these words, they sinned boldly, puffed up with pride, or deceived by false flattery, saying: Your sins are forgiven.

304
00:59:21,737 --> 00:59:29,549
Thus, they lifted up their souls, because believing their words more than their own conscience, they thought themselves to be righteous while they were sinners.

305
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:32,918
Hence it is: My people, those who call you blessed, they deceive you.

306
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:35,554
And it will be as with the people, so with the priest.

307
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:39,899
That is, because they sin equally, they will equally endure the judgment of an angry God.

308
00:59:39,899 --> 00:59:45,807
However, these priests, to whom evil from the Lord is foretold equally as to the people, were not from the tribe of Levi.

309
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:53,374
They came from any tribe, filling their hands with gold or silver, giving gifts to the kings of the ten tribes, and became priests in the temples of idols.

310
00:59:53,374 --> 01:00:00,893
But even any priest or prelate who takes upon himself the sins of others by flattering them becomes equal to them and will be equally condemned with them.

311
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,920
And I will visit upon him, that is, upon the priest, his ways.

312
01:00:04,848 --> 01:01:48,840
I will indeed punish all his works, for here, "visit" means to afflict and torment. I will repay him for his thoughts.
They will suffer punishment not only for their bad deeds but also for their worst thoughts, which led them to commit such acts.
It is easy to understand that the more heretics there are, the more they sin against the Lord. According to their number, they multiply various erroneous doctrines, turning the glory of wisdom and Christianity into disgrace.
Because of their past sins, by God's just judgment, they are allowed to fall into various errors, for which they are eventually handed over to eternal punishments. The Apostle says about them: God handed them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.
They consume the sins of the people when they speak pleasing things and deceive the hearts of believers with sweet words, devouring widows' houses. When they see others sinning, they say, God seeks nothing else but the truth of faith, and if you keep that, He does not care what you do, misunderstanding the Lord's saying: Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved.
While saying these things, they lift up their souls in their iniquities, so they do not repent or humble themselves. Instead, they rejoice in their crimes and walk with heads held high.
Hence, both the people and the priest—those who are taught and those who teach—will be bound by the same judgment. They will be punished not only for their deeds but also for their evil thoughts.
They will eat and not be satisfied; that is, they will engage in evil works and not be fulfilled. The lustful and the greedy will never be satisfied with their wickedness.
On the contrary: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Specifically, those of whom the Prophet says: The poor will eat and be satisfied.
Just as righteousness fills, iniquity, having no substance, deceives those who consume it with empty deceit. It leaves the stomachs of those who devour it empty, that is, their minds: They have committed fornication and have not stopped.

313
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:56,100
It is suggested that they commit adultery because the desires of perverse people lead them to it, and their urge to commit adultery never rests.

314
01:01:56,100 --> 01:03:37,653
Since they did not heed the warning, "You have sinned, be at rest," they will hear on the day of judgment, "Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire."
The ten tribes also committed adultery with idols under Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and continued to worship idols thereafter. Why is this? Because they abandoned the Lord by not keeping His commandments. Adultery, wine, and drunkenness take away the heart. By not keeping His commandments, it is implied that they worshiped idols, because they forsook the Lord their God, unable to serve two masters at the same time.
By not keeping His commandments, it is implied that they did not follow His command: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve." Adultery and wine, and so on, cloud a person's sense and understanding. The meaning is: just as excessive wine and drunkenness make one lose control of their mind, so adultery, whether physical or spiritual, corrupts the sense and weakens the spirit. It turns a rational person into a brute animal, chasing after brothels and dens of lust, and believing that wood and stones are gods, worshiping the works of their own hands.
My people, it is implied, once inquired of their wood, and their staff spoke to them. This was a type of divination done with wood and staves, by which they sought omens of future events. Hence, it is written in Ezekiel that Nebuchadnezzar, proceeding against Amon and Jerusalem, stood at a crossroads where he mixed arrows among other divinations, and one came out against Jerusalem. Perhaps these people did likewise, seeking what was more beneficial to them, whether to worship God or idols.
Because they were so perverse, leaving the truth to follow a lie, by God's just judgment, they were abandoned by God and seduced by the devil through the response of the staff. Hence, it follows: "For the spirit of fornication has deceived them, and they have committed adultery against their God"; that is, through idolatry, they have departed from their God.

315
01:03:37,704 --> 01:03:44,416
The spirit of fornication is understood to be the devil, who persuades people to turn away from God and worship wooden and stone idols.

316
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:47,697
The creation of idols is indeed the beginning of this fornication.

317
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:54,360
Heretics, to whom these things can apply, are never satisfied with their errors and do not stop indulging in the shame of fornication.

318
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,437
They commit acts of bodily impurity and do not follow the law or other Scriptures.

319
01:03:58,437 --> 01:04:07,088
They abandon God, go insane, and become drunk, losing the vigor of their minds, and worship idols that they have created in their hearts, embodying the spirit of fornication.

320
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:10,917
They sacrificed on the tops of the mountains and burned incense on the hills.

321
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:21,955
The children of Israel, following their desires and the lusts of the flesh, abandoned God and, scorning His temple, sacrificed to idols on the mountains and hills, burning incense—which is a sweet-smelling perfume—to them.

322
01:04:21,955 --> 01:04:28,070
There, because of the pleasantness of the places, they ate, drank, slept, and engaged in excess, calling these high places.

323
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,954
They did this because they did not have the Most High God.

324
01:04:30,954 --> 01:05:17,144
We read about these high places in the Acts of the Kings: "However, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed on the high places."
They are said to have done this on the high places because they worshiped on the rooftops of their houses, following, as I think, the custom of the serpent raised on a pole.
Under the oak, poplar, and terebinth trees, it is implied that they sacrificed because its shade was good.
The Jews lost the truth, and that is why they did this.
For the Lord had commanded in the law that they should not sacrifice except in the place He had chosen. But because of their desires, as mentioned above, they sacrificed to idols in the delightful places of groves and mountains, making altars under the shade of trees, attracted by their pleasantness, and engaged in bodily impurity.
Therefore, the Lord had forbidden planting a grove near His altar.
Hence, your daughters will fornicate.

325
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:21,517
It is implied that foreigners, or those abandoning the Lord, will worship idols.

326
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:25,295
Your brides will be adulteresses, leaving their own beds to join with others.

327
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:30,447
I will not punish your daughters when they commit fornication, nor your brides when they commit adultery.

328
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:36,090
Israel has turned away from the Lord their God, so their daughters and brides commit these acts without punishment.

329
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:42,420
They are left to their own wickedness, so they may understand the pain of God, who is so angry that He will not strike them down.

330
01:05:42,420 --> 01:06:47,778
He says, "I will not punish your daughters when they commit fornication, nor your brides when they commit adultery." Instead, He will allow them to indulge in their vices freely, so they recognize their own offense against Him. He will not avenge their wrongdoings, except through ultimate captivity.
They consorted with prostitutes and sacrificed with the effeminate. This explains why He will not avenge the daughters' and wives' iniquities. The number of the sons of Israel was so great that punishment seemed hopeless for reform.
They consorted with prostitutes and sacrificed with the effeminate, committing abominations in the temples of their gods. The people, not understanding, will be punished by God for their own sin, struck by the blows and lashes of captivity.
If we want to understand these things regarding heretics, their daughters or brides are souls begotten in error and betrothed to their doctrines. Such people are unworthy of God's correction, for all their worship is fornication, and the vile mix with the vile. Therefore, they will be punished, so perhaps through blows, those who have abandoned the Lord may repent.
If you fornicate, Israel, at least let Judah not sin. Israel here signifies the ten tribes, while Judah signifies Benjamin and the priestly tribe, the Levitical, joined with the same tribe.

331
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:57,982
Which tribe is now being urged by the prophetic speech not to abandon God for the worship of idols, as Israel did—the ten tribes—by worshiping the idols that Jeroboam, son of Nebat, made for them?

332
01:06:57,982 --> 01:08:39,909
"If you commit adultery," it says, "you Israel, who have mingled with prostitutes, anyone who filled his hand, either his own or the king's, by giving gifts, became a priest of idols."
At least you, Judah, who possess Jerusalem and have priests and Levites according to the law, and the temple with its legal ceremonies, do not commit the sin of imitating them by worshiping idols.
"And do not enter into Gilgal."
Gilgal is the place where the sons of Israel, having crossed the Jordan, first set up camp; and there, after receiving the second circumcision, they were purging idols. The tribe of Judah is now prohibited from veneration there, as it is said:
"Do not go up to Gilgal," implying that you should not worship gods there, as the Israelites do—the ten tribes.
"And do not go up to Bethaven." Bethaven is the same as Bethel, which was previously called Bethel, meaning the house of the Lord. But after idol worship arose there and the calves were placed there by Jeroboam, it was called the useless house and the house of idols.
Hence, the Septuagint translates Bethaven as "house of vanity," because one of the golden calves had been placed there by Jeroboam.
"Do not," it says, "go up to Bethaven to offer sacrifices there, because it is no longer the house of God, but the house of idols. Neither swear, 'As the Lord lives.'"
They are forbidden to swear by the name of the Lord, who had been idol worshipers and had mouths polluted with praises of demons. For praise is not fitting in the mouth of a sinner. The Lord had prohibited in the law that Jews should not swear by the names of idols or foreign gods, allowing them to swear by His name.
For each person either loves or venerates the one by whom they swear. Hence, to prevent them from loving or venerating idols, they were prohibited from swearing by the names of idols, lest by mentioning them, they might be enticed to love and worship them.
Instead, they should always have the name of God in their mouth, worshiping and adoring Him.

333
01:08:39,960 --> 01:10:34,439
Because the Jews had already abandoned God and were worshiping idols, they were forbidden to swear, "The Lord lives." This oath was common among them, as Elijah said, "The Lord lives, in whose sight I stand." And we read very frequently that they used this oath. For you must not swear, "The Lord lives"; it is as if God were saying, "I do not want my name to be mentioned by your mouths, which are polluted by idolatrous worship."
Just as a wanton cow, Israel has turned away: now the Lord will feed them like a lamb in a wide field. The wanton cow is called proud because of its excessive fatness, which refuses to accept the yoke and, driven by a gadfly, leaves the straight path of the furrow. Similarly, Israel (that is, the ten tribes) has thrown off the yoke of the law from their necks, and driven by a demonic spirit, they have taken the wide path by following their pleasures, of which the Lord says, "Wide is the path that leads to destruction." Now he will feed them as above.
The prophet's voice continues about the same people: and because he began to speak about the wanton cow, he keeps the metaphor in the rest. In the wide fields, he says that God will pasture the Israelites like a lamb. Now, he says, that is at the present time, while this spirit rules these bodies, that is, while I am alive, the Lord will feed them in the wide field like a lamb. This means they will be taken into captivity by the Assyrians and in the wide land of captivity, they will be scattered, and there they will remain for a long time.
Allegorically, the name Israel refers to heretics, but Judas means any ecclesiastical man confessing God. To them, it is said: If you fornicate, Israel, that is, if you, O heretic, depart from God through false doctrine, let not Judas offend; that is, let not the ecclesiastical man follow the dogmas of your perversity. And let him not enter into Gilgal, that is, the assemblies of the heretics, where all sins are revealed, and like pigs, they wallow in the mire of vices. For Gilgal means revelation or wallowing place. Nor let him go up to Beth-aven, that is, to the arrogant fabrications of false dogmas, because there is no house of God there, but a house of idols.

334
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:42,869
Those stained by such crimes are also forbidden
to swear in the name of the Lord, whose majesty
they pollute by thinking bad things about Him.

335
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:50,823
They, like a frisky cow,
struck by a shelter, have been hit by the devil's burning arrows
and have abandoned the knowledge of the law.

336
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:55,394
Therefore,
they will graze on the wide and spacious path that leads to death.

337
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:57,234
Ephraim is a partaker in idols.

338
01:10:57,234 --> 01:11:08,631
Ephraim in this
place refers to the ten tribes after the separation from
the house of David to Jeroboam, who was from the tribe of Ephraim,
to whom Jacob had given the blessing of the kingdom.

339
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:14,092
Sometimes,
they are also called by the name Joseph because Joseph
was the father of Ephraim.

340
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:22,640
Therefore, Ephraim (that is, the ten
tribes) participated in idols because they were like them,
whom they worshiped as gods made by their hands.

341
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,983
For the Psalmist says: Let those who
make them and all who trust in them become like them.

342
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:28,577
Leave
him.

343
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:50,896
O Judah, you understand, that is, do not ignore the words
of the prophet and do not follow the impiety of Israel, who is a partaker and friend of idols,
whose worship, religion, and
food are separated from your table, hence it follows:
Their table is separated, that is, the sacrifice
to idols is separate from yours, because you offer to the Almighty
God, but they to demons.

344
01:11:50,896 --> 01:11:53,152
With fornication
they have fornicated.

345
01:11:53,152 --> 01:12:03,540
Repetition of the speech is a confirmation;
it is as if he said: They fornicate every day,
and they love their fornication, and always
increase fornications with fornications.

346
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:10,366
For at first,
they worshiped the idol that Jeroboam,
son of Nebat, had made for them, then the gods of all nations.

347
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:11,910
They loved
to bring shame.

348
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:20,280
His protectors
were called Jeroboam and
his other kings, who should have taught them the way of righteousness and
defended them from enemies.

349
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:33,933
They loved to bring
shame, that is, idolatry, whose actions caused the unhappy
people to adopt the worship of idols, and who should have been
guides to them in the way of salvation, became leaders
of error and eternal destruction.

350
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,951
The spirit bound him in its wings.

351
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:40,462
Spirit and
wind are expressed by one word among the Hebrews, which
is Ruach.

352
01:12:41,471 --> 01:13:52,728
The word "spirits" here refers to demons, who have bound both kings and the people under their influence, wrapping them in their wings, or shadows, causing blindness of mind and preventing them from walking freely wherever they wished.
The spirit indeed bound him when it joined with him, uniting him so that he no longer worshiped correctly but instead adored it through idols. And they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.
This means that when they are captured by enemies, they will feel ashamed and embarrassed, recognizing that this punishment came upon them because of the sacrifices they previously offered to idols. On a deeper level, this also refers to heretics, who participated in idol worship by following various doctrines.
Therefore, the prophet urges the churchman to dismiss and disdain their madness and to scorn their entire company, because their sacrifices are separated from those of the faithful, as they do not rightly celebrate the mysteries of the body and blood of the Lord. Thus, they fornicate by following various errors and serving the impurities of the flesh.
And they love to bring disgrace, meaning they rejoice in providing their listeners with vain and superfluous traditions. These spirits, or the devil, bind them, preventing them from remaining firmly in the Church, and they are carried about by every wind of doctrine. They are truly ashamed of their sacrifices, for their bread, that is, their reward, will be perpetual mourning.

01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,072
Chapter Five

354
01:13:54,072 --> 01:14:03,557
Listen to this, priests, and pay attention, house of Israel, and house of the king, listen: because judgment is for you, for you have become a trap for observation and a net spread over Tabor.

355
01:14:03,557 --> 01:14:12,499
He speaks to the priests of the ten tribes and calls their kings to judgment, not because they are priests from the tribe of Levi, but because they are called priests by the people.

356
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:25,492
But also Israel, that is, the people, is called to judgment, and no one is exempt, so that priests, people, and kings who had led the people astray and appointed such priests for them may all hear what they have done and why they are handed over to their enemies.

357
01:14:25,492 --> 01:14:33,544
Listen to this, everyone, and pay attention, that is, perceive with the ear of the body and retain with the understanding of the mind, because judgment is for you.

358
01:14:33,544 --> 01:14:38,633
Condemnation is imminent due to your wickedness, for you have become a trap of captivity and slaughter.

359
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:43,376
I indeed appointed you as watchmen and leaders of the people, to guide them when they go astray.

360
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:48,365
But you have become a trap, and therefore you are no longer called watchmen and leaders, but hunters.

361
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:54,936
Just as a net is spread over Mount Tabor to catch birds, so your teaching and example have ensnared the people and led them to death.

362
01:14:54,936 --> 01:15:00,370
Tabor is a mountain located in the plains of Galilee, round and lofty, and it is equally bounded on all sides.

363
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:15,833
About it, the psalm sings: "Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name."
And you have led sacrifices into the depth. Sacrifices are led into the depth when they are offered to demons.
The people of the two tribes made their sacrifices, which they offered to Almighty God, ascend upward (that is, to the heavens).

364
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:20,724
But Israel, because they sacrificed to idols, made them descend into the depth, that is, into hell.

365
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:34,952
Morally, the sacrifices of the Lord are the praises of believers, the repentance of sinners, the tears of prayers, about which it is written: "The sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit."
But there are some who, after the tears and repentance of sins, return to the sins already committed.

366
01:15:35,496 --> 01:15:41,008
Hi, certainly, the repentance they had for their past sins, they abandon completely, because they become worse.

367
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:44,236
About such people, it is written:
A dog returns to its own vomit.

368
01:15:44,236 --> 01:15:50,940
According to mystical interpretations, heretical priests and leaders are understood, while the people are their disciples and subjects.

369
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:55,310
Both the leaders and the people are rebuked and brought to the judgment of condemnation.

370
01:15:55,310 --> 01:16:02,163
Because those who ought to be teachers of the people have begun to lead them astray through corrupt teachings and have caused them to err.

371
01:16:02,163 --> 01:16:08,520
The same heretics also lay a trap over Thabor, which is interpreted as 'coming light', when they lay their snares in the Church.

372
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,542
By which perverse doctrines they capture birds (that is, souls flying to heaven).

373
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:22,673
They draw the victims into the depths, persuading people to sacrifice to demons while dragging them into their own errors, so that they do not repent of their sins and rise to contemplate heavenly things.

374
01:16:22,673 --> 01:16:24,461
And I am the teacher of all of them.

375
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:36,876
So that the people and their leaders might not despair, that is, the princes and the priests, believing they could return to grace, the Lord mercifully announces that he will be the teacher of all of them, saying:
And I am the teacher of all of them.

376
01:16:36,876 --> 01:16:49,539
As if to say: If they are willing to repent and cease to serve the gods they have worshiped until now, let them not despair: because I, their teacher, will teach them what they should do, as I wish to correct, not punish them: and to save, not to destroy.

377
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:51,973
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me.

378
01:16:51,973 --> 01:16:56,690
By the name Ephraim, he includes Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and all the kings from the same tribe.

379
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:59,124
I also created the people subjected to the kings.

380
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:05,530
Therefore, since they are my creation, and I observe all their actions, let them not despair, but repent, and I will accept them.

381
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,616
Because Ephraim has now played the harlot.

382
01:17:07,616 --> 01:17:14,469
That is, their kings at the present time, turning away from the worship of God, have begun to commit idolatry by worshiping golden calves.

383
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:15,561
And Israel is defiled.

384
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:23,706
Because when the king committed idolatry, the people followed and completed the same impiety with equal zeal, which should be connected from above, and this I know.

385
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:30,436
They will not turn their thoughts to their God because the spirit of adultery is among them, and they have not known God.

386
01:17:30,436 --> 01:17:43,846
Although the Lord mercifully called Himself their teacher earlier, knowing the intention of their hearts, He adds: They will not turn their thoughts to their God, meaning they do not repent of their evil thoughts, to prevent them from completing the evil deed they have planned.

387
01:17:43,846 --> 01:17:48,235
And He gives the reason, saying: The spirit of adultery (that is, the devil) is among them.

388
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:53,493
And they have not known God, meaning they have not understood Him to worship and adore with proper reverence.

389
01:17:53,493 --> 01:18:01,789
Because the devil dwelled in their hearts, he blinded them so they could not return to the true light to know God, that is, to understand that He alone is to be worshipped.

390
01:18:01,789 --> 01:18:07,047
For it is said of the sons of Eli: Moreover, the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they did not know the Lord.

391
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:16,936
Likewise, God knows the leaders of false teachings (that is, heretics) and the people subjected to them, because He considers all their works and even their hidden thoughts, and nothing is hidden from Him.

392
01:18:16,936 --> 01:18:28,995
And because their subjects were also contaminated by their wrong doctrine, they will not turn their thoughts to repentance and return to God, because they are seduced by the spirit of adultery, which is among them, and therefore they do not know God.

393
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:31,551
And the arrogance of Israel will respond in His face.

394
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:38,690
Arrogance, that is, the pride of Israel, by which they, swelling against God, despised His worship, and in offense to the Creator, worshipped idols.

395
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:49,205
This arrogance will respond in His face when, due to the merit of their wickedness because of idol worship, they are handed over to captivity, so they are not left unpunished but are humbled by their enemies' contempt.

396
01:18:49,205 --> 01:19:00,637
And Israel and Ephraim will fall in their iniquity, that is, both the subjected people and the kings who led them to idol worship will fall together and be weakened, so those who were strong in wickedness will be forced to return to God.

397
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:02,133
Judah will also fall with them.

398
01:19:02,712 --> 01:19:06,729
These words show that the tribe of Judah was already worshiping idols at that time.

399
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:18,345
It says this will not only happen to Israel and Ephraim—that is, the ten tribes and their kings, who will be taken into captivity—but also to Judah, the two tribes that reigned in Jerusalem, who will follow in the footsteps of the captives.

400
01:19:18,345 --> 01:19:22,120
Just as they imitated their crimes, they will also suffer the same punishment.

401
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:30,252
Their arrogance will confront the heretics directly, as their pride in always boasting of knowing higher things will cause both teachers and disciples to fall together.

402
01:19:30,252 --> 01:19:42,352
Judah too, a man instructed in church doctrine who remains in the Church in body but not in mind, and who shares the same erroneous knowledge with the heretics, falsely professing the name of the Church, will also be punished along with the heretics.

403
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:46,515
They will go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord, but they will not find Him.

404
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,177
This applies to both the ten tribes and the two tribes.

405
01:19:49,177 --> 01:20:00,164
When Israel, Ephraim, and Judah are oppressed by enemies, they will, led by late repentance, seek the Lord with their offerings, eager to appease Him with sacrifices, whom they had previously offended with their transgressions.

406
01:20:00,164 --> 01:20:05,052
But they will not find Him, because as they departed from divine worship, He also departed from them.

407
01:20:05,052 --> 01:20:07,763
Therefore, it is said, He has been taken away from them.

408
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:18,508
They will not feel His presence as a helper, nor will they be able to appease Him with their offerings, especially since the Psalmist says: I will not accept calves from your house; and: Will I eat the flesh of bulls, etc.

409
01:20:18,508 --> 01:20:28,333
They committed treachery against the Lord, specifically when they worshiped idols instead of God, because they bore foreign children—that is, they joined to idols and bore children to demons, not to God.

410
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:35,158
Foreign children are understood to be those born in the error of idols, or those whom they consecrated to idols by leading them through fire.

411
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:37,626
Now the month will devour them with their portions.

412
01:20:38,256 --> 01:20:48,177
He says that because they acted this way, soon their enemies—the Assyrians and the Chaldeans—will come and devour them along with their lands and possessions, which they received by lot and measure.

413
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:51,735
The Septuagint translation reads: Rust will devour them with their ivy.

414
01:20:51,735 --> 01:20:58,750
The meaning is that every month, the enemy will come to destroy everything belonging to them, killing some and taking others into captivity.

415
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:05,766
This is shown in the history of the Books of Kings and Chronicles, where it is recounted that this people were taken captive multiple times.

416
01:21:05,766 --> 01:21:16,940
Heretics believe that by offering many sacrifices, they please God, and Judas (that is, the clergy) thinks that by giving alms, they can redeem their sins, even though sacrifices usually atone for past, not present, crimes.

417
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,147
People like this do not find God because He withdraws from them.

418
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:25,659
They transgress by neglecting God's commandments and producing illegitimate children through their evil deeds.

419
01:21:25,659 --> 01:21:31,371
Therefore, they are condemned daily and individually, rushing towards eternal damnation with their wicked actions.

420
01:21:31,371 --> 01:21:34,779
Blow the trumpet in Gibeah, the horn in Ramah, cry out in Beth-aven.

421
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:43,197
The trumpet is made from the horn of an animal with a curved shape, but the law commands the horn to be made from bronze or silver, and it sounds in wars and festivals.

422
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:46,905
Gibeah and Ramah are cities in the tribe of Benjamin, close to each other.

423
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,409
Gibeah is where Saul was born.

424
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:55,324
Ramah is the place where the king of Israel tried to block the exit and entrance of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, as recorded in Kings.

425
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:58,481
Beth-aven is in the tribe of Ephraim, previously called Bethel.

426
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:11,058
Having mentioned the captivity of both the ten tribes and the two tribes, saying: Now the month will devour them with their possessions, he encourages them, as captivity is near, to sound their trumpets and horns, urging each other to a common lament.

427
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,564
And the meaning is: Do not mourn your captivity quietly, but sound the trumpets and horns so that all around can hear.

428
01:22:17,564 --> 01:23:49,054
This meaning fits well because Gabaa means "hill" and Rama means "high place." So they are told: Sound the trumpet in Gabaa, the horn in Rama, meaning go up to the mountains and hills and loudly lament your impending captivity.
Also, wail in Bethaven, where one of the golden calves is, for the inhabitants will be handed over into captivity because of their worship. It is fittingly added, "Behind you, Benjamin," for where the tribe of Benjamin ends, this city is not far, situated in the tribe of Ephraim, specifically in the rear part of Benjamin.
Ephraim will be in desolation on the day of correction. Here, Ephraim refers both to the kings descended from him and to the people of the ten tribes. The day of correction refers to the time when they were handed over to their enemies because of their sins, so that those who did not want to serve God in prosperity would endure correction, afflicted by various miseries from their enemies.
On that day, both kings and their subjects were made desolate; some were killed, and others were taken into captivity, leaving their land empty of its inhabitants. In the tribes of Israel, I have shown faithfulness. The Septuagint says: In the tribes of Israel, I have shown faithful things, using the past tense for the future, saying "I have shown" instead of "I will show." As if to say: When the things I spoke of before through the prophets come to pass, I will show faithfulness, meaning I will reveal my faithful and true words, because everything I spoke about their destruction will be fulfilled.
But heretics also dwell in Gabaa and Rama, that is, in the prideful knowledge, thinking they possess high wisdom, and there they worship idols, meaning the false doctrines they created from their own hearts. Therefore, they are commanded not to hide their evil in silence but to publicly reveal it to everyone.

429
01:23:49,104 --> 01:24:18,592
They are commanded to wail in Bethaven, which means "house of uselessness." Their hearts, which were once Bethel through true faith, the "house of God," have now through various errors become useless.
This aligns with Bethaven being mentioned as behind Benjamin. Benjamin means "right hand" and signifies the saints who will reach the prosperity of the heavenly kingdom. Because of eternal joy, they leave behind all the comforts of the present life, echoing the Apostle's words:
"One thing I do: forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal" (Philippians 3:13-14).

430
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:26,872
Heretics, however, are behind Benjamin because they longingly desire and delight in the things the saints despise in this life, placing all their hope in transient things.

431
01:24:26,872 --> 01:25:14,567
Those who previously seemed like Ephraim, meaning "fruitfulness," will be in desolation when the day of correction comes, the day of judgment. Stripped of all the goods in which they seemed to excel, they will be handed over naked and empty to the unquenchable fire.
At that time, the Lord will show His faithfulness in their damnation. He will demonstrate His faithful and true words by accomplishing through action what He had previously foretold about their destruction.
This applies not only to heretics but also to all the reprobates in general.
The leaders of Judah have become like those who move a boundary. They should have wept and encouraged their people to turn away from idol worship to avoid suffering similar consequences. Instead, they rejoiced that their land was open for wider possession. They became like those who move the boundaries of Israel, crossing their own borders and seeking to expand their kingdom and possessions in the lands that once belonged to them.

432
01:25:14,664 --> 01:25:18,014
Therefore, it is said: I will pour out my wrath like water upon them.

433
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:24,958
This means the Babylonians will come upon the leaders of Judah and overwhelm them like a flood, bringing complete captivity and abundant death.

434
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:28,163
This will happen not by their own strength, but by my indignation.

435
01:25:28,163 --> 01:26:54,406
The term "pouring out" signifies the abundance and magnitude of the event. He also tells the leaders of Judah, meaning the Church, that they should not have rejoiced or considered their own salvation in the destruction of the reprobate, but rather mourned their loss, remembering their own condition.
Hence, the Apostle admonishes church members not to boast over the breaking off of the Jewish branches, but rather to fear that they might also be broken off. Some rejoice in the destruction of the reprobate and think they stand firm when others fall, but the Lord pours out his wrath like water upon them. Often, when some rejoice at others' downfall, they themselves fall into the same evils for which they mocked others, thus incurring the wrath of God.
The leaders of Judah also move the boundaries set by their fathers when they replace truth with lies and preach something other than what they received from the apostles. Ephraim suffers slander, broken by judgment.
The people of Israel, still persisting in the hardness of their hearts, claimed they were broken by judgment and unjustly oppressed by their enemies. They said: Because we are descended from the lineage of Abraham, friends of God, we should not have been handed over to those worse than us, meaning the uncircumcised and idolaters, entirely alien to the worship of God. They called the affliction brought upon them by their enemies slander, claiming they were condemned unjustly and without fault.
Therefore, to make them understand they endure this not without cause, it is said they began to follow filth. As if to say: They were not handed over to the Chaldeans because their oppressors were more righteous, but because the Jews, once my people, deserted me and began to follow filth, meaning idols.

436
01:26:54,552 --> 01:27:06,280
Therefore, they are compared to filth and uncleanness, and thus a just sentence is delivered, showing that they suffer slander and are handed over to worse things because Ephraim, that is, Jeroboam, began to follow idols and abandon God.

437
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,101
He made golden calves, which the people later worshipped.

438
01:27:09,101 --> 01:27:14,495
Regarding heretics, it is clear that they oppressed the Church with their sophistries and dialectical skills.

439
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:18,998
But in doing so, they did not follow the purity of true faith, but rather the dirt of lies.

440
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:26,916
When they see themselves condemned with the devil and his angels, they believe they are suffering slander and that the truth of judgment is broken against them.

441
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:28,896
This also applies to all the reprobates.

442
01:27:28,896 --> 01:27:32,261
And I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah.

443
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:34,884
A moth eats clothing, but rot or decay consumes wood.

444
01:27:34,884 --> 01:27:48,444
In these words, the meaning is: Just as a moth consumes clothing and rot consumes wood over time, so I, first with the ten tribes and later with the two tribes, gave them long periods for repentance and urged them to salvation, but ultimately handed them over for damnation.

445
01:27:48,444 --> 01:27:52,699
It should be noted that the moth refers to Ephraim, but the rot to the house of Judah.

446
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:55,718
For the moth consumes clothing faster than rot consumes wood.

447
01:27:55,718 --> 01:28:00,618
Hence, it is shown that the captivity of the ten tribes occurred first, followed by the two tribes.

448
01:28:00,618 --> 01:28:09,228
It should also be noted that while all of Ephraim is declared to be consumed like a moth, speaking of the tribe of Judah, it is said: And I am like rot to the house of Judah.

449
01:28:09,228 --> 01:28:20,066
In these words, it is shown that a certain part will be preserved from them, which later returned, from which Christ originated, to whom the promise is kept, as Jacob says: And he will be the expectation of the nations.

450
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:36,051
However, with the heretics punished, understood by the name Ephraim, even Judah, that is, those who remain in the Church and are restrained by the vices or errors of the heretics, will be subject to a similar sentence, because it was necessary that those who imitate their actions should suffer the same punishment as them.

451
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:42,381
Ephraim saw their sickness, and Judah their wound; Ephraim went to Assyria and sought help from the avenging king.

452
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:51,924
Ephraim, representing the kings of the ten tribes, recognized their weakness, while Judah understood their wound, signifying that captivity was near because they shared in the ten tribes' sins.

453
01:28:51,924 --> 01:28:57,709
They turned to Assyria because they did not seek help from God, who could have resolved both their sin and captivity.

454
01:28:57,709 --> 01:29:00,825
Instead, they sought assistance from the king of the Assyrians.

455
01:29:00,825 --> 01:29:08,538
In the Book of Kings, we learn that during Menahem's reign over the ten tribes, Israel sent gifts to the Assyrians to be freed from the enemies of Damascus.

456
01:29:08,538 --> 01:29:13,533
Similarly, Judah sent gifts to Tiglath-Pileser during Ahaz's reign to escape Pekah, king of Damascus.

457
01:29:13,533 --> 01:29:22,878
Yet, although they were temporarily saved from their enemies, the same Assyrians later conquered them and became the instruments of God's punishment, who were once seen as their liberators.

458
01:29:22,878 --> 01:29:27,279
Thus, it is noted: And he shall not be able to heal you, nor release you from your wound.

459
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,927
With God opposing them, the Assyrians could neither free them nor release them from captivity.

460
01:29:31,927 --> 01:29:35,883
Allegorically, Ephraim and Judah can be seen as heretics and ecclesiastical men.

461
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:49,580
When they recognize their wound—that is, when they realize they are bound by sins, as it is written: Each one is bound by the cords of their sins—they do not seek God's help but turn to the devil, the avenger of all sins, as it is written: To destroy the enemy and the avenger.

462
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:55,019
Because they do not call upon the true helper and judge, they remain in their pains and various errors of sin.

463
01:29:55,019 --> 01:30:01,349
The devil cannot heal them nor release them from the chains of their sins, and they will perish with him by God's just judgment.

464
01:30:01,349 --> 01:30:05,305
For I am like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah.

465
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:13,216
The meaning is clear: Although they went to Assyria and sent gifts to the avenging king to be freed, they could not be healed nor released from their captivity.

466
01:30:13,216 --> 01:30:16,678
For I will show that with me opposing them, all human help is in vain.

467
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:18,408
For I am like a lioness to Ephraim.

468
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,556
The Seventy interpreted it as a panther instead of a lioness, which is similarly said in Greek as in Latin.

469
01:30:24,556 --> 01:30:28,160
According to Blessed Jerome, this animal is the fastest, and rightly so.

470
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:34,667
The Lord, speaking against Ephraim—that is, against the ten tribes—says He will become like a panther, signifying quick captivity.

471
01:30:34,667 --> 01:30:37,721
Not long after, their destruction came through the Assyrians.

472
01:30:37,721 --> 01:30:47,633
Against Judah, however, He says He will be like a lion, which is the strongest of beasts, indicating that their captivity would happen after some time through the strongest kingdom of the Chaldeans.

473
01:30:47,633 --> 01:30:53,289
The Lord compares Himself to beasts in their condemnation, so that they may understand the severity of His anger.

474
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:56,793
I will capture, go, and take away, and there will be no one to rescue.

475
01:30:56,793 --> 01:31:04,252
Because He said earlier that He would be like a panther or a lion, He maintains the metaphor by saying: I will capture, meaning through my ministers.

476
01:31:04,252 --> 01:31:10,960
The Chaldeans or Assyrians did not capture them by their own strength; rather, God Almighty captured them because of their iniquities.

477
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,115
Therefore, even the enemies could not spare them when the Lord was angry with them.

478
01:31:15,115 --> 01:31:25,326
I, He says, will capture, meaning I will make them be captured by the enemies, and I will go with them, so that even in captivity, they will endure the presence of my vengeance, against which they sinned.

479
01:31:25,326 --> 01:31:31,534
I will take them from their own land, and there will be no one to rescue them, meaning no one can snatch them from my power.

480
01:31:31,534 --> 01:31:38,191
No one can snatch anyone from the hand of God, unless the one who is held wants to escape by his own will, as Judas the betrayer did.

481
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:41,595
Going, I will return to my place, until you perish and seek my face.

482
01:31:41,595 --> 01:31:50,105
We must understand the place of God as His magnificence and majesty, or we may refer these words specifically to the Son of God, through whom all prophecy is carried out.

483
01:31:50,105 --> 01:31:54,761
His place is God the Father, as He Himself says: I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.

484
01:31:55,512 --> 01:32:57,000
He said, "I will return to my place. When you have been handed over to your enemies, I will sit securely in my majesty, or even in the Father, and I will not come down to experience human emotions. I will not be angry with you, nor will I have pity, forgetting your wrongdoings. Instead, I will allow you, whom I previously protected, to be subjected to your enemies. I will offer no help or compassion until you are exhausted and, compelled by servitude, seek my face, repenting."
Even for heretics and sinning church leaders, Almighty God, because of the magnitude of their sins, though He is most merciful, turns into the cruelty of wild beasts and takes away their prey—that is, their disciples, whom they had snatched from the Church—making them return to the true faith. There is no one who can rescue them, because whoever's heart He has enlightened, no one can deceive.
While He does this, He departs from the assemblies of the perverse and dwells in the Church of the believers. He despises and rejects them until they waste away in their impieties and fail in their iniquities, seeking His presence, from whom they had been forsaken, saying: "Illuminate, Lord, your face, and we will be saved."

485
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,344
Chapter Six

486
01:32:58,344 --> 01:33:00,655
In their trouble, they will rise early to me.

487
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:08,359
These words can partly refer to those who, pressed by the tribulation of captivity, began to repent and seek God, whom they felt was absent and angry.

488
01:33:08,359 --> 01:33:14,215
And in the morning, that is, in the light of repentance, they say to one another: Come, let us return to the Lord.

489
01:33:14,215 --> 01:33:32,089
Generally, these words are applied to all Christians who believe in Christ, who, afflicted by various tribulations, when the light of truth dawns on them, in the coming of Christ in the morning, that is, in the light of faith, rise from the darkness of unbelief and error, and begin to encourage each other, saying: Come, let us return to the Lord.

490
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:45,495
Indeed, those who returned from captivity from the two tribes, not content with their own salvation, encourage each other, saying: Come with the steps of love and faith, let us return to the Lord, whom we abandoned by sinning, and from whom we were justly left.

491
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:55,665
Because he captured us, leading us into captivity through Nebuchadnezzar; hence it is said above: I will capture; and he will heal us, by bringing us back from captivity, like a father his children.

492
01:33:55,665 --> 01:34:04,449
He will strike us, by whipping us with various tribulations and beatings, and he will heal us from the wounds of sins, if after the whippings we perform worthy repentance.

493
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:20,474
As it is added: He will revive us after two days, this is specifically referred to the believers, who, called and illuminated by the faith of Christ, mutually provoke each other to return to the Lord, from whose worship they had once departed, and by worshipping various demonic idols, they deserved his absence.

494
01:34:20,474 --> 01:34:23,607
Because (it says) he captured us, when the Word became flesh.

495
01:34:23,607 --> 01:34:26,329
Hence Paul says: He took hold of the seed of Abraham.

496
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:31,979
And he will heal us, because the heavenly doctor, after the pain of wounds and sins, will give us full health.

497
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:38,503
Hence the Lord, intending to heal the paralytic, first purifies the soul, then relieves the body from the trouble of infirmity.

498
01:34:38,503 --> 01:34:45,591
He will strike us, you understand, in various ways, and after striking will heal us, according to that: Whom the Lord loves, he chastises.

499
01:34:45,591 --> 01:34:49,905
Hence he also said to a certain healed person: Behold, you have been made well, etc.

500
01:34:49,905 --> 01:34:51,600
He will revive us after two days.

501
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:57,435
The Hebrews, blessed Jerome says, mistakenly believe that after a cycle of 1,000 years, they will be saved.

502
01:34:57,435 --> 01:35:03,220
They base this belief on the salvation of believers being promised on the third day, because the Lord rose from the dead.

503
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:09,675
They refer to the second day as the coming of their Christ and the third day as his coming for judgment, by which they are to be saved.

504
01:35:09,675 --> 01:35:14,313
But when they say this, they need to explain why they acknowledge only the second and third days.

505
01:35:14,313 --> 01:35:21,580
Those who accept the second and third days indicate that they have lost sight of the first day, since the second and third days cannot exist without it.

506
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:30,138
And since they cannot account for the first day, we should refer all these things to the first and second coming of Christ, through which the salvation of believers was fulfilled.

507
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:33,581
So, let's accept the first period of God as the second coming of Christ.

508
01:35:33,581 --> 01:35:37,884
After this day, He will bring us to life through faith, having been dead through unbelief.

509
01:35:37,884 --> 01:35:45,677
Or certainly, He brought us to life in the hope of resurrection, as the Apostle says: He brought us to life and made us sit in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

510
01:35:45,677 --> 01:35:50,745
On the third day, He will raise us up, because with His resurrection from the dead, we also rose with Him.

511
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:57,295
His resurrection signifies our own, as it is written: Just as He rose from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we will rise with Him.

512
01:35:57,295 --> 01:36:09,822
Alternatively, we can consider the first day as the coming of Christ in humility, the second as His coming in glory, where He will be seen by all, and the third as the day when, after judgment, He will reveal the greater glory of His radiance to His chosen ones.

513
01:36:09,822 --> 01:36:16,228
For God the Father has ordained that the general vivification and resurrection of all the saints will be accomplished through the Son.

514
01:36:16,228 --> 01:36:26,221
Our first day is when we are reborn through the water of baptism and the grace of the Holy Spirit, coming from darkness to light, as the Apostle says: You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.

515
01:36:26,221 --> 01:36:29,807
The second is the rest of souls, and the third is the general resurrection.

516
01:36:29,807 --> 01:36:33,345
We will live in His presence, as John says, when we will see Him as He is.

517
01:36:33,345 --> 01:36:38,508
Or if we want to refer this to the present time, we live in His presence because, in Him, we move and exist.

518
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:40,947
We will know and continue to seek to know the Lord.

519
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:47,847
We will recognize the majesty of His divinity by believing and understanding His Trinity in persons, and unity in majesty.

520
01:36:47,847 --> 01:36:51,539
We will follow His footsteps by imitating Him or ascending to the heavens.

521
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,984
Hence, it is added: So that we may know the Lord.

522
01:36:53,984 --> 01:36:59,074
This will truly be fulfilled when what we now see through a mirror dimly, we will behold face to face.

523
01:36:59,074 --> 01:37:05,410
Hence, it is written: And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

524
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,556
Just like the dawn, His coming is prepared.

525
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:14,442
The dawn is called the small light of day, which, when it rises, dispels the darkness of night and the brightness of day begins to appear.

526
01:37:14,442 --> 01:37:33,253
Therefore, the meaning is: Just as the rising dawn dispels the darkness of night, and the light of day opens, so with Christ being born in the flesh, the darkness of our sins was dissipated, and the sun of righteousness rose for us, illuminating our blindness, opening the eyes of our mind, and revealing the brightness of the heavenly homeland and the light of true knowledge.

527
01:37:33,253 --> 01:37:40,538
And beautifully, this same birth is called His coming forth, about which the Psalmist says: And He is like a bridegroom coming out of His chamber.

528
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:48,471
Indeed, He came out like a bridegroom from His chamber when He took on an immaculate body from the untouched womb of the Virgin and appeared born in the flesh.

529
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:53,760
About whose birth it is rightly added: And He will come to us like the early and late rain upon the earth.

530
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:04,937
Literally, He calls the early rain the rain that is given by God to the land of the Palestinians after the seeds are sown, which, when poured, causes the seeds to grow; and the late rain, which brings the fruits to maturity.

531
01:38:04,937 --> 01:38:10,176
Indeed, the promised land does not receive rain from heaven as frequently as ours, but only twice a year.

532
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:15,765
Hence, the Lord promises through the prophet to the same people saying: I will give you the early and late rain.

533
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:23,349
Spiritually, however, Christ is the early rain for us, when we receive the foundations of His faith, by which being rooted, we may abound in good works.

534
01:38:24,047 --> 01:38:30,278
Later on, when the crops are ready for harvest—that is, when our good deeds are complete—we will be stored in the Lord's barns.

535
01:38:30,278 --> 01:38:32,976
For now, the rain is early, while we only know in part.

536
01:38:32,976 --> 01:38:35,625
There will be a later rain when what is perfect comes.

537
01:38:35,625 --> 01:38:42,396
Therefore, the Jews who did not receive the early rain and harvested without rain will not receive the fruit of the seed in the end times.

538
01:38:42,396 --> 01:38:44,064
What shall I do with you, Ephraim?

539
01:38:44,064 --> 01:38:45,634
What shall I do with you, Judah?

540
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:48,970
How can I hand you over to enemies without feeling pain in my heart?

541
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:51,373
What remedy can I apply to restore you to health?

542
01:38:51,373 --> 01:38:55,151
Your mercy is like the morning cloud and like the early dew that passes away.

543
01:38:55,151 --> 01:39:04,767
Just as the cloud that made the night dark passes when the sun comes, and just as the early dew dries up when the sun rises, so that mercy with which I used to show you compassion has passed away.

544
01:39:04,767 --> 01:39:09,378
Now the time of captivity is near for you, soon to come through the Assyrians and Babylonians.

545
01:39:09,378 --> 01:39:12,125
Because of this, I have shaped you through the prophets.

546
01:39:12,125 --> 01:40:11,291
So that the Jews would not make excuses, saying: "We were deceived by false prophets who promised us peace, and that is why we sinned," the Lord testifies that He first killed the prophets. Understanding that those who caused their error were killed by the Lord, they might turn their deaths into an opportunity for salvation.
From this, we read in the Books of Kings about 450 prophets who were killed, and another countless multitude by Jehu, who overthrew the house of Ahab. Hence it is added, "I have killed them with the word of my mouth." The mouth of the Lord was Elijah, who commanded them to be killed.
Alternatively: Because, specifically, mercy has departed from those who act wickedly; I have shaped them, that is, I have foretold through the prophets that they would be shaped, as was Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others; and with my fearful words, I threatened them so that those who despised the merciful one might fear the offended one.
And I have killed them with the word of my mouth, so that sinners might be punished by the terror of words before captivity approached. All these things, as my judgments, by which I will judge you, will go forth like light; that is, they will be made manifest.

547
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:18,070
Because I often rebuke you and you remain unrepentant, you will be condemned in broad daylight with many nations watching.

548
01:40:18,070 --> 01:40:24,261
My judgments will certainly go forth like light, so no one will doubt that you have justly suffered what you are enduring.

549
01:40:24,261 --> 01:40:30,654
These words can also refer to heretics or to the men of Judah, whom the Lord calls to mercy and wishes to return to salvation.

550
01:40:30,654 --> 01:40:42,934
For those who are unrepentant, the prosperity of this world, like clouds or dew, will be taken away from them, much like what happened to the rich man dressed in purple, who realized that everything he enjoyed passed away like a cloud or dew.

551
01:40:42,934 --> 01:40:47,602
The Lord always warns the prophets of heretics by threatening them with eternal punishments.

552
01:40:47,602 --> 01:40:53,945
Their judgments will become evident when, with everyone watching, they will be condemned along with the devil and his angels.

553
01:40:53,945 --> 01:40:58,512
For I desired mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

554
01:40:58,512 --> 01:41:03,434
The Jews, sinning in various ways, thought they could be purified by the offerings of sacrifices.

555
01:41:03,434 --> 01:41:19,317
But the Lord showed that he rather wanted mercy—first, that they have mercy on themselves, as it is said: Son, have mercy on your soul, pleasing God; then on the poor, and the knowledge of true faith with self-awareness, rather than burnt offerings, because without faith and mercy it is impossible to please God.

556
01:41:19,317 --> 01:41:21,905
But they, like Adam, have transgressed my covenant.

557
01:41:21,905 --> 01:41:36,316
As if to say: Therefore, they cannot be purified by sacrifices, as they think, because just as Adam, by tasting the forbidden fruit, despised God's command, so they, by transgressing the divine law, act against God's command, which said to them: Do not make for yourselves other gods.

558
01:41:36,316 --> 01:41:40,933
Just as Adam lost paradise, so they will lose the land they had received as an inheritance.

559
01:41:40,933 --> 01:41:48,037
Where this is, in Adam, or even in paradise, they have transgressed against me, according to what the Apostle says: In whom all have sinned.

560
01:41:48,037 --> 01:41:57,780
Daily, the Lord also calls to repentance those who are within the Church and sin, and those who dwell outside the Church, to the mercy and knowledge of true faith, saying: I desire mercy, etc.

561
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:06,407
These people seem to offer gifts to God, pursue humility, and do charity, which would be considered sacrifices if they came from the right faith and good will.

562
01:42:06,407 --> 01:42:14,023
But since they reject both mercy and the true knowledge of God, they falsely boast of having other parts of faith while missing the most important part.

563
01:42:14,023 --> 01:42:22,041
They have broken God’s covenant in the Church, just as Adam did in paradise; and just as Adam was cast out from paradise, they will be cast out from the Church.

564
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:23,845
Gilead is a city of idol worshipers.

565
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:29,708
Gilead is the name of a city or mountain, but here it refers to a city located across the Jordan in the tribe of Gad.

566
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:33,716
In this city, an idol was first consecrated because it was inhabited by priests.

567
01:42:33,716 --> 01:42:42,085
It was also a city of refuge, but because it was so prominent and had greater authority, being assigned to the priests, it became the origin of idolatry and all evils.

568
01:42:42,085 --> 01:42:48,298
Since they were the first to consecrate idols, they were the first to be captured by the Assyrians and taken into captivity.

569
01:42:48,298 --> 01:42:49,300
Overthrown by blood.

570
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:59,523
We read in the Book of Kings that Jehu, anointed as king in Ramoth-Gilead, destroyed, under the Lord’s command, the entire house of Ahab, including his seventy sons and others who agreed with him in evil.

571
01:42:59,523 --> 01:43:07,841
Therefore, the city itself is said to be overthrown (that is, humiliated) by blood, or because the vengeance for the blood it shed came upon it, as we will see later.

572
01:43:07,841 --> 01:43:09,294
And like the jaws of robbers.

573
01:43:09,294 --> 01:43:14,104
The jaws of robbers are caves and other hidden places where they hide, rob, and kill passers-by.

574
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:16,209
Such dwellings existed in the same region.

575
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:29,037
Therefore, it is said that Gilead is like the jaws of robbers because, just as those robbers, lying in wait, stripped and killed people, so the priests of Gilead, lying in wait for the simplicity of the people, robbed them of faith and killed them in mind.

576
01:43:29,037 --> 01:43:33,196
Those they could not deceive, they stripped of their clothes and killed physically.

577
01:43:33,196 --> 01:43:38,558
And this is what follows, the accomplice of the priests in the way of those killing travelers from Shechem.

578
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,870
Sichem is a city on the border of twelve tribes, known today as Nablus.

579
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:48,506
The Israelites would pass through on their way to Jerusalem, the only place they were allowed to offer sacrifices.

580
01:43:48,506 --> 01:44:02,348
Therefore, during the three times a year when the people were required by law to go up to the temple of God, the priests of idols would place robbers along the route to ambush those traveling, so they would worship golden calves in Dan and Bethel instead of the Lord in Jerusalem.

581
01:44:02,348 --> 01:44:05,562
Those they could not turn back, they would kill on the same path.

582
01:44:05,562 --> 01:44:14,560
The priests of Gilead were involved in this, as they conspired and agreed with the aforementioned priests, and similarly killed those traveling to Jerusalem through their own agents.

583
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:19,157
Hence, it follows that they committed a crime, either in killing those people or in idolatry.

584
01:44:19,157 --> 01:44:33,247
But even now, false teachers lie in wait on the way, that is, on the journey of this present life, for those traveling to the heavenly Jerusalem, and kill those they can in Sichem, that is, in good works, by leading them back to wickedness through their false teachings or bad example.

585
01:44:33,247 --> 01:45:23,773
Sichem means "shoulder."
On the shoulder, however, work is understood.
Hence, we read about Issachar, that he put his shoulder to work.
In the house of Israel, I have seen something horrible.
Horror sometimes means fear, as it is written: "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
Sometimes it means filth and something disgusting; hence: "You did not shudder at the virgin's womb," meaning you did not consider it dirty.
Therefore, in this place, horror is used to mean the fear of idolatry.
For the prophet was terrified seeing the idol that the Israelites had made, abandoning God, and thus he said: In the house of Israel, that is, in the congregation of the twelve tribes, I saw idolatry.
For what could be more dreadful than twelve tribes suddenly turning to idol worship?
There, the fornications of Ephraim, Israel was defiled.
It was mentioned earlier that by the name Ephraim, Jeroboam is understood, namely the first king of the twelve tribes, and Israel, referring to his entire kingdom.

586
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:30,864
In the house of Israel, something terrible appeared: the fornications of Ephraim, which refers to Jeroboam from the tribe of Ephraim.

587
01:45:30,864 --> 01:45:33,096
He abandoned God and began to worship idols.

588
01:45:33,096 --> 01:45:40,297
A man commits fornication when he deserts the Creator (who is the husband of the soul) and joins himself to an adulterer (that is, the devil).

589
01:45:40,297 --> 01:45:46,991
With Jeroboam fornicating, Israel, the people under his rule, were contaminated, as they largely retained the common name of Israel.

590
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:51,556
The discourse then turns to Judah, adding: But you, Judah, prepare a harvest for yourself.

591
01:45:51,556 --> 01:46:02,205
The meaning is clear: Do not think you are secure just because Israel is being taken captive; you too need to prepare crops to be harvested, meaning children who will be cut down by Nebuchadnezzar and his army.

592
01:46:02,205 --> 01:46:08,037
Not long after, you will be taken captive to Babylon, and the time of your harvesting (that is, killing) will come.

593
01:46:08,037 --> 01:46:11,638
When I restore the captivity of my people, you will understand and see.

594
01:46:11,638 --> 01:46:19,144
This was fulfilled under Cyrus, king of the Persians, when through the efforts of Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and Nehemiah, the Jews returned to their land.

595
01:46:19,144 --> 01:46:24,722
Many who had witnessed the captivity also saw the return of those born in Chaldea, and they returned together.

596
01:46:24,722 --> 01:46:30,351
Note, however, that the captivity and return of Judah are equally prophesied, but nothing is said about Israel.

597
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:34,307
While Judah returned after seventy years, Israel remained perpetually captive.

598
01:46:34,307 --> 01:46:40,900
Something terrible also appears in the house of heretics when, following corrupt doctrines, they have wrong thoughts about Christ.

599
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,653
By the error of their fornication, the people seduced by them are defiled.

600
01:46:44,653 --> 01:46:56,367
Judah, meaning ecclesiastical men, are also instructed to prepare a harvest of cutting, to be reaped because of their sins on the day of judgment, by the one who in the Revelation of John is said to have a sharp sickle in his hand.

601
01:46:56,367 --> 01:47:00,374
This, however, is not said with the wish of one desiring it, but as a prophecy.

602
01:47:00,374 --> 01:47:04,228
For even these, if they repent, will see their conversion from evil to good.

603
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,384
Chapter Seven

604
01:47:06,384 --> 01:47:15,836
When I wanted to heal Israel, I understood that their idolatry, which they practiced in Egypt or in the desert when they fashioned the calf’s head, saying: These are your gods, was the issue.

605
01:47:15,836 --> 01:47:18,310
I preferred the repentance of a sinner over death.

606
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:25,486
The iniquity of Ephraim was revealed, specifically the idolatry of Jeroboam, who suddenly became king over the Israelites and made golden calves.

607
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:29,841
The wickedness of Samaria, meaning the people who followed the wicked king, was exposed.

608
01:47:29,841 --> 01:47:33,206
Both the king and the people practiced falsehood, worshipping idols.

609
01:47:33,206 --> 01:47:36,225
Just as falsehood is contrary to truth, so is an idol to God.

610
01:47:36,225 --> 01:47:41,371
In this falsehood, they acted by proclaiming these idols as gods, transferring the glory of God to them.

611
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:44,044
A thief entered to steal, and a bandit stayed outside.

612
01:47:44,044 --> 01:47:50,378
The difference between a thief and a bandit is that a thief seeks the night and acts secretly, while a bandit openly uses force.

613
01:47:50,378 --> 01:47:58,840
In this context, we should understand the thief or bandit to be Jeroboam, who secretly stole the house of Israel from God and openly robbed the people of God's protection.

614
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:05,274
The sense is: When I wanted to erase the old sins of my people due to their ancient idolatry, Ephraim and Samaria found new idols.

615
01:48:05,274 --> 01:48:18,833
This can also mean that when the Lord Savior wanted to heal the sins of the Church, both of the Jews and the Gentiles, new false teachings arose, causing many to work falsehood against Christ, and through them, a thief and bandit, representing the devil, entered the Church.

616
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:28,533
Or we may understand the thief and the bandit to be the heretics, of whom the Lord says: He who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold but climbs in another way, he is a thief and a bandit.

617
01:48:28,533 --> 01:48:30,859
All who came before me are thieves and bandits.

618
01:48:30,859 --> 01:48:33,927
From this, he significantly says that the bandit outside robs.

619
01:48:33,927 --> 01:48:41,449
For they cannot deprive those they have taught of Christ’s garment unless they have led them outside of the Church and made them follow their doctrines.

620
01:48:42,192 --> 01:49:56,823
And so, they don't say in their hearts, "He remembered all our wickedness. Now their own schemes have surrounded them." They don't think, "He is punishing us for old sins, and we are paying for the faults of our fathers," as it is written: "Our fathers ate sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on edge."
But now, in the present, their own schemes have surrounded them. This means that I am punishing them not for the sins of their fathers or for old iniquities, but for their current ones. They thought their wickedness was hidden from God, but God sees everything. Therefore, it is said: "Before my face, their deeds are done," meaning I always see their wicked deeds, which they commit in my presence without fearing me. The wicked are condemned not only for past sins but because they add new impiety to their old deeds every day. When they think they can hide from the Lord, they cannot avoid His eyes, because it is written: "The face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
In their wickedness, they cheered the king, giving their consent to King Jeroboam to worship idols as he wished, and in their lies when they said, "These are your gods." It is implied that the princes also cheered because they consented to the king. Note that this explains what they did in his presence. Everyone who serves a perverse work or thinks badly of Christ, like Arius and others, cheers the king (that is, the devil), and in the lies of wicked doctrines, the princes (the devil's followers), who are called the princes of the devil's darkness.

621
01:49:56,823 --> 01:49:59,139
The opposing forces greatly rejoice in our sins.

622
01:49:59,139 --> 01:50:01,648
All adulterers are like an oven heated by the baker.

623
01:50:01,648 --> 01:50:06,472
This is spoken against those who cheered the king in their wickedness and the princes in their lies.

624
01:50:06,472 --> 01:50:11,779
All adulterers, meaning those who turn away from their own husband, God, are like an oven heated by the baker.

625
01:50:11,779 --> 01:50:17,230
Just as an oven is heated to bake bread, they were heated by the wickedness of Jeroboam and the fire of idolatry.

626
01:50:17,472 --> 01:50:22,171
The city took a brief respite from the spread of new practices, until everyone was influenced.

627
01:50:22,171 --> 01:50:31,421
Indeed, after creating the idols, Jeroboam did not force the people to worship them, fearing that some might resist for the sake of God and religion, which would undermine that worship.

628
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:36,171
Thus, the city rested for a while until the people, by their own choice, aligned with the king.

629
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:42,771
First, the leaders, then their followers, supporting the king and the leaders, and eventually, the entire population was led astray.

630
01:50:42,771 --> 01:50:45,521
This is what is meant by: Until the whole was leavened.

631
01:50:45,521 --> 01:50:50,221
For actions taken willingly last long, whereas those done out of necessity quickly fall apart.

632
01:50:50,221 --> 01:50:56,021
Considering this, Jeroboam preferred that the people willingly adopt the new idol worship rather than being coerced.

633
01:50:56,021 --> 01:50:58,471
Yeast can be used both positively and negatively.

634
01:50:58,471 --> 01:51:04,171
In a positive sense, as the Lord mentions in the Gospel, a woman took yeast and hid it in three measures of flour.

635
01:51:04,171 --> 01:51:09,170
However, here it is used negatively, representing the corruption of the people through idol worship.

636
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:16,020
Heretics also hide their malicious intentions for a long time, masking falsehoods with truths, until their followers willingly obey them.

637
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:23,520
Eventually, the hearts of the deceived swell with the yeast of their wicked doctrine, about which the Lord says: Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees.

638
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,520
The day of our king.

639
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:34,570
The entire population, inflamed with the worship of the golden calves, began to say at the gates of Jeroboam's palace: The day of our king, meaning, this is the day our emperor declared festive for us.

640
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:37,320
We celebrate, we rejoice, and we worship golden calves.

641
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,620
The leaders began to lose control due to wine.

642
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:49,320
While the people shouted: This is the day our king made sacred for us, the leaders, who should have guided the people, instead lost their reason and indulged in madness from luxury and idolatry.

643
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:54,470
He stretched out his hand with mockers, because their hearts were like an oven, while they lay in wait.

644
01:51:55,320 --> 01:52:03,282
When the king saw the people shouting as we had foretold, and the leaders were also drunken and immersed in the wine of idolatry, he extended his hand with the mockers.

645
01:52:03,282 --> 01:52:10,345
These leaders were wickedly deceiving the people and leading them far from their God by blessing and giving thanks, or by agreeing with their errors.

646
01:52:10,345 --> 01:52:14,658
They had turned their hearts like an oven, burning and blazing with the flames of idolatry.

647
01:52:14,658 --> 01:52:22,620
Therefore, the king clapped his hands and gave thanks to the people along with the leaders, because he understood that they had completely turned their minds to errors.

648
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:28,877
He did this while plotting against them, so they would not go up to the temple of the Lord but would worship the calves he had made.

649
01:52:28,877 --> 01:52:36,271
He had deceitfully created those calves to prevent the people of Israel from going to the temple of God in Jerusalem and reconciling with the king of Judah.

650
01:52:36,271 --> 01:52:41,200
The whole night he slept, cooking them, and in the morning, he himself was ignited like a flame of fire.

651
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:51,106
After he implanted the fire of wickedness in their hearts and saw them raging, with no one resisting his will, he slept the whole night securely, dwelling in darkness and cooking them with the fire of impiety.

652
01:52:51,106 --> 01:52:55,609
But in the morning, he himself was ignited with the flames of his crimes and came to sacrifice.

653
01:52:55,609 --> 01:53:05,183
All were heated like an oven because, when they no longer secretly but brazenly turned from the worship of God to the ceremonies of idols, they were all set ablaze with the wickedness of their iniquity.

654
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:10,160
They devoured their judges—those who did not agree with them but even rebuked them, and they killed them.

655
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:15,611
Or certainly, those who had stood before their judges were spiritually killed by being drawn into their wickedness.

656
01:53:15,611 --> 01:53:22,815
When they remembered the religions of the Lord, seeing the king, the leaders, and all the people given to idolatry, they began to say: What shall we do?

657
01:53:22,815 --> 01:53:25,801
Behold, the king, his leaders, and all the people worship gods.

658
01:53:25,801 --> 01:53:31,442
Now, because we are among them, we cannot help but do likewise, lest we be stripped of all things, even lose our lives.

659
01:53:31,442 --> 01:53:35,186
While they were saying these things, they also fell into the crime of idolatry.

660
01:53:35,186 --> 01:53:36,513
All their kings have fallen.

661
01:53:37,272 --> 01:53:42,889
From Jeroboam to the last king Josiah, all the kings of Israel fell into idolatry and faced eternal destruction.

662
01:53:42,889 --> 01:53:46,650
They followed the ways of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.

663
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:51,465
Not one among them called to me, meaning no king or subject turned to God and left behind idols.

664
01:53:51,465 --> 01:54:01,245
Blessed Jerome refers all these things to the heretics and their disciples, who, intoxicated by the malice of the devil (who is the king over all the wicked), celebrate the days of their leaders.

665
01:54:01,245 --> 01:54:06,361
For example, Marcion, Arius, and Eunomius abandoned the Church and trampled on the truth of the faith.

666
01:54:06,361 --> 01:54:13,132
Hence, those who lead the rest applaud them because they see their hearts filled with wickedness and infused with the wine of iniquity.

667
01:54:13,132 --> 01:55:09,707
Solomon says: "Leaders should not drink wine, lest they forget wisdom." They also become insane from wine. Moses said: "Their wine is the fury of dragons," etc.
As for Jeroboam sleeping all night, it shows that heretics, dwelling in the darkness of unbelief, cannot perceive the light of the true sun. For those who sleep, sleep at night because their senses are oppressed. Their hearts are known to be heated by anger, greed, and other vices. They devour their judges, meaning if anyone has the virtue or sense to discern good from evil, they are drawn away from them. All the leaders of such people fall under God's predestination. There is none among them who calls to the Lord, to call on the name of the Lord and be saved.
Ephraim mingled with the peoples. Here, Ephraim does not only refer to the kings, as mentioned earlier, but to the entire people of the ten tribes. Ephraim, meaning the entire kingdom of the ten tribes, mingled with the peoples, meaning they were similar to the nations worshiping idols. Ephraim is like a half-baked bread that is not turned. A bread that is not turned is full of filth on all sides.

668
01:55:10,008 --> 01:55:12,213
In this way, Ephraim became unable to repent.

669
01:55:12,213 --> 01:55:15,300
Remaining unchangeable, he was surrounded by the ashes of sins.

670
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:19,172
If he had wanted to turn away from his wickedness, he could have been purified.

671
01:55:19,172 --> 01:55:21,965
Foreigners consumed his strength, and he did not know it.

672
01:55:21,965 --> 01:56:31,652
By "strength," it means the leaders and all the strong men of the people, or the treasures in which they trusted. Foreigners, from God or even from the Jewish nation, specifically his enemies the Chaldeans and Assyrians, consumed his strength by killing the leaders, claiming their goods, and devouring whatever power they could.
Ephraim was so foolish that he did not know his God or understand why he had been handed over to his devourers, considering himself righteous. But even gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, and he did not know it.
The gray hairs of men are sometimes mentioned for good, as in Solomon’s saying: "Gray hair is the wisdom of a man, and the age of old age is a blameless life." However, here they are mentioned for ill, showing that wickedness persisted in the same people until the end of the kingdom.
But even gray hairs, he says, are sprinkled upon him, meaning that wickedness persisted abundantly until old age and the end of the kingdom. And he did not know that the end of his kingdom was near.
And the pride of Israel will be humbled before him. For Israel had raised itself against the Lord and trusted not in Him, but in the multitude of its own army. Because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble, He now says through the Prophet: The pride of Israel will be humbled, meaning that the leaders and his army (in which he gloried) will be killed by the Assyrians and Chaldeans.

673
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:34,592
This will happen not long after, but now and in the present.

674
01:56:34,592 --> 01:56:36,406
For this is what he says: Before him.

675
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:40,767
They did not return to the Lord their God, and they did not seek Him in all these things.

676
01:56:40,767 --> 01:56:51,303
What he had previously stated obscurely, saying: Ephraim became like a cake not turned, he now states more clearly: They did not, he says, return to the Lord their God, and they did not seek Him in all these things.

677
01:56:51,696 --> 01:58:26,976
If they had returned to the Lord their God, they would have surely heard the Lord speaking through Jeremiah:
"Return to me, and I will return to you."
But instead of seeking Him, they chased after idols and did not trust Him fully or act rightly in their adversities.
Now, if we apply this to heretics or wicked leaders, it's like Ephraim mixing with the people when a wicked leader draws others to his ways and becomes like them. As it was said before:
"Like people, like priest."
Ephraim also mixes with the people because heretics are no different from the errors of pagans. A once-leader of the Church becomes like bread baked on ashes, surrounded by the ashes of sins, and does not return to the Lord, remaining in his initial error. His strength—the virtue and intelligence—gets taken away by demons, the worst enemies of Christians. But he doesn't realize this, thinking those who devour him are friends. Gray hairs appear on him while his foolish heart remains unchanged until the end of his life.
Just as the wisdom of a righteous man is reflected in his gray hairs, the foolishness of the wicked is also apparent. Yet, he doesn't recognize the old age of his wickedness, about which it is written:
"What is becoming old and aging is close to destruction."
Though their pride is humbled daily by Christ, they do not repent or return to the Lord. Ephraim has become like a deceived dove, without a heart.
The dove is seen positively, as the Lord says in the Gospel:
"Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves,"
so that we neither harm others nor suffer deceit, showing a balanced person with both simplicity and prudence. Prudence without simplicity is cunning; simplicity without prudence is foolishness.
Therefore, in this context, the dove represents the foolishness of the Jewish people, who trusted in man rather than in God, calling upon Egypt and seeking help from the Assyrians.

678
01:58:26,976 --> 02:00:05,856
For those who sought help from Egypt, which Isaiah calls a "broken reed staff," they were taken captive by the Assyrians. Thus, Ephraim became like a dove deceived by the devil, lacking heart—that is, the understanding of the mind.
It's noteworthy that they are not compared to an eagle, a hawk, a raven, or any other bird, but to a dove, which is so fragile that it cannot protect its own young. Similarly, they were captured by enemies and did not have the strength to defend themselves. They called on Egypt for help, either by worshiping their gods or asking for aid. They went to the Assyrians, not willingly, but as captives.
And when they are fully grown, I will spread my net over them, meaning that they will realize they cannot escape my sight by changing places. When they go into captivity, I will spread my net, showing my power over them, so they cannot freely return to their land as they think, until I allow it.
I will bring them down like birds of the sky. Just as a bird is brought down from the height of the sky by a net spread over the waters, so I will bring them down from the height of their pride. I will strike them according to the hearing of their assembly. The meaning is: Just as they all worshiped idols with a united plan and conspired to turn away from me, so with me angry, they will all be devastated together, as I strike them all together from the king to the beggar.
We can also refer these words to the time of the Lord's passion. Just as they conspired together regarding the Lord’s death, shouting to Pilate, "Crucify him, crucify him," so they were captured, struck, and killed by enemies during the Passover festival. Woe to them, that is, there will be eternal damnation after the present tribulation. Because they turned away from me, worshiping idols, they will be devastated by enemies and will be miserable. Because they broke faith with me, worshiping golden calves, and transgressing my commandment, which said: "You shall not make for yourselves other gods."

679
02:00:05,856 --> 02:00:09,482
I redeemed them from Egyptian slavery and led them out with a powerful arm.

680
02:00:09,482 --> 02:00:15,866
Yet they spoke against me with lies, making idols and saying: These are your gods, Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

681
02:00:15,866 --> 02:00:19,154
They did not cry out to me in their hearts because they loved idols.

682
02:00:19,154 --> 02:00:23,748
Instead, they howled in their beds, imitating the voices of wolves or dogs in praise of demons.

683
02:00:23,748 --> 02:00:27,230
The songs they sang in praise of demons are called howling by Scripture.

684
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:30,906
They had lost their rational understanding and became like senseless beasts.

685
02:00:30,906 --> 02:00:39,949
It is easy to understand this about heretics, for whom eternal woe is imminent, because they departed from God and transgressed His commandments, the One who redeemed them with His blood.

686
02:00:39,949 --> 02:00:52,522
They speak lies against God, composing impious doctrines of falsehood, not crying out to the Lord in their hearts, but always howling in their assemblies, which are called dens of wild beasts, imitating the howling of wolves and the sound of irrational beasts.

687
02:00:52,522 --> 02:00:54,070
They chewed over wheat and wine.

688
02:00:54,070 --> 02:01:03,887
To chew over means to regurgitate, just as animals bring back what they eat during the day to their mouths and throats at night, and thus, by chewing over more thoroughly, send it back to their stomachs.

689
02:01:03,887 --> 02:01:13,220
The sense is: Because they had an abundance of all things, which is comprehended in wine and wheat, they therefore fell away from me, which Ezekiel also recalls happening in Sodom and Gomorrah.

690
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:17,379
However, to show they were like beasts, he did not say they ate, but they chewed over.

691
02:01:17,379 --> 02:01:23,182
They are also said to have chewed over in this way because they did not spiritually understand the food of divine words.

692
02:01:23,182 --> 02:01:28,695
They departed from me, despising the worship of my religion and submitting themselves to the slavery of the devil.

693
02:01:28,695 --> 02:01:32,564
I taught them, that is, I instructed them through Moses and other faithful ones.

694
02:01:32,564 --> 02:01:38,512
I strengthened their arms, that is, I provided strength for fighting, as happened in the times of Joshua and the Maccabees.

695
02:01:38,512 --> 02:01:45,234
And they thought evil against me, transferring my power to idols, and saying that I was not God, but the calves which they themselves made.

696
02:01:46,008 --> 02:01:47,551
Can they do anything or harm me?

697
02:01:47,551 --> 02:01:52,183
What they intended for evil against me, they have returned to their former state without a yoke.

698
02:01:52,183 --> 02:01:59,950
That is, before I called them through Abraham, then through Moses and the others, they were without the yoke and knowledge of the law, mingling with all nations.

699
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:05,836
Now they have returned to their old ways, living without the yoke and guidance of God, recklessly following their desires.

700
02:02:05,836 --> 02:02:10,275
They have become like a deceitful bow, perverse and turning the arrow back towards the Lord.

701
02:02:10,275 --> 02:02:20,020
Though they were strengthened and extended by God to strike their adversaries, those whom God empowered against their enemies have turned against their own Lord, sending arrows of blasphemy against Him.

702
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,301
Their leaders will fall by the sword because of their furious words.

703
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:31,213
Just as the leaders were the head of malice and deceived the unfortunate people, now they will be the first to be truly confounded because of their furious tongues.

704
02:02:31,213 --> 02:02:36,617
Mad with rage, they dared to call golden calves gods, repeating in the promised land what they learned in Egypt.

705
02:02:36,617 --> 02:02:39,801
For the fury of their tongues, madness, and blasphemy are evident.

706
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:44,384
This mocking in the land of Egypt, meaning their current ridicule and idol worship, is not new.

707
02:02:44,384 --> 02:02:47,568
What they did in Egypt and later in the desert, they still do now.

708
02:02:47,568 --> 02:02:51,428
There they began to worship idols, and even now they persist in the same malice.

709
02:02:51,428 --> 02:03:00,594
Spiritually, through wheat and wine, we can understand the mysteries of the body and blood of Christ, or the Holy Scripture, which provides food in obscure places and drink in easier places.

710
02:03:00,594 --> 02:03:08,314
Heretics stumble over this wheat and wine, unworthily taking the body and blood of the Lord and interpreting the divine Scripture with a perverse understanding.

711
02:03:08,314 --> 02:03:13,862
By continually reading and meditating on the law and other Scriptures, they pretend to understand what they do not.

712
02:03:13,862 --> 02:03:19,748
In doing so, they depart from the Lord, who taught them in the Church and gave them strength to fight against adversaries.

713
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:25,955
They plot evil against God, creating the most wicked heresies, and become like the pagans, reduced to nothing.

714
02:03:25,955 --> 02:03:30,748
Such people turn into deceitful bows, bringing eternal death upon themselves with their opinions.

715
02:03:30,748 --> 02:03:38,111
Thus, the leaders of heretics, due to the madness of their speech and their blasphemy against the Lord, are struck by the judgment of the true judge.

716
02:03:38,111 --> 02:03:45,523
They continue to do in the so-called false Church what they did before when they dwelled in Egypt, that is, in the darkness of unbelief and ignorance.

717
02:03:45,672 --> 02:03:47,016
Chapter Eight

718
02:03:47,016 --> 02:03:48,624
Let a trumpet be in your throat.

719
02:03:48,624 --> 02:03:56,116
The voice of God is to the prophet, who is commanded to raise his voice like a trumpet, so that many may hear him shouting, because many have sinned.

720
02:03:56,116 --> 02:04:02,048
Then, he immediately adds what the prophet should say with his raised voice: Like an eagle over the house of the Lord.

721
02:04:02,048 --> 02:04:06,523
Here, the eagle refers to Nebuchadnezzar, coming against Jerusalem and the temple of God.

722
02:04:06,523 --> 02:04:13,009
He is compared to an eagle because of his great speed and rapacity, mimicking the swift flight of an eagle hastening to its prey.

723
02:04:13,009 --> 02:04:18,640
Hence, Ezekiel speaks of him metaphorically: A great eagle with large wings, with long pinions, came to Lebanon.

724
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:25,176
Indeed, the temple of God, over which the prophet is commanded to announce the arrival of the eagle, is called Lebanon by Ezekiel.

725
02:04:25,176 --> 02:04:30,254
Therefore, Zechariah also speaks, saying: Open your doors, Lebanon, that fire may devour your cedars.

726
02:04:30,254 --> 02:04:33,773
Because they have broken my covenant and have rebelled against my law.

727
02:04:33,773 --> 02:04:40,460
This verse pertains to the above, where the prophet is commanded to cry out with a loud voice, as the eagle is over the house of God.

728
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:59,264
The meaning is: What I say to you, O prophet, and command you to let a trumpet be in your throat, that is, to announce with a loud voice the coming of the king of the Chaldeans, I command this for no other reason than that they have broken my covenant by making idols, and have rebelled against my law, where I said: You shall not make for yourselves gods of gold or silver.

729
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,878
They will call upon me, My God, we know you, Israel.

730
02:05:01,878 --> 02:05:14,045
When captivity occurs, pressed by distress, compelled by necessity, they will call upon me, asking for help and mercy, and will say: We know you, Israel, that is, we who are called Israel and retain the ancient name of Jacob, who pleased you.

731
02:05:14,045 --> 02:05:19,576
We know you and recognize you, and because of the knowledge of you that we have above all nations, deliver us.

732
02:05:19,576 --> 02:05:22,391
Israel has rejected the good; the enemy will pursue him.

733
02:05:22,391 --> 02:05:26,413
This is the response of Almighty God to what they had said: We know you, Israel.

734
02:05:27,168 --> 02:06:00,915
And the meaning is:
How can you be called by the name Israel, which means "man seeing God," when you have rejected the good, that is, the Lord God, from whom Jacob was called Israel?
For the good that Israel rejected is understood to be God, of whom it is written: No one is good except God alone.
Therefore, Israel rejected the good, which means they abandoned their God and regarded Him as nothing.
Thus, when they cry out, I will not listen to them because of the false name Israel, but an enemy (that is, the Assyrian, or even the devil) will pursue and capture them, who, having abandoned me as their king, sought a king for themselves, as the other nations have.

735
02:06:00,915 --> 02:06:07,332
Hence, it immediately adds: They have set up kings, but not by me; they have appointed princes, but I did not acknowledge them.

736
02:06:07,332 --> 02:06:14,304
If we want to refer this to their first king, Saul, a question arises as to why the Lord says: They have set up kings, but not by me, etc.

737
02:06:14,304 --> 02:06:17,385
, when the Lord chose him and established him as king by lot.

738
02:06:17,385 --> 02:06:22,185
For even Samuel, after establishing him as king, said: Surely you see whom the Lord has chosen.

739
02:06:22,185 --> 02:06:27,287
Hence, he also revealed him hidden in the house, and disclosed it to Samuel's ear before his arrival.

740
02:06:27,287 --> 02:06:33,956
But it must be understood that Almighty God sometimes permits what He does not want, as is certainly evident from the choice itself.

741
02:06:33,956 --> 02:06:41,029
For He saw their hearts inclined to the election of a king, and therefore allowed it to happen according to their request, against His will.

742
02:06:41,029 --> 02:06:46,485
This is clearly shown by the thunder and lightning that occurred in summer, against the custom of that land.

743
02:06:46,485 --> 02:06:56,691
Hence, Samuel, knowing that God did not want this, foretold to them the rights of the king, who would subject them to very harsh servitude, so that they might return to the Lord, the most merciful king.

744
02:06:56,691 --> 02:07:06,290
But if we refer this to Jeroboam, who later ruled over the ten tribes, and to the other princes who succeeded him in the kingdom, we clearly recognize that this was done against God's order.

745
02:07:06,290 --> 02:07:12,958
For although God, angered by Solomon's sin, wanted to divide the kingdom, yet against His will, the people of Israel chose Jeroboam.

746
02:07:13,464 --> 02:07:20,744
He should have consulted God according to the command, to see if God wanted this to happen, and then chosen a king by lot, not by his own will.

747
02:07:20,744 --> 02:07:27,311
Often, there are unavoidable reasons, but because people do not follow God's will and instead pursue their own, they sin gravely.

748
02:07:27,311 --> 02:07:35,712
For example, it is said of the Lord Savior that the Son of Man must be handed over, die, and be buried, and then it is added: Woe to that man by whom He is betrayed.

749
02:07:35,712 --> 02:07:40,497
Judas, in His death, did not consider our necessity or God's will, but followed his own greed.

750
02:07:40,497 --> 02:07:45,639
Therefore, what God had preordained to happen, this man, by doing so, was condemned to eternal death.

751
02:07:45,639 --> 02:07:52,614
They ruled, but not by my will; princes came forth, and I did not know them, that is, I did not choose them, and therefore I reject them.

752
02:07:52,614 --> 02:07:55,669
For God's knowing is choosing, and not knowing is rejecting.

753
02:07:55,669 --> 02:07:59,131
They made their gold and silver into idols for themselves to perish.

754
02:07:59,131 --> 02:08:04,018
Because they had abundance, they neglected God who gave these to them for adornment and delight.

755
02:08:04,018 --> 02:08:10,179
They made idols for themselves, leading to their own destruction, because the gods they made caused their death and ruin.

756
02:08:10,179 --> 02:08:17,306
Spiritually, these things said about Nebuchadnezzar can be referred to the devil, who in many places of divine Scripture is called an eagle.

757
02:08:17,306 --> 02:08:22,448
Hence, it is said: If you are exalted like an eagle, from there I will bring you down, says the Lord.

758
02:08:22,448 --> 02:08:26,827
This eagle came over the gatherings of heretics, because they were once houses of God.

759
02:08:26,827 --> 02:08:43,017
Since they transgressed God's law and invoke God in vain with words, but are far from Him in deeds, and reject God through false teaching, they choose kings for themselves against God's will, namely leaders and authors of perverse doctrines, which God does not acknowledge, because they do not deserve His recognition.

760
02:08:43,017 --> 02:08:52,639
Those who, in their eloquence or spiritual brilliance, perversely understand and turn these into idols, which they fashioned from their own hearts, and because they did this, they perished.

761
02:08:53,352 --> 02:08:55,653
Your golden calf has been cast away, Samaria.

762
02:08:55,653 --> 02:09:00,052
Samaria, the capital of the ten tribes, represents all the cities of the same kingdom.

763
02:09:00,052 --> 02:09:05,115
The golden calves were not in Samaria itself, but in Dan and Bethel, which are included in Samaria.

764
02:09:05,115 --> 02:09:11,048
We should take one calf to represent the two, using a singular number for a plural, as often seen in the Scriptures.

765
02:09:11,048 --> 02:10:34,571
When he says, "Your calf has been cast away," it means the temple of idols has been destroyed by the Assyrians. The calves themselves have also been cast away, melted down, and taken into captivity. Hence, it is immediately added, "My anger burned against them." This means I have avenged myself on them, whether on the calves or on those who worshipped them.
How long will they be unable to be corrected? It's as if to say: What madness is this, that while I am giving them a chance to repent, they refuse to turn to health?
Explaining what this calf was, from whose filth they could not be cleansed, he adds:
Because it is from Israel. They did not receive the calf from elsewhere, like Baal and Astaroth from the Sidonians, Chemosh from the Moabites, or Moloch from the Ammonites. Instead, they and their king Jeroboam made the calf. An artisan made it, meaning Jeroboam, the inventor of the evil, or certainly any artisan ordered by him, showing that it is not a god that the craftsman's hand forms, but an idol.
The calf of Samaria will be like spider webs, just as spider webs are dissolved and annihilated by the wind, so their calf will be reduced to nothing. Again, one calf is used to represent the two. Because they sow the wind, and they will reap the whirlwind. They sow is used for they have sown, the future for the past, as often happens in the Scriptures.
He says they sow the wind, meaning they perform vain works, making an idol completely devoid of divinity, and therefore they will reap the whirlwind, that is, captivity, storm, and misery. The standing stalk has no grain, and the sprout will not produce flour.

766
02:10:34,776 --> 02:10:41,113
When seeds are scattered and spoiled by the wind, losing their inner core, they can't produce grain that can be made into flour.

767
02:10:41,113 --> 02:10:48,293
This means that just as spoiled seeds do not yield fruit, good works cannot be found in them, nor can they have any semblance of fruitful action.

768
02:10:48,293 --> 02:10:52,105
Hence, it is added: even if they do produce something, strangers will eat it.

769
02:10:52,105 --> 02:11:04,187
This means that if they manage to have any power for a time or do any good, strangers, such as the Assyrians, will take it all away, or even demons, about whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel, saying that birds of the air ate the scattered seeds.

770
02:11:04,187 --> 02:11:08,346
Israel was devoured by enemies who killed them or by demons who took all their good.

771
02:11:08,346 --> 02:11:12,357
Now they have become like the nations, similar to the Gentiles who worship idols.

772
02:11:12,357 --> 02:11:14,486
Hence, it is added, like an unclean vessel.

773
02:11:14,486 --> 02:11:19,487
An unclean vessel, in the literal sense, refers to something used for holding and disposing of filth.

774
02:11:19,487 --> 02:11:27,607
They were like this, stained with the filth and dirt of idols, made into a vessel not for honor but for disgrace, and so they were cast away by the Lord as unclean.

775
02:11:27,607 --> 02:11:30,231
For what could be more unclean than a demonic spirit?

776
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:34,935
All of this can be applied to heretics, who follow empty things, and so they will depart empty.

777
02:11:34,935 --> 02:11:38,698
Those who sow in the flesh will reap corruption and disgrace from the flesh.

778
02:11:38,698 --> 02:11:52,216
While it may seem that the stalk of ecclesiastical doctrine stands in them because they are baptized and celebrate the mysteries of Christ's body, it will not make flour, meaning it will not lead to the fruit of good work, because all their actions are empty and worthless.

779
02:11:52,216 --> 02:12:01,029
Even if they do something, strangers will eat it, because, elevated by human favor, they will lose all their good, and therefore they will lack the fruit of reward in the future.

780
02:12:01,029 --> 02:12:08,258
They are often devoured by enemies, that is, demons, and become an unclean vessel, becoming like the pagans, even losing the name of Christianity.

781
02:12:08,258 --> 02:12:12,913
Because they went up to Assyria, not willingly, but bearing the harm of captivity unwillingly.

782
02:12:13,656 --> 02:12:15,432
The wild donkey, Ephraim, is alone.

783
02:12:15,432 --> 02:12:23,399
A wild donkey is a wild ass that, unlike sheep, does not require domestic pastures but roams freely through different places and prefers solitary habitation.

784
02:12:23,399 --> 02:12:30,504
The Jews who strayed from God became like this, running after various idols according to their whims and making various gods for themselves.

785
02:12:30,504 --> 02:12:32,483
Abandoned by God, they became solitary.

786
02:12:32,483 --> 02:13:50,533
It is further said, "They gave gifts to their lovers," that is, to the Assyrians, with whom they had once formed an alliance. This happened during the times of King Menahem or King Hoshea, as previously mentioned. They also hired nations with payment, implying they sought their help, as shown earlier when it is said that Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the avenging king.
Now I will gather them, implying for battle, so that all may be led captive together. They will rest for a while from the burden of kings and princes. As if to say: Until now, they loved giving gifts to their adversaries, whom they cherished. But now, I will make them cease for a while, so that while they pass into captivity, they will not pay tributes even to their own kings and princes until they arrive in Assyria, where they will no longer give tributes and payments like free people but will be reduced to the utmost servitude.
Because Ephraim multiplied altars for sinning, the altars became a sin for him. This shows the reason why they suffer captivity and stop giving gifts to kings and princes for a while: because Ephraim, that is Jeroboam, or indeed all the people of the ten tribes, multiplied altars where they compounded sins with sins. Therefore, they sinned even more, because they worshipped idols not only in Dan or Bethel but also in the mountains, groves, and various places. These altars, that is, sacrificial altars, turned into sin for him, because the more they were, the more they sinned there.
"I will write for him my many laws."

787
02:13:50,736 --> 02:14:02,083
Because they consider the law I gave them through Moses to be of no value by worshipping idols in various places, although I commanded that there should be one altar in Jerusalem, I will bring upon them many laws to correct them.

788
02:14:02,083 --> 02:14:06,443
But again, noting their wickedness, he adds that even those laws are considered foreign.

789
02:14:06,443 --> 02:14:12,439
It is as if he said: Because they despised the law they had previously received, what good will it do to write more laws?

790
02:14:12,439 --> 02:14:15,115
They will bring offerings, sacrifice meat, and eat it.

791
02:14:15,115 --> 02:14:22,448
Here it is shown that they made many altars to bring offerings and sacrifices in various places, to fill their own stomachs, not to please the Lord.

792
02:14:22,448 --> 02:14:25,124
Therefore, it is added, the Lord will not accept them.

793
02:14:25,124 --> 02:14:28,048
Because they were not offered to Him, but rather to demons.

794
02:14:28,048 --> 02:14:32,161
For they did not sacrifice them to the Lord, but to their own stomachs and throats.

795
02:14:32,161 --> 02:14:36,620
All their effort was to eat the offerings themselves, not to please the Lord through them.

796
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:44,400
Heretics also multiply altars for themselves when, abandoning the truth, they create various doctrines for themselves, not to please God, but to provoke Him.

797
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:54,607
Indeed, the altar of the Holy Church is one, even though many altars are built in different places around the world, just as there is one faith and one baptism according to the teaching of the Apostle Paul.

798
02:14:54,607 --> 02:14:57,481
When heretics abandon this, they incur a more serious sin.

799
02:14:57,481 --> 02:15:10,167
Therefore, they do not deserve to receive God's laws, because they despised the ones they had received before, abandoning the one true sacrifice of Christ's body, and offering various victims, eating and consecrating the mysteries of Christ as they please.

800
02:15:10,167 --> 02:15:16,311
Hence, whatever they do, such as almsgiving, humility, chastity, and other works of virtue, are considered worthless by God.

801
02:15:16,311 --> 02:15:21,415
Nor will the Lord accept any of these sacrifices, because they seek their own glory in them, not God's.

802
02:15:21,415 --> 02:15:24,338
Now He will remember their iniquities and visit their sins.

803
02:15:24,338 --> 02:15:26,667
There is a difference between iniquity and sin.

804
02:15:26,667 --> 02:15:29,541
Iniquity is whatever is committed before divine knowledge.

805
02:15:30,384 --> 02:15:34,120
Sin, however, when committed after the law, is considered even more severe.

806
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:38,853
Hence, it is said: Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

807
02:15:38,853 --> 02:15:46,226
And those who persist in their transgressions, the Lord remembers their iniquities, which they committed before the law, but He punishes their sins.

808
02:15:46,226 --> 02:15:56,987
Therefore, because they sinned after the law was given, it is now said that He will remember their iniquities to avenge them, and He will visit their former sins with scourges and the torment of misery and captivity.

809
02:15:56,987 --> 02:15:58,980
They themselves will turn back to Egypt.

810
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:00,823
This can be understood in three ways.

811
02:16:00,823 --> 02:16:04,510
First, they turned back to Egypt by worshipping their gods in their minds.

812
02:16:04,510 --> 02:16:07,400
Second, by seeking help, not trusting in God's protection.

813
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:13,777
And finally, when God commanded them not to return to Egypt, they despised God and physically returned to Egypt and lived there.

814
02:16:13,777 --> 02:16:16,168
And Israel forgot their Maker and built temples.

815
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:22,744
By the name Israel, as often said, the whole people of the ten tribes are understood, retaining for the most part their former name.

816
02:16:22,744 --> 02:16:32,160
They forgot the worship of their God, worshipped Baals and Astartes and other idols on mountains and hills and under shady trees, and built temples there, constructing temples for the gods.

817
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:34,053
And Judah multiplied fortified cities.

818
02:16:34,053 --> 02:16:39,185
By the name Judah, two tribes are understood, namely Judah and Benjamin, along with the priestly tribe.

819
02:16:39,185 --> 02:16:48,700
When they saw that Israel had turned away from the love of God, and their sins were visited upon them, they did not turn to the Lord but built fortified cities for themselves to protect them.

820
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:57,618
But it did them no good because, as the history of the Kings tells, in the fortieth year of Hezekiah, Sennacherib came up and destroyed all the fortified cities and captured them.

821
02:16:57,618 --> 02:17:02,152
Hence, it is added: And I will send fire on their cities, and it shall devour their houses.

822
02:17:02,152 --> 02:17:07,433
Fire indeed is called Sennacherib, who destroyed both public and private houses and burned them with fire.

823
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:16,730
If we relate these things to heretics, just like other matters, both the sins forgiven in their baptism and the new sins they committed after baptism are counted against them.

824
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:23,828
They are punished for returning to Egypt, which symbolizes the darkness of unbelief, from which they had departed through the confession of Christ.

825
02:17:23,828 --> 02:17:36,382
By forgetting their God and creating various shrines—meaning doctrines of falsehood—Judas, a churchman, through his evil deeds or perverse interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, builds fortified cities for himself, not with the help of God, but through deceit.

826
02:17:36,382 --> 02:17:44,543
While misunderstanding the Scriptures, he tries to confirm his errors with divine testimonies, which the Lord will burn with the fire of His Spirit and bring to nothing.

827
02:17:44,688 --> 02:17:46,031
Chapter Nine

828
02:17:46,031 --> 02:17:50,481
Do not rejoice, Israel, do not exult like other nations, because you have strayed from your God.

829
02:17:50,481 --> 02:17:54,468
Nations that do not know God and worship various demonic idols rejoice in such things.

830
02:17:54,468 --> 02:18:01,281
Seeing this, the Israelites also began to rejoice in the worship of their gods, thinking they were like other nations and enjoying peace like them.

831
02:18:01,281 --> 02:18:05,546
Therefore, it is said to them: Do not rejoice, Israel, because you have turned away from me.

832
02:18:05,546 --> 02:18:10,691
You will not have peace for long as you think; instead, you will be taken captive to be punished for your sins.

833
02:18:10,691 --> 02:18:17,134
You wanted to pay me the tribute of servitude, but you became like people who do not know me, who also rejoice and celebrate in their gods.

834
02:18:17,134 --> 02:18:25,755
So do not rejoice, because you have strayed from your God, and do not think you are like other nations, because it is different to be ignorant of God and different to turn away from God.

835
02:18:25,755 --> 02:18:29,509
A servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten severely.

836
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:32,337
You loved reward more than all the threshing floors of wheat.

837
02:18:32,337 --> 02:18:42,534
By threshing floors and wheat, we understand the abundance of all things that the same people enjoyed, all of which they thought were given to them as a reward because they had abandoned God and started worshiping idols.

838
02:18:42,534 --> 02:18:59,870
For everything they received from God, they attributed to idols, which is why it is threatened that all these things will be taken away from them by God's just judgment, with the following being added:
The threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them, meaning I will send them famine so that no wheat will be found in the threshing floors and no wine in the presses.

839
02:18:59,870 --> 02:19:06,081
This is known to have happened in the times of Elijah and Elisha when, driven by hunger, mothers fed on the corpses of their children.

840
02:19:06,081 --> 02:19:11,690
And the wine will deceive them, meaning it will fail, and there will be none in the vineyards or presses as they thought.

841
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:25,317
It is also said to heretics not to rejoice, who think they are like other nations when they depart from the unity of the Church, because those who sinned without the law will perish without the law, and those who turned away from the true faith after knowing God will be punished more severely.

842
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:32,252
Those who have an abundance of worldly goods, with barns and wine presses—that is, the body and blood of Christ—are not satisfied.

843
02:19:32,252 --> 02:19:37,221
Because while they eat unworthily, they prepare for themselves everlasting sorrow and eternal torment.

844
02:19:37,221 --> 02:19:39,072
They will not live in the Lord’s land.

845
02:19:39,072 --> 02:19:48,132
Not only will they suffer from hunger in the land they received from the Lord, but they will also be taken into captivity, unable to live in the land they have defiled with their crimes.

846
02:19:48,132 --> 02:19:49,593
Ephraim has returned to Egypt.

847
02:19:49,593 --> 02:19:54,952
This can be understood as either returning in their hearts or, as mentioned earlier, by worshiping their gods.

848
02:19:54,952 --> 02:19:56,754
In Assyria, they eat what is defiled.

849
02:19:56,754 --> 02:20:03,233
Just as they ate food sacrificed to idols in their own land, when taken into captivity, they eat the sacrifices of demons in Assyria.

850
02:20:03,233 --> 02:20:05,230
What was offered to idols became defiled.

851
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:09,078
They will not pour wine to the Lord, but to demons, and it will not please Him.

852
02:20:09,078 --> 02:20:13,998
For they could not pour wine to the Lord in Chaldea, as they did not have a temple or altar for this.

853
02:20:13,998 --> 02:20:16,336
Their sacrifices are like the bread of mourners.

854
02:20:16,336 --> 02:20:17,846
All who eat it will be defiled.

855
02:20:17,846 --> 02:20:23,838
Among the Jews, when a sacrifice was offered for the dead, whoever ate from it became unclean, as did the sacrifice itself.

856
02:20:23,838 --> 02:20:29,635
The sacrifice is called the bread of mourners because it was offered for the dead, whose relatives mourned their death.

857
02:20:29,635 --> 02:20:33,434
Another way: It was customary among the Jews to mourn the dead for seven days.

858
02:20:33,434 --> 02:20:37,916
During this time of lamentation, whatever was made in the house of the deceased was unclean.

859
02:20:37,916 --> 02:20:41,131
Anyone who ate from that house or touched anything became unclean.

860
02:20:41,131 --> 02:20:43,664
Therefore, they ate elsewhere until the seventh day.

861
02:20:43,664 --> 02:20:47,561
On the first day, they mourned the dead, who were still lying in the same house.

862
02:20:47,561 --> 02:20:52,383
After the burial, the bier was placed in the middle, and they lamented as if the dead were present.

863
02:20:52,383 --> 02:20:56,865
According to this custom, the prophet says: Their sacrifices are like the bread of mourners.

864
02:20:57,888 --> 02:21:13,473
The meaning here is: Just as the things in a dead person's house were considered unclean for seven days during mourning, and anyone who ate or drank there became unclean, so too are the sacrifices of those who offer them to idols unclean, including both the sacrifices themselves and those who offer or consume them.

865
02:21:13,473 --> 02:21:20,921
Their bread is prepared for their own souls, meaning they offer bread and other items to idols to satisfy themselves and find joy in this present life.

866
02:21:20,921 --> 02:22:42,549
Here, "soul" refers to the present life, as it often does in divine scripture, as in He who loves his life will lose it.
They will not enter the house of the Lord because their offerings are not to the Lord, but to demons. "Bread" is used to mean all food and sacrifice. It's easy to understand this about heretics, who do not dwell in the house of the Lord, meaning the Church of the faithful, often called "earth" because of the firmness of faith. Hence, John says: They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us.
They will return to Egypt, imitating the works of the unfaithful. They eat polluted things among the Assyrians, satisfying their desires in the company of demons, and do not offer wine to the Lord because they are not spiritually joyful in Him. Thus, they will not please Him, and whatever they do will be considered unclean.
They will not be able to enter the house of the Lord, because everything they do will turn into mourning. They may do good works, like preaching words, which are called bread, to give to their listeners, but they do so for present joy, deceiving and stripping the homes of widows. This defiles those who eat, as those who accept the doctrine of heretics become unclean. The assemblies of heretics are not houses of God but are called dens of thieves.
What will you do on the day of the solemn feast, on the day of the Lord's festival? We should understand the day of the Lord's solemn feast or festival to mean the time of captivity and misery when He avenges His enemies and foes. Although all days belong to the Lord, that day is specifically said to be His, as it is compelled to render vengeance.

867
02:22:42,648 --> 02:22:52,036
When the day of captivity comes, he says, and the most savage enemy advances, what celebration is there for me to enjoy, because it avenges me of my enemies and puts an end to the injury?

868
02:22:52,036 --> 02:22:52,890
What will you do?

869
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:53,241
Answer.

870
02:22:53,241 --> 02:22:58,362
With them remaining silent, he answers himself, or rather, he sees with divine eyes what they will do.

871
02:22:58,362 --> 02:23:01,525
Hence it is added: Behold, they have departed from devastation.

872
02:23:01,525 --> 02:23:06,546
In this place, the past is used instead of the future, following the usual manner of Holy Scripture.

873
02:23:06,546 --> 02:23:18,294
They have departed, namely, for what is to be departing, because with the Assyrians and Chaldeans pressing down with misery and devastation, and wishing to bind the captives, they will flee to Egypt to escape the hands of the enemies.

874
02:23:18,294 --> 02:23:21,859
Hence it is also added: Egypt will gather them, Memphis will bury them.

875
02:23:21,859 --> 02:23:33,757
This refers to the remaining two tribes who killed Gedaliah with Jeremiah against the Lord's command, fleeing the Chaldeans and entering Egypt, where they were later killed by Nebuchadnezzar, as the book of the prophet himself testifies.

876
02:23:33,757 --> 02:23:39,029
Memphis, whose inhabitants buried the Jews killed there, was the capital city of Egypt before Alexandria.

877
02:23:39,029 --> 02:23:42,644
Their desirable silver, nettles will inherit, and thorns in their tents.

878
02:23:42,644 --> 02:23:49,221
These words signify long-lasting desolation, because where once there were beautiful houses, now thorns and nettles have sprung up.

879
02:23:49,221 --> 02:23:56,551
For by that silver is understood what is bought with silver, namely villages and fields, which long-lasting desolation has turned into wilderness.

880
02:23:56,551 --> 02:24:04,584
It is also said to heretics: When the day of the Lord's feast comes, that is, the day of judgment, when he will give life back to his friends, what will you do?

881
02:24:04,584 --> 02:24:13,973
Behold, you have been devastated by enemies, that is, demons, who have stripped you of all virtues, you have imitated the works of the unbelievers, and you have become like other nations.

882
02:24:13,973 --> 02:24:25,118
Therefore, Memphis will bury you there, which is interpreted as from the mouth, because according to the judgments and blasphemies of your mouth you will be condemned, and you will feel in punishments what you have spoken.

883
02:24:25,872 --> 02:24:31,874
Then the desirable things, like silver and the brilliance of eloquence and false teachings, will be taken over by a nettle.

884
02:24:31,874 --> 02:24:34,510
Perpetual fire will consume it, burning you eternally.

885
02:24:34,510 --> 02:24:39,488
It will be a thorn in your tents, symbolizing the conscience of your sins and your former way of life.

886
02:24:39,488 --> 02:24:40,854
Such cares will torment you.

887
02:24:40,854 --> 02:24:44,124
The days of visitation have come, the days of retribution are here.

888
02:24:44,124 --> 02:24:46,906
In this context, visitation means affliction and torment.

889
02:24:46,906 --> 02:24:50,859
Elsewhere, it is used positively, as in: The sunrise from on high has visited us.

890
02:24:50,859 --> 02:24:56,618
The days of visitation have come, as he said earlier: What will you do on the solemn day and the festival of the Lord?

891
02:24:56,618 --> 02:25:00,863
The days of retribution have come, so you will receive according to what you have done.

892
02:25:00,863 --> 02:25:04,182
Know, Israel, that the prophet is foolish, the spiritual man is mad.

893
02:25:04,182 --> 02:25:07,403
The people of Israel used to call the true prophets of God madmen.

894
02:25:07,403 --> 02:25:11,698
We read that the princes in Ramoth-Gilead said to Jehu: What did this madman say to you?

895
02:25:11,698 --> 02:25:14,138
And he replied: You know the man and what he said.

896
02:25:14,138 --> 02:25:16,773
So it is said: O Israel, now recognize your own words.

897
02:25:16,773 --> 02:25:21,702
You called the prophet who spoke the truth to you and prophesied by the Holy Spirit, foolish and mad.

898
02:25:21,702 --> 02:25:27,559
Know, therefore, that you are foolish, without understanding, and that the prophet you called mad was speaking my words.

899
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:32,634
You thought you were a spiritual man and believed that seeing through the Holy Spirit would benefit you.

900
02:25:32,634 --> 02:25:39,418
Alternatively: Know, Israel, that the prophet is foolish because you promised yourself peace, and it did not come as you falsely estimated.

901
02:25:39,418 --> 02:25:42,346
Know also that you are a mad prophet, who despised my words.

902
02:25:42,346 --> 02:25:47,178
You thought you were a spiritual man and believed that seeing through the spirit would benefit you.

903
02:25:47,178 --> 02:25:50,692
Because of your many sins and much madness, you lost your understanding.

904
02:25:50,692 --> 02:25:59,623
You did not foresee the adversities coming to you, nor did you listen to those taught by the Holy Spirit who preached these things to you, whom you additionally called mad and insane.

905
02:26:00,648 --> 02:26:03,149
The day of vengeance will also come for the wicked.

906
02:26:03,149 --> 02:26:07,661
When the Lord comes for judgment, they will face punishment and be repaid for their actions.

907
02:26:07,661 --> 02:26:14,429
While they lived, they claimed to be Israelites, meaning people who see God—but they were not, failing to recognize their own foolishness.

908
02:26:14,429 --> 02:26:21,491
They said that the Son of God was a creation, denied the Holy Spirit, and asserted that one God is good and another is the creator of the world.

909
02:26:21,491 --> 02:26:24,630
Their madness is manifold because their iniquities are numerous.

910
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:26,542
The watchman of Ephraim is with my God.

911
02:26:26,542 --> 02:26:29,240
The prophet has become a snare of ruin on all his ways.

912
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:46,650
The voice of the prophet: the watchman of Ephraim, understood as, with my God—that is, he was appointed by my God as a watchman over Jeroboam, who is understood by the name Ephraim—so that he and his followers, the kings, would be watchmen over the people of God, providing good things for them, and governing and instructing them according to God's will.

913
02:26:46,650 --> 02:26:49,544
The rulers and prophets of the people were called watchmen.

914
02:26:49,544 --> 02:26:53,762
Hence, it is also said to Ezekiel: I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.

915
02:26:53,762 --> 02:27:01,412
Thus, Jeroboam was given as a watchman and as a prophet to the people with his followers, to correct the erring people and call them back to the right path.

916
02:27:01,412 --> 02:27:08,965
But he, who should have educated them, became a snare of ruin in all his actions, because through power and wicked persuasion, he made them worship idols.

917
02:27:08,965 --> 02:27:13,624
He, who should have been a prophet to show the people the worship of God, taught them idolatry.

918
02:27:13,624 --> 02:27:20,441
Hence, it is added here: Madness, that is, an idol in the house of his God, that is, in Bethel, where previously the house of God had been.

919
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:22,844
There he set up the golden calf to be worshipped.

920
02:27:22,844 --> 02:27:25,297
They have deeply sinned, as in the days of Gibeah.

921
02:27:25,297 --> 02:27:33,928
Here the prophet recalls the crime of the sons of Israel, which once happened in Gibeah when they killed the wife of a Levite returning from Bethlehem with illicit intercourse.

922
02:27:33,928 --> 02:27:40,549
Thus, he says that the Israelites of his time are sunk in the abyss of impiety, surpassing the crime that was once committed in Gibeah.

923
02:27:40,549 --> 02:27:45,797
We can also take the days of Gibeah as the time when they chose Saul as king for God in the city of Gibeah.

924
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:50,354
They sinned by abandoning God and choosing a human king to rule over them.

925
02:27:50,354 --> 02:27:53,928
They chose Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, as their king against God's will.

926
02:27:53,928 --> 02:27:57,056
They turned away from God by worshiping the calves he had made.

927
02:27:57,056 --> 02:28:03,411
He will remember their iniquities, those they thought were forgotten, and he will visit their sins through captivity unto death.

928
02:28:03,411 --> 02:28:08,575
God sometimes does not allow forgetfulness but is said to remember when he renders vengeance to sinners.

929
02:28:08,575 --> 02:28:12,993
These things can also apply to those placed over the Church, such as bishops and priests.

930
02:28:12,993 --> 02:28:16,717
By teaching perverse doctrine, they became a snare of perdition for others.

931
02:28:16,717 --> 02:28:20,689
Like paths in the desert, I found Israel, like the first fruits of the fig tree.

932
02:28:20,689 --> 02:28:27,342
When all nations were deserted by God, whose knowledge they did not have, I found the people of Israel, like a path in the wilderness.

933
02:28:27,342 --> 02:28:32,208
Just as eagerly as new fruits are eaten, so I chose them, leaving all other nations in the desert.

934
02:28:32,208 --> 02:28:37,470
He adds, like the first fruits of the fig tree, meaning those which are delightful and gathered with love.

935
02:28:37,470 --> 02:28:39,059
On its top, I saw their fathers.

936
02:28:39,059 --> 02:28:47,202
This means, at the beginning of this people, by the grace of my mercy, I chose Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they pleased me, adhering to faith and good works.

937
02:28:47,202 --> 02:28:48,592
To see God is to have mercy.

938
02:28:48,592 --> 02:28:52,315
But they entered into Baal-Peor, the idol of the Moabites, and turned away.

939
02:28:52,315 --> 02:28:55,493
In their abundance, they became abominable, worthy of rejection.

940
02:28:55,493 --> 02:29:05,373
Just as they loved those things, as written in the Psalm: Let those who make them become like them, and all who trust in them, that they may not only be idolaters but also be called idols themselves.

941
02:29:06,167 --> 02:29:20,554
But to bring this back to the faithful people, in the desert of this age, when the whole world was held in sin and the nations did not know God, the Lord first found the Christian people in the apostles and apostolic men, who saw God with their minds, and He was satisfied with their sweetest fruits.

942
02:29:20,554 --> 02:29:25,637
But heretics who usurp the name of Christianity for themselves have entered into Beelphegor, serving lust.

943
02:29:25,637 --> 02:29:36,811
It is difficult, as blessed Jerome says, to find a heretic who loves chastity, although he often professes it with his mouth, because he speaks one thing with his lips, keeps another in his conscience, and fulfills another in action.

944
02:29:36,811 --> 02:29:40,839
Hence, they are abominable and have become unclean, just like the things they loved.

945
02:29:40,839 --> 02:29:42,518
Ephraim has flown away like a bird.

946
02:29:42,518 --> 02:29:47,169
This means that the people of the ten tribes quickly lost their own land and went into captivity.

947
02:29:47,169 --> 02:29:50,382
The prophet called him a bird to show the swift journey to Babylon.

948
02:29:50,382 --> 02:29:53,931
Their glory has flown away from birth, from the womb, and from conception.

949
02:29:53,931 --> 02:30:05,632
The people of the ten tribes boasted in the multitude of their children and in the multitude of their armies, and in this, they thought themselves greater than their brother Judah, because they ruled over ten tribes, while Judah ruled over two.

950
02:30:05,632 --> 02:30:14,456
Therefore, they had many children, in whom they gloried, but they were all taken captive or even killed, and their glory, that is, their boasting in their children, suddenly flew away.

951
02:30:14,456 --> 02:30:49,176
Hence, it is added: "And even if they raise their children, I will make them childless among men," meaning that if they gather a multitude of children and have the freedom to raise them, it will benefit them nothing, because they will be handed over to death, and I will make it so that they do not glory in them, because they will see them killed and taken captive by enemies.
While other nations rejoice in the offspring of their children, they will be without children.
But woe to them when I depart from them. For since they have departed from me, I will also depart from them, and then they will feel woe, that is, eternal damnation, when they have lost all my help.
Ephraim, as I saw, was like Tyre, founded in beauty.

952
02:30:49,655 --> 02:30:53,522
Tyrus was a noble city, rich in many ways, located in the middle of the sea.

953
02:30:53,522 --> 02:30:59,932
It was known as an emporium because all manner of wealth for trade could be found there, and it was filled with many citizens.

954
02:30:59,932 --> 02:31:08,377
Therefore, Ephraim, representing the ten tribes, proud of their wealth and population, saw themselves as similar to Tyrus, established in beauty, honor, and splendor.

955
02:31:08,377 --> 02:31:17,381
The meaning is: Ephraim was as beautiful, he says, but is now deserted, once surrounded by God's help, just like Tyrus, encircled by the sea, which defies storms and whirlwinds.

956
02:31:17,381 --> 02:31:25,063
Just as Tyrus is untroubled by the waves crashing against it, so too did Ephraim, protected by God's help, consider their adversaries as insignificant.

957
02:31:25,063 --> 02:31:27,403
Ephraim will bring his children to the killer.

958
02:31:27,403 --> 02:31:38,697
Let us understand the killer to be Hazael, the king of Syria, who besieged Samaria for a long time until hunger forced them to surrender, believing it better to die quickly by the sword than to suffer prolonged starvation.

959
02:31:38,697 --> 02:31:48,058
Tropologically, heretics are understood as Ephraim, who, like the unstable and wanton, depart from the Church and boast of the multitude of followers they gain through false teachings.

960
02:31:48,058 --> 02:31:54,111
To them, the Lord threatens that even if they are nurtured, they will be punished because they are born of fornication.

961
02:31:54,111 --> 02:31:59,148
Thus, the fathers are left childless, while the disciples perish along with their corrupt teachers.

962
02:31:59,148 --> 02:32:01,742
As it is said: Woe to them when I depart from them.

963
02:32:01,742 --> 02:32:07,440
He also reminds us what Ephraim was like when he says he was in the Church amidst the temptations of this world.

964
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:15,580
Just as Tyrus, struck by sea waves but enduring adversity because of its foundation in Christ, upon which a house cannot be overthrown, Ephraim once stood firm.

965
02:32:15,580 --> 02:32:20,972
But now, he brings his children to the killer, that is, to the devil, who eternally destroys wicked souls.

966
02:32:20,972 --> 02:32:24,991
And he aptly says, he brings them out, meaning he removes them from the Church.

967
02:32:25,703 --> 02:32:35,022
Morally, we can say that the sons of Ephraim represent the worst thoughts and doctrines contrary to the truth, all of which the Lord destroys, not allowing sinners to have such offspring.

968
02:32:35,022 --> 02:32:39,556
Leaving them eternally with their depraved doctrines and wicked thoughts, He punishes them.

969
02:32:39,556 --> 02:32:42,695
Hence, it is said:
On that day, all their thoughts will perish.

970
02:32:42,695 --> 02:32:43,493
Give them, Lord.

971
02:32:43,493 --> 02:32:44,689
What will You give them?

972
02:32:44,689 --> 02:32:47,180
Give them a womb without children and dry breasts.

973
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:55,153
So that we do not misuse what God has given for blessings and turn the things given by Him into their opposite, it is necessary that they be taken away from us.

974
02:32:55,153 --> 02:33:04,272
Indeed, since we have been given a tongue to praise God and speak good things, if anyone abuses it for blasphemy, the Psalmist prays against them: Let deceitful lips be silenced, etc.

975
02:33:04,272 --> 02:33:19,320
Because Ephraim gloried in the womb, in conception, and childbirth, and in the multitude of people, for which he swelled with pride when he should rather have humbled himself and given thanks to God, who had multiplied them, the prophet speaks to the Lord, saying:
Give them, Lord, and answers himself.

976
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:20,516
What will You give them?

977
02:33:20,516 --> 02:33:30,831
And immediately, by cursing and provoking God against them, he adds: Give them a sterile womb and dry breasts, so that they do not have reasons for pride, and in what they usually boast, they are confounded.

978
02:33:30,831 --> 02:33:42,192
For their pride was in the multitude of children, thus he says: Give them a sterile womb, so they do not generate children, and give them dry breasts, so that even if they do give birth, they do not have the means to nurse them.

979
02:33:42,192 --> 02:33:45,481
All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I began to hate them.

980
02:33:45,481 --> 02:33:49,667
In Gilgal, Saul was anointed king, with Samuel announcing God's wrath to the people.

981
02:33:49,667 --> 02:33:54,799
There (he says) I began to hate them because by asking for a human king, they departed from My command.

982
02:33:54,799 --> 02:34:06,908
Alternatively, we read in the book of Joshua that in Gilgal, the people of Israel were circumcised a second time, where later, under the guise of religion, they first began to worship idols, in whose worship they committed all sorts of crimes.

983
02:34:07,655 --> 02:35:48,863
True, because "Galgal" means "revelation" or "rolling," it is rightly said that the wickedness of heretics is in Galgal, as their deeds must be revealed, and they themselves are to be cast down to hell. They are truly deserving of hatred because they speak lies against God. Because of the wickedness of their inventions, that is, their idolatry, which they maliciously created against me, I will cast them out of my house, that is, from Bethel, which is called the house of God. Or we can also understand the house of the Lord to mean heaven, from which they were cast out because, failing in the body, they also perish eternally in spirit. I will no longer love them. It is clear that the Lord did not add to their love, so they remain in captivity to this day. All their leaders are retreating, you might understand. By leaders here, we should understand the kings of the ten tribes, who all turned away from God through idolatry, and none of them turned to God with their whole heart. We can relate all these things to the times of Christ and understand them about the two tribes that were cast out of the house of God at his coming, so that they would not be saved, so that Israel, that is, the Christian people, would be saved. Hence, in the Gospel, we read that the Lord made a whip of cords and drove them out of the temple because they had made his Father's house a house of trade. Ephraim was struck by God, who handed them over to enemies, their root dried up, and they will produce no fruit. He takes a metaphor from a tree, whose roots, if dried up, will not bear fruit; and if it produces a little, it will immediately wither in the flower. But what root of the Israelites should we understand, if not the good fathers from whom they took their origin in the flesh? And yet, because they did not want to keep their faith and imitate their examples, their root dried up because they could not help them to free them from imminent evil. Or certainly, we should understand the root as the Almighty God, in whom they were founded, who created, protected, and made them grow like all people.

984
02:35:48,863 --> 02:35:52,497
The root has dried up in them because it no longer protects or defends them.

985
02:35:52,497 --> 02:35:57,470
Therefore, it is said: They will not bear fruit, meaning they won't have children or produce good works.

986
02:35:57,470 --> 02:36:01,200
And if they do have children, I will kill the beloved offspring of their womb.

987
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:07,559
That is, if they happen to have children against my will, it will not benefit them because I will kill the children they love dearly.

988
02:36:07,559 --> 02:36:11,432
As it is mentioned above: And if they raise children, I will make them childless.

989
02:36:11,432 --> 02:36:16,166
My God will reject them because they did not listen to Him, and they will wander among the nations.

990
02:36:16,166 --> 02:36:22,478
They will follow various cultures in different places because they did not want to remain steadfast in worshipping the one true God.

991
02:36:22,478 --> 02:36:27,929
This generally applies to all the Jews, whose leaders strayed from the Lord, leading the people to seek His death.

992
02:36:27,929 --> 02:36:30,558
He cast them out of His house and no longer loves them.

993
02:36:30,558 --> 02:36:37,922
Their root has been struck and dried up because they lost the understanding of the heart, and they do not comprehend the Holy Scripture with a sound mind.

994
02:36:37,922 --> 02:36:40,408
Therefore, they do not bear the fruit of good deeds.

995
02:36:40,408 --> 02:36:50,115
And if they do, meaning if they are seen meditating on the Holy Scripture and the law, and if they bring forth some knowledge and teaching as beloved children, they will be cut down by the opposing Lord.

996
02:36:50,115 --> 02:36:58,530
For God rejected them, the God of all prophets, because they did not listen to Him, and they were wandering among the nations, having no altar, no temple, no city of their own.

997
02:36:58,530 --> 02:37:02,786
Thus, David also says in the psalm: Do not kill them lest my people forget; scatter them.

998
02:37:03,407 --> 02:37:04,751
Chapter Ten

999
02:37:04,751 --> 02:37:08,617
Israel was a lush vine, symbolizing the saints, when it thrived in good works.

1000
02:37:08,617 --> 02:37:12,283
Hence it's said: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel.

1001
02:37:12,283 --> 02:37:13,423
The fruit was abundant.

1002
02:37:13,423 --> 02:37:19,369
With good shoots and fruitful branches, it produced many clusters, and the grapes' fertility matched the branches' size.

1003
02:37:19,369 --> 02:37:25,216
According to the multitude of people, it abounded in good works, through the patriarchs, prophets, and other good men.

1004
02:37:25,216 --> 02:37:33,393
Another translation says: Israel is a watery vine, which we understand negatively, because a watery vine, if not pruned by the vinedresser, grows entirely in leaves.

1005
02:37:33,393 --> 02:37:39,933
The moisture that should turn into wine is wasted on the vain ambition of leaves and foliage, making such a vine harmful to farmers.

1006
02:37:39,933 --> 02:37:47,564
Israel was like this, growing in numbers but not yielding fruit for the farmer, God, because when it should have produced grapes, it produced wild grapes.

1007
02:37:47,564 --> 02:37:50,290
It is written: The vineyard of Sodom is their vineyard.

1008
02:37:50,290 --> 02:37:53,560
For they focused not on good works, but on an abundance of leaves.

1009
02:37:53,560 --> 02:37:57,227
According to the multitude of its fruits, it multiplied altars for itself.

1010
02:37:57,227 --> 02:38:06,592
As there were many people, they had many altars: what was once abundant in good works later turned this abundance into an offense, so the more people there were, the more altars they built.

1011
02:38:06,592 --> 02:38:10,903
Hence it's added, According to the fertility of their land, they flourished with idols.

1012
02:38:10,903 --> 02:38:20,962
Since their land was the most fertile, they made more idols there than all other nations, images of dead men or animals, to the extent that the abundance of the land was surpassed by the excess of idols.

1013
02:38:20,962 --> 02:38:26,909
Similarly, heretics, when planted in the Church, were called the vineyard of the Lord and brought forth abundant fruits.

1014
02:38:26,909 --> 02:38:32,558
But later, departing from the good altar, that is, from the unity of faith, they built more altars of their error.

1015
02:38:32,558 --> 02:38:39,743
According to the fertility of their land, that is, the sharpness of their mind and the force of their burning genius, they flourished with idols.

1016
02:38:40,535 --> 02:38:45,661
From ancient times, kings and nations worshipped golden calves, leading to their downfall and captivity.

1017
02:38:45,661 --> 02:38:52,461
The last king of the ten tribes was Hoshea, who, although he did evil in the sight of the Lord, was not as wicked as the kings before him.

1018
02:38:52,461 --> 02:38:56,601
He allowed the people, if they wished, to go to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem.

1019
02:38:56,601 --> 02:38:58,868
Despite this permission, they chose not to go.

1020
02:38:58,868 --> 02:39:07,985
In the ninth year of Hoshea's reign, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, captured the people of Israel, taking them to Assyria and settling them by the river Gozan in the cities of the Medes.

1021
02:39:07,985 --> 02:39:14,786
One might wonder why the people were not captured under the worst kings, but under Hoshea, who showed some inclination toward better ways.

1022
02:39:14,786 --> 02:40:04,264
The answer is that under the previous kings, the people justified their actions by saying, "We obey the commands of the kings and cannot resist tyranny. Therefore, we worship the calves we are compelled to adore and cannot go to the temple of the Lord." However, during Hoshea's reign, the king commanded that the calves should not be worshipped with such fervor, and allowed those who wished to go to Jerusalem and sacrifice at the temple. The people opposed this command, embodying the phrase, "Their heart is divided," meaning the will of the king and the people were not aligned. With no excuse left, they faced destruction and eternal captivity.
As soon as the people disagreed with the king, destruction and captivity followed, as the prophet Hosea predicted and mourned. He declared, "Now," referring to the present time, "He will break their idols and lay waste their altars." This refers to God Almighty, who, through the Assyrians, carried out His will, devastating and destroying their altars.

1023
02:40:04,559 --> 02:40:09,495
The opinions of heretics are divided among themselves since they have different views about Christ.

1024
02:40:09,495 --> 02:40:16,026
Therefore, they will perish; that is, they will be condemned to eternal punishment when God Almighty destroys the idols and altars.

1025
02:40:16,026 --> 02:40:19,914
These represent the various doctrines they have created from their own hearts.

1026
02:40:19,914 --> 02:40:21,061
For now, they will say.

1027
02:40:21,061 --> 02:41:48,352
"Now" refers to the ninth year when Hosea was captured by Shalmaneser, who is also known as Sennacherib, and put in prison.
After the Lord breaks the idols of Israel, they will say: "We have no king." This means they have no one to defend them because their king and all their leaders have been captured and killed.
Finally, explaining why the king and leaders have been taken from them, they add: "For we did not fear the Lord." It's as if they are saying: "We lost the human king who was supposed to defend us because we did not fear the true King, God."
And what will a king do for us? The meaning is: Even if we had a human king, what could he do for us? How could he defend us when God Almighty is angry with us, whose will no one can resist? It's like they are saying: "It would do us no good to have a king."
Speak the words of the useless vision. The prophet's voice is the speech of God mocking those who promised themselves peace and prosperity to come. Speak, he says, the words of the useless vision; that is, promise yourselves good things, and dream different dreams, which all declare that good things will happen to you, as you have done so far.
All the things that seemed good to you have turned into the opposite. Hence it is added: "And you will make a covenant, not with God, but rather with falsehood, saying: 'Peace will be with us.' And judgment will sprout like bitterness." That is, the very falsehood in which you trust will not produce the most peaceful fruits for you to be satisfied with, but rather the force of bitterness, namely, captivity and slaughter.
Over the furrows of the field, which represent your earthly hearts, from which you have produced bad fruits, according to that: "Evil thoughts come from the heart."

1028
02:41:48,551 --> 02:43:07,024
The disciples of heretics, when their lies are exposed, will say: "We have no king, that is, no teachers who previously commanded us and deceived us, making us not fear God." "And what will the king do for us now?" It's as if they're saying: "What benefit did we gain from following those who can't help us in our time of need?" They will say these things to find excuses, making it seem like they erred because of their teachers, not by themselves. Hence, the words and visions of heretics are useless.
They will make a covenant, not with God, but with the judgment of bitterness. About this judgment, the Lord says in the Gospel that some will receive greater judgment because, when the day of judgment comes, those who have sown lies in the hearts of people will reap damnation, while those who have sown in tears will reap in joy. It follows:
The inhabitants of Samaria worshipped the cows of Bethaven. Bethaven is actually Bethel, meaning the house of the idol, where Jeroboam placed the golden calf he made, mockingly calling the calves cows. It's as if to say: Israel has fallen into such misery that it worships not only calves but even cows.
The inhabitants of Samaria are understood to be all the inhabitants of the ten tribes, whose capital was the same city. Because his people mourned over him. To show that the calf in Bethel should be understood as the cows of Bethaven, it did not say: "The people mourned over them," but "over him." His people are those who worshiped the golden calf and mourned when (as we find later) it was taken as a gift to the avenging king.

1029
02:43:07,024 --> 02:43:17,348
The keepers of the temple, that is, his priests, rejoiced over him because his deceit was not discovered; they made bronze calves covered with gold and placed them in the same place, according to the Hebrews.

1030
02:43:17,348 --> 02:43:26,877
Therefore, when the people mourned in their time of need because the calves were taken by King Sennacherib of Israel, the priests rejoiced that their deceit could not be argued and discovered.

1031
02:43:26,877 --> 02:43:27,523
In his glory.

1032
02:43:27,671 --> 02:43:32,830
The glory of the people is called the calf itself, in which they gloried because they had golden calves.

1033
02:43:32,830 --> 02:43:34,665
But this glory will depart from them.

1034
02:43:34,665 --> 02:43:38,435
He explains why they rejoiced in their glory, which then departed from them.

1035
02:43:38,435 --> 02:43:42,552
It is added: For he himself was taken to Assyria as a tribute to the avenging king.

1036
02:43:42,552 --> 02:43:48,207
Sennacherib is the avenger because he avenged the insult to God against those who worshipped idols instead of God.

1037
02:43:48,207 --> 02:43:54,506
Note that he expresses the misery and condemnation of the people, because they even gave what they held most dear as a tribute.

1038
02:43:54,506 --> 02:43:58,474
The shame of Ephraim will seize him, and Israel will be ashamed of his own will.

1039
02:43:58,474 --> 02:44:06,956
In the book of Kings, we read that Menahem, king of Israel, sent Pul, king of Assyria, one thousand talents of silver, so that his hand would be with him, to provide help.

1040
02:44:06,956 --> 02:44:10,279
Some believe that even the calves, thought to be golden, were sent.

1041
02:44:10,279 --> 02:44:20,150
When the fraud of the gilded calves was discovered, it was reported to the king of Israel, and what they hoped would appease him, instead offended him, inciting those to whom they had sent the gifts.

1042
02:44:20,150 --> 02:44:25,160
They thought this was done not by the theft of the priests but by the deceit and counsel of the king.

1043
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:29,326
Knowing the calves were bronze, he was very angry, thinking they wanted to mock him.

1044
02:44:29,326 --> 02:44:31,509
For this reason, he came and conquered them.

1045
02:44:31,509 --> 02:44:39,445
Therefore, it is said: The shame of Ephraim will seize him, and Israel will be ashamed, that is, will blush, for his own will, in seeking help from a foreigner.

1046
02:44:39,445 --> 02:44:42,917
Samaria made its king pass away like foam on the surface of the water.

1047
02:44:42,917 --> 02:44:47,530
Just as foam and bubbles quickly dissolve, so the kingdom of the ten tribes will quickly end.

1048
02:44:47,530 --> 02:44:57,748
It was said that Hoshea wanted and commanded them to return to the temple of the Lord, but because the inhabitants did not listen to him, they made him perish, like foam on the water during rain or drought.

1049
02:44:57,748 --> 02:45:00,228
And the high places of the idol will be destroyed.

1050
02:45:00,228 --> 02:45:04,891
As often stated in the books of Kings: Nevertheless, the people sacrificed on the high places.

1051
02:45:05,783 --> 02:46:42,599
But what these high places of the idol are is revealed when it is added: "The sin of Israel," you understand, were these same high places. They sinned greatly when they worshipped idols on mountains, in groves, and other pleasant places, abandoning the temple of God.
Thorns and thistles will grow over their altars. It is a sign of utter desolation when thorns and thistles have overtaken their tents due to long abandonment. And they will say to the mountains: "Fall on us," and to the hills: "Cover us." This can refer not only to the captivity of the ten tribes but also to the times of the Romans and the entire Jewish people.
This is also manifested by the Lord, who said in the Gospel: "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves." On judgment day, they will say to the saints, who, because of the heights of their virtues, are called mountains: "Fall on us," meaning, cover our wrongdoings with your prayers. Literally, it signifies the excessive terror of sinners who, with the impending judgment day, would wish to escape God's presence and perish temporarily rather than eternally.
From the days of Gibeah, Israel has sinned. From the day when Benjamin in the city of Gibeah disgracefully and cruelly killed the Levite's wife through illicit intercourse, Israel has sinned against me. Or even from the day when, rejecting God so that He would not rule over them, they chose Saul as king. They persisted in those sins.
The battle in Gibeah will not overtake them against the children of iniquity, meaning they did not perish in the battle of Gibeah because they rose up against the children of iniquity, that is, against Benjamin, and destroyed it. But because they avenged a man and did not avenge the injury to God, allowing the idol to remain in the house of Micah.
They should have first exercised God's vengeance by overturning Micah and his house and reducing the idol to nothing, and then avenged the injury to the Levite.

1052
02:46:42,599 --> 02:46:46,723
They avenged a man, not God, and did this more for the sake of the man than for God.

1053
02:46:46,723 --> 02:46:50,454
Furthermore, they did not want to vindicate the sacrilege against their God.

1054
02:46:50,454 --> 02:46:52,909
Because of this, a battle will catch up with them.

1055
02:46:52,909 --> 02:46:58,457
According to my desire, I will punish them; that is, I will hand them over to their enemies according to my will.

1056
02:46:58,457 --> 02:47:04,102
People will gather against them, namely the multitudes of the Assyrians, when they are punished for their two sins.

1057
02:47:04,102 --> 02:47:08,717
We can understand these two sins as follows: they avenged a man, neglecting the injury to God.

1058
02:47:08,717 --> 02:47:14,559
Or, they committed two sins because they first sinned with the idols of Micah and secondly with the calves of Jeroboam.

1059
02:47:14,559 --> 02:47:19,812
They certainly committed two sins, referring to the two calves of Samaria: one in Dan, the other in Bethel.

1060
02:47:19,812 --> 02:47:23,101
Or, they committed two sins by abandoning God and worshiping idols.

1061
02:47:23,101 --> 02:48:25,646
Regarding these two sins, Jeremiah says: "They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug for themselves cisterns that cannot hold water." These two sins violate two commandments of the Decalogue, which say: "I am the Lord your God" and "You shall have no other gods before me."
Ephraim is like a trained heifer that loves to thresh. This refers to a custom in the promised land where heifers, along with other animals, were used to thresh grains. When they are exhausted by hard labor, they usually leave the threshing floor, but they love the threshing floor because they eat the grains there. Hence the saying: "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." They voluntarily return to the threshing floor.
So, Ephraim is like a cow or heifer because it has learned to thresh and has also begun to love what it was trained to do by annual custom, even though threshing is laborious. Similarly, the Israelite people, although frequently afflicted and suffering many adversities because of idolatry, nevertheless, desiring to follow their own wills and the gluttony of their belly, voluntarily returned to idols. Morally, we can refer this to those who, from a secular habit, convert to monastic religion and then voluntarily return to earthly labor.

1062
02:48:26,087 --> 02:48:32,748
Even when wearied by long periods of heat and cold, they willingly endure all these hardships, just as they had experienced before.

1063
02:48:32,748 --> 02:48:38,951
I overlooked the beauty of his neck, which symbolizes his pride and his refusal to accept my yoke due to his stubbornness.

1064
02:48:38,951 --> 02:50:00,762
In the context of God, "passing over" always signifies plagues and adversities. Remember, the destroyer also passed through Egypt.
The meaning is: Because Ephraim refuses to accept the yoke of the law, I passed over the beauty of his neck and subdued his pride by placing the yoke on him. Thus, it is said: I will go up against Ephraim, meaning I will confront him, so that the rebellious and stubborn cow learns to work, which it refuses to do.
Alternatively, we can see the yoke as the condemnations of all nations, which the Lord promises to remove so that they might return to Him. Judah will plow, and Jacob will break up the furrows. By Judah, we mean the two tribes who, upon seeing Israel taken captive by enemies, began to cultivate their hearts and discipline themselves in the worship of God.
By Jacob, we mean those remaining from the ten tribes who were called to the true worship of religion. They removed all hardness of heart and began producing the fruits of good works. It is written in Isaiah that Hezekiah sent them books and brought them to Jerusalem to worship God in His temple, repenting from idol worship.
In an anagogical sense, this can mean that Ephraim, who was taught the law of God to meditate on it day and night, began to reject the yoke of the law and contend against church leaders, leading listeners astray.
Hence, the Lord, seeing the raised neck and lofty ambitions, will either press it with the yoke or trample it under His feet, confronting it so that he may know he has God. Judah, representing the faithful, will continue to plow the land, persevering in their work.

1065
02:50:00,863 --> 02:51:49,463
Jacob, whose name means "supplanter," will break the furrows of vices. This means he will crush the hard clods of history and letters into pieces and spiritually divide them so they can yield spiritual fruits.
Sow for yourselves righteousness in truth. This continues the metaphor started by the farmers. Ephraim is said to love threshing like a trained heifer, and he himself goes over its neck to plow Judah and break the furrows of Jacob. Now it is commanded to sow in righteousness, meaning in the observance of legal precepts, and reap in the mouth of mercy, which means in the grace of the Gospel.
Hence it is: Repent, and so on. And: Do good to those who hate you. And: Whoever strikes you on the cheek, offer him the other also. Break up your fallow ground, which means make your hearts new, saying with the Psalmist: Create in me a clean heart, O God.
Literally, fallow ground is a field that has been plowed for the first time. However, the time to seek the Lord is implied to be when He comes to teach you righteousness. This is in the time of the Lord’s incarnation and passion when all things will be openly revealed through which the faithful will be justified. Hence it is: Seek the Lord while He may be found.
He provides reasons why you should sow, why you should reap, and why you should renew joyful fallow grounds. He says the time to seek the Lord is when Christ the Savior comes, who will teach you the righteousness you now hope for in the law. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who does good.
Similarly, it is commanded to those who are separated from the Church and falsely assume the name of Christians to repent and accept both Testaments: in the Old Testament to sow righteousness, in the New Testament to reap mercy, so that they renew for themselves fallow grounds of good works and seek God, who can teach them true righteousness.
You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity. The meaning is: While I urged you to sow in righteousness and reap in the mouth of mercy so that you would make me joyful with your joyful fallow grounds, you instead plowed wickedness, meaning you devised wicked plans to depart from me.

1066
02:51:49,463 --> 02:51:53,133
The greatest injustice is to turn away from God and worship idols instead.

1067
02:51:53,133 --> 02:51:58,438
This is why you have faced captivity and death because of your sins; you have brought this upon yourselves.

1068
02:51:58,438 --> 02:52:00,868
You deserved to harvest bad crops from bad seeds.

1069
02:52:00,868 --> 02:52:03,744
You received the reward of deceit, having eaten its fruit.

1070
02:52:03,744 --> 02:52:06,917
You dreamed of good things, but adversity rightly came upon you.

1071
02:52:06,917 --> 02:52:09,991
Similarly, heretics sow impiety when they teach unjust things.

1072
02:52:09,991 --> 02:52:15,842
Therefore, they will reap injustice and eat the fruit of deceit when they are condemned for their iniquity and deceit.

1073
02:52:15,842 --> 02:52:17,974
For whatever a man sows, he will also reap.

1074
02:52:17,974 --> 02:52:25,313
Because you trusted in your own ways, in idols, and in the strength of your kings and princes instead of God, a tumult will arise among your people.

1075
02:52:25,313 --> 02:52:31,064
The sound of the Assyrian army will come upon you, and at their shouting, all your fortifications will be destroyed.

1076
02:52:31,064 --> 02:52:34,932
Those things you considered fortified and safe will be exposed to the enemies.

1077
02:52:34,932 --> 02:52:40,089
Hence, it is written in Isaiah that Sennacherib ascended and captured all the fortified cities of Judah.

1078
02:52:40,089 --> 02:52:50,402
Just as Salmana was devastated in his house, avenging Baal on the day of the battle, with the mother being struck down over her children, so Bethel has done to us because of the wickedness of your iniquities.

1079
02:52:50,402 --> 02:52:58,435
The history of the Judges reminds us that an angel appeared to Gideon and said: Go in this strength of yours, and you will deliver Israel from the hand of Midian.

1080
02:52:58,435 --> 02:53:01,807
But first, he was urged to destroy the grove and the altars of Baal.

1081
02:53:01,807 --> 02:53:07,856
For this reason, he was called Jerubbaal, because his father said: Let Baal avenge himself on him who destroyed his altar.

1082
02:53:07,856 --> 02:53:18,070
So, he went with three hundred men, carrying torches inside jars, and he killed the army of the Midianites, who had come up with all they had, taking possession of and devouring all that belonged to Israel.

1083
02:53:18,863 --> 02:53:34,954
And the meaning is: Just as Salmana, the prince of the Midianites, was destroyed—killed by the family of Gideon, who avenged Baal by destroying his altar on the day of battle, with the mother dashed to pieces over her children—so Bethel, where you placed the golden calf, will do to you because of the wickedness of your sins.

1084
02:53:34,954 --> 02:53:37,224
You will be handed over to enemies and perish.

1085
02:53:37,224 --> 02:53:48,725
And what he says: The mother dashed to pieces over her children, refers to the same story, which says that after Gideon captured Zebah and Salmana, the princes of the Midianites, he asked them: What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?

1086
02:53:48,725 --> 02:53:52,130
Salmana replied: They were like you, each one like the son of a king.

1087
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:55,240
Gideon then said: If you had spared them, I would not kill you.

1088
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:59,978
And finally, he said: Just as your sword made women childless, so your mother will be childless.

1089
02:53:59,978 --> 02:54:01,607
And he struck him and killed him.

1090
02:54:01,607 --> 02:54:10,096
So the mother was dashed to pieces over her children, because she was shattered by excessive grief from the death of her sons, or perhaps she was killed together with them.

1091
02:54:10,096 --> 02:54:18,685
It could have happened that she was there and was dashed to pieces together with them, because, as previously mentioned, they went up to the land of Israel with all they had.

1092
02:54:19,079 --> 02:54:20,663
Chapter Eleven

1093
02:54:20,663 --> 02:54:23,650
Just as the morning passes, the king of Israel passes away.

1094
02:54:23,650 --> 02:54:30,787
He conveys the same idea using different figures, as he said before: Samaria caused its king to vanish like foam on the surface of the water.

1095
02:54:30,787 --> 02:54:38,632
He illustrates it with another metaphor: just as the morning swiftly passes when the sun rises, so did the king of Israel, Hoshea, get captured by enemies.

1096
02:54:38,632 --> 02:54:42,428
Morning is the dawn, from the end of the night until the rising of the sun.

1097
02:54:42,428 --> 02:54:44,655
Because Israel was a child, and I loved him.

1098
02:54:44,655 --> 02:54:46,933
He explains the blessings God had given them.

1099
02:54:46,933 --> 02:54:53,715
He says, Israel was a child worshiping idols in Egypt, thinking like a child, and I loved him through the patriarchs and other saints.

1100
02:54:53,715 --> 02:54:57,208
And I called my son out of Egypt, which you understand through Moses.

1101
02:54:57,208 --> 02:55:02,623
For he said to Pharaoh: This is what the Lord says: Let my firstborn go so he may worship me in the desert.

1102
02:55:02,623 --> 02:55:04,395
And elsewhere, My firstborn Israel.

1103
02:55:04,395 --> 02:55:06,268
And again: I raised and exalted sons.

1104
02:55:06,268 --> 02:55:17,707
If we want to refer this to Christ, who is the Son of the Father, he called him out of Egypt when (as Matthew says) at the command of the angel, he was brought back to the land of Israel by Joseph along with the virgin mother.

1105
02:55:17,707 --> 02:55:21,554
Spiritually, however, Egypt, which is called darkness, signifies this world.

1106
02:55:21,554 --> 02:55:28,589
Therefore, God called his Son out of Egypt when, through the glory of the ascension, he was lifted up from this world and placed in heaven.

1107
02:55:28,589 --> 02:55:29,449
They called them.

1108
02:55:29,449 --> 02:55:34,562
Because Israel, although mentioned singularly, is understood plurally, like the people and the crowd.

1109
02:55:34,562 --> 02:55:44,280
It rightly moves from singular to plural: They called them, that is, all the Jews, Moses, Aaron, and the others, to follow them out of the land of Egypt, and to fulfill God's command and will.

1110
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:53,694
So they left their presence, meaning they quickly departed from their teaching, turning their backs and hardening their minds when they said to Aaron: Make us gods who will go before us.

1111
02:55:53,694 --> 02:55:56,073
For we do not know what happened to this Moses.

1112
02:55:56,073 --> 02:55:59,009
They then proceeded to shout: These are your gods, Israel.

1113
02:55:59,009 --> 02:56:01,843
They sacrificed to Baal and offered sacrifices to idols.

1114
02:56:02,855 --> 02:56:08,626
It wasn't enough for them to scorn those who called upon them; they also had to sacrifice to Baal during Ahab's time.

1115
02:56:08,626 --> 02:56:13,755
Ahab received the idol from the Sidonians because he married Jezebel, the daughter of the Sidonian king.

1116
02:56:13,755 --> 02:56:16,468
Baal, also known as Beelphegor, was worshipped by them.

1117
02:56:16,468 --> 02:56:23,175
They sacrificed to idols not only in Dan and Bethel but also on mountains, in groves, and other pleasant places, adoring various images.

1118
02:56:23,175 --> 02:56:28,699
It's easy to understand the heretics, whose king—be it the devil or any heresiarch—will pass away like the dawn.

1119
02:56:28,699 --> 02:56:33,483
God loved them when they were children, when they believed and were called by the Christian name.

1120
02:56:33,483 --> 02:56:36,443
He called them out of the tribulation and darkness of Egypt.

1121
02:56:36,443 --> 02:56:39,106
He called the apostles and the teachers of the Church.

1122
02:56:39,106 --> 02:56:46,751
But after being called, they turned away and worshiped Beelphegor, serving their vices and lusts, and sacrificed to the idols they had made for themselves.

1123
02:56:46,751 --> 02:56:52,422
Each heretic had their own gods, and whatever they imagined, they worshiped as if it were a carved or molten image.

1124
02:56:52,422 --> 02:56:54,297
I was like a foster father to Ephraim.

1125
02:56:54,297 --> 02:56:57,305
This shows how God loved Israel by calling them out of Egypt.

1126
02:56:57,305 --> 02:57:42,680
As stated in Deuteronomy: "The Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his little child," etc. I carried them in my arms, meaning with my strength. It's as if to say: I who was a father became a foster father, carrying my little one in my arms, protecting him in the wilderness, from the heat of the day and the darkness of the night. By day, I was a cloud; by night, a pillar of fire.
They didn't realize that I cared for them. Even when they sinned and made the head of a calf, I gave them a chance for repentance. They didn't know that I wanted to heal them, to cleanse them from their idols. I will draw them with cords of Adam, meaning with the affection of love with which I loved Adam. Just as I made him holy, I wanted to sanctify and purify them. Hence, it is also added: with the bonds of love, meaning with the highest affection of love. Another translation states: I will draw them with the cords of men.

1127
02:57:43,271 --> 02:57:50,281
And the meaning is: with the love with which I loved and bound to myself Abraham, Isaac, and the other saints, I will also join these to myself.

1128
02:57:50,281 --> 02:57:53,494
And I will be to them like one who lifts the yoke from their jaws.

1129
02:57:53,494 --> 02:57:58,314
That is, I will remove from them the yoke of the law, so they do not perish under its heavy burden.

1130
02:57:58,314 --> 02:58:02,987
As it says: Whoever makes an idol and whoever sacrifices to Moloch shall surely be put to death.

1131
02:58:02,987 --> 02:58:13,356
For since I desire mercy rather than vengeance, I will lift the yoke of the law so they do not succumb to its weight, or I will remove the yoke of captivity and domination of all the surrounding nations from them.

1132
02:58:13,356 --> 02:58:17,348
And I inclined to him to feed him, that is, I gave him manna in the desert to eat.

1133
02:58:17,348 --> 02:58:21,388
For when I inclined to him, it is to be understood that I made food incline to him.

1134
02:58:21,388 --> 02:58:24,796
We can also refer these words to the coming of the Lord's incarnation.

1135
02:58:24,796 --> 02:58:30,151
In this way, I loved them and was such a gentle shepherd that I myself carried the sick sheep on my shoulders.

1136
02:58:30,151 --> 02:58:37,842
But they did not understand that I would heal them by my suffering, and because I am a lover of humanity, I would draw them to believe with the bonds of love.

1137
02:58:37,842 --> 02:58:40,617
As it says: No one comes to the Father except through me.

1138
02:58:40,617 --> 02:58:49,623
And they thought my yoke to be the heaviest, and I inclined to them, leaving the kingdoms of heaven to dwell with them, taking on the form of a man; and I gave them the food of my body.

1139
02:58:49,623 --> 02:58:51,619
He shall not return to the land of Egypt.

1140
02:58:51,619 --> 02:58:58,045
The people of Israel, under Menahem, the king of the ten tribes, wanted to flee to Egypt from the face of Sennacherib, seeking help.

1141
02:58:58,045 --> 02:59:13,428
Against this the Lord speaks here, saying: He shall not return to the land of Egypt so that they may have Pharaoh as their king; but Assyria will be his king, that is, Sennacherib, and afterward he will be his king because he will be taken captive and led into captivity, and will rule over him by right of conquest.

1142
02:59:13,428 --> 02:59:21,363
The reason why they suffer such things is revealed when it is added: because they did not want to turn back through repentance, trusting in man rather than in God.

1143
02:59:21,363 --> 02:59:24,624
The sword began in his cities, and it will consume his chosen ones.

1144
02:59:24,624 --> 02:59:32,316
See how great the weight of their miseries is, so that not fields, or possessions, or farms are devastated, but the enemy enters into the midst of the cities.

1145
02:59:33,143 --> 02:59:42,594
The sword has begun (he says), in his cities — you understand, to kill — and it will consume his chosen ones, namely the leaders and the strongest of his army, and it will eat their heads.

1146
02:59:42,594 --> 02:59:46,716
This signifies the leaders themselves, who rule the others by right of leadership.

1147
02:59:46,716 --> 02:59:54,961
And my people will hang on my return, that is, when the time of captivity comes, and the sword has consumed all their warriors, and they cannot find any protection.

1148
02:59:54,961 --> 02:59:57,273
Then my miserable people will repent too late.

1149
02:59:57,273 --> 03:00:06,020
With the enemies devastating everything, they will hang on my return, sigh, and seek to convert, but it will not help, because once they were my people, but now they are not.

1150
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:09,740
A yoke will be placed on them at the same time, which will not be removed.

1151
03:00:09,740 --> 03:00:13,762
Even to this day, they remain slaves in the mountains of the Persians and Medes.

1152
03:00:13,762 --> 03:00:19,342
This can also refer to the times of the Romans when the Jews were condemned to a final and perpetual captivity.

1153
03:00:19,342 --> 03:00:20,900
How can I give you up, Ephraim?

1154
03:00:20,900 --> 03:00:22,408
How can I protect you, Israel?

1155
03:00:22,408 --> 03:00:24,519
that is, you are not worthy of protection.

1156
03:00:24,519 --> 03:00:27,184
Here, the Lord speaks to Israel like a loving father.

1157
03:00:27,184 --> 03:00:28,792
How (he says) can I give you up?

1158
03:00:28,792 --> 03:00:32,010
that is, how can I give you up to captivity without my own pain?

1159
03:00:32,010 --> 03:00:34,473
How can I protect you, and what can I do for you?

1160
03:00:34,473 --> 03:00:38,947
By what method can I correct you, and how can I expose you without my greatest heartache?

1161
03:00:38,947 --> 03:00:40,757
Here he speaks like a loving father.

1162
03:00:40,757 --> 03:00:41,863
How can I give you up?

1163
03:00:41,863 --> 03:00:50,911
Like Admah, you understand, I will give you up; I will make you like Zeboiim, that is, although not without pain, I will hand you over and reduce you to dust and a vast wilderness.

1164
03:00:50,911 --> 03:00:56,994
I will destroy you to ashes and embers, just as I destroyed Admah and Zeboiim, and the remaining cities of the Sodomites.

1165
03:00:56,994 --> 03:01:04,786
It should be noted that where the Lord speaks against the two tribes through the prophets, Admah and Zeboiim are not mentioned, but Sodom and Gomorrah are.

1166
03:01:04,786 --> 03:01:21,576
Hence in Isaiah, we read, "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; receive the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah." And the Lord says in the Gospel to the disciples, "It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for the city that does not receive you." And to Jerusalem, Ezekiel says: "Sodom is justified by you."

1167
03:01:22,631 --> 03:01:28,039
When he speaks of the ten tribes, not Sodom and Gomorrah, but other cities subject to them are mentioned.

1168
03:01:28,039 --> 03:01:34,786
This is because, although the ten tribes were greater in number, two of them stood out in dignity due to the temple and priesthood.

1169
03:01:34,786 --> 03:01:41,636
Therefore, these two tribes sinned more grievously than the ten, which lacked these distinctions and were far removed from Jerusalem.

1170
03:01:41,636 --> 03:01:47,353
Similarly, Sodom and Gomorrah were greater in wickedness because their evil surpassed that of the other cities.

1171
03:01:47,353 --> 03:01:52,504
The subject cities also followed in their wickedness, and therefore it will be more severe for them.

1172
03:01:52,504 --> 03:01:58,684
Likewise, it will be more severe for the two tribes, which worshipped idols in the temple of the Lord, than for the ten.

1173
03:01:58,684 --> 03:02:03,422
For a servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten with many blows.

1174
03:02:03,422 --> 03:02:13,826
Hence, ecclesiastical men, if they are guilty of the same crimes as heretics, will not suffer the torments of Admah and Zeboiim, which are lesser, but of Sodom and Gomorrah, which are of greater crimes.

1175
03:02:13,826 --> 03:02:19,388
My heart is turned within me, my repentance is disturbed, that is, my will is shown with paternal affection.

1176
03:02:19,388 --> 03:02:28,041
As soon as I spoke against you and pronounced a cruel sentence, mercy touched me, overcoming strictness, just as a father's kindness mitigates the austerity of a judge.

1177
03:02:28,041 --> 03:02:36,590
As soon as I spoke that I would make Ephraim and Israel like Admah and Zeboiim, my bowels were moved, and I regretted that I had planned to destroy my people forever.

1178
03:02:36,590 --> 03:02:45,655
Thus, the Lord speaks here: Just as if any of you were to say: I will kill you, and immediately, driven by repentance, add: My fault, because I spoke against you in such a way.

1179
03:02:45,655 --> 03:02:51,166
I will not carry out my fierce anger; that is, I will not change my mercy to destroy Ephraim if he repents.

1180
03:02:51,166 --> 03:03:00,334
Therefore, it follows, I will not turn from my mercy to cruelty to destroy Ephraim, that is, the people of the ten tribes: for I do not strike to destroy forever, but to correct.

1181
03:03:00,334 --> 03:03:03,372
Indeed, my severity is a cause for repentance and kindness.

1182
03:03:03,372 --> 03:03:05,587
For I am God and not a man, holy among you.

1183
03:03:06,359 --> 03:03:10,539
Man strikes to destroy and gets angry to take revenge; his judgment is punishment.

1184
03:03:10,539 --> 03:03:13,240
But God corrects to improve and chastises to correct.

1185
03:03:13,240 --> 03:04:46,410
When we read, "In your midst is the Holy One," it means: "If you want to repent, I will be in your midst, dwell with you, save you, and not enter the city." This specifically refers to punishment, like judges, because I am not one of those who live in the cities and follow human laws.
The Jews understand this as: "If you repent, I will not enter the city of the Gentiles, but will stay with you."
Otherwise, we often read about two cities: one started by Cain and the other by Abel. One is for the wicked, the other for the righteous. Therefore, He does not enter the city built by a murderer, constructed from wickedness, but remains forever in Abel's city.
We can relate these same ideas to heretics and the people deceived by them. It is said to the heretics that unless they repent, they will be cast out like Admah and Zeboiim, with no hope of salvation.
Again, the most merciful Father says He will change His judgment and regret saying such things, to provoke them to repentance and conversion. He says, "I will not act in my fury, I will not destroy Ephraim, as much as it is in me, as much as I desire, if he corrects his error with truth, if he loves me more than the leaders of heresy. For I am God, not a man: I will extend my hand to those who have fallen, call those who err to salvation; and because I am holy, therefore I will not enter the assemblies and cities of the heretics: I gladly receive those who come out of their cities; I will not enter their cities."
They will walk after the Lord. The voice of the prophet, as if saying: Because the mercy of the Lord is so great, that He even promises forgiveness to sinners and prosperity: they will walk after the Lord, that is, they will imitate Him when they turn to Him.
He will roar like a lion, because He will roar, and the sons of the sea will tremble.

1186
03:04:46,511 --> 03:04:49,178
The lion, when hungry, usually lets out a great roar.

1187
03:04:49,178 --> 03:04:53,053
At the sound of this, all the beasts and birds are terrified and stand still.

1188
03:04:53,053 --> 03:06:32,179
Therefore, the Lord’s roar was a threat of captivity when He said, "I will make you like Admah and like Zeboiim." About this, Amos also says, The Lord will roar from Zion, and His voice from Jerusalem. Or, His roar is understood as the terror instilled in the nations so that the captivity of the Jews would end.
His roar was also heard when, present in the flesh, He said, Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. At this voice, when the true lion roared, even the false lion, who is, according to the apostle Peter, our adversary, immediately fell silent. He also roared when He said, Then the King will say to those on His left: Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire. This roar will be perfect and clear when He comes for judgment, and not only humans but also angels will be terrified. Hence it is added, And the sons of the sea will be afraid, meaning the sons of this world, as the sea often signifies the present world.
They will fly away like a bird from Egypt and like a dove from the land of Assyria, and I will place them in their homes. The Jews still await these things to come. But since we know they have already happened, let us say that from Egypt and Assyria, that is, from the east and west, north and south, the faithful flock to the faith of Christ, imitating the simplicity and innocence of the dove. Later, they can fly away from the power of demons to be placed in their homes, that is, in the heavenly mansions, namely in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
If we want to refer this specifically to heretics, upon hearing the voice of the lion threatening the judgment of their damnation, those who were born of the bitter waters of the heretics will take wings and fly like a bird, or like a dove from the land of Assyria, that is, from demons, or from Egypt, that is, from the sorrow of tribulation. Freed from this, they may dwell in their homes, that is, in the faith of the Church.

1189
03:06:32,279 --> 03:06:37,105
Surrounded by the dealings of Ephraim and the deceit of the house of Israel, Ephraim denied me.

1190
03:06:37,105 --> 03:06:40,610
This means Jeroboam worshipped idols and did not honor me as a deity.

1191
03:06:40,610 --> 03:06:44,674
Israel also tried to deceive by making idols, as if they held some divine power.

1192
03:06:44,674 --> 03:06:47,823
But Judah stood as a witness with God and the faithful saints.

1193
03:06:47,823 --> 03:06:52,649
The Hebrews say: when the children of Israel were leaving Egypt, they found themselves trapped.

1194
03:06:52,649 --> 03:06:57,474
On one side was a very high mountain, on the other the Red Sea, and on the third side, enemies.

1195
03:06:57,474 --> 03:07:06,618
While other tribes doubted and wanted to return to Egypt, Judah—that is, the two tribes who dwelled in the temple, the law, and the prophets—stood as a witness to the Lord's words.

1196
03:07:06,618 --> 03:07:10,834
Judah kept His commandments, humbled himself, and followed in the Lord's footsteps.

1197
03:07:10,834 --> 03:07:16,574
This was with the faithful saints, or with those who crossed over at the end, imitating the works of the fathers.

1198
03:07:16,574 --> 03:07:19,012
Heretics surround the Lord with lies and denial.

1199
03:07:19,012 --> 03:07:20,485
Whatever they speak is a lie.

1200
03:07:20,485 --> 03:07:27,952
They surround Him with deceit, much like the impiety of the house of Israel, crafting their falsehoods with artful speech and speaking against God.

1201
03:07:27,952 --> 03:07:32,625
But Judah, representing the faithful, does not become proud or swollen with heretical pride.

1202
03:07:32,625 --> 03:07:36,740
Instead, he humbles himself with God and stays faithful with the choir of saints.

1203
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:41,768
He is either a faithful and strong witness, building his house upon a rock that no storm can shake.

1204
03:07:42,479 --> 03:07:43,823
Chapter Twelve

1205
03:07:43,823 --> 03:07:46,405
Ephraim feeds on the wind and chases the east wind.

1206
03:07:46,405 --> 03:07:51,568
The story tells that Menahem, king of Israel, after making peace with Assyria, sought help from Egypt.

1207
03:07:51,568 --> 03:09:26,178
This is what is meant by "Ephraim feeds on the wind," that is, he is deceived by false hope, placing his trust in man. And "chases the east wind," which means he goes to Egypt, located in the southern part of the world.
All day long he multiplies lies and destruction. At all times, he multiplies lies, such as idols, and brings calamity and affliction upon himself, preparing the downfall of his cities. Menahem, as mentioned before, made a pact with the Assyrians, sending them gifts to secure their alliance. He brought oil to Egypt. After making a pact with the Assyrians and realizing that he could not join forces with Sennacherib, but instead saw him coming against him, he sent gifts to the Pharaoh. Among these gifts, he also sent oil, which is the most distinguished and precious product in Samaria but is not found in Egypt.
Let's try to apply these same things to heretics. Ephraim feeds on the wind, meaning he pleases demons with his deeds. And chases the east wind, which is contrary to flowers and destroys all that sprouts. Therefore, the Septuagint translates it as "scorching wind." All day long, he multiplies lies, that is, false doctrine, and destruction, meaning ruin, for himself and his followers. He is not content with his own error but gathers many disciples of vanity. They also make a pact with the Assyrians, meaning they have peace with demons, whom they obey. And they bring oil to Egypt because, being in the darkness of error, they falsely claim to have the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, which they do not deserve, as they are outside the Church.
Therefore, the judgment of the Lord is with Judah. The captivity and miseries occurred because the ten tribes were taken captive for their sins. They did not repent but instead acted even worse, so much so, as the prophet Ezekiel reveals, that they surpassed their sisters in wickedness.

1208
03:09:26,279 --> 03:09:34,091
And visitation, meaning the magnitude of torment, whippings, and punishments, will come upon Jacob—that is, upon the two tribes that descended from his seed.

1209
03:09:34,091 --> 03:09:36,878
According to his ways and inventions, he will be repaid.

1210
03:09:36,878 --> 03:09:38,719
What he did, he will receive in kind.

1211
03:09:38,719 --> 03:09:44,192
For he did not fall by chance, nor due to human frailty, but because he sought out and discovered ways to sin.

1212
03:09:44,192 --> 03:09:46,133
In the womb, he supplanted his brother.

1213
03:09:46,133 --> 03:09:50,959
This refers to the old story, showing God's mercy towards Jacob and his stubbornness against God.

1214
03:09:50,959 --> 03:09:59,467
Even when he was still in Rebecca's womb, he supplanted his brother Esau—not by his own strength, but by God's arrangement, who considered him a future faithful patriarch.

1215
03:09:59,467 --> 03:10:02,204
And he was directed by his own strength with the angel.

1216
03:10:02,204 --> 03:10:13,698
When he was sent by his father to Mesopotamia, or when the angel wrestled with Jacob all night by the stream, receiving a blessing from him, he heard: If you have been strong against God, how much more will you prevail against men?

1217
03:10:13,698 --> 03:10:17,728
And he prevailed against the angel, obtaining by prayers that he would bless him.

1218
03:10:17,728 --> 03:10:25,042
He was strengthened by the blessing of the one he had overcome when it was said to him: You will not be called Jacob, but Israel will be your name.

1219
03:10:25,042 --> 03:10:26,187
He wept and begged him.

1220
03:10:26,187 --> 03:10:28,973
When he said, I will not let you go unless you bless me.

1221
03:10:28,973 --> 03:10:34,894
This is indeed the struggle he had with the angel, holding him by prayers to bless him—not by the strength of his work.

1222
03:10:34,894 --> 03:10:36,039
He found him in Bethel.

1223
03:10:36,039 --> 03:10:37,133
The order is reversed.

1224
03:10:37,133 --> 03:10:43,005
First, complying with the advice of his father and mother, while fleeing from his brother, he saw the angel in Bethel.

1225
03:10:43,005 --> 03:10:52,857
When he placed a stone under his head and slept, he saw God's angels ascending and descending, and he heard the Lord standing at the top of the ladder, saying to him: Jacob, Jacob, do not be afraid.

1226
03:10:52,857 --> 03:10:57,534
I am the Lord God of your fathers; descend, and I will be with you, and I will bring you back.

1227
03:10:57,534 --> 03:11:01,664
For this reason, he called the name of that place Bethel, meaning the house of God.

1228
03:11:01,664 --> 03:11:07,236
And there he spoke with us in our father, saying: The land on which you sleep, I will give to you and your seed.

1229
03:11:08,231 --> 03:11:10,615
The Lord God of hosts, the Lord is His memorial.

1230
03:11:10,615 --> 03:12:43,079
He gave this memorial of His name to him so that he might be called Israel, which means "man seeing God." This name is still retained by his descendants. He always remembers God's name, given to him by the angel, and by which he is called. And you will turn to the Lord your God.
The Prophet addresses Judah: Since things are so, you, O Judah, will turn to the Lord your God by repenting and believing faithfully in Him. This was fulfilled when three thousand believed in one day, five thousand on another day, and then many thousands.
Keep mercy and judgment, and always hope in the Lord your God. First, have mercy on yourself, as it is written: "Have mercy on your soul, pleasing God." Then strive to show mercy to others, as it is written: "Make friends for yourselves from the mammon of unrighteousness." Also, keep the judgment of discernment between good and evil, God and the devil. When you have done both, always hope in the Lord your God, advancing to greater things through good works.
We can apply these same things said about Judah to any church member who is corrected by the Lord for not remembering His former blessings but daily adding sins to sins. He also explains what these blessings are: When the Church bore you at birth, you supplanted Esau, implied to be the Jewish or Gentile people, by receiving his birthright. In your strength, you were directed against the angel, either by overcoming evil spirits or being strengthened by the angel's blessings. You prevailed against the angel, making him your helper through prayers, and you would prevail even against men. But after your victory, you wept and begged the angel of the Lord. Remembering your past sins, you found Him in Bethel, which means the house of God, which is the Church, or according to the Septuagint, in the house of the Oven, that is, of sorrow, tears, and repentance.

1231
03:12:43,079 --> 03:14:24,503
To understand who this Judas is, it says, "he spoke with us in the Church," meaning to us Christians. From that time, we are called by the name of Christ and are guided by His teachings.
Therefore, O churchman, known as Judas and a confessor, turn to your God daily through repentance. If you happen to sin, turn to your God, just as the Prophet cried out: “I am weary with my groaning.”
Keep God's commandments; show mercy to others, so that you may also receive mercy. Always hope in the Lord your God, and continually draw near to Him, progressing in virtue at all times, and always getting closer to your God.
Canaan, in his hand, holds a deceitful scale. He had warned Judah earlier to turn to the Lord his God, and by keeping mercy and justice, to always hope in the Lord his God. Now the speech turns to Ephraim, referring to the ten tribes called Canaan, not by nature, but by imitation, just as Daniel spoke to the elder, who was indeed of the seed of Judah: “Seed of Canaan, and not of Judah, appearance has deceived you.”
In Ezekiel, we read it said to Jerusalem: “Your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.”
A deceitful scale among Ephraim, contrary to: “Let your measure be fair, and your sextary just.” He loved oppression, meaning he not only had an unjust and deceitful scale but also loved oppressing the poor, stripping them of their possessions through power.
And Ephraim said: “Nevertheless, I have become rich.”
Now it is more clearly stated who this Canaan is, referring to the ten tribes who said: “I have become rich,” meaning they abound in all temporal goods. The sense is: I do not care where I have gathered these from, as long as I have what I possess.
Many suffer from this mindset because the riches they have, they do not distribute to the poor, nor do they give thanks to God for them, about which it is written: “Wealth gathered will be burned with fire.”

1232
03:14:24,503 --> 03:15:51,863
As Scripture says, "The redemption of a man's soul is his riches," and the Lord in the Gospel: "Make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth."
I have found an idol for myself. He calls those very riches, with which he was refreshed, an idol. Just as the belly is a god to gluttons, so gold is an idol to the greedy. This is true because they worshiped idols instead of God.
All my labors will not find for me the wickedness that I have sinned. This means that whatever I have sinned, because I had riches, it will not be charged to me by those who need my help. Since they need my goods, they will not accuse me for my sins but rather praise me, as it is written: "And he who acts unjustly will be blessed."
Riches and the ambition of servants are free from accusation. The rich have many friends. All these things apply to heretics, in whose hand is a deceitful scale: they fraudulently deceive whomever they can. They also love slander, while they persecute the innocent and oppress through power.
After deceiving others, they usually say: "We have become rich by the multitude of disciples who follow us." We have found an idol for ourselves, therefore heresies are composed chiefly to devour the houses of widows, who are always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
And beautifully he says: "I have found an idol for myself." For all the fabrications of heretics are idols, and they differ in nothing from the impiety of the Gentiles; therefore, they usually say: "Whatever I do, whatever I act, it cannot be charged to me. For I have my riches, the arguments of philosophers, and the multitude of people, who, when they see it, will not think me a sinner."
And I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt.

1233
03:15:51,863 --> 03:17:34,823
The meaning is: While you rejoice in sin and boast about your wealth, saying, "I have become rich, I have found an idol for myself," even though you have sinned grievously, I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. When you served Pharaoh and built cities from mud and straw, I still grant you a place for repentance. Hence, it is added: "I will still make you sit in tents, as in the days of the festival."
He calls the day of the festival the Feast of Tabernacles, which is celebrated in the seventh month after Passover, in memory of their departure from Egypt. The children of Israel lived in tents. Just as, at that time, I freed you from Egypt and made you live in tents for forty years, so now I will do, bringing you out of captivity so that in the days of the Feast of Tabernacles, you may sit in tents like your ancestors, if only you do what I have commanded.
I have spoken through the prophets, like Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, and I have multiplied visions. Hence, Isaiah said: "I saw the Lord sitting on a high throne." And Daniel said: "I was looking in the night visions, and behold, the Son of Man was coming." In the hands of the prophets, I have made myself known.
Just as Adam held the type of the one who, while sleeping, formed Eve from his side, so Christ formed the Church on the cross. Just as Jonah; hence the Lord said: "Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale." Just as David defeated Goliath. Just as Isaac for whom the ram was sacrificed. To those who followed heretics, it is said to return to God, who wants the repentance of the sinner more than death.
It must be believed that He is the one who brought them out of Egypt, that is, out of the darkness and error of the Gentiles. And lest they remember the sin and return more slowly: "I will still," He says, "make you sit in tents, as in the days of the festival," so that what baptism did, repentance may also do, and they may live in the tents of the Savior, that is, in the churches, of which it is said: "Planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God."

1234
03:17:34,823 --> 03:19:26,327
And so that the heresiarchs and leaders of their error do not think they are speaking by the Spirit of God: "I am," He says, "the one who spoke to the prophets, not to your teachers. I multiplied visions and was compared in the hand of the prophets who are established in the Church."
If Gilead is an idol, then they wander in vain, sacrificing in Gilgal. Gilead is both a mountain and a city located next to that mountain across the Jordan in the tribe of Gad. Previously, we read: "A city of idol makers, overthrown by blood." But Gilgal is in the tribe of Judah near Bethel, about which it was previously said: "All their wickedness is in Gilgal."
Therefore, since both the ten tribes, signified by Gilead, and the two tribes, represented by Gilgal, worshiped idols in those places, it is rightly said: "If Gilead is an idol," meaning if the ten tribes worship idols, which lack the temple, priests, and the religion of God. Yet you, Judah, have forsaken God in vain and worship idols in Gilgal, even though you have the temple, priesthood, and everything that pertains to the true rite.
Furthermore, he calls oxen calves. For their altars will remain like heaps on the furrows of the field, it is implied, and will be left without care, with them being led into captivity, like mounds of stones and sands gathered together.
Jacob fled to the region of Syria. The prophet seems to touch on the history of Genesis, speaking about the flight of Jacob, who fled to Laban, his uncle, in the region of Syria. It was also said earlier: "In the womb, he supplanted his brother, and in his strength, he contended with an angel."
And Israel served; that is, Jacob himself, for a wife, that is, for Rachel, serving seven years, tending the sheep of his uncle. And he served for a wife, namely another seven years for another woman. But in the prophet, the Lord brought him out of Egypt, and in the prophet, he was preserved. Because he began to weave the history of Jacob and Israel, he connects the sons to the father, saying: "In the prophet, the Lord brought him out of Egypt," meaning Moses, by whose guidance they departed from the land of Egypt.

1235
03:19:26,327 --> 03:19:34,885
Certainly, if we want to understand this more deeply, the Lord, meaning God the Father, led His people out of the darkness of unbelief through the prophet, that is, Christ.

1236
03:19:34,885 --> 03:21:09,766
Furthermore, the same people were saved by the prophet when, due to the sin of the golden calf, with the Lord's anger raging, he prostrated himself before Him and said: "Either forgive them, or erase me from your book," until he received the response: "I have forgiven according to your word."
One would not be wrong to say that Jacob, the supplanter, and Israel, who saw God, prefigured the Lord, and that Rachel, initially barren and beautiful, whom Jacob loved greatly, signifies the Church. Leah, however, with weak eyes but fertile, represents the sacraments of the Synagogue. He led the faithful people out of the darkness of this age and brought them to the very bright waters of the Jordan, that is, baptism.
Ephraim provoked me to anger with his bitterness. The meaning is: When I freed Ephraim, that is, all ten tribes, from Egyptian servitude and granted him many blessings, he provoked me, who am naturally most sweet, with his bitterness. That is, he made me bitter and forced me to deliver retribution. And his blood will come upon him, meaning he will be the cause of his own death. Because of his sin, he will be taken captive and killed by enemies, as David said to the one who reported that he had killed Saul: "Your blood is on your own head." And the Lord your God will return his disgrace upon him, meaning the retribution for the blasphemy where he said: "These are your gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt," will be brought upon him by the Lord.
Heretics always provoke the most merciful Lord to anger, and they, whom He prefers to repent rather than die, compel Him to punish the hardness of their hearts. And their blood, with which they have shed both their own and many others' blood, will come upon them. The reproaches with which they blasphemed the Lord will be returned to them by the Lord their God, not because He is their Lord, but because He once was their Lord.

1237
03:21:09,815 --> 03:21:11,399
Chapter Thirteen

1238
03:21:11,399 --> 03:21:13,535
When Ephraim spoke, fear gripped Israel.

1239
03:21:13,535 --> 03:21:21,224
Ephraim, also known as Jeroboam, son of Nebat, from the tribe of Ephraim, commanded the worship of idols, causing excessive fear to grip Israel.

1240
03:21:21,224 --> 03:21:24,268
This fear led them to abandon God and sacrifice to idols.

1241
03:21:24,268 --> 03:21:33,558
As it is said: They sinned with Baal, specifically the idol of the Sidonians, who is also known as Bel, and they died, losing Him through infidelity, who says: I am the life.

1242
03:21:33,558 --> 03:21:36,121
For it is written: The soul that sins shall die.

1243
03:21:36,121 --> 03:21:38,310
And now they have added to their sinning.

1244
03:21:38,310 --> 03:21:47,067
Combining the sin of idolatry with another sin, they made a molten image, a calf, from their silver, so that they too would have their calves, resembling the idols.

1245
03:21:47,067 --> 03:21:53,688
Because the king had golden gods, the subjected people made silver gods for themselves within their means to resemble those.

1246
03:21:53,688 --> 03:21:57,426
It is all the work of craftsmen, that is, the work of man, not of God.

1247
03:21:57,426 --> 03:22:00,469
To these, they say: Sacrifice humans, worshipping calves.

1248
03:22:00,469 --> 03:22:05,916
For example, Manasseh and many others sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons, as it is written.

1249
03:22:05,916 --> 03:22:14,939
It is as if it plainly said: You, idol worshippers, because you lack sacrifices, sacrifice your sons and daughters, who also worship idols with you, that is, the calves.

1250
03:22:14,939 --> 03:22:19,638
But if, as some say, demons speak to the people: Sacrifice humans, for they bear calves.

1251
03:22:19,638 --> 03:22:31,332
Their greed is shown, those who are fed by the blood of victims and the smoke of burnt offerings, that, lacking sacrifices, they desire humans to be sacrificed, rejoicing not only in their death but also in their blood.

1252
03:22:31,332 --> 03:22:41,049
Therefore, they will be like the morning cloud, and like the morning dew that passes away: like the dust swept by a whirlwind from the threshing floor, and like smoke from a chimney.

1253
03:22:41,049 --> 03:22:51,301
Because, he says, they sacrificed humans to calves, or rather to one calf, and worshipped calves, therefore they will be like a cloud, all of which are seen for a time and quickly cease to be.

1254
03:22:51,301 --> 03:22:59,417
For clouds and dew are driven away and dried up by the coming sun; dust swept from the threshing floor, and smoke from a chimney dissolve into thin air.

1255
03:22:59,417 --> 03:23:01,660
Hence: As the smoke fades, they will fade.

1256
03:23:02,567 --> 03:23:08,208
And the meaning is: just as these four things disappear quickly, so they will be swiftly taken to the Assyrians.

1257
03:23:08,208 --> 03:23:12,942
That is why it was said earlier: Just as the morning passes, so has the king of Israel passed.

1258
03:23:12,942 --> 03:23:19,539
Heretics are compared to morning clouds, dew, and dust, about whom we read in the Catholic Epistle: These are clouds without water.

1259
03:23:19,539 --> 03:23:32,582
For they appear to be prophets and apostolic clouds through whom the truth of God has come, but they do not have water, that is, the grace of the Holy Spirit, about whom the Lord says: Whoever believes in me, rivers of living water will flow from within them.

1260
03:23:32,582 --> 03:23:34,898
I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt.

1261
03:23:34,898 --> 03:23:41,546
It is implied, from when I brought you out of Egypt: and you will not know any god besides me, and there is no savior other than me.

1262
03:23:41,546 --> 03:23:52,826
Now it mentions what He did for them, leading them out of Egypt by the hand of Moses, when He said to them: Be careful, lest you eat and are satisfied; lest you forget your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, etc.

1263
03:23:52,826 --> 03:23:56,653
For there is no other God besides me, and there is no one else who can save.

1264
03:23:56,653 --> 03:23:58,869
I have known you, that is, I have loved you.

1265
03:23:58,869 --> 03:24:03,251
For just as not knowing God is to reject Him, so knowing Him is to love and choose Him.

1266
03:24:03,251 --> 03:24:08,538
That is why it was said to Moses: I know you by name, that is, I have chosen you especially above others.

1267
03:24:08,538 --> 03:24:17,200
In the desert, in the land of solitude, it is implied, I knew you, where there were neither crops nor vineyards, nor even fruit-bearing trees, but a scarcity of all things.

1268
03:24:17,200 --> 03:24:26,517
Near their pastures they were filled, that is, although there was a lack of all good things there, I gave them manna from heaven, I brought forth springs of water from the hardest rock.

1269
03:24:26,517 --> 03:24:33,164
And when they were satisfied, they lifted up their hearts, that is, they became proud, filled with manna, meat, and spiritual drink.

1270
03:24:33,164 --> 03:24:39,509
And they forgot me, whose benefits they should have remembered, according to what is written: The beloved grew fat and kicked.

1271
03:24:39,509 --> 03:24:51,948
For in such a vast wilderness, where not only crops but even trees and vines, not even grass grows, and no waters temper the heat of the sun, for forty years Israel could not have reached the land of Jordan unless the Lord had provided everything.

1272
03:24:52,703 --> 03:25:03,711
The Lord brought heretics out of the darkness of unbelief, where they served Pharaoh and his leaders, and commanded them in the Church to know no other god but Him, the Creator of all people who knows how to save those He made.

1273
03:25:03,711 --> 03:26:34,343
He recognized and nourished them in solitude, so they could say, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
He gave them bread from heaven, which they had never eaten in Egypt, and water from the rock that followed them; but the rock, according to the Apostle, was Christ.
Filled with the wealth of the Scriptures and satisfied, they lifted their hearts against the Creator and fashioned another god for themselves, forgetting the God who had commanded them to keep the words of the law before their eyes and in their hands, so they would never forget Him.
And I will be to them like a lioness, and like a leopard on the way to Assyria. A lioness is fiercer than all beasts when her cubs are taken, and a leopard is no less savage.
The meaning is: When they are handed over to enemies and taken into captivity, I, who always showed them the greatest mercy, will unleash the ferocity of all beasts against them. Hence it is immediately added: I will meet them like a bear robbed of her cubs, and I will tear open their chests.
Those who have written about the nature of beasts say that among all wild animals, none is fiercer than a bear that has lost her cubs or is in need of food; and the meaning is: Because they have thought blasphemies in their hearts against me and have spoken against me, I will turn into all beasts for them, that is, into all ferocity, and I will destroy and crush them through the Assyrians, and I will tear open the insides of their hearts, that is, I will take away the vital parts of their hearts.
And I will devour them there like a lion, a wild beast will tear them apart. As if to say: They are so wicked that even in captivity, they will justly feel my wrath.
Therefore, I will consume them there, like a lion devours its prey, a wild beast will tear them apart, namely Sennacherib, or the devil dwelling in the desert of this world.

1274
03:26:34,391 --> 03:26:40,570
Notice how the one who speaks to believers in the Gospel says:
Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
etc.

1275
03:26:40,570 --> 03:26:41,913
, up to: My yoke is easy.

1276
03:26:41,913 --> 03:26:48,789
Now, through the prophet, to the unbelievers and those unwilling to repent, he becomes a lioness, a leopard, a bear, and a lion.

1277
03:26:48,789 --> 03:26:52,926
Your destruction, Israel, is solely due to yourself; your help is only in me.

1278
03:26:52,926 --> 03:26:55,666
That is, you are the cause of your own destruction.

1279
03:26:55,666 --> 03:27:03,671
Another translation says: Perish, Israel, for you have descended into such depths of wickedness that you can only be saved by the mercy of God alone.

1280
03:27:03,671 --> 03:27:07,001
For in me is your only help, if you repent, not from yourself.

1281
03:27:07,001 --> 03:27:08,022
Where is your king?

1282
03:27:08,022 --> 03:27:10,171
Let him save you now in all your cities.

1283
03:27:10,171 --> 03:27:18,444
The divine word is spoken ironically to those who chose a king for themselves against God's will and boasted they'd be victorious relying on his strength.

1284
03:27:18,444 --> 03:27:20,002
Where is, he says, your king?

1285
03:27:20,002 --> 03:27:25,267
Jeroboam, clearly, or even Saul, about whom you said to Samuel:
Appoint a king for us to judge us.

1286
03:27:25,267 --> 03:27:32,090
And when he objected, you replied: By no means, but there will be a king for us, and he will go out before us and fight for us.

1287
03:27:32,090 --> 03:27:41,921
So, the one you promised yourself would fight your battles, let him save you now in all your cities, with the Assyrians now imminent, let him also rescue you from the imminent danger.

1288
03:27:41,921 --> 03:27:45,897
But you have no human king, because you have rejected me, you have no God.

1289
03:27:45,897 --> 03:27:53,579
And your judges, that is, your companions and other leaders, about whom you said: Give me a king and leaders, it is understood: Where are they?

1290
03:27:53,579 --> 03:27:57,501
I will give you a king in my anger, and I will take him away in my wrath.

1291
03:27:57,501 --> 03:28:10,502
I will give you a king, namely Saul, in my anger, to the extent that I showed rain during the harvest days against the nature of the promised land, and I will take away Zedekiah in my wrath, whom I will lead to Babylon with his eyes torn out.

1292
03:28:10,502 --> 03:28:18,238
Alternatively: I will give you a king, that is Jeroboam, in my anger, and I will take away Hoshea, the last king of the ten tribes, in my wrath.

1293
03:28:19,151 --> 03:28:25,200
Ephraim's wrongdoing is stored up, like something kept in a bag, and it doesn't disappear for the one who has it tied up.

1294
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:30,699
Similarly, all the sins Ephraim committed against God are stored up and will stay until the time of captivity.

1295
03:28:30,699 --> 03:28:32,148
It's said: His sin is hidden.

1296
03:28:32,148 --> 03:28:37,947
Not from God, who sees everything clearly, but from Ephraim himself, who will recognize it at the time of captivity.

1297
03:28:37,947 --> 03:28:39,496
Birth pains will come upon him.

1298
03:28:39,496 --> 03:28:44,095
When the day of revenge and captivity comes, his sin will be revealed and known to everyone.

1299
03:28:44,095 --> 03:28:47,045
He will be struck with sudden pains, like a woman in labor.

1300
03:28:47,045 --> 03:28:48,044
He is a foolish son.

1301
03:28:48,044 --> 03:28:56,342
Ephraim was God's son, as it is written: Israel is my firstborn son, but he is foolish because he did not recognize the true Father, God, and instead worshiped idols.

1302
03:28:56,342 --> 03:29:11,239
Now he will not withstand the destruction of the children, meaning that when the days of labor and captivity come, he will not be able to endure the evil and destruction of the children, who will be killed in the presence of their fathers, or they will not stand because they will be taken captive.

1303
03:29:11,239 --> 03:29:14,938
I will deliver them from the hand of death, I will redeem them from death.

1304
03:29:14,938 --> 03:29:17,987
God Almighty speaks to those He chooses to free by His grace.

1305
03:29:17,987 --> 03:29:29,734
From the hand of death, He says, I will deliver them, meaning from the work of sin, which leads to death: because the hand carries out the work, it is rightly understood that the hand of sin means the work itself, which kills the soul.

1306
03:29:29,734 --> 03:29:36,582
Thus it is written: Death and life are in the power of the tongue; or certainly, the hand of sin is understood as the power of the devil.

1307
03:29:36,582 --> 03:29:41,231
I will redeem them from death, meaning I will free all believing Jews and Gentiles from hell.

1308
03:29:41,231 --> 03:29:44,780
It is said: I will be your death, O death, I will be your bite, O hell.

1309
03:29:44,780 --> 03:29:49,479
His death was because He destroyed death with His own death, leaving none of His people there.

1310
03:29:49,479 --> 03:29:54,078
He bit when He freed some, namely His chosen ones, but left some of the rejected ones there.

1311
03:29:54,078 --> 03:30:03,276
Just as when we bite, we consume part and leave part; or death and hell are understood as the devil, whom Christ bit so that he would lose his power, but not completely cease to exist.

1312
03:30:04,175 --> 03:30:15,217
Between death and the underworld, there's a distinction: Death occurs when the soul separates from the body, while the underworld is where souls are confined, either for refreshment or punishment based on their merits.

1313
03:30:15,217 --> 03:30:16,787
Comfort is hidden from my eyes.

1314
03:30:16,787 --> 03:30:21,295
The most merciful Father has decreed that we all must die, having judged us through Adam.

1315
03:30:21,295 --> 03:30:25,397
He says: Comfort is hidden from my eyes, because I see all of humanity perishing.

1316
03:30:25,397 --> 03:30:32,488
Or the prophet, seeing that everyone dies and descends into the underworld, knowing he will join them, says: Comfort is hidden from my eyes.

1317
03:30:32,488 --> 03:30:38,971
The meaning is: I am unable to be comforted; nothing I imagine can ease my pain as I consider the inevitable necessity of death.

1318
03:30:38,971 --> 03:30:40,693
Because he divides among brothers.

1319
03:30:40,693 --> 03:30:45,809
The underworld divides among brothers, receiving one taken from this life and leaving another behind.

1320
03:30:45,809 --> 03:30:53,811
In this place, understand that all charity is lacking, as even a mother is separated from her daughter, a father from his son, and a brother from his brother.

1321
03:30:53,811 --> 03:30:59,281
Therefore, anything that divides the unity of brotherhood and sows discord is rightly called the underworld.

1322
03:30:59,281 --> 03:31:08,094
Some interpret the two brothers divided by death, according to the history of that time, to be Judah and Israel, so what was once symbolized in part is now fully experienced.

1323
03:31:08,094 --> 03:31:10,778
The Lord will bring a scorching wind from the desert.

1324
03:31:10,778 --> 03:31:17,008
We should understand this scorching wind as Habakkuk says: God will come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount Paran.

1325
03:31:17,008 --> 03:31:21,870
For God the Father brought forth a scorching wind, His Son, who takes away the sins of humanity.

1326
03:31:21,870 --> 03:31:31,190
In Him, the devil, seeking rest, could not find it; or from the womb of the virgin, who conceived without the moisture of male seed; hence: How will this be, since I do not know a man?

1327
03:31:31,190 --> 03:31:44,004
Beautifully, in both Isaiah and here, a flower or an ascending wind is mentioned, because He ascended from the humility of the flesh to the heights, and led us with Him to the Father, saying in the Gospel: When I am lifted up, I will draw all to myself.

1328
03:31:44,004 --> 03:31:47,093
And it will dry up its veins, that is, the sins of its death.

1329
03:31:47,903 --> 03:31:54,527
We understand the veins of death as sins, which, through Christ, have been dried up, and death itself will also be dried up.

1330
03:31:54,527 --> 03:32:21,450
He will desolate its source, that is, the devil, about whom He said: "Now the prince of this world will be cast out."
He will seize the treasure of every desirable vessel. This can be understood in two ways.
First, the desirable vessels are the saints, about whom Paul says: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."
Second, those whom the devil desired to hold as vessels forever, Christ Himself, upon coming, has seized from his power, and has led as the most precious vessels with Him into paradise.

1331
03:32:21,503 --> 03:32:23,087
Chapter Fourteen

1332
03:32:23,087 --> 03:32:26,208
Let Samaria perish, for it has provoked its God to bitterness.

1333
03:32:26,208 --> 03:32:33,859
We have often said that the ten tribes are called Samaria, after the metropolis Samaria, which is now called Augusta, or Sebastia, named after Augustus.

1334
03:32:33,859 --> 03:32:36,778
The Book of Kings explains why the city is called Samaria.

1335
03:32:36,778 --> 03:32:49,915
The prophet speaks here not as a wish, but as a proclamation: Let Samaria perish, because it has provoked its God to bitterness, when He was most sweet in devotion, forcing Him to bring vengeance upon them for their sins, with the sword, implying the Assyrians.

1336
03:32:49,915 --> 03:32:56,559
Let it perish: its children will be dashed to the ground, and its pregnant women will be ripped open by the sword, leading to death.

1337
03:32:56,559 --> 03:33:05,518
This is believed to have happened during the time of captivity and distress, when they lost their homeland, and those who escaped the sword were brought into perpetual servitude.

1338
03:33:05,518 --> 03:33:09,092
Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, because you have fallen into sin.

1339
03:33:09,092 --> 03:33:16,692
Historically, these words were directed at the ten tribes called Ephraim, who abandoned the Lord their God and worshipped the calves Jeroboam had made.

1340
03:33:16,692 --> 03:33:26,256
Spiritually, they can be applied to any sinner who, departing from their Creator, submits to an idol, which is every lie, hoping to be saved by Assur, that is, the devil, the author of lies.

1341
03:33:26,256 --> 03:33:31,792
So, let us briefly discuss both the historical understanding and the spiritual application to each individual.

1342
03:33:31,792 --> 03:33:42,966
Earlier, the prophet predicted the calamities and hardships threatening the ten tribes he was addressing; now he speaks to them, encourages them, and advises them to beseech the Lord by abandoning idols and turning to God.

1343
03:33:42,966 --> 03:33:53,385
Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, from iniquity to righteousness through the confession of sins and the performance of good deeds, because you have fallen into sin by making idols and worshipping demons.

1344
03:33:53,385 --> 03:33:58,570
You have fallen through idolatry; rise through worship and the fulfillment of the religion of your God.

1345
03:33:58,570 --> 03:34:00,281
Each of us should act in this way.

1346
03:34:00,935 --> 03:34:03,075
We are weakened and have fallen into sin.

1347
03:34:03,075 --> 03:34:08,032
Let us rise to repentance, producing fruits worthy of repentance, as John the Baptist foretold.

1348
03:34:08,032 --> 03:34:10,015
Let's turn away from our wicked deeds.

1349
03:34:10,015 --> 03:34:14,503
Take words with you, O people of the ten tribes, and turn to the Lord, and say to Him.

1350
03:34:14,503 --> 03:34:19,408
The prophet does two things: he urges them to repent and teaches them how to pray to the Lord.

1351
03:34:19,408 --> 03:34:25,671
He says, take words with you, meaning: Offer prayers, confess your sins, and turn to the Lord with both words and deeds.

1352
03:34:25,671 --> 03:34:33,081
Someone truly turns from their wickedness to perform good works when they proclaim with their mouth what they believe and hold in their heart.

1353
03:34:33,081 --> 03:34:37,621
Remove all iniquity, and accept what is good, and we will offer the calves of our lips.

1354
03:34:37,621 --> 03:34:45,448
Each one of the faithful should say such things: Remove all iniquity, that is, cleanse us from all sins, as it says: Cleanse me from my hidden faults.

1355
03:34:45,448 --> 03:34:49,779
And accept what is good, which means confession, sincere prayers, and thanksgiving.

1356
03:34:49,779 --> 03:34:53,797
The prophet adds: We will offer the calves of our lips, speaking wonderfully.

1357
03:34:53,797 --> 03:34:57,242
Who ever had calves on their lips, unless a part was taken to eat?

1358
03:34:57,242 --> 03:35:02,930
He does not command us to offer calves and sacrifices, the victims that the Jews used to offer in the temple.

1359
03:35:02,930 --> 03:35:41,441
By "calves of our lips," we should understand praises and thanksgiving, as the Psalmist says: Offer to God a sacrifice of praise and fulfill your vows to the Most High; and also: A broken spirit is a sacrifice to God.
Thus, each of us offers calves, that is, praises, to Almighty God when we confess to believe in God the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, believing Him to be true God and man, and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son—having the Trinity in the distinction of persons, unity in the power of the Godhead.
By doing this, we fulfill what the Apostle says: With the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
Assyria will not save us; we will not ride upon horses.

1360
03:35:42,119 --> 03:35:52,791
Blessed Jerome mentions that, according to Jewish tradition, during the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Menahem and the people of the ten tribes sent one thousand talents of silver to Pul, the king of Assyria.

1361
03:35:52,791 --> 03:35:57,698
This was done to secure his support and ensure peace, providing assistance against the Egyptians.

1362
03:35:57,698 --> 03:36:03,919
Among these gifts, they also included two calves made of bronze and gilded to resemble the golden ones created by Jeroboam.

1363
03:36:03,919 --> 03:36:08,066
The priests had secretly kept the gold for themselves and replaced it with bronze.

1364
03:36:08,066 --> 03:37:20,797
The Prophet previously referred to these calves, saying: "And it (the calf) was brought to Assyria as a gift to the avenging king," using the singular to refer to the plural.
Therefore, speaking on behalf of the people, the Prophet said: "Assyria will not save us." He implied that while they hoped for the Assyrians' protection, true safety did not come from them. He emphasized that they should no longer trust in man but in God, as it is written: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man and whose heart turns away from the Lord."
He further added: "We will no longer ride on horses," indicating their previous reliance on the swift horses of the Egyptians. The meaning is: "We will no longer place our hope in the Egyptians; instead, you will be our refuge."
Allegorically, if we interpret this, Assyria can be seen as representing the devil and the horse as his pride. So, if anyone has placed their trust in Assyria, appeasing him with gifts—namely evil deeds he delights in—to ride the horse, that is, to rise with arrogance, it will happen as the Lord says in the Gospel: "Everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled." We will no longer declare, "The work of our hands are our gods," referring to the golden calves we made. We will no longer consider them gods or seek help from them, for you will have mercy on those who are in you, your people. This refers to the people of Israel, of whom you said: "Israel is my firstborn son."

1365
03:37:20,999 --> 03:39:10,367
He said, "You will have mercy on the people who are in you through faith and repentance, who once sinned and turned away from you. But after returning through repentance, you will heal their brokenness and love them freely.
Because they said, turning to God through repentance, 'Remove all iniquity and accept what is good;' recognizing the Father they had left, the Lord responded, 'I will heal their brokenness.' That is, 'I will forgive their sins, which had deeply broken and wounded them. I will love them freely,' meaning, voluntarily.
Because my anger has turned away from them, as they have repented. I will be like dew, and Israel will blossom like a lily. For I, who was angry with them because of their sins, will now have mercy on them because of my compassion. And I will be to them like dew, because my mercy will remove the heat of burning passion and lust from them; and they will blossom like a lily, because they will grow and flourish in the beauty of virtues and the fragrance of good deeds.
Hence Paul says, 'We are the fragrance of Christ to God.' For the chosen ones blossom; indeed, they flourish like a lily, imitating their Lord God, who says in the Song of Songs, 'I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys.'
And their roots will spread out like those of Lebanon, that is, their good will shall be brought to the fruition of good deeds. Lebanon is a mountain whose trees extend their tops to the skies and their roots deep into the earth, so that no storm can shake them, but they stand firm. Its branches will spread, that is, they will progress from strength to strength, and their glory will be like an olive tree.
Because it says, 'Its root shall spread out like Lebanon;' lest we think it speaks of a holy person from unfruitful trees, it compares the converted man to a fruitful olive tree. Oil signifies mercy, which works through charity and all good deeds. Therefore, it says, 'Its glory will be like an olive tree,' that is, it will be enriched by works of mercy, so that, by lighting a lamp in the darkness, it may shine and provide an example of good deeds to others.
And its fragrance will be like that of Lebanon. In Greek and Hebrew, Lebanon refers both to a mountain and to incense."

1366
03:39:10,367 --> 03:39:18,851
Here, however, is placed instead of frankincense:
Just as we are delighted by the smell of frankincense, so too are we delighted by the reputation of a righteous person.

1367
03:39:18,851 --> 03:39:21,060
Those who sit in his shade will be restored.

1368
03:39:21,060 --> 03:39:26,029
Specifically, those who had distanced themselves from God the Father by sinning will return to Him.

1369
03:39:26,029 --> 03:41:10,841
And after they have turned back, they will receive the reward for their conversion: to sit under the shade, that is, to live under His protection, and they will be able to say with the Church:
"I sat under the shade of Him whom I had desired, and His fruit was sweet to my taste."
They will live on wheat and flourish like the vine. When they sit under His shade, those who had died will live on wheat, that is, they will abound in good works, or by the Body and Blood of the Lord. Certainly, they will live on wheat because through Christ, who is the true grain, they will rise from death to life.
Hence it is written: "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone."
He is also the vine, who intoxicates those who believe in Him with spiritual wine. As the Psalmist says: "You visited the earth and intoxicated it."
And the Lord Himself to the disciples: "Eat, friends, drink and be intoxicated, beloved."
Therefore, like the vine, the chosen will flourish, because they will imitate their Lord with good works, as the Lord Himself says: "Whoever serves me must follow me."
His memorial is like the wine of Lebanon. We can call the wine of Lebanon mixed, and prepared with various spices, so that it has the sweetest fragrance. And the meaning is: just as spiced wine has a pleasant fragrance to people, so too is the memory of a righteous person who imitates the works of the Lord sweet and pleasant.
We can also understand the wine of Lebanon as that which was offered to the Lord in the temple, of which Zechariah says: "Open your doors, O Lebanon," etc.
For just as Almighty God delighted in the wine that was offered to Him, so too does He rejoice and is glad from the fragrance of the faithful, returning the fame of their faith and good works.
Ephraim, what more do I have to do with idols? It is understood that you oppose them. And the meaning is: Since you are about to receive so many blessings because you have begun to do penance and be mine, what more do you want to worship idols? I will hear and guide him who does penance and calls out to me.

1370
03:41:10,991 --> 03:41:17,213
I will guide him, meaning I will lead him on the right path; the path is Christ, through whom access to the Father is possible.

1371
03:41:17,213 --> 03:41:24,756
I, like a flourishing tree, have given him life, so he may have the vitality of faith and good deeds, and always seek heavenly things with a clear vision.

1372
03:41:24,756 --> 03:41:32,545
From me, his fruit was found, meaning all his actions and the observance of both the Old and New Testament came from my gift, without which you can do nothing.

1373
03:41:32,545 --> 03:41:43,664
But it must be known, as we have often said, that the salvation of Israel and the return to God and redemption from captivity should not be understood literally, as the Jews dream, but should be fulfilled spiritually and truly.

1374
03:41:43,664 --> 03:41:45,868
Who is wise and will understand these things?

1375
03:41:45,868 --> 03:41:47,730
Who is intelligent and will know them?

1376
03:41:47,730 --> 03:41:52,530
In these words, the Prophet shows the obscurity of the text and the difficulty of its explanation.

1377
03:41:52,530 --> 03:42:05,511
Who can understand what Jezreel means, what his sister who did not receive mercy means, what his third brother who is not my people means, what the harlot joined to Hosea means, and other things mentioned in the chapter, or what the scorching wind means at the end?

1378
03:42:05,511 --> 03:42:10,312
Considering the obscurity of these matters, he says: Who is wise and will understand these things?

1379
03:42:10,312 --> 03:42:18,688
And if the one who wrote it confesses it is difficult or impossible, what can we do, we who, with weak eyes darkened by sins, cannot gaze upon the bright light of the sun?

1380
03:42:18,688 --> 03:42:22,656
As it is written: Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

1381
03:42:22,656 --> 03:42:25,987
How unsearchable are his judgments and his paths beyond tracing out.

1382
03:42:25,987 --> 03:42:29,709
Because the ways of the Lord are right, and the righteous will walk in them.

1383
03:42:29,709 --> 03:42:39,898
The ways of the Lord are understood as the commandments of the Old and New Testament, in which the righteous walk, fulfilling them in action, saying to God with the Psalmist: Make my steps firm in your paths.

1384
03:42:39,898 --> 03:42:41,808
But transgressors will stumble in them.

1385
03:42:41,808 --> 03:42:47,344
Transgressors are understood as Jews, heretics, and false Christians who transgress the commandments of the Lord.

1386
03:42:47,344 --> 03:42:51,850
They will stumble in them, because those who sinned under the law will be judged by the law.

1387
03:42:51,850 --> 03:42:56,455
And the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten with many blows.
