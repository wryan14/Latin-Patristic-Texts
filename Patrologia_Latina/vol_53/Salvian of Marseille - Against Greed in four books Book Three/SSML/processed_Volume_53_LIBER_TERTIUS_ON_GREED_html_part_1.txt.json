It is up to each group to recognize their parts as they read, and to receive what is said with the love of God.</p>\n  <p>Given that we have already emphasized the special virtues of all Christians—mercy and generosity—and proven with many suitable witnesses that these are the main merits of the saints and remedies for sinners, I believe no one expects more. Especially since anyone seeking more should consult the books of God, which are filled with so many and great testimonies that the testimony of all heavenly scriptures is nearly unanimous.</p>\n  <p>Now, we need to address the reasons behind unfaithful responses, which some people use as a deadly excuse. The Savior, speaking in the Gospel, says that wealth and money are given to people by the Lord so that they may be returned with multiple interests. He tells the most greedy debtor: \"Wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered: you should have therefore put my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I should have received what was mine with interest. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents\" (Matthew 25:26-27).</p>\n  <p>And a little later: \"And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Although this can refer to other things, it is appropriately adapted to this context and cause.</p>\n</speak>",

Hence, elsewhere the Lord himself more clearly commands the rich to distribute their wealth and make for themselves purses that do not wear out. <break time=\"500ms\"/> Luke twelve, thirty-three. And in his chosen vessel, he indicates that riches are given by the Lord to the wealthy so that they may become rich in good works. <break time=\"500ms\"/> First Timothy six, eighteen to nineteen.\n\nTherefore, even I, the least and most unworthy of God's servants, say that the foremost and most beneficial duty of religion is for a Christian rich person, while in this life, to spend the riches of this world for the name and honor of God; but secondly, if somehow prevented by fear, weakness, or some necessity, to at least distribute everything when dying.\n\nBut perhaps he says: I have children. Indeed, the main page of the booklet and its contents, as I think, have already mentioned not a little about this, and the Lord's word is sufficient, saying: Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. <break time=\"500ms\"/> Matthew ten, thirty-seven.\n\nBut also the prophetic saying that neither fathers for the children, nor the children for the parents should be judged, but each person will be saved by their own righteousness or perish by their own iniquity. <break time=\"500ms\"/> Ezekiel eighteen, twenty. And therefore, whatever riches a person heaps up for their children, it will not benefit them in judgment that they left a rich heir.\n\nBut let it be, parents can be forgiven if they leave some hereditary assets to their children, as long as it is to good, as long as it is to holy. Let it also be, they can be forgiven if they leave something even to the bad and wicked. They seem to have some appearance of an excuse saying: Piety conquered, the force of blood compelled, nature itself as if by the hand of love drew to its right: we knew what God's justice required, what sacred truth demanded; but we confess, we were subdued by the yoke of incarnate kinship, and we gave captive hands to the bonds of love: faith yielded to blood, and the laws of piety overcame the devotion of religion.\n</speak>",

Nothing is more just, nothing is more fitting, than since they have embraced a religious life, they should beg: not because this will oppress them with poverty, but because they have renounced earthly possessions and hold the hope of heaven, which they will soon possess in reality, with God leading and protecting them, rewarding them with sufficient temporal blessings and the immortal hope of eternal things.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Yet, as far as the inhumanity of parents is concerned, these children are left in need, having been made destitute by their parents.

Even if they can't buy victory itself, they still pay a lot for the hope of winning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Tell me, those of you who claim to believe in God's judgment, if you truly believed, like the people mentioned earlier, that you would be judged by God, wouldn't you secure your hope and salvation at any cost?

Why didn't you give it away while you were healthy and unharmed? Why didn't you hand it over to your heirs while you were sound and vigorous? But in your will, you cautiously and diligently write: When I depart from this life, then you, my dearest heir, shall have it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Tell me, why do you give nothing of yours to this dearest and most beloved person while you're alive, but only when you see yourself dying?

It's strange that you allow them to have anything of yours only after you are completely gone, unless you have also ensured that it is only after you are buried.

Without a doubt, it's because you consider your property essential while you're alive. You don't want to be deprived of your resources, and you think it's very unfair that while you're alive and well, someone else becomes rich from your wealth, while you are reduced to poverty.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This is true, and I understand your concern. I agree with everything you say in this regard. But there's one thing I'd like you to explain. Why is it that you, who find the use of your possessions so necessary for yourself, don't consider the fruits and returns of your property necessary after your death? You say, without a doubt, because nothing is needed by the dead, and there's no need to reserve anything for that time. Because being deceased and feeling nothing, you can neither take pleasure in the possession of your things nor be troubled by their loss. The reason is clear. Therefore, you assign your wealth to someone else when you die because you can't enjoy its benefits after death.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But what about the fact that the most excellent vessel of God, the apostle Paul, testifies and proclaims that \"Whatever a man sows in this life, that he shall also reap after death\" (Galatians 6:8); and \"Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully\" (Second Corinthians 9:6)? From this, it's clearly understood that those who sow sparingly cannot reap a blessing. By saying, \"Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully,\" he emphasizes that the blessing is found in generosity, showing that those who sow sparingly will reap poverty, and those who sow generously will reap blessings.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But perhaps these things, whoever you are, O unbeliever, seem either not strong enough or not clear enough to you. What about the fact that the Lord himself in the Gospel clearly teaches that no Christian loses out on good works, saying: \"Whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones, solely in the name of a disciple, truly I tell you, he will not lose his reward\" (Matthew 10:42)?

Your relatives and kin surround you as you are sick; wealthy matrons surround you; noblemen surround you; your sickbed is crowded with people dressed in silk and gold garments. Oh, what a great reward in eternity it is to give your own goods to such beggars! It is evidently a worthy and just cause that you take away from your soul what you leave to such needy people.</p>\n    <p>But surely you are broken by compassion, and you are overcome by the piety of lamenting relatives. There is a certain reason. You see, indeed, the most opulent and splendidly dressed people, anxious for you, weeping for you, showing you sad faces with festive attire, displaying faces composed to sadness, buying your inheritance with their imagined concern. Who is not moved by such compassion, who is not moved by such grief; or how, when you see such things, can you not forget yourself?</p>\n    <p>For you see forced tears, feigned sighs, fake anxiety, not hoping for your recovery, but waiting for your death. You see all their faces fixed on you, as if accusing you of delaying your death. Oh, unfortunate and most miserable you, whose final end so many relatives desire and pray for!</p>\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Vide pietatem\nerga te Domini nostri, vide quam misericors sit\nDominus Deus noster, qui nos ipsos pro nobis misericordiam\nrogat. Miserere, inquit, animae tuae. Hoc\nest dicere: Miserere etiam tu illius cujus vides miseratione\nme frangi; miserere illius tandem cujus misereor\nego semper; miserere tu animae saltem tuae,\ncum misereri me cernas alienae. Et quid post haec,\no miserrime homo? cum Deus sic tecum agat, non\nacquiescis! rogat te ut tui miserearis, et non vis! causam\ntuam apud te agit, et  a te non admittitur! dignatur\nte pro te petere, et a te non potest impetrare! Et quomodo, quisquis es, o miserrime homo, quomodo\nte postea supplicantem ille in judicio suo audiet,\ncum tu hic cum pro te rogantem audire ipse nolueris? Sed videlicet causa grandis est, qua Deum audire\nnon possis. Circumstant enim te aegrotantem cognati\natque agnati tui, circumstant locupletes matresfamiliae,\ncircumstant nobiles viri, obsidet lectum infirmitatis\ntuae sericis atque auratis vestibus circumfusa\nnumerositas. O quantus fructus aeternitatis est, talibus\nbona propria erogare mendicis! Digna videlicet\ncausa et satis justa est, ut tu animae tuae auferas quod\negenis talibus derelinquas. Sed nimirum misericordia\nfrangeris, et lamentantium propinquorum pietate\nsuperaris. Est certa ratio. Vides quippe opulentissimi\nac splendidissimi cultus homines,  tibi anxios,\ntibi flentes, tristi vultu et festo habitu, compositas ad\nmoestitudinem facies tibi ostentantes, per imaginariam\nsollicitudinem suam ementes 279 haereditatem\n tuam. Quem non moveat tanta pietas, quem non moveat\ntalis dolor; aut quomodo, cum haec talia videas,\nnon obliviscaris tui? Vides enim extortas lacrymas,\nsimulata suspiria, fictam anxietatem, non optantem\nut convalescas, sed exspectantem quando moriaris. Vides defixos in te, quasi accusantes tui obitus tarditatem,\nomnium vultus. O infelicem te ac miserrimum\ncujus supremum exitum tantus desiderat  ac precatur\n numerus propinquorum!"

I might be surprised that you are alive, given how many wish for your death. For these people, whoever they are, you abandon your soul, and you say you believe in God's judgment while disregarding His commands to leave your inheritance to such individuals?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The prophet says of one who believes in God, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"hi hæz ˈskætərd, hi hæz ˈɡɪvən tu ðə pʊər; hɪz ˈraɪtʃəsnəs ɪnˈdjʊərz fɔːˈɛvər\">\"He has scattered, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever\"</phoneme> (Psalm One Hundred Eleven: Nine). And the Savior Himself said to all the rich, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"sɛl wɒt ju pəˈzɛs, ənd ɡɪv ælmz\">\"Sell what you possess, and give alms\"</phoneme> (Luke Twelve: Thirty-Three). And elsewhere, <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"sɛl wɒt ju hæv, ənd ɡɪv tu ðə pʊər\">\"Sell what you have, and give to the poor\"</phoneme> (Matthew Nineteen: Twenty-One).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Does He say, give to your relatives, give to your in-laws? Certainly not; but to the poor, to the needy. Does He say to a rich relative, to any powerful person at all? Certainly not; but to the needy, the poor, the destitute. And rightly so. For if you give your wealth to your wealthy relatives, does your righteousness endure forever? Or if you increase their riches with your wealth, will you have a treasure in heaven?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Woe, says the prophet, to those who call evil good, and good evil (Isaiah Five: Twenty). God even forbids you to praise such people, and yet you do not fear to enrich them! He does not want these people to hear preaching words, and you bestow wealth on them! He forbids honoring their lives with false words, and from you, their treasures and riches are accumulated!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But you evidently fear the faces of surrounding relatives, and you are afraid to offend those present and besieging your bed. Do not fear them, says the Lord through the prophet, nor be afraid of their faces, for they are a rebellious house (Ezekiel Two: Six). And therefore you too, be fearless and steadfast. Do not fear their faces, nor be broken by their flattery. Despise those who covet your inheritance and are already dividing your wealth among themselves; who do not love you, but your inheritance, indeed who curse you out of greed for your possessions.\n    </p>\n  \n</speak>",

Et propter hos, quisquis ille\nes, propter hos tales animam tuam deseris, et credere\nte judicium Dei dicis, cum ad hoc ejus jussa despicias\nut patrimonium tuum talibus derelinquas? Dispersit,\ninquit propheta de eo qui Deum credit, dispersit,\ndedit pauperibus: justitia ejus manet in aeternum\n(Psal. CXI, 9). Sed et Salvator ipse ad omnes\ndivites: Vendite, inquit, quae possidetis, et date eleemosynam\n(Luc. XII, 33). Et alibi: Vende quae habes, et\nda pauperibus (Matth. XIX, 21). Nunquid dicit, agnatis\nda, nunquid affinibus? Non utique; sed pauperibus,\nsed egenis. Nunquid propinquo diviti, nunquid ulli\n omnino homini praepotenti? Non utique; sed egenti,\nsed inopi, sed egestuoso. Et recte. Nunquid enim\ncum locupletibus cognatis tuis substantiam tuam dederis,\njustitia tua manet in aeternum? aut cum divitias\neorum divitiis tuis auxeris, thesaurum habebis in\ncoelo?

Etiam laudari a\nte tales hos Deus prohibet, et tu ditare non metuis! dari his praedicatoria verba non vult, et tu etiam talenta\nlargiris! honorari vitam eorum fictis sermonibus\nvetat, et a te thesauri 280 eorum divitiaeque\ncumulantur!
