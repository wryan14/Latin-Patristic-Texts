Against Greed Book Twoby Salvianus of Marseilles

2
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:09,380
We have discussed remedies for sins, or rather, the hopes for remedies and comforts.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,278
The first step in seeking salvation is for the sinner to regret their mistake.

4
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:17,675
Then, according to the sacred word, to immediately redeem their sins with acts of mercy.

5
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:25,519
Finally, if they have not done this, at least not to leave anything untried when dying and to assist themselves with the final offering of their possessions.

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:40,059
But perhaps it might be said that if sinful people are bound by the necessity to redeem their crimes, then undoubtedly the saints, who are free from crimes, are not bound by this and thus do not need to give away their possessions because they do not need to redeem anything with generosity.

7
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:40,658
I hear this.

8
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,507
But we will see what this means soon.

9
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:50,701
Meanwhile, even if past wrongs do not need to be redeemed by everything a holy person owns, there are still eternal goods that they ought to obtain at a great cost.

10
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,600
We will discuss this more fully later.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,745
For now, I say this freely and firmly assert that there is no one among the saints who is not indebted to God in many ways.

12
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:02,842
Thus, whatever they give to their Lord, they are not so much donating as repaying.

13
00:01:02,842 --> 00:01:10,637
First, to speak of general blessings, whoever you may be, whether saint or rich person, you were born, raised, and educated by the goodwill and gift of God.

14
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:22,728
Provided with necessities for life, enriched with even non-necessities, given more by your Lord than what your needs required, extended His gifts beyond your hopes, and, which is the greatest and rarest, His gifts even surpassed your desires.

15
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:30,346
I add, however, after all these things, that the same Lord who first gave you birth by His gift, later also saved you by His suffering.

16
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:36,325
Indeed, for your sake, O man, the Lord of all things came to the earth and its dust—a small part of earth and dust.

17
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:44,696
He came to earth, advanced from flesh and in flesh, humbling Himself to the shame of human origin, the filth of swaddling clothes, and the lowliness of a manger.

18
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:53,430
He endured the unworthy sufferings of this life: the frail cycles of eating, drinking, sleeping, and waking, and the disgraceful necessities of this fleeting existence.

19
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:05,492
He even endured the foul company of those who interacted with Him—people stained with the mud of their sins, always guilty of a bad conscience, exuding the stench of their shameful deeds, and thus unable to grasp heavenly teachings.

20
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:12,666
They could not bear the light of sacred radiance because their eyes, darkened by sins, were overwhelmed by the brilliance of divine light.

21
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,602
And not only this.

22
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:37,934
But after all these things, add the stubborn contradictions of a proud people, add insults, add curses, impious persecution, false testimony, bloody judgment, mockery of the people, spitting, blows, extremely bitter punishments, and indignities even more bitter than the punishments—a crown of thorns, a cup of vinegar, food of gall, the Lord of all condemned by men, hanging on the cross for the salvation of the human race, God dying by the law of earthly condition.

23
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:47,084
Seeing that these things are so, whoever you are, whether you are holy or believe yourself to be holy, tell me, please: can these alone be repaid, even if nothing else is owed?

24
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:51,555
For no matter what a man endures for God, he can never repay what God endured for man.

25
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:58,886
Because even if the suffering itself does not differ in the kind of punishments, it must differ greatly in the diversity of those who suffer.

26
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:06,424
But perhaps you say that what we have mentioned is a general debt of all humanity, and in this, the entire human race is indiscriminately liable.

27
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,100
That is true.

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,220
But does anyone owe less just because another owes the same?

29
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:19,877
Or if one hundred promissory notes for one hundred sesterces each are written by one hundred people, does that relieve the debt of one person if all are debtors for the same amount?

30
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:25,583
The Apostle says, each person will carry their own load Galatians 6:5, and each will give an account of themselves.

31
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:31,737
Therefore, one person's burden is not lightened by another's burden, nor is a guilty person absolved by the company of many.

32
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:37,939
Similarly, the severity of a person's condemnation is not lessened even if they share their punishment with many accomplices.

33
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:46,722
As I mentioned before, although a debt may be general, it is undoubtedly specific for each individual; although it is common to all, it is particularly singular for each person.

34
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,990
Thus, what applies to everyone equally does not reduce the amount owed by each person.

35
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,860
For just as Christ suffered for all, so too did He suffer for each individual.

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,284
He gave Himself entirely to everyone and entirely to each individual.

37
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:10,094
Therefore, whatever the Savior granted through His passion, the entire amount is owed by all and by each person individually; and in some sense, each individual owes more than the totality since each received as much as everyone together.

38
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:14,957
Where one person receives the same as everyone, even if the measure is equal, the envy is greater.

39
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:19,969
Thus, even though one receives the same, they seem to owe more because they are compared to everyone.

40
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:27,313
These things should be said up to this point because some of the saints do not consider themselves debtors to God, as they cannot estimate the debt.

41
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:34,011
But perhaps someone will say: The saints are not debtors, but the debts of secular people are much greater because they have more sins.

42
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:42,695
This is like someone saying: I am innocent because someone else is more guilty; I am just because another is unjust; I am exceptionally good because another is singularly bad.

43
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:51,131
Firstly, it is improper for a holy mind to think that their goodness increases because of the evil of others, or to consider themselves better by comparison to the worse.

44
00:04:51,131 --> 00:05:01,055
It is a most unfortunate form of consolation to take solace in the miseries of sinful people, while the Apostle commands us to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep Romans 12:15.

45
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,653
And do not think only about what is best for yourselves, but also about what is best for others.

46
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:12,518
Philippians 2:4
Now, let's say this kind of comparison seems fair and honest: can it also be considered trustworthy?

47
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:16,563
Who can be truly certain about that great and terrifying future judgment of God?

48
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:18,636
Or who can say: I owe less, he owes more?

49
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:21,973
Finally, who can presume about themselves or despair about others?

50
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,815
For we all, says the Apostle, will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

51
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,546
Romans 14:10
And each one will carry their own burden.

52
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:33,147
Galatians 6:5
So, someone might ask, is there no difference between the saints and sinners?

53
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:35,978
There is a great difference, indeed almost immeasurable.

54
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:39,467
But because Scripture says: Blessed is the one who is always fearful.

55
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:52,764
Proverbs 28:14
And the wise person's mind is never secure about their own salvation;
Although there is a great difference between saints and sinners, I still ask everyone who professes religion:
Who among you is sufficiently holy according to your own conscience?

56
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:56,151
Who is not fearful of the terrible severity of the future judgment?

57
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,224
Who is secure about their eternal safety?

58
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:08,892
And if that is not the case, as it should not be, tell me, I beg you, why does not anyone strive with all their might to redeem with the devotion of death whatever they have incurred through the offense of life?

59
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:17,993
Although I want all who read this to know that I am not speaking about all saints, but only those who, although they have not professed religion, still do not abandon their wealth.

60
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:30,835
For those who, free from all burdens, follow the way of the Savior, and imitate the Lord Jesus Christ not only in holiness but also in poverty, there is nothing more to say except what the prophet also said:
To me, your friends are highly honored, O God.

61
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:41,200
Psalm 138:17
For I honor all these people as imitators of Christ, I revere them as images of Christ, and I respect them as members of Christ, and only remember them so that I may be worthy of their memory.

62
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,700
But those things we mentioned above may seem to be injurious to the religious profession.

63
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,694
What then, someone might ask, if a wealthy widow does not leave her widowhood despite her great riches?

64
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:55,981
What if a virgin has vowed purity and is dedicated to maintaining an unblemished body?

65
00:06:55,981 --> 00:07:00,965
What if a marriage is without marital relations, with the couple living as if they were not married?

66
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:03,557
What if a monk has been serving God since childhood?

67
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:07,794
What if a cleric completes the service of sacred ministry with diligent faithfulness?

68
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:15,072
Are these individuals also at risk of losing eternal salvation if they keep their wealth while living or die without giving anything to the needy?

69
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:18,860
I do not have the authority or words to pronounce judgment on such a matter.

70
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,939
Let us therefore see what the sacred scriptures and heavenly commandments say about this, and align our opinions according to God's standards.

71
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:33,416
First of all, no one should seek refuge in the comforts of old examples, suggesting that some saints were rich either under the law or before the law.

72
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,008
That time has passed, and the situation has changed.

73
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:43,136
Before the Law, everyone had the freedom to possess or pursue wealth because, at that time, heavenly prohibitions had not yet been established.

74
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,625
As the Apostle says, where there is no law, there is no transgression.

75
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:55,000
Romans 4:15
The Law has since made certain things forbidden, as stated: For I would not have known lust, says the Apostle, unless the Law had said: You shall not covet.

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,283
Romans 7:7
Therefore, the wealth that God did not condemn before the Law could be freely possessed by man.

77
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:08,458
Under the Law, a similar right was available to everyone: the Law did not entirely forbid a person from having what they desired, as long as it was obtained justly.

78
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:17,331
Thus, at that time, all the saints used their resources within the limits prescribed by the Law, walking, as we read, in all the commandments and ordinances of God without blame.

79
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:17,730
Luke 1:6

80
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:40,441
Just as those people themselves walked,
about whom these things are remembered, like the prophetess Anna, living in fasting and prayers; like Nathanael, praised as a true Israelite, and amazed with the Lord and God himself as a witness; like Tobias, who exceeded the commandments of the law with his great devotion, serving in the burial of dead men even at the risk of death, and helping the needy up to his own need.

81
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:56,064
He reached such a level of generosity that he allocated a portion of all his goods to his servant; and this, which is more remarkable, even though he was already wealthy; and, more miraculously, wealthy from being poor, because wealth after need almost always excites a greater desire to have more.

82
00:08:56,064 --> 00:09:01,674
Such were the saints then, having everything according to the law, leaving everything according to the law.

83
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:09,538
And thus, everyone who adhered to the law was perfect, and as devoted as those under the law who did less, compared to now in the Gospel, who do more.

84
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,635
For then, the law was almost the Gospel.

85
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:16,772
Therefore, those who showed themselves obedient to the law back then, almost fulfilled the Gospel.

86
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,918
So now, no one should think they can take refuge in the law.

87
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:24,793
For as the Apostle says, the old things have passed away: behold, all things have become new.

88
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:26,052
Second Corinthians 5:17.

89
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:28,463
More indulgence and license existed back then.

90
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:31,399
Then, the eating of meat was proclaimed, now abstinence.

91
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,379
Then, in all life, there were very few days of fasting, now life is almost one continuous fast.

92
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,420
Then vengeance was available to the wronged, now patience.

93
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,670
Then the law was an ally to the angry, now it is an adversary.

94
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,868
Then it handed a sword to the accuser, now it offers charity.

95
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:50,587
Then even carnal temptation was indulged by the law, now the Gospel forbids even the gaze.

96
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:55,567
Then bodily pleasures had a certain license, now even the eyes are commanded to keep restraint.

97
00:09:55,567 --> 00:10:01,124
Then the law allowed a husband to take many wives, now devotion to chastity binds him to exclude even one.

98
00:10:02,016 --> 00:11:31,152
For the Apostle says, "The time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who weep, as if they do not weep; those who rejoice, as if they do not rejoice; those who buy, as if they do not possess; and those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world, in its present form, is passing away" First Corinthians 7:29-31.
See how briefly the teacher sent by God has moderated everything and concluded everything within such perfection. He has not only cut off what is forbidden but also restricted what is permitted, trimming, as it were, the use of marriages, the unfaithfulness of tears, the intemperance of joys, the desire to possess, the greed of buying, and even the short and shadowy pleasure of this world.
And why all this? Why indeed, if not because, as he said, "this world in its present form is passing away"?
How far, then, are they from God's command, who, when God has ordered them to renounce their wealth while alive, instead desire to possess it even for their dead relatives? Or how far are they from the devotion that would disinherit themselves for God, who do not wish to disinherit even strangers for their own sake!
To such people, I would gladly and freely say: What madness is this, O most miserable ones! That you should make anyone else your heirs, but disinherit yourselves; that you should leave others wealthy, even for a short time, but condemn yourselves to eternal poverty.
But perhaps someone asks, what is it that God now demands more from Christians through the Gospel than from Jews before through the law? There is a clear reason for this. For we pay more to our Lord now because we owe more.

99
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,293
The Jews once had the shadow of things; we have the truth.

100
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,297
The Jews were slaves; we are adopted.

101
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,680
The Jews received the yoke; we have freedom.

102
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,847
The Jews received curses; we have grace.

103
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,692
The Jews had the letter that kills; we have the spirit that gives life.

104
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:48,267
A servant was sent to the Jews as a teacher; a son was sent to us.

105
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:52,438
The Jews crossed the sea to the desert; we enter the kingdom through baptism.

106
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,279
The Jews ate manna; we eat Christ.

107
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,367
The Jews had the flesh of birds; we have the body of God.

108
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,616
The Jews had the frost of heaven; we have the God of heaven.

109
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:07,062
Who, as the Apostle says, being in the form of God, humbled Himself to death, even death on a cross Philippians 2:6, 8.

110
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:13,615
He was not content with merely undergoing death for us, but He also endured the extreme suffering of voluntary execution.

111
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:20,494
Therefore, what can man offer in return for this, since Christ gave Himself for us through the utmost bitterness of punishment?

112
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:24,773
Or what worthy thing can man repay to the Lord, to whom he owes his redemption?

113
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:30,894
This is why the Lord wants us to be more devoted to Him, because He purchased our devotion at such a great price.

114
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:35,335
And so, the most blessed Paul says: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

115
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:41,022
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword Romans 8:35?

116
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:53,155
The Apostle does not say that only money or riches are owed to God, but also tribulation, distress, famine, sword, suffering, the shedding of blood, the exhalation of the soul, and finally, death in every form of punishment.

117
00:12:53,155 --> 00:13:01,875
Therefore, let all religious people understand that they do not give enough to God, even if they give all their possessions, because they owe themselves as well.

118
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:18,882
And so, as we began to say earlier, if there is a widow, let her not think that the name of widowhood alone is sufficient for eternal salvation, but let her see what kind of widow God commands in the Apostle, saying: The real widow, left all alone, puts her hope in the Lord and continues in prayers night and day.

119
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:23,540
But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives First Timothy 5:5-6.

120
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:32,129
Under one and the same commandment, the Apostle expressed two forms of widowhood: one of life and the other of death, when he placed death in pleasures.

121
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:40,968
Therefore, without a doubt, he does not want someone to be rich where he cannot allow someone to be indulgent, because all the fruits of wealth are placed in the use of pleasures.

122
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:44,967
Otherwise, if the use of pleasures is removed, there is no reason to have wealth.

123
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:56,127
Since the Apostle mentioned that death lies in the pleasures of the widow, it is clear that he wants everything to be distributed for the benefit of eternal life, and does not want anything to be reserved for the use of death.

124
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:12,076
And so he says: "She who is truly a widow, left alone, has set her hope on the Lord" (First Timothy 5:5), teaching that it is not enough for a widow to not be indulgent or rich, unless she clings to God, is devoted to prayer, is desolate from all the allurements of the world, and through all these things is truly a widow.

125
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:23,828
If this is the case, any woman who wishes to be of life, not of death, should not think it sufficient to renounce both pleasures and riches for God's sake, unless she also earns through prayer and labor to be seen as truly a widow of God.

126
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:33,851
Because there is no doubt that as one clings to Christ in this world, so will they remain in the body of Christ, according to the saying: "My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me" (Psalm 63:8).

127
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:39,629
This shows that only the soul that clings to God in this world will be upheld by the right hand of God in the future.

128
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,702
This, therefore, is the rule of widowhood.

129
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:51,677
For regarding those who have professed continence and are full of the Spirit of God, should anyone doubt that they would not want to serve their worldly heirs who have removed themselves from the world?

130
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:56,417
How could those who deny themselves to themselves dedicate anything belonging to them to others?

131
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:09,008
Endowed with such new virtue, and trampling underfoot the permitted and, what is more, experienced bodily pleasures with admirable austerity of continence, how could they not vow some of their possessions to God, who have made God dwell within themselves?

132
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:22,446
In my opinion, it could very well be said about such a marriage:
Rejoice, barren one who does not bear children; burst into song and shout, you who have not been in labor; because the children of the desolate woman are more than those of her who has a husband
Isaiah 54:1.

133
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:32,781
For barren is the one who does not give birth, and desolate is the one who has separated herself from all the lures of the world, and without a husband is the one who, while having a husband, is seen as not having one.

134
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:43,116
Who then would doubt that such married couples, while they live, live for God both in themselves and in their possessions, and when they depart from this life, they go to God with their wealth, to whom they have lived?

135
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:52,787
Otherwise, if any of them gives their possessions to the world and leaves them to the world, they have inscribed the name of religion in vain and seem to have always lived for the world to which they die.

136
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,347
So, these things are sufficient about married couples.

137
00:15:55,347 --> 00:16:09,048
Let's move on to the sacred virgins, to whom the Savior himself prescribed the law of devotion
Matthew 25:1 and following, by the example of the ten virgins, of whom he says that the foolish ones are to be given to eternal punishment only because he knows they will lack the work of mercy.

138
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:15,827
By saying this, he very clearly taught how much he valued abundant mercy, without which he said even the virgin's purity would not benefit her.

139
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:22,038
But perhaps some deceive themselves and think it is enough for them if, having many great possessions, they at least give a little.

140
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:25,641
Nor do I deny that if this is the reasoning, it should be believed to be so.

141
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:28,059
Let little be given if giving little is sufficient.

142
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:32,942
But I do not know that giving little is sufficient: rather, I am certain that little is not sufficient.

143
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,596
If they know otherwise, let them know it for themselves.

144
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:41,285
I know one thing, that God says the lamps of the foolish virgins were extinguished for not having the oil of good works.

145
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:44,082
But you, whoever you are, do you think you have enough oil?

146
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,690
Those foolish virgins I spoke of surely thought so too.

147
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,577
For if they had not believed they had enough, they would have provided to have it.

148
00:16:50,577 --> 00:17:00,201
For as the Lord said, when later they wished to borrow and sought it with all effort and ambition, without a doubt they would have sought it before if their confidence in having it had not deceived them.

149
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,389
And so, young woman, be careful not to think you have something you don't.

150
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,660
You share the same name and profession as others.

151
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,758
You are a virgin, and they were virgins too; you presume to be wise, and they did not think they were foolish.

152
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:16,856
You judge that you have light in your lamp, but they lost their light through the presumption of future light.

153
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:21,166
It is written that they prepared their lamps because they believed they would be illuminated.

154
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,371
And what more can be said?

155
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,178
I believe some light did shine in them.

156
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,886
When they feared their lamps would go out, they certainly had something to fear.

157
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:32,057
Their fear was not unfounded; their lamps were indeed extinguished, and they were blinded.

158
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:36,877
Integrity showed the light of virginity in them, but the substance of oil did not support it and failed.

159
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:48,278
From this, we understand that a little is almost nothing: it does no good to light a lamp that will immediately go out, nor does it help for something to shine if it is destined to set as soon as it rises, and to begin living only to start dying.

160
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:51,800
Clearly, therefore, a lamp needs to be worked on so that the light can last.

161
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,215
If the light in the lamps we use for a short time fades and fails unless oil is generously poured in, how much oil do you need for your lamp to shine eternally?

162
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:02,505
No one can reach eternal life if they think they have what they do not.

163
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,962
Foolish assumptions lead to perdition, not salvation.

164
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:10,616
As the Apostle says, "If anyone thinks they are something when they are nothing, they deceive themselves" (Galatians 6:3).

165
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:23,731
Unless, perhaps, you have had the measure of generosity revealed to you by God, and have the limits set by the Holy Spirit for giving, which you believe it would be a sin to exceed, and you judge it to be a kind of transgression if you are more religious than God commands you to be.

166
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,532
If this is the case, I do not forbid you to use the knowledge granted by Divinity.

167
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:38,341
But if this is as false as it is frivolous, what madness it is not to do everything you can with cautious and careful foresight, since you are completely unaware of what is necessary for your salvation?

168
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:43,601
It remains to say something about ministers and priests, although some things might be said unnecessarily.

169
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:52,779
For whatever is said about others undoubtedly pertains more to those who should be examples to everyone and who should surpass others in devotion as much as they surpass all in dignity.

170
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,343
Nothing is more disgraceful than for someone to excel in rank but be despicable in behavior.

171
00:18:57,343 --> 00:19:01,065
What is authority without merit, if not a title of honor without substance?

172
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:04,637
Or what is dignity in an unworthy person, if not an ornament in the mud?

173
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:09,102
Therefore, all those who stand at the sacred altar must excel in merit as much as in rank.

174
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:17,387
If God has given such a perfect rule of life to ordinary men and weaker women, how much more does He command those to be perfect who must teach everyone to be perfect?

175
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:24,482
He wanted them to be such great examples that He bound them to a singular rule of life with the strictness of both the new law and the old law.

176
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:35,943
Although the old decree gave everyone ample opportunity to increase their wealth, it confined all Levites and priests within a certain limit of possession, permitting them to have neither fields, nor vineyards, nor any land at all.

177
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:45,766
From this, we can understand whether our God now wants His clerics living under the Gospel to leave worldly inheritances to their heirs when He did not even want those under the law to possess them.

178
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:51,720
Hence, the Savior Himself in the Gospel imposes the duty of perfection on them, not as a voluntary act but as a command.

179
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,697
For what do we read that He said to the young man, a layman?

180
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:59,162
"If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor" (Matthew 19:21).

181
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:00,601
But what about His ministers?

182
00:20:01,295 --> 00:21:58,343
"Do not," he says, "possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your belts. Do not carry a bag for the journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff."
Matthew 10:9-10.
Notice the significant difference in these words of God.
To the layperson, he said: "If you want to be perfect, sell what you possess."
But to the minister: "I do not want you to possess anything."
Yet, he thought it was not enough to take away the possession of greater wealth from him, unless he also took away the very bag from the apostle who was to undertake a long journey, and deprived him of having more than one tunic.
And what then?
This was still not enough.
He also commanded his servants to traverse the world with bare feet and took away their shoes even in the freezing cold.
What more can be said?
He snatched the bag from the apostle's hand and did not leave his ministers, who were to travel throughout the world, even the use of a single staff.
And after this, it is not enough for their successors, that is, for the deacons and priests, who are engaged in such great administration of divine matters, if they themselves are only rich, unless they also leave rich heirs.
Let us be ashamed of this unbelief, I ask.
Let it be enough for us that we seem to reject God up to the end of our lives.
Why do we act in such a way that we extend our contempt for him even after death?
We have spoken about the roles and duties of each.
And all this because, as we said above, some who have professed religion either think they do not owe their substance to the Lord as much as other worldly people do, or certainly think they owe less; whereas they ought to owe more.
Because the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten with many blows; but the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows.
Luke 12:47-48.
Religion, however, is the knowledge of God; and therefore every religious person, by following religion, testifies that he knows the will of God.
Thus, the profession of religion does not remove the debt but increases it: because assuming the religious name is a pledge of devotion; and therefore, the more one promises by profession, the more one owes by action, according to that: "It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it."
Ecclesiastes 5:4.

183
00:21:58,343 --> 00:22:25,781
But perhaps someone says, "If these things are so, then irreligion is safer than religion."
Not at all.
The religious person is indebted because they profess to be religious; the irreligious person is indebted because they neglect religion.
Thus, both have their own debt according to their condition.
The religious person owes whatever they have professed to acknowledge; the irreligious person owes even what they do not deign to acknowledge, according to what the divine word specifically says about them: "They did not want to understand to do good" (Psalm 36:4).

184
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:35,991
Even though we seem to have burdened the religious with this matter, because we said that the profession of the name is a pledge of religion, let us remove this burden and assume that what I have said is not so.

185
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:41,556
Let us consider, then, not what we should do by profession, but by reason; not by vow, but by the very healthiness.

186
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:49,105
Tell me, please, all religious people, is there anyone who does not do everything they do for the sake of their own salvation or at least their own benefit?

187
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:49,686
I think not.

188
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:54,912
For all are led to the desire and pursuit of their own benefit by the teaching and impulse of nature itself.

189
00:22:54,912 --> 00:23:01,057
Those who serve in the military think it is honorable; those who trade think it is useful; those who farm think it is fruitful.

190
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:15,381
Even thieves, robbers, poisoners, assassins, and every kind of person of poor conduct think that what they do is appropriate for them, not because wrongful acts are appropriate for anyone, but because the person who engages in wrongful acts believes that what is wrongful is appropriate for them.

191
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:21,419
We pursued philosophy not for its own sake, but because we saw it as suitable for us through the lens of religion.

192
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:28,619
When we reflect on the brevity of the present and the eternity of the future, we realize how insignificant the former is compared to the latter.

193
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:40,018
Thinking about the future judgment and its severe consequences—the burning valley of eternal tears amidst the masses—we see that it is an immense and supreme evil not just to enter and endure it, but even to witness and fear it.

194
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:50,917
Amidst these dreadful punishments, we also consider the glorious and blessed things: new heavens and a new earth, a more beautiful appearance of all creation, the eternal dwelling of justice, and the newly built world.

195
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:58,267
The golden homes of all the saints above the rustic heavens, halls polished with sparkling gems and adorned with the brilliance of immortal metals.

196
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:14,016
A light seven times more illustrious, always shining with a crimson radiance, happiness filled with unspeakable goods, perpetual joy with its inhabitants, the fellowship of patriarchs, the companionship of prophets, the brotherhood of apostles, the dignity of martyrs, and in all the saints, the likeness of angels.

197
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:18,865
The abundance of heavenly riches, the affluence of immortal delights, and a shared life with God.

198
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:24,315
Reflecting and contemplating these things, we sought refuge in the worship of sacred religion and its duties.

199
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:30,265
We adopted it as an advocate and intercessor, believing it to be the most effective means to obtain these goods for us.

200
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:34,214
We entrusted ourselves to its protection and patronage with ambitious humility.

201
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:43,564
Since we have reflected on and sought these great things, let us now see and carefully consider if there is anything in our actions or possessions that can buy such great things from God.

202
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:48,914
If there is not, why does each of us not offer everything he has, since he cannot offer everything he owes?

203
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:58,451
Especially since the Savior Himself
and our God said that nothing is safer and more beneficial for every person than to use their resources and wealth for acts of mercy.

204
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:06,854
He commanded this particularly in both the Old and New Law, saying that those who share their possessions will become richer, and that mercy saves from death.

205
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:10,842
In the book of Tobit, it is written: "Mercy saves from death" (Tobit 12:9).

206
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:17,011
Elsewhere, about the holy man: "He scattered, he gave to the poor, his righteousness endures forever" (Psalm 111:9).

207
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:22,276
Also in the Gospel: "Do not," He says, "store up for yourselves treasures on earth" (Matthew 6:19).

208
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:25,467
And again: "You cannot serve God and wealth" (Matthew 6:24).

209
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:29,987
And again: "Woe to you, rich people, who have received your consolation" (Luke 6:24).

210
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:37,113
To those guilty of greed and inhumanity: "Go," He says, "into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41).

211
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:43,070
It is easy to understand what their eternal punishment will be, for those whose fate is assigned with the devil.

212
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:52,163
Through these greatest torments, not even the most atrocious crimes of fornication, murder, or sacrilege are punished, but only greed and the inhumanity that denies mercy.

213
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:57,747
From this, we should understand what those will suffer who, besides other sins, are also guilty of greed.

214
00:25:57,747 --> 00:26:04,980
Those who are to be punished with the greatest penalty, whom, being free from all other sins, only the crime of greed condemns to death.

215
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,554
If we truly believe that all these things will happen, we must undoubtedly avoid them.

216
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:12,372
If we do not avoid them, we certainly do not believe.

217
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:15,031
If we do not believe, we are in no way Christians.

218
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:19,711
For we cannot call anyone a Christian who does not think that Christ should be believed.

219
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:25,189
But suppose we do not fear the punishments mentioned above; can we hope for a reward we do not deserve?

220
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,975
If we don't give wealth to redeem our sins, let's at least give to gain happiness.

221
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:33,143
If we don't give to avoid condemnation, let's give to be rewarded.

222
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:38,663
Even if the saints don't need redemption from past evils, there are everlasting goods to be acquired at great cost.

223
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,359
Even if there's no punishment to fear, there's still a kingdom to strive for.

224
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,055
So, even if the saints have nothing to redeem, they still have things to buy.

225
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:58,487
Perhaps someone fears a loss in the purchase, thinking they might give more than they receive, or that small returns might come from great investments, that repayment might not match generosity, and that giving money at great cost might endanger their wealth.

226
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:04,055
As if, having entrusted something great to the Lord on earth, Christ might not have the means to repay it in heaven.

227
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:08,711
If this doubt exists, I advise against doing anything at all, because nothing benefits a doubter.

228
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,607
The effort is in vain without certain faith, and it's pointless to invest if you despair of receiving.

229
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,575
We believe that Christ rewards all deeds.

230
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:23,927
So, if you think He is either too poor to repay or unwilling to repay, how can you hope for repayment from Him, whom you have condemned for both inability and unfaithfulness?

231
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:33,479
But if you don't doubt that He will do what He has said, what foolishness or error is it not to give Him as much as you can, when you surely don't doubt that you will receive much more than you gave?

232
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:39,623
What misery, indeed, to want to receive nothing from what you give up when you can completely possess everything you believe in?

233
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,023
But (woe is me!) I think that God is not believed.

234
00:27:42,023 --> 00:28:04,487
And when I say "I think," I wish I were uncertain and didn't clearly recognize it.
Perhaps I would struggle within myself to overcome my opinions and force my mind not to believe doubtful things, so I could direct it to better things.
But what are we to do? We are not overcome by doubtful matters but are constrained by clear ones.
For who believes the Lord in mind and does not believe Him with their means?
Who entrusts their soul to God and denies Him their money?

235
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,318
Who believes in heavenly promises and does not act to be a part of those promises?

236
00:28:09,318 --> 00:28:13,932
Therefore, when we see people not acting this way, we must recognize them as non-believers.

237
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:17,989
We cannot consider them to have faith in God when their actions clearly deny it.

238
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:22,097
This situation calls for mourning and lamenting the disbelief of almost everyone.

239
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:22,655
Oh, misery!

240
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:23,415
Oh, perversity!

241
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,646
People believe in each other but not in God.

242
00:28:25,646 --> 00:28:28,233
They put hope in human promises but deny it to God.

243
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,123
In all human matters, hope for the future drives actions.

244
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:34,166
Even this temporary life is sustained and nourished by hope.

245
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:38,324
For this reason, we plant seeds in the earth, believing they will yield a harvest.

246
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:42,939
For this reason, people work hard in vineyards, comforted by the hope of the grape harvest.

247
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:48,263
For this reason, merchants spend their treasures on purchases, hoping to accumulate wealth through sales.

248
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:53,081
For this reason, sailors entrust their lives to the winds and storms, hoping for a safe return.

249
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,298
And what more can I say?

250
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:59,774
Peace among even the wildest and most barbaric peoples is based on hope and is strengthened by mutual trust.

251
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:04,744
Even robbers and murderers do not deny faith to each other; they trust that promises will be kept.

252
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,432
As I said, everything among people is driven by hope.

253
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:08,699
Only God is despaired of.

254
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:18,081
Although our Lord has made the very elements and nature of the world faithful, He alone is almost universally not believed in, He who made it possible for everything else to be trusted.

255
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:28,629
However, it might be said that using one's resources is not always due to disbelief but sometimes due to necessity, and that religious people do not disbelieve in God but reserve necessities for life and use.

256
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:36,387
Indeed, many holy people are sometimes prevented from the utmost perfection in dispensing wealth by gender, age, or the fragility of their weaker bodies.

257
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:45,414
Fine, let this be accepted; but even if it is accepted, it must be managed so that only what is necessary for the quality of needs and causes is retained, and excess is cut away.

258
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:49,521
For the Apostle says, "Having food and clothing, with these we shall be content."

259
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:54,589
For those who seek to become rich fall into temptation and the devil's trap.

260
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:56,642
First Timothy, chapter 6, verses 8 to 9.

261
00:29:56,642 --> 00:30:05,266
Therefore, as we observe, safety lies only in necessary things, while in excess there is a trap; in moderation, there is God's grace, and in wealth, the devil's chains.

262
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:07,678
Finally, what does the Apostle immediately add?

263
00:30:07,678 --> 00:31:32,170
"Which drown men in destruction and perdition," he says. Therefore, if riches carry destruction within them, let us avoid wealth, so we do not fall into destruction.
It is said that ample and wealthy means bring about perdition. A large estate must be avoided, so it does not lead to deep ruin. Thus, whether gender, age, or infirmity requires necessary sustenance, they must be content with what is sufficient; anything exceeding temporary use should be spent on religious duty.
But if you, regardless of your holy profession, are eager to preserve wealth or accumulate resources, you are making an excuse in vain about infirmity. Can a weaker gender not live otherwise, unless their mind is burdened by the management of a large inheritance? Can a sacred girl or a widow devoted to chastity not maintain the unblemished perseverance of their holy profession, unless they burden themselves with weights of silver and gold, knowing they possess such great wealth that the needs of the owners are not required?
Or because tranquility is especially necessary for both this gender and modesty, does someone perhaps consider it impossible to maintain inviolate tranquility with only a few servants, unless the noise of a large family's activities and the tumultuous clamor of surrounding crowds batter their ears? This indeed is not only too much unrest for a soul desiring true peace, but even seeing it is in some way a part of unrest. Even if someone wants to subject them to discipline and silence, they still cannot suppress their unrest along with their own peace: even the correction of another's unrest is thus a disturbance to our own peace.

264
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:37,415
Everything we've discussed about this matter applies to everyone, regardless of age, gender, or weakness.

265
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:43,463
So, no one should think that wealth is beneficial to religion: it's actually a hindrance, not a help; a burden, not a support.

266
00:31:43,463 --> 00:31:54,455
Possessing and using wealth doesn't uphold religion but rather undermines it, as the Lord Himself says:
"The worries of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word of God, and it becomes unfruitful" (Matthew 13:22).

267
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,135
He rightly called wealth deceitful.

268
00:31:56,135 --> 00:32:03,000
People think of it as good and call it so, but it deceives them by appearing as a present good while actually being the cause of eternal evils.

269
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,296
But even though this is as God predicted, let us still consider the struggles and weaknesses of those who believe they cannot live without great wealth.

270
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:17,592
For you, holy and devout, suppose you hold on to your wealth and riches until the end of this life, as long as you eventually dedicate them to yourself.

271
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:24,648
Use your resources in this life, but remember yourself when dying, and dedicate your wealth to His worship and honor, acknowledging it as His gift.

272
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:28,104
It's a kind and joyful request to all of you, the wealthy of this world.

273
00:32:28,104 --> 00:32:33,048
If you can't bring yourself to be poor in this world, at least ensure you won't be in want in eternity.

274
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:36,024
If you avoid present poverty so much, why not fear it forever?

275
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:38,664
Fear the brief matters and avoid the long-lasting ones.

276
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,488
Why do you dread poverty in this life?

277
00:32:40,488 --> 00:32:41,544
Why are you so scared?

278
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,416
It's much less than what you fear here.

279
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:47,016
If you find temporary poverty heavy, what will it be like if it never ends?

280
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:48,936
We're addressing your souls and desires.

281
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:54,120
If you don't want to completely lack the use of your possessions, act in a way that you may never lack them.

282
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,808
We're asking something delightful and pleasant from you.

283
00:32:57,672 --> 00:33:10,486
For those of you who cannot be content without riches, take action to ensure you can always be wealthy, as it is written: "If you delight in thrones and scepters, kings of the people, love wisdom so that you may reign forever" (Wisdom of Solomon 6:22).

284
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:20,961
Otherwise, what error or insanity is it for any person who has led a life of great wealth—which alone is enough for guilt—to reach the end of their life and not remember themselves generously and healthily?

285
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:30,013
In their own dire extremity, they do not help themselves, even though their wealth, which by itself accuses the Lord, is according to this: "Woe to you who are rich" (Luke 6:24).

286
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:35,047
There are also other kinds of sins that arise from wealth, as if it were a natural breeding ground.

287
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:42,064
They do not take action, strive, or earnestly use their resources to avoid guilt, to avoid leaving behind a body and soul to be tormented.

288
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:46,336
Who, then, is so faithless or insane that they do not consider or fear these things?

289
00:33:46,336 --> 00:33:54,116
They care for others more than themselves with their wealth, losing the only hope they could cling to like a shipwrecked person in the middle of the sea.

290
00:33:54,116 --> 00:34:02,303
Not only do they lose it, but they throw it away and cast it out from themselves, striving in every way not to leave anything for themselves to escape perishing.

291
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:11,252
Since these things are so, tell me, I beg you, all lovers of Christ, can there be any humans so cruel and ruthless against their enemies as these people are against themselves?

292
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:16,643
There are none so fierce, so inhuman, who do not at least stop pursuing their desperate and dying enemies.

293
00:34:16,643 --> 00:34:19,185
Yet, these people pursue themselves even in death.

294
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:28,491
Is this not persecution, or can there be any greater persecution, for a person to disinherit themselves, to be made an exile from all their goods, and driven into exile by themselves?

295
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:32,101
And this not in a common or usual way, but in a new and most cruel one.

296
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:36,539
All exiles, even if their bodies are banished, are not removed in spirit.

297
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:41,467
Even if they are captives in the flesh, they can, if they choose, remain free in their hearts.

298
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:49,802
However, what we're discussing now is a new kind of exile and torment, where the soul itself is sent into exile, where the spirit is stripped of its faculties.

299
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:52,686
Oh, how much lighter are external and physical enemies!

300
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:56,198
They are only enemies of the body, but you are enemies of the soul.

301
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:59,606
Thus, in comparison to your deeds, their hatred is insignificant.

302
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:02,647
Anything that harms in this present world is easy to bear.

303
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:06,316
What is truly grave and destructive is what will strangle in eternity.

304
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:42,228
And so, the Savior Himself said, "Do not be afraid of those who can kill the body but cannot kill the soul" Matthew 10:28.
Therefore, the hatred that harms the body is easy to bear because it does not harm the soul. For when the body is harmed, the soul remains unharmed, and the happiness of the spirit is not disturbed by the sufferings of the flesh. That indeed, that inexpiable evil, that which cannot be valued at all, is what will utterly damn the whole man without end.
And for this reason, your enemies are lighter than you yourselves. Indeed, all enmity is dissolved by death. But you act against yourselves in such a way that you do not escape your enmities even after death.
