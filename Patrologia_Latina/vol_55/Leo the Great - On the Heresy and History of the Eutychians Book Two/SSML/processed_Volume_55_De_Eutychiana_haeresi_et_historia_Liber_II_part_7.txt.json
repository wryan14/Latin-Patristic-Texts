      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\nThe Chalcedonian decision concerning Domnus of Antioch is genuine. Rusticus the deacon translated it from Greek into Latin, along with the other Acts. Quesnellus unjustly denied this, but his arguments have already been proven false and very weak. They were also thoroughly refuted by the learned and distinguished Stephanus Baluzius with remarkable scholarship. In this discussion, we often had to follow his insights.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Among Quesnellus' dissertations, we found one ranked ninth, in which the author examined the case of the former bishop of Antioch, Domnus. He discussed Domnus' condemnation, the ordination of his successor Maximus, and aimed to illustrate various letters of Saint Leo and the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon. The author believed he could demonstrate that the action regarding Domnus included in these Acts was fabricated. However, this claim was unjustified. All the points he gathered to support his argument either fall apart as weak or are entirely irrelevant to the matter at hand, as the sequence of events clearly shows.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    He begins the dissertation by exploring why Maximus' ordination was confirmed and Domnus' deposition was not overturned. He notes that almost all Catholic writers addressing this issue point out that Maximus, even though elected by questionable people, consecrated by the Bishop of Constantinople against canonical rule, and placed over Domnus while he was still alive, was nonetheless accepted by the synod because he had been confirmed in his episcopate by Saint Leo. The deposition of Domnus and other bishops during the Ephesian robbery was done with utmost wickedness; however, only Domnus, unlike others who were reinstated, was not restored to his position, which presents a greater challenge in this matter.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n    <p>\n        The actions taken during the Ephesian robbery were overturned by the Westerners before the Council of Chalcedon. Pope Leo insisted that everything should remain as it was before the unfortunate synod, until it could be reformed through an ecumenical synod. As a result, the removal of Domnus and the appointment of Maximus were nullified, allowing Domnus to regain his position.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Baronius suggests that Saint Leo, after understanding the situation, realized that Domnus was justly condemned. He shares the theory of those who believe that Domnus willingly agreed to his own deposition, drawn by the appeal of a solitary life, which he had once experienced under Euthymius the abbot. In the year 489, when he considered leaving this life, against the advice of the Holy Father, to assist his uncle John, who was straying from the Catholic faith, he heard these prophetic words:\n        <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n        \n            \"If you try to leave the Laura, neglecting these and content with tolerance, you will indeed obtain the administration that your uncle holds, but evil men and deceivers will take it away from you again, having first deceived you through ignorance.\"\n        \n    </p>\n    <p>\n        He recounts these and similar stories from Cyril the monk about the actions of Euthymius.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thirdly, Quesnellus concludes that those who believe Leo's authority acted to keep Maximus in the Antioch position, despite the unfavorable circumstances, and force Domnus to relinquish his role, argue that this is evident from the Acts of Chalcedon. In the proceedings regarding Domnus of Antioch, it is clearly stated that Maximus was confirmed by Leo's authority. Quesnellus eventually included this entire matter in his dissertation to investigate the truth of ecclesiastical history, allowing the reader to more easily form their judgment.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

For truth does not need lies; rather, from association with falsehood, even the most well-attested truth tends to be called into suspicion of falsehood. Yet, who persuades themselves that Quesnellus made that sincere protestation with all his strength? Indeed, if he had sincerely wished from his heart that the action concerning Lord Antioch was not fabricated but genuine, he would have recanted, renounced his ninth dissertation written for this cause, and burned it in flames.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

Before his deposition, he began the correction of the acts of the Synod of Chalcedon on the tenth day before the Kalends of March in 519, and completed it the following year on the third day before the Kalends of April, dedicating a little over a year to this work.</p>\n</speak>",

Although Domnus was orthodox, he wasn't deposed because he had already agreed to the deposition of the orthodox and the absolution of Eutyches.

This theory suggests that Domnus, being sick and absent, was condemned and didn't survive long after his deposition, not living to see the Council of Chalcedon. Baluzius notes that this theory could have been supported by Eutychius's account, which claims Domnus died the year after that Ephesian council. However, Baluzius refrains from using this source, likely because the author is rife with historical and chronological inaccuracies, making any certainty about Domnus's life and death elusive.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Yet, Liberatus contradicts himself when he describes the death of Flavian and the ordination of Anatolius in his place. He mentions that Maximus was ordained in place of Domnus without saying Domnus had died. In fact, the following statements suggest Domnus was still regarded as alive. After detailing Flavian's death and Anatolius's ordination, Liberatus talks about the ordinations of Maximus in place of Domnus, Nonnius in place of Ibas, and Athanasius in place of Sabinianus, without mentioning any deaths. Since Ibas and Sabinianus were not deceased before the Council of Chalcedon, as they attended the synod, it shouldn't be inferred that Domnus was dead before this council simply because he was ill at the time of the Ephesian council.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

The case of Domnus was not one that the papal legates, Anatolius, or anyone else could judge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, Baluzius himself cited another reason, noting that after his deposition, Domnus withdrew to Palestine to his abbot Euthymius and stopped being among the bishops. Because of this, there was no question about his name being mentioned alongside other bishops' names at the altar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Another argument strongly emphasized by Quesnellum, and added by Baluzius, is that if Domnus is considered deceased simply because Anatolius does not mention him in his letters to Saint Leo the Great, then Thalasius, bishop of Caesarea, Eusebius of Ancyra, and Basil of Seleucia must also be considered deceased. In Leo's response to Anatolius, he did not explicitly mention those who had been involved in the Ephesian robbery with Dioscorus, Juvenal, and even Eustathius, the bishops.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Nor should other arguments, which he painstakingly gathered to support his case, be considered more valid.

Since our opponent compiled a vast array of points in his dissertation, aiming to undermine the authority of the Roman pontiffs in confirming bishops' ordinations and overturning council decrees, we needed to carefully re-examine each point he raised.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Nonetheless, our work has been significantly reduced thanks to the effort and diligence of the distinguished Stephen Baluzius. We chose to use in our defense what he meticulously noted, adding some of our own insights that adequately addressed the discussions from our previous Exercises, rather than drafting an entirely new one.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Now, because Paschasius Quesnellus pointed out many errors, including grammatical ones, in the actions we're discussing, and noted that the names of the bishops involved weren't listed, thus raising suspicions of forgery-since Maximus presented petitions to lay judges in an ecclesiastical matter, bypassing the bishops who led the synod-we decided, to avoid appearing negligent, to address these Quesnellian doubts alongside Baluzius.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Regarding the grammatical errors, if Quesnellus' suspicion were valid, all the Acts of Chalcedon and records of other general councils would have to be considered forgeries, especially those translated from Greek to Latin. Does Quesnellus perhaps not know that recent translators worked hard so that we might at least have an ancient version as Rusticus corrected it?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    And what about the names of the bishops? It wasn't necessary for them to be recited after Domnus' action. Those names were sufficiently described in other actions and were recorded at the end of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

It involved a pension to be given to the Lord from church revenues, which Maximus voluntarily proposed as a gesture of compassion. This was because, having been deprived of the Church title and benefits by canon law, the Lord couldn't receive benefits from the Church he was removed from.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        To avoid violating ecclesiastical laws, a decree from the synod was needed, approved by lay judges as witnesses. This clearly reflects the approach of Emperor Marcian, who, after leaving the synod following the definition of faith, ordered that bishops remain for three or four days to present anything they wished before the high judges. It doesn't matter that judges and the distinguished senate were mentioned first; they didn't sit as arbiters of ecclesiastical matters but were merely witnesses, providing support to ensure all cases were resolved without disputes and contentions. We demonstrated this in the study conducted on the fourth action at Chalcedon in the case of Photius of Tyre, which was judged not according to secular pragmatic sanctions but according to canonical laws.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Furthermore, presenting the Lord as a beggar, concerned about obtaining sustenance, is highly indecent and ridiculous, argues Quesnellus. He states that the bishop of such a great see as Antioch, succeeding in place of his uncle, should have thrived with wealth, friends, and authority, and couldn't have reached such a depth of calamity to completely lack sustenance unless provided at the discretion of his successor. But where does Quesnellus derive all these things he imagines? The Lord didn't come to the synod, didn't ask for those expenses to be given to him, and no one else requested it on his behalf; Maximus did it of his own accord.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
