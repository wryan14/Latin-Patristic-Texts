Envoys were sent to Constantinople, including the very holy man, Germanus, bishop of Capua.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Once peace was restored between the Eastern churches and the Roman See, along with the condemnation of the memories of Acacius, Euphemius, and Macedonius, as well as the emperors Zeno and Anastasius, Hormisdas finally expelled the Manichean descendants from the city. If we believe the author of the Liber Pontificalis followed the sequence of events accurately when describing Pope Hormisdas' deeds, we can affirm that this judgment against the Manicheans took place after the year 519.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, setting aside this somewhat unclear and uncertain question, let's focus on Hormisdas' actions against the Manicheans. According to the esteemed writer, Hormisdas discovered the Manicheans and, after examining them and their wounds, exiled them. This represents a new form of ecclesiastical judgment applied by Hormisdas against the Manicheans, as described by the author.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Before this pope's time, there is no record of heretics being examined with wounds by ecclesiastical authority. Although emperors and secular judges had long decreed various punishments to eliminate this group, either by confiscating their property or forcing them into exile stripped of all human rights, there is no understanding that anyone had decreed they should be afflicted with wounds and beatings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, it is believed that it was carried out under public secular authority to ensure that the laws of leniency, to which church leaders adhered most sacredly, were not violated. Additionally, after all the books and writings of the Manicheans were gathered, the supreme pontiff, following the example of his predecessors, burned them in front of the doors of the Constantinian basilica. Such fear and terror were instilled in the minds of these wicked people that they did not consider returning to the city from exile.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Isaac Beausobre, in his writings on the History of Manichaeism, argues that this approach was particularly neither useful nor safe. He examined various laws from emperors and magistrates regarding the destruction and elimination of heretical or Christian books. Beausobre defends these laws as reasonable, mainly because such books contained content that corrupted religious devotion and human society, which we discussed clearly in Chapter 4 of this book.\n    </p>\n    <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n    <p>\n        Now, setting aside Beausobre's viewpoints and commentaries, let's begin to explore other Manichaean customs, worship practices, and church governance from the Constantinopolitan synods. One of these synods dates back to the time of Hormisdas, and another to the era of Agapetus, as we will demonstrate using the most reliable documents. It is well established for those who have reviewed their Acts that these synods, alongside individuals like Severus, Anthimus, Zoaras, Philoxenus, and others known as the Acephali, were condemned as defenders of Manichaean doctrines by the unanimous consensus of the Fathers. Therefore, in reviewing these Acts, we have concluded without any doubt that teachers of Manichaean rites attempted to disguise themselves under the name of the Acephali.\n    </p>\n    <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n    <p>\n        To avoid appearing as if I'm telling untruths, I will first recount what the impious emperor Anastasius did to spread his heresy. Specifically, he brought Xenia to Constantinople and welcomed Severus, a notorious individual, along with two hundred monks who accompanied him, with honor. As Petavius notes, this marked the beginning of Severus's unclean influence, who in the year 513 forcibly took over the Antioch seat, from which Flavian had been expelled the previous year due to his steadfastness in the Catholic faith, and tried to persuade all the Easterners to condemn the Council of Chalcedon, while expelling the Catholic bishops who resisted from their seats.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
