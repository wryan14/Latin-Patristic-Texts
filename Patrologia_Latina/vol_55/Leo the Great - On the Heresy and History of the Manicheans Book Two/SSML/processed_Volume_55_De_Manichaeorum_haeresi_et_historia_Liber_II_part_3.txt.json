Relying on various conjectures, he demonstrated that this booklet received its name from the topics it covered, and it was called: \"On the Difference of Those Who Approach Pure Faith.\" Indeed, it was proven earlier by Augustine that the Manichaeans falsely boasted about the purity of their faith, referring to themselves as Catharists, or purifiers.\n    </p>\n    <break time=\"500ms\"/>\n    <p>\n        Now, moving on to the items published after the Goarian formula by Cotelerius and Tollius, we encounter another book called the Apocryphon.

These teachings were passed down only to initiates and those involved in their vile ceremonies. We do not at all dismiss Cave's conjecture. Besides the common doctrines that the Manichaean school spread to its followers, it also taught and protected other hidden and secret knowledge, known only to the leaders and top teachers of this sect. We have already noted in the previous book, chapter 11, that Turbon testified to this in his renunciation of heresy, not obscurely. It is likely that this book described all the profane rites, sacrilegious ceremonies, fasts, and prayers used by Manichaean worshippers during their sacred and festive ceremonies for the god Bema.
