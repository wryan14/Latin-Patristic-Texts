      "original_latin": "Vandali a loco suo digressi cum Gunderico rege\nin Gallias ruunt, quibus valde vastatis Hispanias appetunt. Hos secuti Suevi, id est Alamani, Galliciam apprehendunt. Nec multo post scandalum inter utrumque\noritur populum, quoniam propinqui (Colb., ibi)\nsibi erant . . . . . . . Post haec prosequentibus Alamannis\nusque ad Traductam, transito mari Vandali per totam\nAfricam ac Mauritaniam sunt dispersi. II. Sed quoniam eorum tempore persecutio in Christianos\ninvaluit, videtur ut aliqua ex his quae circa Dei\nEcclesias intulerunt, vel quemadmodum de regno expulsi\nsunt, memorarem. Defuncto igitur  Trasimundo,\npost scelera quae in sanctis Dei exercuit, Honoricus\nmente crudelior Africanum occupat regnum, atque ex\nelectione Vandalorum ipsis praeponitur, cujus sub tempore\n quanti Christianorum populi pro ipso Christi sacratissimo\n nomine coesi tint, ab hominibus non potest\ncomprehendi. Testis est tamen Africa quae misit, et\nChristi dextera quae gemmis immarcessibilibus coronavit. Legimus tamen quorumdam ex ipsis martyrum\npassiones, ex quibus quaedam replicanda sunt, ut ad\nea quae spopondimus veniamus. III. Igitur Cirola, falso vocatus episcopus, haereticorum\ntunc maximus habebatur assertor; cumque ad\npersequendum Christianos rex per diversa transmitteret,\nsanctum Eugenium episcopum, virum inenarrabilis\nsanctitatis, qui tunc ferebatur magnae prudentiae esse in\nsuburbano civitatis suae reperit persecutor. Quem ita\nviolenter rapuit, ut nec  ad cohortandum gregem\nChristi locum habere permitteret. Ille vero cum se\nvideret abduci, epistolam civibus suis pro custodienda\n fide catholica hoc modo transmisit:",
