Eight Sermons by Faustus of Riez
Sermon One A Message to the Monks
(From the manuscript of Lord Chauvelin, keeper of the royal seals.)
Dear brothers, we have gathered here not for rest, not for security, but for battle, for struggle. We have come here to fight against vices. Our life is our enemy, as Scripture says: "Beware lest you have any fellowship with them."  We need constant vigilance and tireless guarding because this conflict is unending, and this enemy never makes peace. This enemy can be defeated but never befriended. Therefore, this battle we have taken on is very hard and very dangerous because it is fought within a person and only ends with the person. That's why we have come to these peaceful and spiritual camps, to fight our passions daily with relentless effort; to subdue our wills as if they were servants, to cut off the evils of the heart, or to dull the sword of the tongue.  We must not only avoid harming each other but also be untouched by harm from others.
Specifically, our profession requires us to seek no comfort in this life, no honor; to reject the comforts of the present world and prepare our minds for the promised rewards of eternal life.  We should rejoice in submission and humility, eagerly seek poverty, and uproot not only our possessions but even our wills from our hearts. Sometimes, having nothing of our own is a necessity, but desiring nothing is a virtue.
We must also understand that those of us who choose this life either strive diligently or negligently, with great risk. Therefore, blessed is the soul that, while living well in the community, brings joy to many, and many are either edified or enlightened by it. Good things, when shared with many, are increased. This is reflected in the wise saying: "My son, if you are wise, you are wise for yourself and your neighbors" (Proverbs 23:15). Thus, if anyone in the community shows humility or patience to those who follow, the good he provides to others is also returned to him.  But if, on the contrary, he seeks through disobedience or pride, he will more easily find the worse path, leading others into evil or injustice. The harm he causes will bring him the danger of damnation, and the sin he once abandoned will come back to him many times over. Therefore, as much as someone is admirable and praiseworthy whose good conduct benefits many, so too is someone to be mourned whose life causes the downfall of many.  Therefore, dear brothers, let us strive to do those things which build up the community, so that our path does not harm the virtues of others, and our lukewarmness does not weaken their fervor; and our anger does not violate their patience, and our pride does not corrupt their humility, and our ugliness does not taint their beauty: let us not extinguish the burning lamps of others if we cannot light our own. Indeed, those foolish virgins, foolish as they were, did not wish to extinguish others' lamps, but to light their own; and so, if any of us lack the rich grace of humility, or the fire of faith, or the flame of fervor, or the oil of charity, or the light of discretion, let him come to those he sees more abundantly endowed, and by imitating, transfer their grace to himself, without taking it away from them, but enriching himself.  The light of a burning fire is never diminished by lighting many flames, nor is the light of the sun lessened by the multitude of those who look at it; it shares its gifts with many and remains whole.
Blessed is the soul whose humility confounds another’s pride, whose patience extinguishes another’s anger, whose obedience silently rebukes another’s laziness; whose fervor...
He awakens even the warmth of another, who illuminates the troubled eye of his neighbor's heart with the grace of consolation and edification. It is better for him than for the one who, seeing his brother slightly saddened by someone, does not extend a hand of comfort to help him, but instead, like a leaning wall, aids his downfall through malicious speech and incites him with harmful advice, so as to crush him; he arms him to destroy him.
Therefore, brothers, if one's own misdeeds are not enough, he acts in such a way that he also incurs the judgment of another's destruction. We are certain, dearest ones, that unless we are cautious, unless we cut back and circumcise our daily passions, we will become much worse than we were while we lived in this world: so much so that our end will be worse than our beginning. Indeed, dear ones, as long as we were engaged in worldly activities and businesses, in which we are now ashamed, the adversary did not stand in our way, but even consented because he found nothing in our miserable and lost life to exercise his envy. Our deeds delighted him, and our sins and crimes were enough for him by themselves. For who wages war against his own soldier, and who wants to attack his own subject? But more unfortunate was the life of the one whom the enemy disdained to harm.
But now, after we have renounced his pleasures, he saw his followers return to the service of their former master, he saw in us his idols being transformed into God's temple, and gnashing his teeth and roaring like a lion, the ever-watchful plotter searches for all means of harming us. The apostle testifies well about this lion:  Be alert, because your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour  First Peter chapter five, verse eight. Blessed are those whom this lion judges worthy to seek and follow, certainly by the traces of virtues and the scent of merits. For he seeks only the good, because the evil come to him willingly. He pursues the good violently. He meets the evil negligently. Therefore, blessed are those whom this lion, driven by envy, seeks but malice does not allow him to find.
It sounds terribly in our ears when we hear "Like a roaring lion." But because it is said: "His chosen food; what he seeks is of choice; what he roars is of despair." As we read elsewhere: "He gnashes his teeth and melts away." Thus the divine word speaks, so that consolation is joined with terror. Indeed, it is of the cruel one to gnash; but of the defeated one to melt away. And among the many things prepared by God for man, the enemy's envy reveals itself.
Therefore, dearest ones, thinking of these things and sweating in this struggle, let us remember that we are disciples and children of our glorious and illustrious father, Saint Honoratus, who founded and led the Lérins Monastery, to whose monks Saint Faustus spoke, having himself been a monk of the same place before his episcopate. Let each of us seize what we can from the goods of our intestate parent. Let one take from the inheritance the precious variety of faith's deeds. Let another occupy the talent of meekness and simplicity. Let another claim for himself the ornament of benevolence and wisdom from the heart. Let another take hold of the pearl of compunction and the treasure of chastity. For although that very wealthy friend of God took with him all that he had intact, he still left everything to us if we wish. Therefore, let us follow his good deeds, so that he who will be raised to eternal glory at the end of the ages may now rise again in the divine offspring of the Church through the merits of his children.
Sermon Two Words for the Monks
As God supports and in a way commands it with charity, and with your brotherhood, I offer whatever sermon I can.
I do this not out of presumption, but out of true and complete love.
And although you are so perfect by God's grace that you don't need our admonition at all, yet with commanding charity that knows no fear, we dare to suggest and admonish with true humility and perfect love what we know you already fulfill excellently, though not without embarrassment, since we know ourselves to still be unworthy disciples and seem to be urging teachers to holy work.
Though we are lukewarm, we are forced to admonish the fervent; though we are sinners, we argue with the just; though we are unskilled, we instruct teachers; though we are tossed by the waves of this world's sea, we speak words of prediction to those who have happily reached the port.
But, dearest brothers, as ships, having overcome and defeated the sea's waves, still struggle even in the safest port and, without great caution, almost sink; we humbly and reverently advise that, since Christ has freed you from major crimes as from dangerous waves, placed in the port of peace and happiness, you should continuously and vigilantly, with Christ's help, strive to bail out small negligences and minor sins that gather in the soul like drops through tiny cracks in a ship's bilge.
For just as a ship that has escaped the sea's waves will be filled and sunk by small drops if not bailed out in port, so a monk, having overcome the crimes of this world like dangerous waves, if he neglects to bail out creeping vices and small daily sins from the bilge of his soul, faces shipwreck in the very port.
But someone might ask, how can a soul be bailed out?
Certainly, by praying, fasting, watching, and showing true love, true humility, and true obedience.
Consider, brothers, how a ship is bailed out with a bucket; likewise, a soul is freed from bad deeds by the Lord's prayer if it says and truly says:  "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors"  Matthew 6:12.
For whoever mercifully forgives everyone who sins against him, no trace of sin will remain in his soul.
Consider, brothers, and understand what I said: whoever forgives one who sins against him, I did not say you should forgive one who sins against God, which is worse; sometimes we forgive those who sin against us either late or difficultly, but we quickly forgive those who sin against God.
But if we want to act justly, we should not forgive those who sin against God without the strictest discipline, lest by indiscreet mercy towards them, we set an example of ruin to others.
Therefore, each one should show mercy in his own case, for the Lord said:  "If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you"  Matthew 6:14.
However, when someone presumes to commit a sin against God, he should endure monastic discipline.
And this should be done with a pious mind, so that he is corrected by spiritual chastisement in this world and does not perish in the future: because every sin that is not corrected in this world will be punished in the future world.
For divine Scripture mentions about the son and the servant:  "You will strike him with a rod and rescue his soul from hell"  Proverbs 23:14.
And therefore, as I suggested above, let us avoid not only major crimes but also small negligences that we daily breathe in as the devil’s poison.
For there are some who, after professing religion and seeming to leave the world, become lax with excessive security, and the Lord's sentence is fulfilled in them which says:  "I wish you were either cold or hot: but because you are lukewarm, I will begin to spit you out of my mouth"  Revelation 3:15.
What did He mean by saying: I wish you were hot or cold? Now, because you have both left the world and refused to grasp spiritual fervor due to your negligence, you have become lukewarm.
From the mouth of the Lord, you will be spewed out, scarcely to be taken back again.
Therefore, dearest brothers, pay close attention to the message of the divine Scripture, which says: Guard your heart with all vigilance (Proverbs 4:23). Just as we should rejoice over a monk who wishes to exhibit gentleness, obedience, patience, meekness, and humility in the monastery, so we should mourn for the one who only appears to have left this world physically but is known to have remained in it unfaithfully in heart or returned to it unhappily. Such a person shows pride instead of humility, anger instead of patience, contempt instead of obedience, and spreads the poison of malice instead of the medicine of charity. The true and much-feared judgment of blessed Peter applies to such individuals. He says, it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back (2 Peter 2:20). And again: A dog returns to its vomit, and a sow that is washed returns to wallowing in the mud (2 Peter 2:21).
But we should not despair over such people, brothers, because God is able to ignite a spark of repentance in them through your prayers and to consume all worldly pleasures like thorns and thistles of evil with a healthy fire, the fire of which the Lord said: I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled (Luke 12:49).
Therefore, beloved brothers, pray not only that God may grant you good perseverance but also that those who are negligent may finally lift themselves out of the pit of pride and escape from its snares. For if, through your prayers and loving advice, those who are lukewarm and negligent are corrected, the Lord will deem it worthy to reward you doubly for both your own and their correction. Neither should those who are good exalt themselves as if by their own merits, nor should those who are negligent despair of God's mercy. Rather, the good should guard God's gifts with humility, and the negligent should quickly flee to repentance and the remedies of correction with great contrition. For the good person, if they begin to be proud, will be humbled; and the proud person, if they humble themselves, will be lifted up by God's mercy. The key is not to allow oneself to be pressed further by a harsh yoke or to be hardened longer by dangerous and excessive neglect in sins. Instead, one should quickly flee to God's mercy so that no trace of sin remains. A balm or suture is best applied to fresh wounds; for if one’s intention to rise is swift to seek the heavenly doctor, the trace of sin will not remain. Under the hand of the Almighty Doctor, the sickness quickly disappears, and the patient is swiftly healed.
Again and again, I ask and urge you, brothers, to continually strive to show obedience, humility, and charity not only to elders and equals but also to those younger. For whatever good a servant of God strives to possess, they lose it all quickly if they do not have true humility and charity. Do not grumble, brothers; for it is written that those who grumbled perished by serpents. Do not slander, brothers, for it is written: Whoever slanders their brother will be uprooted. Do not hold anger in your heart, for it is written: Human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires (James 1:20). Do not hate one another, because it is written: Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer (1 John 3:15). But there is no need to teach your holy charity with many words, for we know and rejoice that you fulfill it with your deeds for Christ's glory. We only ask this specifically, that since God has deemed it worthy to place you in a place of peace and tranquility, pray more abundantly to the Lord for us, who are afflicted by the storms and countless waves of this world. So that if glory is not given to us, who are unworthy, at least the forgiveness of sins may be granted to us through your prayers. Amen.
Sermon Three: On Repentance
Let repentance be given to the layperson, whose neck still hangs under the yoke of the world. Let the time for this be determined according to the severity of the sin, for they are still bound by time. However, if someone renounces the world and its service, and vows to serve God all their days, why would they need to earn repentance when they have been set free and, like a wild donkey, seek the solitude of the desert? As Job says, Job:  "Who let the wild donkey go free? I gave him the wasteland as his home" (Job 39:5-6).
They should be cautious of the lion and be nourished in the desert by sparse vegetation and a small drink. Let them lift their head to the sky and let the burning thirst be quenched by the breath of the Holy Spirit. Lest in their great desire for pleasant greenery, they fall into the danger of losing their salvation due to excessive indulgence.
Therefore, public repentance is not necessary for those who have renounced, because they have groaned in conversion and made an eternal pact with God. From that day on, their sins committed in the world are not remembered, as they have promised God to live justly from then on.
[Note: This shows that religious profession is like a second baptism, which washes away all sins committed in the world, as other holy Fathers also clearly teach.]
Therefore, after the written promise [Note: The pact was thus committed to writing, where the monks vowed to serve God perpetually, which Saint Benedict later also prescribed in the Rule, chapter 58.]
In which the monk promised to fulfill their duty with full faith, even if they sin in the world after renouncing it again, they should not hesitate to receive the Lord's body, lest excessive humility keep them away from the body and blood with which they have united to become one body. Therefore, they should not stop taking communion if they cease to sin, only that they should not sin from then on.
Just as this visible fire has two effects, to burn the fragile and to illuminate the dark, so the Lord's inflamed body, when taken with great fear and reverence, consumes the sins of the body and enlightens the mind of the soul. For this reason, they should receive communion more frequently.
If, however, there is, as it is written, leprosy on the skin, it will be impure, that is, sin in the monk. Because Scripture pronounces the monk to be the skin, mortifying their members on earth, whose flesh clings to their bones, which is changed by oil, weakened by fasting, and dries up like grass. Therefore, if leprosy is seen on this skin, it will be impure, and unless it is pure blue or red, it will not be suitable for the adornment of the tabernacle.
Sermon Four: Judgement Day and Daily Penance
OR  A NECESSARY WARNING ABOUT JUDGMENT DAY, AND THE PUNISHMENT OF THE WICKED, OR THE GLORY OF THE RIGHTEOUS; AND THAT EVEN LAY PEOPLE, WITHOUT CHANGING THEIR HABIT, CAN AND SHOULD REPENT DAILY.
To the monks.
(From the Corbie manuscript written in Merovingian script over 1,000 years ago.)
I ask you, dearest brothers, as I have often reminded you, to constantly strive to think about the day of our death and the terrible and fearful judgment. I warn you that there are no more useful remedies for the wounds of sins than for each person to think about that hour when they will leave this world.
How can anyone choose to commit any sins if they believe they could leave this life at any moment? For the Scripture says: Remember, my child, that death does not delay. And also: Remember the end of your life, and you will stop sinning.
For anyone who carefully considers how harsh the examination will be before the tribunal of Christ, where everyone will receive according to their work, will not be pleased with their own sins or crimes. When all nations are gathered before that dreadful judge, what will happen then to the unjust, the adulterers, and the greedy? There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, as they see the multitude of the saints at the right hand of the eternal king, separated from glory, the sinful people cast into the depths of hell without any end to their suffering or hope of mercy, seeing themselves excluded in darkness from the blessed light of the saints, descending endlessly into the depths of hell, their mouths pressed to the pit of eternal punishment and an everlasting death that does not die. They will in vain ask for the tip of Lazarus' finger to cool their burning lips.
And so, dearest brothers, while we still have time, let us examine our consciences, and if we recognize that any serious sins or capital crimes are still ruling over us, not yet purified by alms and prayers, let us hasten to enter the harbor of repentance, overcoming the waves of sins with Christ guiding us. If we know that anything in the boat of our soul has been corrupted by many storms of sins, whether through greed, pride, or unjust desire, let us hurry to repair it with good deeds.
For past sins do not harm us if we do not like them; just as no one's righteousness is enough if they do not persevere to the end, so no one's sins can harm them if they seek the remedies of alms or the medicine of repentance before leaving this body. But because we do not know when or at what hour we will be taken from this world, let us flee from the left to the right without any delay or hesitation. It is not safe to trust in health or age for one's salvation, for we are uncertain of our lifespan. For He who made us secure by saying to the sinner: On whatever day you turn back, all your iniquities will be forgotten; He also wanted us to be cautious, saying: Do not delay to turn back to the Lord, nor put it off from day to day.
But perhaps when everyone is generally called to repentance, someone might think to themselves, saying: I am a young man with a wife, how can I shave my head or take on the habit of religion? We are not saying this, dearest brothers, we are not preaching this, that young men who seem to have reasonable marriages should change their habit more than their ways. For what harm is there to a man with a wife if he does not want to have corrupt behavior and turns to good and honest works, if he recalls the wounds of his sins to their original health through alms and prayers?
True conversion is sufficient without changing clothes; religious clothing without good works not only will not have any remedy, but will also face the just judgment of God. Therefore, let us turn to better things while the remedies are in our power. Here, let us extinguish death by dying to sins. Here, let us gain the life of life through the merits, thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.
Sermon Five: Easter Message to the Monks
It is fitting and appropriate that on this significant day of celebration, we rise with a voice of rejoicing, and with the Apostle we say:  "Now is the day of salvation"  Second Corinthians chapter six.
Today, the Egyptians are slain, and God's people, from the lowest and most meaningless works, are freed from the mud and straw. Today, the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world is offered for the redemption of human salvation. When the doorposts of houses are commanded to be marked with His blood—our foreheads painted with the sign of the cross—the destroying angel may not find a place.
At this time, Pharaoh and his army are cast into the Red Sea, with sins perishing in the sacred font, just as the Egyptians are submerged in the Red Sea, consecrated by the blood of Christ.
At this return, the fatted calf is sacrificed for the lost and found younger son, representing the salvation of the Gentiles. The younger son is us, while the older brother, representing the Jews, delay and refuse to enter. We return to our Creator with repentance for our sins, having squandered and lost the substance received from God our Father.
Let us see what substance—that is, the goods of all nature—is. For the substance of God is everything we live, understand, and think: the intellect and reason to discern good and evil are God's substance; also, the freedom of choice we have received, either to avoid the enticements of sin or to stir the affection of free will in obedience to the Creator, or to maintain the image and likeness of God.
Therefore, these riches given to us and instilled within us by the Creator, we had transferred to evil uses and consumed in the practice of vices, abandoning the fountain of virtues, journeying far from the Father—not in places and regions, but departing in hearts and deeds.
For he who follows his own desires and is carried away by his passions becomes an exile from God. To whom we return with the recognition of sins, and indeed returning not with the steps of the body, but with the affection of the mind.
He comes to meet us with immense mercy, with ineffable joy and consolation; He enters the festive banquet; arranges choirs and symphonies—the rejoicings of heavenly joys—with which angels rejoice in heaven over one sinner who repents.
Thus, for us returning to amendment, this banquet is celebrated daily; daily the Father receives his sons, Christ is always sacrificed for believers.
Therefore, this is the fatted calf whom we are taught to offer in the Old Testament: a calf and a bull, descending from the patriarchs and prophets, from the seed of Abraham: a male without blemish; a male, robust and strong against all sin. For it is of a masculine and manly spirit to break the temptations of sin, just as it is of feminine frailty to accept the lasciviousness of vice. Hence that Pharaoh, bearing the type of the devil, oppressing the people of God, an enemy to the spirit, a friend to the flesh, stifled virtues and nurtured desires.
Therefore, Christ died for our iniquities, and like a sheep, was led to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer, so He did not open His mouth  Isaiah chapter fifty-three, verse seven.
This is the lamb whom we are commanded by law to eat in one house, with our loins girded. But what does it mean to eat the head with the feet in one house? It means that in the unity of the Church, we are commanded to take up His flesh.
Thus, Arians and the various perversities of heretics do not eat Him in one house; and therefore, just as in the flood, only those who were found inside Noah's ark were saved, so people of different faiths, if they are outside the house of the Church, do not have the Lamb who is Christ.
That the Scripture reminds us to eat the head with the feet of this lamb means that we should acknowledge both God and man.
We honor him with a sincere confession. The head represents the divine nature, while the feet represent the human nature. We understand the head from what the blessed John says: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1); and the feet from what the Apostle Paul writes: "He emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men, and being found in human form" (Philippians 2:7); and, "Born of a woman, born under the law" (Galatians 4:4).
Therefore, it is necessary that we eat the flesh of such a lamb with our loins girded, that is, with carnal passions mortified, and with the utmost purity of heart and body. We must believe in the head and feet, that is, that he was born of God and born of a human. As I said, born of God, some less educated might say in their hearts: How did God beget a son? We should not think of anything physical here. What does it mean that God begot God, if not that fire appeared from fire, light proceeded from light?
Therefore, for those slow to understand, let us take some kind of analogy from earthly and visible things. For example, if a lamp is lit from another lamp, if one is illuminated from another, does it not seem to you that the flame somehow gave birth to splendor from splendor? Does it not seem to you that light was born from light in an incomprehensible manner? And when the flame is transferred from one lamp to another, although two lamps burn, the same fire indeed shines in the second as in the first. Was that fire made out of nothing or from some new beginning? Rather, it was poured out from the nature of its own splendor: therefore, the illumination which seems to be kindled from the first lamp did not begin to exist in the second as if from nothing, but proceeded from a related splendor, which already remained in the origin of the first light. And although a twin and double flame seems to shine in both lamps, both are of one substance; so also in the only begotten Son of God, although the persons are distinct, the nature is common, not beginning from the Father, but coexisting with the Father.
All things were created from nothing; He alone is God from God. Therefore, while he was in the form of God, he took the form of a servant for the salvation of servants; and while he was life, he was hung on the wood of the cross: as if he weighed himself as the price for the lost; he was struck with blows, crowned with thorns. The scarlet robe he wore represents the merits of the saints; similarly, it is then stained with the blood of martyrs in that scarlet color. When the Jews worshipped him clothed in a purple robe with a bent knee, whether they wanted to or not, they confessed him as King and Lord.
When he said on the cross "I thirst", he was seeking faith from his followers. But because he came to his own, and his own did not receive him, instead of the sweetness of faith, they offered him the vinegar of unbelief. They offer the vinegar of malice because they had lost the wine of wisdom they received from Christ by sinning. He drinks the bitterness of our wrongdoings to give us the sweetness of his goodness. Even now, when he is grieved and angered by sins, a sort of vinegar is given to him as drink and gall as food.
The veil of the temple is torn; the veil is the ornament of the dwelling. Therefore, with the grace shining, the Church is built, the Synagogue is destroyed, the temple’s veil is stripped of its honor, with the veil of the letter removed by the coming of Christ; so that with the Apostle, the inner parts of the law are revealed with an unveiled face. When the tombs are opened, the gates of death are unlocked, the saints are raised from their loosened graves with Christ: and while the heavens do not receive him, the underworld recognizes him as God.
Thus, recognizing the profound mysteries of divine benefits towards us, let us respond in whatever way we can to the mercy of the Redeemer: let us give him a contrite heart from the amendment of our sins for his thorns; let us offer him a heart pierced with fear for his nails; let us give him the palm of perseverance for his blows.
Sermon Six: Celebrating the Birth of Saint Peter with the Monks
By honoring the most glorious leaders of the Christian faith with annual celebrations, dear brothers, we also worship with due reverence God Himself and our Lord, who is the author of this faith.
The word apostle in Latin means "sent one"; therefore, those who honor the sent ones clearly honor the sender.
The dignity bestowed upon the ministers is undoubtedly shown to the one whose ministers they are, as the Savior Himself said to His disciples: whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever receives you receives me,  Luke 10:16.
Truly blessed are the merits of the apostles, in whom Christ proclaims Himself to be both received and heard; equally blessed are those whose devotion to the apostles returns to Christ.
Therefore, brothers, holding the faith of such a great promise, let us rejoice with faithful joys in the sufferings of our fathers, endured for the confession of Christ: because those who rejoice in the death of martyrs do not doubt that the martyrs reign with Christ after death.
Let us honor with the most pious efforts the most revered fathers of all churches, Peter and Paul, whose death today has become a day of birth thanks to the grace of Christ; for whom the end of life became the beginning of living; for whom, as the apostle Paul said, to live was Christ, and to die was gain.
Indeed, Christ was their life, for life was not without Christ for them; Christ was their life, because what they lived was for the benefit of Christ's churches.
For them, to die was gain, because by such a death they earned eternal life for themselves; to die was gain for them, whose corruption was succeeded by incorruption, and the losses of the present times were followed by eternal gains.
But now, dear ones, I think it necessary to speak of their own specific virtues, as much as the dryness of our tongue and the weakness of our mind allows, or rather as God mercifully grants.
This is Peter who, by confessing Christ the Lord to be the Son of the living God, established for us the most solid and invincible foundations of faith.
For when the Lord asked who people said He was, Peter answered: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God"  Matthew 16:16.
That is, you, Lord, made of the flesh of the Virgin, are the Christ, who is the eternal Son of the living God; you, Lord, born as a man among men, are with unimaginable majesty God with God.
You are the Christ, who, coming to suffer for our redemption, remain impassible with the Father.
Who, then, could have ever lifted their gaze to such a great mystery of the incomprehensible Deity, if not from the mouth of Peter the truth of this saving faith had shone forth?
Who can match the glory of his merits with any great speech, from whom the faith of the adorable Divinity both began and remains with us?
What is more glorious than this man, who declared the faith of the inscrutable mystery by speaking, taught it by living, and confirmed it by suffering?
To show the greatness of this confession, the Savior said to him: "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven; And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven"  Matthew 16:17.
Who, then, could have believed that Christ, born in the flesh and of the flesh, was the Son of the omnipotent Father, unless the Father Himself had graciously revealed it to us from heaven through Peter?
This confession granted him the keys of the heavenly kingdom before he entered the gates of heaven.
But, brothers, let no thoughts of the keys given to Peter be like our earthly keys; the key of heaven is the word of Peter, because the apostle judges the merits of each person, either closing or opening the kingdom of heaven to each one.
Therefore, this key is not made by the hand of any mortal craftsman, but the power of judging is given by Christ.
Finally, He said to him: "Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; whose sins you retain, they are retained"  John 20:23.
This is Peter, whom the waters beneath his feet proved to be the most confident in Christ.
For he faithfully asked his Lord to grant him new steps on the waves, and as the beloved he deserved it: he seemed to tremble for this reason alone, that human weakness might recognize how great the distance is between the Lord and the servant.
The flesh, weighed down by sins, sinks, and the spotless foot does not know how to slip. And also, lest Peter, walking on the water with an unhesitating foot, might have equaled his Lord in virtues by reaching Christ.
But why do we say he was so afraid, when his pious fear led to greater faith? For as Peter believed that by his Lord's command he could be sustained by the waves, so also, while he was sinking, he believed that by the Lord's power he would be saved. Truly blessed is Peter, and even when he was afraid, his faith was admirable, for the fear of imminent danger could not shake him. For as he was sinking, he cried out, "Lord, save me"  (Matthew 8:25), showing that he doubted himself, not the Lord.
Therefore, let no one consider this fear of the most glorious Peter a fault. Because this fear, although it disturbed his initial faith, adorned him with renewed confidence in faith. This is Peter, to whom Christ willingly granted the sharing of His name. For as the Apostle Paul taught, the rock was Christ. So through Christ, Peter was made the rock, as the Lord said to him: "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church"  (Matthew 16:18).
For just as, in the desert, water flowed from the rock for the thirsty people of the Lord, so to the whole world, weary with the dryness of unbelief, from the mouth of Peter emerged the spring of life-giving confession. This is Peter, to whom Christ, about to ascend to the Father, entrusted the feeding of His sheep and lambs. So that those whom He had redeemed by His mercy, Peter might preserve by the strength of his faith. And rightly indeed did the Son of God, the judge of hidden things, entrust the feeding and guarding of His sheep to him, knowing that in tending the Lord's flock, neither zeal nor faith would be lacking in him.
This is Peter, who, when he was being led to the cross as a disciple of the Crucified, asked to be crucified upside down. Not refusing the suffering but avoiding the equality with the Lord's cross, to show all the admirable virtue of humility and to keep the discipline of the new mystery even in torment. How confidently, dearest ones, Peter went to the cross, who, repelling the fear of death, sought the manner of dying in such bitter suffering.
What shall I say of the most glorious Paul, in whom the Lord chose the faith of His name while he was still persecuting it? While as a fierce persecutor he was ravaging the Christian Church, Christ found a friend in the heart of this enemy. And while he was taking Christians for temporal punishments, he himself, captured for eternal grace, suddenly became a shepherd from a wolf, a guardian from a robber, a defender from an enemy. Thus it was evident that neither did Paul persecute the Lord's people with an evil intention, nor did Christ fail to recognize whom He would choose in Paul.
This is Paul, who, called by Christ's voice from heaven, though his Jewish unbelief blinded his eyes, did not lose his vision but transformed it. He lost his sight and regained it, so that at the same time, a punishment for his persecution would proceed, and the grace of the calling God would illuminate the Church. For the Lord said to him from heaven: "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"  (Acts 9:4). That is, why are you persecuting me, Saul? What injustice of mine has stirred your hatred against me? Is it because I have given sight to the blind, healed the sick, driven out demons, fed hungry crowds with five loaves? Or because I have raised the dead from their graves? Or rather because I have promised the heavenly kingdom to my faithful?
But if you doubt that I can fulfill what I promise, look, if you can, from where I call you. But why do you persecute me, Saul, or what do you gain by persecuting me? Will your persecution have any effect against the one reigning in heaven? Can you harm me in any way, whom you cannot even see? For I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting  (Acts 22:8); who exchanged earth for heaven, the cross for the kingdom, death for eternity: from all this you should not hesitate, and now that you are saved and soon returned, your sight will persuade you.
But the most blessed Paul, indeed restrained by sudden blindness, understanding the majesty of the one speaking from heaven, immediately became faithful, ceased his persecution, and gained new eyes to see Christ.
Aulus, who, as a reward for his virtues, was taken up to heaven for the third time beyond human merit, learned the secrets of heaven; so that, as a future teacher of the churches, he might learn among the angels what he should preach among humans.
Who would dare not believe him, who speaks of the Lord’s sacraments not only from what he heard but also from what he saw?
How great, brothers, was the grace of our God that he was called from the heavens to apostleship so that his apostleship might be consecrated in heaven?
And after all, this is Paul who, having proudly raised his head against Christ's name, humbly submitted his neck to be struck by the sword of the unfaithful for the honor of Christ.
Nor did it trouble him to die for Him whom he had often proven to live and reign after death.
And so it happened that glorious Paul, who had fought many battles for the faith of Christ among various nations with great struggle, was received by Rome to triumph as a victor of the world.
These, then, are the most blessed Peter and Paul, who, preaching the mystery of the heavenly kingdom with one spirit, consecrated their teaching with holy blood and the strongest death on the same day of suffering.
Being made the leaders of all churches by heavenly dispensation, they sought Rome and placed their most sacred bodies in the stronghold of that city, which had obtained the leadership of the whole world.
So that Christ, showing the power of his virtue, might place the leaders of his kingdom where the world had the head of its empire.
Sermon Seven: Another Address to the Monks
The divine word instructs and encourages us on how we should prepare ourselves to seek His promises and obtain those blessings that cannot be grasped by sight, heard by ears, or comprehended by thought.
"Ask," He says, "and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
That is, we should ask through prayer, seek through labor, and knock through perseverance.
And we should be so driven by the hope of heavenly things, so inflamed with desire, that the magnitude of our desires matches the worthiness of the rewards.
For our God does not wish His good things to become cheap through excessive ease of finding.
A precious and desirable commodity requires a passionate lover and an eager merchant.
Therefore, the Promiser of such great gifts does not want you to be lukewarm in your efforts; He despises the disdainful, rejects the unwilling and ungrateful, and turns away from the undevoted.
To seek the grace of the divine gift slowly and with little gratitude is a great offense to the Giver.
Therefore, though we may toil with all the efforts of our soul and body, though we may be exercised with all the strength of obedience, we can offer nothing worthy to repay or compensate for heavenly goods.
The services of this temporal life are not equal to the joys of eternal life.
Though our limbs may grow weary with vigils, and our faces pale with fasting, yet the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us.
Let us knock, then, as much as we can, because we cannot do as much as we should.
Future happiness can be acquired, but it cannot be estimated.
Unless we act with eagerness, good will, and joy in the works of God, we know we are perishing in God's sight.
Do we think, beloved, that the soul which presumes to respond and say to a light command of the elder, "Are we your servants?" is seeking worthily and knocking so that it may be opened to it?
That soul says, "I have already done my part; let him do his."
How can he say this, to whom it is commanded, "Do not seek your own interests"?
And again, "Do not each seek his own interests"?
From whom is not required that he fulfill his own reward, but that he invade, preempt, and seize others?
Do we think that the one who, corrected for some negligence and disciplined according to the order, does not turn to amendment or satisfaction but rather to obstinacy, saying, "I desert and depart; I cannot bear this; I am a free man!" is asking so as to receive, seeking so as to find, knocking so as to have it opened to him?
Now, first of all, he who boasts of being free before the superior or abbot, I think he does not yet know he is bought.
He who is enlisted in the Christian military service and presumes to say he is free, almost denies that he is bought with Christ's blood.
What else is this but to cry out to the Lord Himself, "I am free; I owe you nothing"?
About such people, the Apostle said, "For when you were servants of disobedience, you were free from righteousness" (Romans 6:20).
He who is oppressed by the miserable slavery of vices is not rightly called free.
However, he cries out in the reproach of discipline and in the sin of his soul, "I prefer to depart rather than be corrected, rather than make satisfaction, rather than fulfill what you command."
What else is this but to shake off Christ's yoke with a rebellious neck?
Such people do not know what they have vowed; they have forgotten why they came here.
Such people do not ask rightly if they are wrongly attracted to vices; they do not knock with faith but are struck by unfaithfulness.
What good does it do to depart, who is bound everywhere by the chains of passions? Whom his own vices surround on all sides?
Someone would depart worthily if he could go where the devil could not find him.
Let no one deceive himself; do not flee the adversary from place to place, but from vice to virtue, from passion to correction.
If you flee from him, he will follow; correct yourself, and he will flee from you, as the apostle says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7).
But to disobey and to want to depart is to doubly do the devil's will; it is to voluntarily bring damnation upon oneself even in the present.
For those who grievously sin among us, we can find no more sorrowful or bitter sentence than to be cut off from the body of the congregation and depart without peace.
And is it not a kind of madness that this should be so?
Would anyone seek a remedy that even a superior cannot impose except for the most serious crime? Let us understand, then, that these indignities and contradictions come about with the enemy cooperating and arranging them. For he who cannot absolutely drive someone from a place of salvation first sends opportunities and causes; he sends the passion of disobedience, which is always accompanied by disbelief. Once it has captured the mind, it immediately makes even small things seem intolerable and impossible.
And indeed, there is no doubt that strength is divinely withdrawn from the disobedient. Just as he who does not have the necessary devotion of faith will have even what he has taken away from him as stated in Matthew 13, so disobedience hardens the mind it has once seized, so that it is neither swayed by authority nor by reason to accept commands. What is worse, it believes only in itself and follows its own intentions instead of any reason, thinking this is the only command it conceived with a hardened heart. It becomes like what the divine word proclaims: "The way of fools seems right to them" (Proverbs 12). And again: "There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end, it leads to death" (Proverbs 16).
Finally, such souls will experience what happened to the house built on sand. This parable especially refers to the disobedient. For we read in Matthew 7: "Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand." That is, when the torrents of passions flow, when the floods and torrents of tribulations come from many negligences, when the winds blow—those winds that fly through this air ready to scatter Christ’s chaff wherever they find it—then they will attack that house found without the foundation of obedience, and its fall will be great.
But perhaps someone might say: Is it immediately called a ruin to leave this place? I say, beloved, it is not a great hope if a ship caught in the waves, though it does not perish, still suffers great loss of honor and goods and arrives at the port empty. Similarly, it is not a great joy if someone returns to the waves of the world, seeming to keep the name and habit of their profession, while their soul wastes away and dissolves due to negligence. What is graver than suddenly, like one uprooted from the place where your Lord called you, where He first brought you into a port from the storm of the world, to suddenly forget the fellowship and consolation of your brothers; to forget the place where you first shed the sweetest habit and name of the secular?
Even birds love their nests; wild animals love the places where they were raised. They love their dens and pastures; no matter how far they are taken by their natural freedom to various places, they often return to the places dear to them with a certain longing. And you, endowed with intellect and fortified by reason, sometimes become so alienated in your senses that you prefer your wishes or intentions to the benefits of God, and follow the insinuations of the devil! Although they may lead you to hard labors, although they may drag you to the shipwreck of salvation and the detriment of the soul, you do not feel any of this due to the excessive indignation of your heart!
At the time of departure, the enemy promises many things: that you will find greater progress, much grace, and abundance of everything where you are heading, and that you will be received like an angel. And after this, when filled with anxiety and stripped of peace, you leave the pursuit of your progress and the sacred fold. Then you realize, as the storm of time calms, what you have done wrong. Then you recognize the danger you incurred when you left the place to which you came with joy, without peace, with scandal. Then late repentance laments and weeps over its own ruins, just like certain birds that are said to weep over those they have killed. All these detriments to the soul come from the evil of disobedience.
However, obedient and humble souls overcome many tribulations and all labors.
They send it to the summary. It must be understood that the more humble and obedient we are to our superiors and our fathers, the more the Lord will respond to our prayers.
Let's see how acceptable to the Lord are the works or fasts of those who obey their own wills rather than those of their elders. They cry out: "Why have we fasted, and you have not seen? We have humbled our souls, and you did not know"; and He responds: "Because on the days of your fasting, your own will is found."
Therefore, we see that due to the disobedience of the spirit, works are not regarded, fasts are not heard, vows are not accepted. Hence, let us more diligently follow His commands, because He descended to us from heaven, not only to redeem us at the price of death but also to build an example of life; and let us say with Him: "I came not to do my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me."
To follow one's own will is so pernicious that God, angered, imposes it as a punishment for sin on the disobedient, saying: "So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts’ desires." Therefore, he who wants his works to be righteous in the sight of God should place nothing above obedience and precepts; whether he is young or old, he should strive even more for edification and perfection. He should not set any end to his progress, nor establish any boundary to his acquisitions, since he hears it said to him: "Prepare your work outside"; and again: "Do not fear to be justified unto death"; and again: "Wisdom is sung in the end."
The more we progress, the more we should humble ourselves: because the more we are humbled, the more we will progress. No elder should appear so unlearned as to think that obedience, which befits God, does not befit him; for humility and obedience are still necessities for the young, and already a dignity for the old. He who daily acts as if he were always beginning progresses well and finishes well. Therefore, Scripture declares that the increase of merits is the incentive of the perfect.
Concerning those who, while neglecting their initial lapses, always fall into new and new ones, it is said: "The sinner adds sin to sin"; but concerning the perfect, it is said: "And let the holy still be sanctified."
Let us first see what it means: "The sinner adds sin to sin." For example, if any passion of backbiting begins to attack me, if I do not immediately repent of this vice, tomorrow the ease and certain (so to speak) sweetness of this vice will come to me so that I cannot withdraw from it or restrain myself. Thus it happens that he who does not wish to amend himself at first begins in the future neither to wish nor to be able.
For example, I began to acquiesce to pride, I broke the rule, I offended the elder, I destroyed the younger: if I did not immediately repent of having been gravely overtaken, day by day the violence of habit and the impulse of passion will so delight me that I will no longer understand that I am sinning, nor feel that I am sinning: for the frequency of sinning obscures and overwhelms the understanding of sin.
Indeed, the heart of the negligent becomes so hardened that if he does not humble himself, if he does not make amends, he believes he is harming his superior, moreover, he insults and says: "How firmly I resisted him, how well I did not yield, how authoritatively I answered, did he think that I should always humble myself to him?" He who does this is clearly handed over to the devil, who rejoices in the vices, passions, and perdition of men, and such a soul will encounter that sentence: "The sinner adds sin to sin."
Let us avoid this, rather let us hold to the statement that says: "And let the holy still be sanctified," so that we may add merits daily, and presume nothing of ourselves, for everything we are is from God.
Therefore, let us be indefatigable in God's work for the sake of eternal reward, and strive daily for better things. Indeed, the very eagerness to grasp, the very habit of progressing, should always provoke us to greater things, and where God sees the devotion of the soul, He will suggest a more ardent desire; and the more we burn with zeal, the more He will add His help; the more we apply ourselves to diligence, the more He will add to our glory.
"For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have in abundance" (Matthew 25:29).
And in another place it says: I have placed help upon the mighty. Grace is born from grace, and progress serves progress. Gains make room for gains, and merits make room for merits, so that the more someone begins to acquire, the more they strive to acquire; and the more eagerly they draw from the goods of wisdom, the more they desire to draw.
As Wisdom itself speaks of itself: Those who eat of me will still be hungry Ecclesiasticus twenty-four.
Let us urge our course so that our life may flourish in the end.
Let us seek until the end, so that we may be worthy to rejoice without end.
But let it be so, if we cannot engage in physical labor, let us devote ourselves to the desire for spiritual goods, to the increase of contrition and charity.
If we daily set up ascents in our hearts, our minds cannot be tired by any weakness or age, so that we may be worthy to ascend by certain spiritual steps to the promises of our Lord Jesus Christ.
To whom be honor, power, and glory, strength and brightness, and magnificence, and dominion, now and always, and in all ages of ages. Amen.
Sermon Eight - A Warning About the Final Judgement
Now, dearest brothers, when the divine reading was read, we heard the blessed Apostle warning us both fearfully and beneficially. For he says: "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad"  (Second Corinthians 5:10). Therefore, the Lord also declares in the Gospel, saying: "The Son of Man will come in His glory with His angels, and then He will reward each according to their works"  (Matthew 16:27). Please listen carefully, dearest brothers, and be equally afraid with me; for He does not say that He will reward each according to His mercy, but according to their works. Here He is merciful; there He is just. For the fact that He does not immediately punish sinners is due to patience, not neglect. He does not lose power; but He has reserved us for repentance. Hence, it is more to be feared that the longer He waits for us to cease, the more severely He will condemn if we refuse to amend.
Since these things are so, we must know and understand, brothers, that nothing is more beneficial to us than to reject the pleasures of all present things and rather think about when we will leave this world or when, on the final day, we will lay down the tent of our body and receive it again at the time of resurrection, so that we may receive with it what we have done, whether good or bad. And therefore I ask you, brothers, to think about what kind of people we will be when we are presented before the purest eyes of the angels on the day of judgment and give an account to the eternal Judge from the books of conscience. For with all proofs removed, it is certain that on that day a person will stand before himself, and his soul will be shown in the mirror of his heart, and witnesses against him will be brought not from outside but from within himself, and not some foreign testimonies but very well-known ones, that is, his own works. His sins or crimes will be arranged before the unfortunate soul to shame it with proof and recognition, according to what is written: "I will rebuke you and lay the charge before you"  (Psalm 50:21). Whoever neglects to amend himself now, while it is permitted, will be the first to receive punishment from shame before that heavenly people, and the soul that now disregards the quick remedy of repentance to treat the putridness of sins will remain perpetually wounded without any remedy before that fearful tribunal.
Oh, if only we could now look with the eyes of the heart or body at the face of a sinful soul and bring the face of our conscience into the sight of our eyes! If it were permitted and could be said, with what effort and fear would we urge to set right the tainted, cleanse the stained, and heal the wounded. Therefore, since we cannot use the eyes of the body, let us look, as much as we can, with the eyes of the heart, and each of us place our consciences before the sight of our inner person, let us chastise ourselves, let us make daily correction from our conversation. Each soul should speak to itself in secret and say: Let us see if I have spent this day without sin, without envy, without slander, without murmuring. Let us see if today I have done something that pertains to the progress of the soul: I think I have lied today, been overcome by anger or desire, not done good to anyone, nor groaned in fear of eternal death. Who will give me back this day, which I lost in vain things and consumed with harmful and wicked thoughts? And if, brothers, we are pricked by all our negligences, in our beds, that is, in our hearts, let us condemn ourselves, let us accuse ourselves daily to our Judge, and while we are in this flesh, let us daily speak against this flesh, let us conquer our wills and intentions, while we await that most anticipated and blessed time of the happy change to eternal life. When what the Lord said happens: "They will be like the angels"  (Luke 20:36); and again: "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father"  (Matthew 13:43). Imagine what the splendor of souls will be like then...
The bodies will shine with the brightness of the sun; for when we reach that blessed state, there will be no sadness, no fear, no sickness, no death, and nothing will hinder us from serving our God. No sickness will stand in our way, no adversity of miserable flesh will oppose us, and there will no longer be any need to fight.
A time will come, I say, when no food will be desired, and all nourishment will be unnecessary. No fatigue from fasting will be felt, and no disturbance from the flesh or temptation from the enemy will be feared. But with the adversary cast into the depths of hell, we will enjoy this first happiness, beginning to neither want to sin nor be able to. With all wickedness, misery, and sorrow ceasing, innocence and happiness will fully reign.
No lesser misery, no greater envy will be feared, for they have been emptied, completely extinguished, and have passed away. In the hearts of men, the love of angels will shine, and humans, now mingled with celestial bodies, will shine without the weakness of flesh. And thus, they will no longer suffer any weariness from the eternal power of their Lord, nor any lack in their perpetual exultation of praise.
We will have full happiness among those immense blessings of our God, so that we never cease in giving thanks. Made co-heirs with Him who will say:  Come, blessed ones; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  Matthew 25:34.
Given by Him who lives and reigns forever and ever, Amen.
