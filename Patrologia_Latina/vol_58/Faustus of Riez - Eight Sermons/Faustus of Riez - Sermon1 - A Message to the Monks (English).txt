  <p>Dear brothers, we have gathered here not for rest, not for security, but for battle, for struggle. We have come here to fight against vices. Our life is our enemy, as Scripture says: "Beware lest you have any fellowship with them." <break time="500ms" /> We need constant vigilance and tireless guarding because this conflict is unending, and this enemy never makes peace. This enemy can be defeated but never befriended. Therefore, this battle we have taken on is very hard and very dangerous because it is fought within a person and only ends with the person. That's why we have come to these peaceful and spiritual camps, to fight our passions daily with relentless effort; to subdue our wills as if they were servants, to cut off the evils of the heart, or to dull the sword of the tongue. <break time="500ms" /> We must not only avoid harming each other but also be untouched by harm from others.</p>

  <p>Specifically, our profession requires us to seek no comfort in this life, no honor; to reject the comforts of the present world and prepare our minds for the promised rewards of eternal life. <break time="500ms" /> We should rejoice in submission and humility, eagerly seek poverty, and uproot not only our possessions but even our wills from our hearts. Sometimes, having nothing of our own is a necessity, but desiring nothing is a virtue.</p>

  <p>We must also understand that those of us who choose this life either strive diligently or negligently, with great risk. Therefore, blessed is the soul that, while living well in the community, brings joy to many, and many are either edified or enlightened by it. Good things, when shared with many, are increased. This is reflected in the wise saying: "My son, if you are wise, you are wise for yourself and your neighbors" (Proverbs 23:15). Thus, if anyone in the community shows humility or patience to those who follow, the good he provides to others is also returned to him. <break time="500ms" /> But if, on the contrary, he seeks through disobedience or pride, he will more easily find the worse path, leading others into evil or injustice. The harm he causes will bring him the danger of damnation, and the sin he once abandoned will come back to him many times over. Therefore, as much as someone is admirable and praiseworthy whose good conduct benefits many, so too is someone to be mourned whose life causes the downfall of many. <break time="500ms" /> Therefore, dear brothers, let us strive to do those things which build up the community, so that our path does not harm the virtues of others, and our lukewarmness does not weaken their fervor; and our anger does not violate their patience, and our pride does not corrupt their humility, and our ugliness does not taint their beauty: let us not extinguish the burning lamps of others if we cannot light our own. Indeed, those foolish virgins, foolish as they were, did not wish to extinguish others' lamps, but to light their own; and so, if any of us lack the rich grace of humility, or the fire of faith, or the flame of fervor, or the oil of charity, or the light of discretion, let him come to those he sees more abundantly endowed, and by imitating, transfer their grace to himself, without taking it away from them, but enriching himself. <break time="500ms" /> The light of a burning fire is never diminished by lighting many flames, nor is the light of the sun lessened by the multitude of those who look at it; it shares its gifts with many and remains whole.</p>

  <p>Blessed is the soul whose humility confounds another’s pride, whose patience extinguishes another’s anger, whose obedience silently rebukes another’s laziness; whose fervor...</p>


<p>He awakens even the warmth of another, who illuminates the troubled eye of his neighbor's heart with the grace of consolation and edification. It is better for him than for the one who, seeing his brother slightly saddened by someone, does not extend a hand of comfort to help him, but instead, like a leaning wall, aids his downfall through malicious speech and incites him with harmful advice, so as to crush him; he arms him to destroy him.</p>

<p>Therefore, brothers, if one's own misdeeds are not enough, he acts in such a way that he also incurs the judgment of another's destruction. We are certain, dearest ones, that unless we are cautious, unless we cut back and circumcise our daily passions, we will become much worse than we were while we lived in this world: so much so that our end will be worse than our beginning. Indeed, dear ones, as long as we were engaged in worldly activities and businesses, in which we are now ashamed, the adversary did not stand in our way, but even consented because he found nothing in our miserable and lost life to exercise his envy. Our deeds delighted him, and our sins and crimes were enough for him by themselves. For who wages war against his own soldier, and who wants to attack his own subject? But more unfortunate was the life of the one whom the enemy disdained to harm.</p>

<p>But now, after we have renounced his pleasures, he saw his followers return to the service of their former master, he saw in us his idols being transformed into God's temple, and gnashing his teeth and roaring like a lion, the ever-watchful plotter searches for all means of harming us. The apostle testifies well about this lion: <break time="500ms" /> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="bi ˈælɜːt">Be alert</phoneme>, because your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour <break time="500ms" /> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="fɜːst ˈpiːtɜr">First Peter</phoneme> <w role="ivlnt">chapter</w> <w role="ivlnt">five</w>, <w role="ivlnt">verse</w> <w role="ivlnt">eight</w>. Blessed are those whom this lion judges worthy to seek and follow, certainly by the traces of virtues and the scent of merits. For he seeks only the good, because the evil come to him willingly. He pursues the good violently. He meets the evil negligently. Therefore, blessed are those whom this lion, driven by envy, seeks but malice does not allow him to find.</p>

<p>It sounds terribly in our ears when we hear "Like a roaring lion." But because it is said: "His chosen food; what he seeks is of choice; what he roars is of despair." As we read elsewhere: "He gnashes his teeth and melts away." Thus the divine word speaks, so that consolation is joined with terror. Indeed, it is of the cruel one to gnash; but of the defeated one to melt away. And among the many things prepared by God for man, the enemy's envy reveals itself.</p>

<p>Therefore, dearest ones, thinking of these things and sweating in this struggle, let us remember that we are disciples and children of our glorious and illustrious father, Saint Honoratus, who founded and led the Lérins Monastery, to whose monks Saint Faustus spoke, having himself been a monk of the same place before his episcopate. Let each of us seize what we can from the goods of our intestate parent. Let one take from the inheritance the precious variety of faith's deeds. Let another occupy the talent of meekness and simplicity. Let another claim for himself the ornament of benevolence and wisdom from the heart. Let another take hold of the pearl of compunction and the treasure of chastity. For although that very wealthy friend of God took with him all that he had intact, he still left everything to us if we wish. Therefore, let us follow his good deeds, so that he who will be raised to eternal glory at the end of the ages may now rise again in the divine offspring of the Church through the merits of his children.</p>
