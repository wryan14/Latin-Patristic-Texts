    <s>As God supports and in a way commands it with charity, and with your brotherhood, I offer whatever sermon I can.</s>
    <s>I do this not out of presumption, but out of true and complete love.</s>
    <s>And although you are so perfect by God's grace that you don't need our admonition at all, yet with commanding charity that knows no fear, we dare to suggest and admonish with true humility and perfect love what we know you already fulfill excellently, though not without embarrassment, since we know ourselves to still be unworthy disciples and seem to be urging teachers to holy work.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Though we are lukewarm, we are forced to admonish the fervent; though we are sinners, we argue with the just; though we are unskilled, we instruct teachers; though we are tossed by the waves of this world's sea, we speak words of prediction to those who have happily reached the port.</s>
    <s>But, dearest brothers, as ships, having overcome and defeated the sea's waves, still struggle even in the safest port and, without great caution, almost sink; we humbly and reverently advise that, since Christ has freed you from major crimes as from dangerous waves, placed in the port of peace and happiness, you should continuously and vigilantly, with Christ's help, strive to bail out small negligences and minor sins that gather in the soul like drops through tiny cracks in a ship's bilge.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For just as a ship that has escaped the sea's waves will be filled and sunk by small drops if not bailed out in port, so a monk, having overcome the crimes of this world like dangerous waves, if he neglects to bail out creeping vices and small daily sins from the bilge of his soul, faces shipwreck in the very port.</s>
    <s>But someone might ask, how can a soul be bailed out?</s>
    <s>Certainly, by praying, fasting, watching, and showing true love, true humility, and true obedience.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Consider, brothers, how a ship is bailed out with a bucket; likewise, a soul is freed from bad deeds by the Lord's prayer if it says and truly says: <break time="500ms" /> "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors" <break time="500ms" /> <sub alias="Matthew">Matthew</sub> 6:12.</s>
    <s>For whoever mercifully forgives everyone who sins against him, no trace of sin will remain in his soul.</s>
    <s>Consider, brothers, and understand what I said: whoever forgives one who sins against him, I did not say you should forgive one who sins against God, which is worse; sometimes we forgive those who sin against us either late or difficultly, but we quickly forgive those who sin against God.</s>
    <s>But if we want to act justly, we should not forgive those who sin against God without the strictest discipline, lest by indiscreet mercy towards them, we set an example of ruin to others.</s>
    <s>Therefore, each one should show mercy in his own case, for the Lord said: <break time="500ms" /> "If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you" <break time="500ms" /> <sub alias="Matthew">Matthew</sub> 6:14.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>However, when someone presumes to commit a sin against God, he should endure monastic discipline.</s>
    <s>And this should be done with a pious mind, so that he is corrected by spiritual chastisement in this world and does not perish in the future: because every sin that is not corrected in this world will be punished in the future world.</s>
    <s>For divine Scripture mentions about the son and the servant: <break time="500ms" /> "You will strike him with a rod and rescue his soul from hell" <break time="500ms" /> <sub alias="Proverbs">Proverbs</sub> 23:14.</s>
    <s>And therefore, as I suggested above, let us avoid not only major crimes but also small negligences that we daily breathe in as the devil’s poison.</s>
    <s>For there are some who, after professing religion and seeming to leave the world, become lax with excessive security, and the Lord's sentence is fulfilled in them which says: <break time="500ms" /> "I wish you were either cold or hot: but because you are lukewarm, I will begin to spit you out of my mouth" <break time="500ms" /> <sub alias="Revelation">Revelation</sub> 3:15.</s>
    <s>What did He mean by saying: I wish you were hot or cold? Now, because you have both left the world and refused to grasp spiritual fervor due to your negligence, you have become lukewarm.</s>
  </p>


  <p>From the mouth of the Lord, you will be spewed out, scarcely to be taken back again.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, dearest brothers, pay close attention to the message of the divine Scripture, which says: <s>Guard your heart with all vigilance</s> <sub alias="Proverbs chapter four, verse twenty-three">(Proverbs 4:23)</sub>. Just as we should rejoice over a monk who wishes to exhibit gentleness, obedience, patience, meekness, and humility in the monastery, so we should mourn for the one who only appears to have left this world physically but is known to have remained in it unfaithfully in heart or returned to it unhappily. Such a person shows pride instead of humility, anger instead of patience, contempt instead of obedience, and spreads the poison of malice instead of the medicine of charity. The true and much-feared judgment of blessed Peter applies to such individuals. He says, <s>it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after knowing it, to turn back</s> <sub alias="Second Peter chapter two, verse twenty">(2 Peter 2:20)</sub>. And again: <s>A dog returns to its vomit, and a sow that is washed returns to wallowing in the mud</s> <sub alias="Second Peter chapter two, verse twenty-one">(2 Peter 2:21)</sub>.</p>
  
  <p>But we should not despair over such people, brothers, because God is able to ignite a spark of repentance in them through your prayers and to consume all worldly pleasures like thorns and thistles of evil with a healthy fire, the fire of which the Lord said: <s>I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled</s> <sub alias="Luke chapter twelve, verse forty-nine">(Luke 12:49)</sub>.</p>

  <p>Therefore, beloved brothers, pray not only that God may grant you good perseverance but also that those who are negligent may finally lift themselves out of the pit of pride and escape from its snares. For if, through your prayers and loving advice, those who are lukewarm and negligent are corrected, the Lord will deem it worthy to reward you doubly for both your own and their correction. Neither should those who are good exalt themselves as if by their own merits, nor should those who are negligent despair of God's mercy. Rather, the good should guard God's gifts with humility, and the negligent should quickly flee to repentance and the remedies of correction with great contrition. For the good person, if they begin to be proud, will be humbled; and the proud person, if they humble themselves, will be lifted up by God's mercy. The key is not to allow oneself to be pressed further by a harsh yoke or to be hardened longer by dangerous and excessive neglect in sins. Instead, one should quickly flee to God's mercy so that no trace of sin remains. A balm or suture is best applied to fresh wounds; for if one’s intention to rise is swift to seek the heavenly doctor, the trace of sin will not remain. Under the hand of the Almighty Doctor, the sickness quickly disappears, and the patient is swiftly healed.</p>

  <p>Again and again, I ask and urge you, brothers, to continually strive to show obedience, humility, and charity not only to elders and equals but also to those younger. For whatever good a servant of God strives to possess, they lose it all quickly if they do not have true humility and charity. Do not grumble, brothers; for it is written that those who grumbled perished by serpents. Do not slander, brothers, for it is written: <s>Whoever slanders their brother will be uprooted</s>. Do not hold anger in your heart, for it is written: <s>Human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires</s> <sub alias="James chapter one, verse twenty">(James 1:20)</sub>. Do not hate one another, because it is written: <s>Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer</s> <sub alias="First John chapter three, verse fifteen">(1 John 3:15)</sub>. But there is no need to teach your holy charity with many words, for we know and rejoice that you fulfill it with your deeds for Christ's glory. We only ask this specifically, that since God has deemed it worthy to place you in a place of peace and tranquility, pray more abundantly to the Lord for us, who are afflicted by the storms and countless waves of this world. So that if glory is not given to us, who are unworthy, at least the forgiveness of sins may be granted to us through your prayers. Amen.</p>
