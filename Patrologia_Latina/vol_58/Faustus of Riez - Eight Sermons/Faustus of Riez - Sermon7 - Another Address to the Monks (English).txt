      The divine word instructs and encourages us on how we should prepare ourselves to seek His promises and obtain those blessings that cannot be grasped by sight, heard by ears, or comprehended by thought.

      That is, we should ask through prayer, seek through labor, and knock through perseverance.

      To seek the grace of the divine gift slowly and with little gratitude is a great offense to the Giver.

    <s>
      Do we think, beloved, that the soul which presumes to respond and say to a light command of the elder, "Are we your servants?" is seeking worthily and knocking so that it may be opened to it?
    </s>
    <s>
      That soul says, "I have already done my part; let him do his."
    </s>
    <s>
      How can he say this, to whom it is commanded, "Do not seek your own interests"?

    <s>
      Do we think that the one who, corrected for some negligence and disciplined according to the order, does not turn to amendment or satisfaction but rather to obstinacy, saying, "I desert and depart; I cannot bear this; I am a free man!" is asking so as to receive, seeking so as to find, knocking so as to have it opened to him?
    </s>
    <s>
      Now, first of all, he who boasts of being free before the superior or abbot, I think he does not yet know he is bought.

      He who is enlisted in the Christian military service and presumes to say he is free, almost denies that he is bought with Christ's blood.

    <s>
      What else is this but to cry out to the Lord Himself, "I am free; I owe you nothing"?

      About such people, the Apostle said, "For when you were servants of disobedience, you were free from righteousness" (Romans 6:20).

      He who is oppressed by the miserable slavery of vices is not rightly called free.

      However, he cries out in the reproach of discipline and in the sin of his soul, "I prefer to depart rather than be corrected, rather than make satisfaction, rather than fulfill what you command."
    </s>
    <s>
      What else is this but to shake off Christ's yoke with a rebellious neck?
    </s>
    <s>
      Such people do not know what they have vowed; they have forgotten why they came here.
    </s>
    <s>
      Such people do not ask rightly if they are wrongly attracted to vices; they do not knock with faith but are struck by unfaithfulness.

    <s>
      What good does it do to depart, who is bound everywhere by the chains of passions? Whom his own vices surround on all sides?
    </s>
    <s>
      Someone would depart worthily if he could go where the devil could not find him.
    </s>
    <s>
      Let no one deceive himself; do not flee the adversary from place to place, but from vice to virtue, from passion to correction.
    </s>
    <s>
      If you flee from him, he will follow; correct yourself, and he will flee from you, as the apostle says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7).
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      But to disobey and to want to depart is to doubly do the devil's will; it is to voluntarily bring damnation upon oneself even in the present.
    </s>
    <s>
      For those who grievously sin among us, we can find no more sorrowful or bitter sentence than to be cut off from the body of the congregation and depart without peace.
    </s>
    <s>
      And is it not a kind of madness that this should be so?
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    Would anyone seek a remedy that even a superior cannot impose except for the most serious crime? Let us understand, then, that these indignities and contradictions come about with the enemy cooperating and arranging them. For he who cannot absolutely drive someone from a place of salvation first sends opportunities and causes; he sends the passion of disobedience, which is always accompanied by disbelief. Once it has captured the mind, it immediately makes even small things seem intolerable and impossible.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And indeed, there is no doubt that strength is divinely withdrawn from the disobedient. Just as he who does not have the necessary devotion of faith will have even what he has taken away from him as stated in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈmæθ.juː">Matthew</phoneme> <sub alias="thirteen">13</sub>, so disobedience hardens the mind it has once seized, so that it is neither swayed by authority nor by reason to accept commands. What is worse, it believes only in itself and follows its own intentions instead of any reason, thinking this is the only command it conceived with a hardened heart. It becomes like what the divine word proclaims: "The way of fools seems right to them" (Proverbs 12). And again: "There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end, it leads to death" (Proverbs 16).
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, such souls will experience what happened to the house built on sand. This parable especially refers to the disobedient. For we read in <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈmæθ.juː">Matthew</phoneme> <sub alias="seven">7</sub>: "Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand." That is, when the torrents of passions flow, when the floods and torrents of tribulations come from many negligences, when the winds blow—those winds that fly through this air ready to scatter Christ’s chaff wherever they find it—then they will attack that house found without the foundation of obedience, and its fall will be great.
  </p>

  <p>
    But perhaps someone might say: Is it immediately called a ruin to leave this place? I say, beloved, it is not a great hope if a ship caught in the waves, though it does not perish, still suffers great loss of honor and goods and arrives at the port empty. Similarly, it is not a great joy if someone returns to the waves of the world, seeming to keep the name and habit of their profession, while their soul wastes away and dissolves due to negligence. What is graver than suddenly, like one uprooted from the place where your Lord called you, where He first brought you into a port from the storm of the world, to suddenly forget the fellowship and consolation of your brothers; to forget the place where you first shed the sweetest habit and name of the secular?
  </p>

  <p>
    Even birds love their nests; wild animals love the places where they were raised. They love their dens and pastures; no matter how far they are taken by their natural freedom to various places, they often return to the places dear to them with a certain longing. And you, endowed with intellect and fortified by reason, sometimes become so alienated in your senses that you prefer your wishes or intentions to the benefits of God, and follow the insinuations of the devil! Although they may lead you to hard labors, although they may drag you to the shipwreck of salvation and the detriment of the soul, you do not feel any of this due to the excessive indignation of your heart!
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time of departure, the enemy promises many things: that you will find greater progress, much grace, and abundance of everything where you are heading, and that you will be received like an angel. And after this, when filled with anxiety and stripped of peace, you leave the pursuit of your progress and the sacred fold. Then you realize, as the storm of time calms, what you have done wrong. Then you recognize the danger you incurred when you left the place to which you came with joy, without peace, with scandal. Then late repentance laments and weeps over its own ruins, just like certain birds that are said to weep over those they have killed. All these detriments to the soul come from the evil of disobedience.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, obedient and humble souls overcome many tribulations and all labors.
  </p>


    <p>
        They send it to the summary. It must be understood that the more humble and obedient we are to our superiors and our fathers, the more the Lord will respond to our prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's see how acceptable to the Lord are the works or fasts of those who obey their own wills rather than those of their elders. They cry out: "Why have we fasted, and you have not seen? We have humbled our souls, and you did not know"; and He responds: "Because on the days of your fasting, your own will is found."
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we see that due to the disobedience of the spirit, works are not regarded, fasts are not heard, vows are not accepted. Hence, let us more diligently follow His commands, because He descended to us from heaven, not only to redeem us at the price of death but also to build an example of life; and let us say with Him: "I came not to do my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me."
    </p>
    <p>
        To follow one's own will is so pernicious that God, angered, imposes it as a punishment for sin on the disobedient, saying: "So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts’ desires." Therefore, he who wants his works to be righteous in the sight of God should place nothing above obedience and precepts; whether he is young or old, he should strive even more for edification and perfection. He should not set any end to his progress, nor establish any boundary to his acquisitions, since he hears it said to him: "Prepare your work outside"; and again: "Do not fear to be justified unto death"; and again: "Wisdom is sung in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
        The more we progress, the more we should humble ourselves: because the more we are humbled, the more we will progress. No elder should appear so unlearned as to think that obedience, which befits God, does not befit him; for humility and obedience are still necessities for the young, and already a dignity for the old. He who daily acts as if he were always beginning progresses well and finishes well. Therefore, Scripture declares that the increase of merits is the incentive of the perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concerning those who, while neglecting their initial lapses, always fall into new and new ones, it is said: "The sinner adds sin to sin"; but concerning the perfect, it is said: "And let the holy still be sanctified."
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us first see what it means: "The sinner adds sin to sin." For example, if any passion of backbiting begins to attack me, if I do not immediately repent of this vice, tomorrow the ease and certain (so to speak) sweetness of this vice will come to me so that I cannot withdraw from it or restrain myself. Thus it happens that he who does not wish to amend himself at first begins in the future neither to wish nor to be able.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, I began to acquiesce to pride, I broke the rule, I offended the elder, I destroyed the younger: if I did not immediately repent of having been gravely overtaken, day by day the violence of habit and the impulse of passion will so delight me that I will no longer understand that I am sinning, nor feel that I am sinning: for the frequency of sinning obscures and overwhelms the understanding of sin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, the heart of the negligent becomes so hardened that if he does not humble himself, if he does not make amends, he believes he is harming his superior, moreover, he insults and says: "How firmly I resisted him, how well I did not yield, how authoritatively I answered, did he think that I should always humble myself to him?" He who does this is clearly handed over to the devil, who rejoices in the vices, passions, and perdition of men, and such a soul will encounter that sentence: "The sinner adds sin to sin."
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us avoid this, rather let us hold to the statement that says: "And let the holy still be sanctified," so that we may add merits daily, and presume nothing of ourselves, for everything we are is from God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, let us be indefatigable in God's work for the sake of eternal reward, and strive daily for better things. Indeed, the very eagerness to grasp, the very habit of progressing, should always provoke us to greater things, and where God sees the devotion of the soul, He will suggest a more ardent desire; and the more we burn with zeal, the more He will add His help; the more we apply ourselves to diligence, the more He will add to our glory.
    </p>
    <p>
        "For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have in abundance" (Matthew 25:29).
    </p>

        <s>
            And in another place it says: I have placed help upon the mighty. Grace is born from grace, and progress serves progress. Gains make room for gains, and merits make room for merits, so that the more someone begins to acquire, the more they strive to acquire; and the more eagerly they draw from the goods of wisdom, the more they desire to draw.
