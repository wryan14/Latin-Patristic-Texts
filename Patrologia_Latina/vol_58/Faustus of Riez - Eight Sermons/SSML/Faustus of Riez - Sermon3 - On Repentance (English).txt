<break time="2s"/>Sermon Three:<break time="500ms"/>On Repentance<break time="2s"/>

<p>Let repentance be given to the layperson, whose neck still hangs under the yoke of the world. Let the time for this be determined according to the severity of the sin, for they are still bound by time. However, if someone renounces the world and its service, and vows to serve God all their days, why would they need to earn repentance when they have been set free and, like a wild donkey, seek the solitude of the desert? As Job says, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʤoʊb">Job</phoneme>: <break time="500ms" /> "Who let the wild donkey go free? I gave him the wasteland as his home" (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʤoʊb">Job</phoneme> 39:5-6).</p>

<p>They should be cautious of the lion and be nourished in the desert by sparse vegetation and a small drink. Let them lift their head to the sky and let the burning thirst be quenched by the breath of the Holy Spirit. Lest in their great desire for pleasant greenery, they fall into the danger of losing their salvation due to excessive indulgence.</p>

<p>Therefore, public repentance is not necessary for those who have renounced, because they have groaned in conversion and made an eternal pact with God. From that day on, their sins committed in the world are not remembered, as they have promised God to live justly from then on.</p>

<p>[Note: This shows that religious profession is like a second baptism, which washes away all sins committed in the world, as other holy Fathers also clearly teach.]</p>

<p>Therefore, after the written promise [Note: The pact was thus committed to writing, where the monks vowed to serve God perpetually, which Saint Benedict later also prescribed in the Rule, chapter 58.]</p>

<p>In which the monk promised to fulfill their duty with full faith, even if they sin in the world after renouncing it again, they should not hesitate to receive the Lord's body, lest excessive humility keep them away from the body and blood with which they have united to become one body. Therefore, they should not stop taking communion if they cease to sin, only that they should not sin from then on.</p>

<p>Just as this visible fire has two effects, to burn the fragile and to illuminate the dark, so the Lord's inflamed body, when taken with great fear and reverence, consumes the sins of the body and enlightens the mind of the soul. For this reason, they should receive communion more frequently.</p>

<p>If, however, there is, as it is written, leprosy on the skin, it will be impure, that is, sin in the monk. Because Scripture pronounces the monk to be the skin, mortifying their members on earth, whose flesh clings to their bones, which is changed by oil, weakened by fasting, and dries up like grass. Therefore, if leprosy is seen on this skin, it will be impure, and unless it is pure blue or red, it will not be suitable for the adornment of the tabernacle.</p>
