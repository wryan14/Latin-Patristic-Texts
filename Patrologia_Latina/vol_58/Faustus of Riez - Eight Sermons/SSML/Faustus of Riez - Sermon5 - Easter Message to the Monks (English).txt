      It is fitting and appropriate that on this significant day of celebration, we rise with a voice of rejoicing, and with the Apostle we say: <break time="300ms" /> "Now is the day of salvation" <break time="300ms" /> <sub alias="Second Corinthians">Second Corinthians</sub> chapter six.

      Today, the Egyptians are slain, and God's people, from the lowest and most meaningless works, are freed from the mud and straw. Today, the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world is offered for the redemption of human salvation. When the doorposts of houses are commanded to be marked with His blood—our foreheads painted with the sign of the cross—the destroying angel may not find a place.

      At this time, Pharaoh and his army are cast into the Red Sea, with sins perishing in the sacred font, just as the Egyptians are submerged in the Red Sea, consecrated by the blood of Christ.

      At this return, the fatted calf is sacrificed for the lost and found younger son, representing the salvation of the Gentiles. The younger son is us, while the older brother, representing the Jews, delay and refuse to enter. We return to our Creator with repentance for our sins, having squandered and lost the substance received from God our Father.

      Let us see what substance—that is, the goods of all nature—is. For the substance of God is everything we live, understand, and think: the intellect and reason to discern good and evil are God's substance; also, the freedom of choice we have received, either to avoid the enticements of sin or to stir the affection of free will in obedience to the Creator, or to maintain the image and likeness of God.

      Therefore, these riches given to us and instilled within us by the Creator, we had transferred to evil uses and consumed in the practice of vices, abandoning the fountain of virtues, journeying far from the Father—not in places and regions, but departing in hearts and deeds.

      For he who follows his own desires and is carried away by his passions becomes an exile from God. To whom we return with the recognition of sins, and indeed returning not with the steps of the body, but with the affection of the mind.

      Therefore, this is the fatted calf whom we are taught to offer in the Old Testament: a calf and a bull, descending from the patriarchs and prophets, from the seed of Abraham: a male without blemish; a male, robust and strong against all sin. For it is of a masculine and manly spirit to break the temptations of sin, just as it is of feminine frailty to accept the lasciviousness of vice. Hence that Pharaoh, bearing the type of the devil, oppressing the people of God, an enemy to the spirit, a friend to the flesh, stifled virtues and nurtured desires.

      Therefore, Christ died for our iniquities, and like a sheep, was led to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer, so He did not open His mouth <break time="300ms" /> <sub alias="Isaiah">Isaiah</sub> chapter fifty-three, verse seven.

      This is the lamb whom we are commanded by law to eat in one house, with our loins girded. But what does it mean to eat the head with the feet in one house? It means that in the unity of the Church, we are commanded to take up His flesh.

    <s>
      Thus, Arians and the various perversities of heretics do not eat Him in one house; and therefore, just as in the flood, only those who were found inside Noah's ark were saved, so people of different faiths, if they are outside the house of the Church, do not have the Lamb who is Christ.

    <s>
      That the Scripture reminds us to eat the head with the feet of this lamb means that we should acknowledge both God and man.
    </s>
  </p>


    <p>
        We honor him with a sincere confession. The head represents the divine nature, while the feet represent the human nature. We understand the head from what the blessed John says: <s>"In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1)</s>; and the feet from what the Apostle Paul writes: <s>"He emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men, and being found in human form" (Philippians 2:7)</s>; and, <s>"Born of a woman, born under the law" (Galatians 4:4)</s>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, it is necessary that we eat the flesh of such a lamb with our loins girded, that is, with carnal passions mortified, and with the utmost purity of heart and body. We must believe in the head and feet, that is, that he was born of God and born of a human. As I said, born of God, some less educated might say in their hearts: How did God beget a son? We should not think of anything physical here. What does it mean that God begot God, if not that fire appeared from fire, light proceeded from light?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, for those slow to understand, let us take some kind of analogy from earthly and visible things. For example, if a lamp is lit from another lamp, if one is illuminated from another, does it not seem to you that the flame somehow gave birth to splendor from splendor? Does it not seem to you that light was born from light in an incomprehensible manner? And when the flame is transferred from one lamp to another, although two lamps burn, the same fire indeed shines in the second as in the first. Was that fire made out of nothing or from some new beginning? Rather, it was poured out from the nature of its own splendor: therefore, the illumination which seems to be kindled from the first lamp did not begin to exist in the second as if from nothing, but proceeded from a related splendor, which already remained in the origin of the first light. And although a twin and double flame seems to shine in both lamps, both are of one substance; so also in the only begotten Son of God, although the persons are distinct, the nature is common, not beginning from the Father, but coexisting with the Father.

        All things were created from nothing; He alone is God from God. Therefore, while he was in the form of God, he took the form of a servant for the salvation of servants; and while he was life, he was hung on the wood of the cross: as if he weighed himself as the price for the lost; he was struck with blows, crowned with thorns. The scarlet robe he wore represents the merits of the saints; similarly, it is then stained with the blood of martyrs in that scarlet color. When the Jews worshipped him clothed in a purple robe with a bent knee, whether they wanted to or not, they confessed him as King and Lord.

        When he said on the cross <s>"I thirst"</s>, he was seeking faith from his followers. But because he came to his own, and his own did not receive him, instead of the sweetness of faith, they offered him the vinegar of unbelief. They offer the vinegar of malice because they had lost the wine of wisdom they received from Christ by sinning. He drinks the bitterness of our wrongdoings to give us the sweetness of his goodness. Even now, when he is grieved and angered by sins, a sort of vinegar is given to him as drink and gall as food.

        The veil of the temple is torn; the veil is the ornament of the dwelling. Therefore, with the grace shining, the Church is built, the Synagogue is destroyed, the temple’s veil is stripped of its honor, with the veil of the letter removed by the coming of Christ; so that with the Apostle, the inner parts of the law are revealed with an unveiled face. When the tombs are opened, the gates of death are unlocked, the saints are raised from their loosened graves with Christ: and while the heavens do not receive him, the underworld recognizes him as God.

    <p>
        Thus, recognizing the profound mysteries of divine benefits towards us, let us respond in whatever way we can to the mercy of the Redeemer: let us give him a contrite heart from the amendment of our sins for his thorns; let us offer him a heart pierced with fear for his nails; let us give him the palm of perseverance for his blows.
