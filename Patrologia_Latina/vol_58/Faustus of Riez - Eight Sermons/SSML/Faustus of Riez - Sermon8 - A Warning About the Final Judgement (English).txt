  <break time="2s"/>Sermon Eight: <break time="500ms"/> A Warning About the Final Judgement<break time="2s"/>
  <p>Now, dearest brothers, when the divine reading was read, we heard the blessed Apostle warning us both fearfully and beneficially. For he says: <s>"We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad" <break time="500ms" /> (Second Corinthians 5:10).</s> Therefore, the Lord also declares in the Gospel, saying: <s>"The Son of Man will come in His glory with His angels, and then He will reward each according to their works" <break time="500ms" /> (Matthew 16:27).</s> Please listen carefully, dearest brothers, and be equally afraid with me; for He does not say that He will reward each according to His mercy, but according to their works. Here He is merciful; there He is just. For the fact that He does not immediately punish sinners is due to patience, not neglect. He does not lose power; but He has reserved us for repentance. Hence, it is more to be feared that the longer He waits for us to cease, the more severely He will condemn if we refuse to amend.</p>
  
  <p>Since these things are so, we must know and understand, brothers, that nothing is more beneficial to us than to reject the pleasures of all present things and rather think about when we will leave this world or when, on the final day, we will lay down the tent of our body and receive it again at the time of resurrection, so that we may receive with it what we have done, whether good or bad. And therefore I ask you, brothers, to think about what kind of people we will be when we are presented before the purest eyes of the angels on the day of judgment and give an account to the eternal Judge from the books of conscience. For with all proofs removed, it is certain that on that day a person will stand before himself, and his soul will be shown in the mirror of his heart, and witnesses against him will be brought not from outside but from within himself, and not some foreign testimonies but very well-known ones, that is, his own works. His sins or crimes will be arranged before the unfortunate soul to shame it with proof and recognition, according to what is written: <s>"I will rebuke you and lay the charge before you" <break time="500ms" /> (Psalm 50:21).</s> Whoever neglects to amend himself now, while it is permitted, will be the first to receive punishment from shame before that heavenly people, and the soul that now disregards the quick remedy of repentance to treat the putridness of sins will remain perpetually wounded without any remedy before that fearful tribunal.</p>
  
  <p>Oh, if only we could now look with the eyes of the heart or body at the face of a sinful soul and bring the face of our conscience into the sight of our eyes! If it were permitted and could be said, with what effort and fear would we urge to set right the tainted, cleanse the stained, and heal the wounded. Therefore, since we cannot use the eyes of the body, let us look, as much as we can, with the eyes of the heart, and each of us place our consciences before the sight of our inner person, let us chastise ourselves, let us make daily correction from our conversation. Each soul should speak to itself in secret and say: Let us see if I have spent this day without sin, without envy, without slander, without murmuring. Let us see if today I have done something that pertains to the progress of the soul: I think I have lied today, been overcome by anger or desire, not done good to anyone, nor groaned in fear of eternal death. Who will give me back this day, which I lost in vain things and consumed with harmful and wicked thoughts? And if, brothers, we are pricked by all our negligences, in our beds, that is, in our hearts, let us condemn ourselves, let us accuse ourselves daily to our Judge, and while we are in this flesh, let us daily speak against this flesh, let us conquer our wills and intentions, while we await that most anticipated and blessed time of the happy change to eternal life. When what the Lord said happens: <s>"They will be like the angels" <break time="500ms" /> (Luke 20:36);</s> and again: <s>"Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father" <break time="500ms" /> (Matthew 13:43).</s> Imagine what the splendor of souls will be like then...</p>

  <p>
    The bodies will shine with the brightness of the sun; for when we reach that blessed state, there will be no sadness, no fear, no sickness, no death, and nothing will hinder us from serving our God. No sickness will stand in our way, no adversity of miserable flesh will oppose us, and there will no longer be any need to fight.
  </p>
  <p>
    A time will come, I say, when no food will be desired, and all nourishment will be unnecessary. No fatigue from fasting will be felt, and no disturbance from the flesh or temptation from the enemy will be feared. But with the adversary cast into the depths of hell, we will enjoy this first happiness, beginning to neither want to sin nor be able to. With all wickedness, misery, and sorrow ceasing, innocence and happiness will fully reign.
  </p>
  <p>
    No lesser misery, no greater envy will be feared, for they have been emptied, completely extinguished, and have passed away. In the hearts of men, the love of angels will shine, and humans, now mingled with celestial bodies, will shine without the weakness of flesh. And thus, they will no longer suffer any weariness from the eternal power of their Lord, nor any lack in their perpetual exultation of praise.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will have full happiness among those immense blessings of our God, so that we never cease in giving thanks. Made co-heirs with Him who will say: <break time="500ms" /> Come, blessed ones; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world <break time="500ms" /> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="mæθju">Matthew</phoneme> 25:34.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given by Him who lives and reigns forever and ever, Amen.
