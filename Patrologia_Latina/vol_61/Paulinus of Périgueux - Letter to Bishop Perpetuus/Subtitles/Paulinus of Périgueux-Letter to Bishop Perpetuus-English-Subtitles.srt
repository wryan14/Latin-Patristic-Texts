Letter from B. Paulinus to Perpetuus, Bishop.

2
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:10,416
To the holy and most blessed master, Bishop Perpetuus, from Paulinus.

3
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:19,846
You've once again given me the courage to speak, allowing my words to flow where I might have otherwise remained shamefully silent, rather than stumbling over unskilled verbosity.

4
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:29,856
You seek the suggestion of ongoing support: to share my wishes in words, holy and most blessed master, a special patron before the Lord, known for angelic conversation and apostolic dignity.

5
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:41,236
Driven by conscience, I thought even this was too much, feeling it reckless to approach such evident brightness of virtues, as if to be enlightened, fearing I might overshadow such a clear light with my own darkness.

6
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:50,983
But, understanding what I had written, you bolstered my confidence with your command, so those consecrated walls may still bear the marks of my verses, written as a remedy for weakness.

7
00:00:50,983 --> 00:01:04,997
I sent the verses through my most esteemed deacon, as per your instructions, so the page displayed on the wall would receive them, also mentioning the visit of my Nepotulus, whose recovery was aided by the virtue-inscribed document and your blessed hand's signature.

8
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:11,688
Your prayer will ensure that belief grows with support, and what we aim to achieve, because we are allowed to write, we pursue.
