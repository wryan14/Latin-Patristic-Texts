Behold, now is the acceptable time, behold, now is the day of salvation.

Behold, in these days we see fulfilled what is spoken by the voice of the prophet Isaiah:

Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.

Behold, a virgin has conceived without male seed, a virgin has given birth without any carnal corruption.

The birth of this same son increases the joy of the human people:

at his birth, the enemy of our substance is confounded with sorrow.

Indeed, that adversary of ours, who rose as Lucifer at dawn, who delighted in the food of the delights of God's paradise, fell from heaven and deserved to hear:

If you have been exalted like an eagle, you will be brought down shamefully by the Lord.

That enemy of human substance, who had said he would be like the Most High, fell through pride, roaring like a lion, seeking whom he may devour.

He does not seek the unfaithful man, not the angry man, not those who are outside, but seeks to bring down the humble, modest, rational person, or someone from the Church of Christ.

This envious one sent man, ejected from the paradise of God, into this misery and valley of tears, and wanted to separate the blessed Job from God, but could not.

To this spotless and simple man it is said: His strength is in his loins, and his power in his navel.

Therefore, through the disobedience of the first man, death and misery entered the world:

but through the birth of the second man, salvation and joy entered.

The star gave the sun:

the virgin gave birth to God as man without a man;

the rod gave birth to the flower.

If Mary had not remained a virgin, she certainly would not have given birth to the Son of God.

Oh, how praiseworthy is virginity!

The most blessed Isaiah says: A virgin shall come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall ascend from his root (Isaiah 11:1).

The virgin is the mother of Christ, simple, humble, and spotless, adhering to no external seed, and fruitful by union with the image of God.

It was indeed necessary for men that a virgin should conceive the Son of God, troublesome for Satan, but fruitful for us.

Of that flower which the rod of Jesse brought forth, it is written:

I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys.

If virginity did not benefit a virgin, the prophet would not have signified that a Virgin would be born of a Virgin.

However, widowhood is excellent, but virgin chastity is better.

The law of Moses, however, was given differently.

It is written: Blessed is he who has seed in Zion.

And Cursed is the barren woman who does not give birth.

And elsewhere: There was no infirm person among their tribes.

But in the law of our Lord Jesus Christ it is said: Rejoice, barren one: do not consider yourself a dry tree.

You will have a place for your sons and daughters forever.

Now even he who is weak becomes stronger, as the Apostle testifies, who says: I will gladly boast in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.

Therefore, because Christ was born before all ages from the eternal Father, it was the ineffable sacrament of divine power.

But when he appeared to us visibly from the virgin, as a man, it was for the sake of human salvation.

Death entered the world through Eve; lost life is restored through Mary.

After the Virgin conceived him in her womb, the Virgin gave birth to the light that illuminates every man coming into this world:

His government is upon his shoulder, who is the mighty God, the everlasting Father (Isaiah 9:7).

The curse pronounced against the whole human race was lifted.

Who could comprehend this secret of divine counsel, that a Virgin would conceive in the womb, that the Virgin would give birth to God, begotten of the Father before all, without a mother?

And the invisible God would appear through a visible man, and, assuming the condition of human mortality, would suffer death, conceived by no law of bodily generation but coming forth from the original womb under human law, and the same Mother would remain a virgin incorrupt?

Thus, Christ, born without a mother before the ages from the invisible Father, necessary not for himself but for the human race, is born a second time without a carnal father from a visible mother.

And since we were in danger through the disobedience of the first woman, it was fitting that we should be saved through a woman.

Let the human race rejoice, for Christ is born, and wrapped in humble swaddling clothes, is laid in a manger of animals.

The humility of the swaddling clothes is indeed a great and ineffable sacrament.

The cloths are worshipped by the Magi, and they offer gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the child lying in the manger, who reigns above the angelic creatures. 
 Gold is fitting for a king, the offering of frankincense for a great priest, and myrrh for the burial of the dead. 
Gold signifies the Son of God born of the Virgin, now reigning on earth.

Frankincense signifies the high priest offering himself as a sacrifice to the Heavenly Father on our behalf.

Myrrh signifies the same Son of the Virgin being buried and rising again for the salvation of the human race.

The swaddling clothes with which the Virgin mother wraps the infant represent our sins, as the prophet says: "Truly he has taken our infirmities, and carried our sorrows." 
Through these humble cloths, it is evident that he has taken on our sins.

The fact that he is placed between two animals is an inestimable mystery of God.

Behold, it is fulfilled what the voice of the prophet Habakkuk says: "Lord, I have heard your report, and I was afraid; I considered your works and was astonished: in the midst of two animals."

It is fitting that the Son of Man is placed among humble animals.

He is the life of men, the nourishment of angels, and the food of beasts.

It was necessary that he who was the living bread be placed in a manger between two animals.

He is the one who says: "I am the living bread that came down from heaven."

He is the spotless lamb, whose untouched body, after being handled by the priest and consumed by all the faithful, remains unblemished and unconsumed.

After the prophecy about the Virgin's birth was fulfilled and the patriarchs' proclamations were realized, and all that was to be done regarding Christ through the angel Gabriel was completed, it was fitting that a new man, coming from a pure man, a virgin born from a virgin, would acquire a new family for himself: 
so that he who was worshipped by angels in heaven would also establish angels for himself on earth.

Then he wanted to be baptized by John, the king by a soldier, the Lord by a servant.

Not because he had committed any crimes, but so that our sins would be erased through his baptism.

The water did not cleanse him; rather, by entering it, he blessed it, he who baptized in Spirit and truth.

Then, announcing the word of life and truth to the people, he found some to be disciples and others to be evangelists.

The twin brothers, James and John, left their father Zebedee and the boat to follow the Savior, unanimously giving up family care and blood ties.

After this, many other disciples were told by the Lord Jesus: "If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me." 
Thus, the divine Scripture contains it: No soldier goes to battle with his wife.

If anyone wants to follow the footsteps of the Redeemer, let him leave everything behind and not look back, like Lot's wife did: "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."

If anyone has the means to redeem his soul from the enemy's deceit, let him feed the poor, practice hospitality, and clothe the naked or those in shabby clothing.

When Christ wanted to ascend from earth to heaven, to move from the lower parts to the higher, as he had foretold his disciples long before, he endured death to free the dead from sin. 
He preached to show us the way of salvation.

He rose again to make the resurrected live.

Following in his footsteps, beloved, let us not please ourselves but God and our neighbor.

Thus, when Jesus announced peace to the people, he said to his disciples: "I did not come to do my will, but the will of him who sent me."

While the Son of Man fulfilled the will of God, the Jews said he sinned against God, but in reality, by not receiving the Son whom he had sent, they reproached the Father, and therefore they unjustly crucified the innocent Son of God.

Thus, the sins of the sinners fell upon Christ, who, though innocent, was killed as if he were a blasphemer.

Then the victorious Lord Jesus, stripping the places of darkness, rose on the third day and happily ascended to heaven from where he had descended.

How did humanity ascend unless the Deity first descended to the lower parts of the earth to unite with human nature?

The heavenly Deity descended so that the Redeemer could ascend.

Humanity.

He is one and the same person, always in the Father, always with the Father, and always has been with the Father.

After the ascension, he also sent the Holy Spirit, appearing in fiery tongues to the disciples.

The Spirit is indeed the power of the Son, which came from him and healed everyone.

It is said, however, to proceed from the Father and is usually referred to him: from whom he is also, and what is his.

For Christ himself testifies, saying: 
 "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me."

The Son has from the Father that he is God. For he is from God, God.

From him, he has that the Holy Spirit proceeds from him.

Therefore, dearest brothers, let us with due reverence celebrate the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Let us flee from pride, lest we be overwhelmed in hell, like the evil angels.

For in pride, man is inflated, shaken by greed, and delighted by ambition.

Do not boast of worldly riches; do not prefer yourselves to others, lest evil thoughts creep in.

And you who now desire gilded clothes, be pleased to sit in rags, so that you may please Christ: to whom is honor with the invisible Father through all ages of ages. Amen.
