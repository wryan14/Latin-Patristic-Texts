The Catholic faith believes and confesses not in three gods, but in one God, worships and venerates Him. 

Unity remains in the Trinity: the perfect Trinity consists in unity.

The true God, our Lord Jesus Christ, was born from the true Father according to divinity; according to humanity, He was born of the unstained virgin. 

The Holy Spirit proceeds from both, who turns the hearts of unbelievers to the acknowledgment of truth. 

The Son is equal to the unbegotten Father, the Holy Spirit is equal to the only-begotten Son; the Son, the eternal light, proceeds from the eternal light: an unfailing lamp shines forth from that invisible brightness. 

When the Virgin Mary, the Mother of the eternal Judge, was foretold to conceive by the Holy Spirit, and remaining a virgin, brought forth the Son of God to the earth, and after the miraculous birth, while maintaining her virginity, nourished Jesus Christ with divine milk. 

Oh, that holy angelic announcement!

The angel Gabriel is sent to a Virgin unaware of the mystical matter. 

The Mother of the Redeemer is likened to a servant when she responds to the angel; she says: 

"Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to your word."

Therefore, the Son of God, made flesh, to fulfill the word of the angel, was born of the glorious Virgin by divine inspiration: He is laid in a manger, then announced by an angel to shepherds. 

He rules all things reigning in heaven, and the little Son of God lies in a manger. 

He is nourished by the virgin mother, and adored by the wise men with gifts. 

To show us the humility of His power and the magnificence of His divinity, He possessed all things, as a man without sin.

He had no sin, endured death, and by His death offered us eternal life. 

Oh, the wondrous birth of the only-begotten Son of God! 

Oh, the marvelous preaching of the Son of Man! 

Oh, the unheard-of wisdom of such a young man!

The Son of God appeared in the synagogues and convinced all the scribes and doctors of the law by the Holy Spirit: yet He did not lack any power from the Holy Spirit, as He was the Son of God. 

For the Son, who is co-eternal with the eternal Father, never needed the help of another, because He is perfect and blessed forever. 

Wise men marvel at wisdom unheard of in the world.

For this reason, the Son of Man, betrayed by the impious and most wicked traitor Judas, is scourged by the Jews and followed with reproaches. 

Thus, Christ Jesus, who lowered Himself to voluntary humiliation for the sake of human frailty, indeed offered His own body, not for Himself, but for our redemption, to the eternal Father as a true sacrifice, a sacrifice pleasing to God in a sweet-smelling aroma. 

For what sacrifice or offering would He need when He existed free from all sin, as God?

Since all have sinned and need the grace of God, for human nature was sickened by sins and evil deeds: He, however, was not so, although He took the form of a servant and willingly accepted death.

The prophet David spoke of our Lord Jesus Christ when he said: 

"Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit" (Psalm 51).

For the Father is the beginning of all things, with whom the Son made all things, the King of kings, the Father of the universe, and the reformer of the decaying world. 

Amid these words, the holy man's pain from wounds and heart severely constrained him. 

What could he do? 

He saw the day of his death approaching and knew that the churches he had built within the walls were about to fall. 

Thus, he turned with tears and prayed, saying:

Almighty, most merciful God, who in your three holy patriarchs, namely Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, willed that your glorious name be invoked with a triple invocation, that through your only-begotten Son Jesus, the followers of the Catholic faith might recognize and fully believe that you are God in the perfect Trinity, the unbegotten Father, equal to the only-begotten Son, and comparable to the Holy Spirit: true Father, who begot the true Son before the foundation of the world and before the establishment of things, who sent the Holy Spirit proceeding from you from heaven to strengthen the hearts of your disciples and to glorify the name of Christ among men: whose true Trinity consists in unity, one Divinity remains in the Trinity, equal to the Son, equal to the Holy Spirit.

Who, descending into the womb of the undefiled Virgin, was pleased to take on the form of our servitude and, perfect God, to put on perfect man, so that, made flesh, he might help men and turn unbelievers to the way of truth, incarnate as man.

Who, after the Virgin's birth, placed as a child in a manger, showed the humility of his condition to himself. Who was shown by angels rejoicing to shepherds watching and to the wise men of Ethiopia following a star. Who endured the temptations of the devil and for us the reproaches and other torments, to free us from the snares of visible and invisible enemies, and to cleanse the stains of our sins, he bore the cross's gibbet to restore us to the glory of the heavenly court, which we lost through Adam.

And the Son of Man was incarnate, so that he might make the sons of men sons of God and partakers of heavenly goods. I beseech you, who became the author of our resurrection, to open for us the heavenly entrance, and to captivate the dominion of the devil, and ascending into heaven with your wonderful power to lead our captivity captive.

Who by your death gave life to the dead, and healing to the captive. I humbly invoke you, I mercifully appeal to you, to preserve and defend the Churches of Tournai, as much as I could elevate them with my smallness, and all the dwellings of the saints from every disturbance of demons, to elevate and exalt them.

Guard my small flock present and those to follow, unto the last generation, so that they may know that you are gentle, Father of mercy and compassion, giver of knowledge and truth. To those who pursued me, your unworthy servant, to death with swords and clubs, kindly forgive, and deign to gather me with your saints into your granary.

Also to those, most loving God, who will devoutly honor my memory, grant faith, confer friendship, most merciful God, as your mercy knows how to delight for the Catholic faith, for Christian religion. Indeed, all things are naked and open to your eyes. Behold, now the time of my release approaches.

Eternal God, what shall I do? Send me to follow David saying: As the deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, God. And again he says: My soul thirsts for the living God: when shall I come and appear before the face of God?

If it can be, allow me to be like Blessed Job, saying: I am compared to the dirt and am like dust and ashes. In you I trust, my God, I seek you, I desire to see you, whom I have always worshipped while on earth. To whom I have devoted myself with all my love. Free me, who are blessed forever and ever.

And soon, again bursting into praises of God, he said: The Catholic faith declares him to be the Son, to whom the Father cries out through the prophet, and says: You are my Son, today I have begotten you. And again: With you is the beginning on the day of your power in the splendors of saints, from the womb before the morning star I have begotten you.

He is Jesus Christ our Lord, equal to the Father, invisible, proceeding from the invisible, eternal from the eternal, immortal from the immortal. Who, uniting the nature of our humanity to himself according to subsistence, endured birth from the same corporeal and virginal womb. Not that he needed that glorious birth necessarily, but to sanctify the first fruits of our substance.

So that even when Christ, united in flesh, proceeded from the Blessed Virgin Mary, that miserable curse, which had been pronounced against all humankind, would cease, and no longer would souls and mortal bodies be destined to death. And to show that what the prophet had foretold with his voice was true: Death is swallowed up in victory. And elsewhere: God has wiped away every tear from every face.

He is Christ, the son of the Virgin Mary, who restored hearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, walked on the sea with dry feet, cast out demons, calmed winds and seas, cleansed lepers, healed paralytics, raised the dead, and said to the unbelieving Jews: If you do not believe my words.

If you don't believe, at least you should believe in the virtues and miracles.

There is one Son of God in Christ, who, just as He is truly the invisible Son of God, so He is truly the visible Christ. For the perfect God took on a perfect human form to provide perfect salvation for humanity.

And let us hear the prophet praying to the Holy Spirit and saying: "Do not take your Holy Spirit from me."

It is indeed a great rashness to separate the Son from the Father, the Father from the Son, or to consider the Holy Spirit as not proceeding from both. For God is inseparable, immutable, and impassible. The Son, as mentioned above, is equal to the Father. The Holy Spirit is neither superior nor better than Him, but equal to the Father, equal to the Son, proceeding from both. Almighty God sent the Holy Spirit into the world to glorify His only begotten Son.

Because Christ, the Son of God, performed human miracles, healed lepers, raised the dead, and did other unheard-of things in the world, and used the power of His own Spirit to demonstrate His divinity, He was said to be glorified by Him. However, it is not appropriate to claim that our Lord Jesus Christ was glorified by the Holy Spirit, as if He had used a power not His own, and had taken power against unclean spirits through the same Spirit. Rather, we should confess that it was His own Spirit through whom He performed such remarkable miracles.

It is also fitting for every believer to affirm that He offered the sacrifice not for Himself, but for the redemption of the human race to the Father, since He, who knew no sin, needed no sacrifice. Therefore, let the Catholic faith believe and affirm that His own life-giving flesh was made from His own Word. For, being naturally life, as God existing, because He is united to His own flesh, He declared it life-giving.

Because He says: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you will not have eternal life," we should not consider it as the flesh of just any man. According to its own nature, how could the flesh of just one man be life-giving?

Let the unhappy Jew flee. Let the heretic who denies the birth of Christ be destroyed. The faithful praise God as a Trinity in persons, but one God in substance. The miserable expect Him in wrath to be given infernal punishments, whose company the evil angels rejoice in, while the just expect rewards for their labors, whose company the angels of God congratulate, with the help of Him whose benefits are given to the weak, through whom joy is given to the afflicted. To whom be glory, dominion, and power, with the unbegotten Father and the Holy Spirit, for infinite ages of ages. Amen.
