Believe in one God, the all-powerful Father, and in His only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was born from God the Father as the only begotten Son, immeasurable from the immeasurable, immortal from the immortal, invisible from the invisible, eternal from the eternal, through whom and with whom the Father made all things contained in heaven, on earth, or in the sea.

Therefore, I urge you, beloved, believe that our Lord Jesus Christ came down from heaven for the salvation of humanity and the liberation of the world, was incarnate, and suffered as a man under the governor Pilate. Furthermore, on the third day, He rose from the dead, and again ascended into heaven, from where He had descended. These decrees, my most beloved children, you must hold and observe. You must devoutly obey them if you wish to earn heavenly joys. Obey these doctrines and decrees of the ancient Fathers, considering and clearly understanding what it means to be incarnate and that the Word of God became human.

For you should not assert that the nature of God changed, but rather that He joined to Himself a rational soul and animated flesh, and that Christ, the Son of God, became irreproachably, ineffably, substantially human, and was also called the son of man.

Therefore, Christ Jesus, who was born from the eternal Father before all ages, was also physically born from a woman, that is, the blessed Virgin Mary, not because His heavenly nature began from the holy Virgin, nor did He need to be born a second time, after that glorious birth He had from the Father. For it is not fitting, but rather foolish, to affirm that our Lord Jesus Christ, who is coeternal with the Father before all ages, needed a second generation from the Father, so that through the one He took on in the Virgin, He began to be.

However, the holy universal Catholic Church affirms and believes that for the salvation of humanity and the cleansing of sins, He joined human nature to Himself; and proceeded from the virginal womb, a pure womb, but most worthily preserved by heavenly angels. Therefore, the Catholic Fathers assert, and we by the authority of our elders, that He was born physically. He, being kind and merciful, wishing to turn all to the path of divinity, joined flesh to Himself from that virginal and uncontaminated womb, as said above, and underwent a physical birth, making His own birth from His own flesh.

Then believe that He was crucified, and on the third day rose from the dead: not because God the Word in His nature was struck under the governor Pilate, then affixed to the cross, or because He endured for us the piercings of the lance and nails, and so many wounds (for God is incorporeal and beyond suffering), but because that body, which became His own, endured these things for us. For this reason, it is said that He suffered all these things for all people for the redemption of sins. For in that body which suffered, God was present, who could in no way suffer.

Similarly, you should understand His death. For naturally, the life-giving Word of God is incorruptible and immortal. But because by the grace of God, His own body, according to the judgment of the teacher of the nations Paul, tasted death, it is said that God suffered death for us, not because He Himself experienced death, as far as His nature is concerned (for it would not be fitting, but rather absurd to assert this), but as we said above, His true flesh tasted death.

So, with His flesh rising again, affirm the resurrection, not because it fell into decay, but because His body rose again. Therefore, beloved, I beseech your brotherhood to devoutly worship the true God, and His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, adore with a kind heart, praise with a pure mind, confess with tearful sighs, not glorifying Him as a man with words, lest you introduce a kind of division, but honor Him as one and the same: because His body (with which He also sits with the Father) is not separate from the Word. Nor should you testify as if there were two sons sitting, but one with flesh through unity.

Your faith must believe that Christ, our Lord, became the mediator between God and humans, and the reconciler to bring peace with God the Father on our behalf, offering himself as a pleasing fragrance. For this reason, he said through the prophet: 

"You did not desire sacrifice and offering; burnt offerings for sin did not please you, but you prepared a body for me. It is written about me in the scroll, that I should do your will, God."

He did not offer his own body for himself, but for us as a pleasing fragrance.

My brothers, who among you still doubts that the true and spotless Lamb was sacrificed for the salvation of the human race and was crucified by the wicked Jews? He is the one who redeemed us through his marvelous power and the ineffable might of his divinity, defeated the rebellious and proud Jews, and stripped the gates of hell, bringing out the captives from their chains and sending out those imprisoned in the places of darkness, crying out and saying: 

"O good conqueror of the world, O holy defeater of the devil's deceit, our cries awaited you, most merciful Jesus, in these torments, our sighs called out to you, merciful Christ, in the gloomy places of the weeping. Behold, you have come, whom we awaited from ancient times. Free us, whom we once devotedly worshiped on earth."

He is the one who, after the destruction of the devil and the liberation of the saints from the darkness, rose on the third day and, ascending into the heavenly kingdom, sits at the right hand of God the Father. He is the Son of Mary, who conceived as a virgin by the Holy Spirit, who gave birth to both God and man while remaining a virgin even after giving birth, and who remained the Virgin and Mother of the Savior.

As mentioned above, he offered himself as a spotless sacrifice, a sacrifice pleasing to God the Father. But if anyone says that he offered this sacrifice for himself as well as for us, they will not escape the ultimate punishment but will suffer eternal torment with the wicked. Regarding the Holy Spirit, when he spoke with his disciples: 

"He will glorify me,"

understand, my children, that Christ is one and the Son, not needing another's glory, but confess that he received glory from the Holy Spirit because the Spirit is superior to him, better than him. Although in his essence, the Spirit is his, and is understood in his personal property, according to which the Spirit is his and the Son, he is not separate from him.

He is called the Spirit of Truth, and Christ is the Truth. Therefore, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son in the same way as from the Father. For the Holy Spirit, performing miracles through the hands of the holy apostles, glorified God, Jesus Christ, after his glorious resurrection, ascended into heaven (from where he had descended for the liberation of our souls). Therefore, Christ is believed by us and many other Catholic men to be God by nature, demonstrating his virtues and glorious miracles through his Spirit to the nations spread throughout the world. Hence, our Lord Jesus Christ said that 

"He will take from what is mine and announce it to you."

But the same Holy Spirit is not said to be powerful or wise by another's participation because he is perfect in all things and needs no good at all.

For the Holy Spirit is believed to be the paternal virtue and heavenly wisdom, that is, the Son, and therefore, by the very fact and virtue of his subsistence, virtue and wisdom are proven. Beloved brothers, this is the true faith, and it must be held by all Catholic men, for unless one believes firmly and rightly, they cannot be freed from the company of the devil. Confess one substance, three persons, so that you may be worthy to reach the heavenly kingdom and enjoy eternal goods forever, where the angels rejoice, the apostles are glad, the glorious crowd of martyrs exults, the company of confessors and virgins applaud, whom the Redeemer of the world crowns with an eternal laurel, who lives and reigns as God, almighty, invisible, eternal, incorruptible, to whom is honor, praise, glory, and dominion, undying power, unfading majesty, perpetual glory, and ineffable virtue with the Father and the Holy Spirit for infinite ages of ages. Amen.

But if anyone contradicts these decrees from the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit...

Meanwhile, for five years, the Church of Tournai, during which the indomitable priest survived, was elevated by the Catholic men. In the meantime, the part of the heretics was confused. What should they do? They took counsel, inquiring what should be done about him, and they said: If he prevails among us, our lives will be despised; but if we prevail, we will gain the victory of praise.

So, as they were conversing one day, behold, the blessed Pope, with the deacon Athanasius and the faithful disciple Audoenus, was leaving the church of Blessed Mary of Tournai; the heretics, seeing him and hidden behind a corner (for they lay in wait for him in many ways), said: Behold, the destroyer of our law, come, let us kill him. So, raising their clubs, they struck him hard and, leaving him half-dead in front of the church, secretly went away after inflicting wounds on him. Similarly, the disciples, leaving their shepherd, fled.

When Censorinus Caesar heard this, he would have had them all nailed to the cross, had it not been for the prayer of the man of God: a tumult arose throughout the city, the young men shouted, the matrons lamented, and the virgins sprinkled themselves with ashes, the old men hastened to see the half-dead prelate, and he lay lifeless, blood flowing from his holy head and from both sides.

Then, as he had requested, a bed of haircloth was prepared by the citizens of the city, and he was carried into his house: living for five more weeks, in that infirmity, he gave sight to a blind man and cured several sick people. Therefore, the end of the days of the most blessed Eleutherius approached, he called his brothers and the followers of the true religion, and openly received the body and blood of Christ, predicting that he would leave the bodily prison within the same week.

What could they do? They saw that their father desired heavenly things and wept that he was already about to leave the Christians, to whom he gently spoke: I am about to enter the end of all flesh, to receive the eternal joys promised to me by the Lord. I urge you, dearest ones, to flee hatred, sow concord, dissolve schisms, pursue virtue, endure temporary evils for your judge, so that you may deserve to present the worthy fruit of penance to Christ. For every man is like grass, and his flesh is like the stubble of the field. In the morning it blooms and flourishes, in the evening it withers and fades. Be patient, remain chaste, fear the Lord, persevere in all good things. For you have heard David saying: Man is made like vanity.

Therefore, we are dust, and in judgment, we will rise before the tribunal of Christ, as Scripture testifies, we will all stand. With these words said, such brightness shone upon the town where he was born, that all who came to the funeral of such a Father, being almost out of their minds, saw his spirit lifted by an angel in a cloud, and with the brightness of the cloud, penetrating the heavens, and the brightness flying with him, no longer appearing. Thus, bathed in the wave of sacred blood, the true martyr and confessor departed in peace. The day before the Kalends of July.

These things were done by the heretics on the seventh day before the Kalends of June, and in that same year, the blessed Eleutherius fell asleep in peace, reigning our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be honor and power through all ages of ages. Amen.
