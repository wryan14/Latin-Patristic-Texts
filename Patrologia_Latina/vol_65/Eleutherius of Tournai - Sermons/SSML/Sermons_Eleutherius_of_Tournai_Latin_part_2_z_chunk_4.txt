    In those times, while the blessed Eleutherius was the second bishop of the Church of Tournai, a great dispute arose among the clergy of Tournai. Some heretics were introducing certain new ideas of their own heresy and trying to destroy the preaching of the truth. They dared to corrupt the mystery of the divine dispensation and denied that the heavenly messenger had announced the virgin birth. Other heretics, causing confusion, wrongly claimed that the nature of the flesh and the deity were one, spreading the confusion that the divine nature of the only begotten was passible and impudently asserting that the pure man born of the most blessed Virgin Mary. Others opposed the Holy Spirit. However, those devoted to and serving God believed in the truth, not obeying falsehood.

    The dispute was so great that the heretics even attacked the Catholic children of the Church of Tournai, and many were killed and drowned in the river called the Scheldt. At the same time, the blessed bishop of the Church of Tournai had gone to Rome and had brought back with him the head of Mary of Egypt. He had secretly received it from the Roman Church of the blessed Apostle Peter and brought it to the Church of Mary, Mother of Christ.

    Thus, the man of God, returning from Rome, was received with great joy by all the people. The clergy, dressed in dalmatics, went to meet their blessed pastor, but suddenly the joy of all was doubled. For the bishop brought the relics of the blessed Mary, who had endured so many and such great sufferings. When he entered the gate of Nervia, a great miracle from God was revealed in that place. As the joyful people and the ranks of the clergy came forward, the blessed bishop, clothed in his cloak, ascended the hill called the Mount of Hidden Treasure, now called Mount Saint Andrew, and showed the relics of Saint Mary of Egypt and the Shoulder of the blessed Stephen the Protomartyr to all the people. Suddenly, a certain brightness appeared from heaven around the relics of the head of Saint Mary, which was seen by all until it entered the church of the Mother of Christ. Around the Shoulder of the blessed Stephen, a brighter light appeared in the form of a silver circle.

    When he entered the church, surrounded by the entire crowd of people, four men and two women, who were suffering from a great illness called the fire of hell, were present. Then the man of God, moved by compassion, placed the head before the women and the shoulder before the men, saying: Let us all pray. As they prostrated themselves and prayed, he said: Saint Stephen the Protomartyr, help these people: Saint Mary, have mercy on this female sex. We will not rise from prayer until they are made well. At this word, all were healed. The flesh they had lost due to the illness was restored at that very hour. A mute man standing by also spoke, saying: Behold the relics of the blessed Stephen and Saint Mary. Then all were amazed and astonished.

    In those times, the relics of the saints were not placed in gold or silver. These events took place on October 5th. Blessed Eleutherius had indeed ruled the Church of Tournai for 31 years and the Church of Blandin for 9 years. When he heard that the children of the Church were disturbed, he grieved. Then, by the authority of the Roman pope, he decreed that all heretics should be expelled from the city so that they might confess Christ, the Son of God the Father, with one accord. Thus, compelled by the bishop, they chose a fitting day on which Bishop Eleutherius of Christ would convene their synod. The day arrived when the synod was convened, and the Catholic children came, confounding the sect of the heretics. Some of the heretics who opposed them were also present. Then the holy man of God, Eleutherius, rose and, making a sign for silence with his hand, said: Listen, all who confess the Lord, the Father, and His Son, with the Holy Spirit.
