    <s>Fatherly authority encourages brotherly love to have faith and gently urges it to abstain from evil.</s>
    <s>We cry out, but no mortal listens.</s>
    <s>We call upon Christ, and Christ in heaven hears us.</s>
    <s>Nevertheless, let the unbelievers listen faithfully, and the foolish understand wisely.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>We believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of all things visible and invisible.</s>
    <s>We worship Christ, the perfect Son of the perfect Father.</s>
    <s>We revere the Paraclete, the Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>Just as the Father is without beginning, so too the Son, whose Father is God, remains without beginning.</s>
    <s>The Only-begotten, descending from the Unbegotten, has always been God, who has always remained the Son, whose Father we confess to be God.</s>

    <s>Before the world was made, the Father had the Word, possessed wisdom, and did not lose power.</s>
    <s>The Catholic Fathers testify that the Word is the power and wisdom of God, which we do not doubt has always existed.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>To believe more certainly that wisdom has existed from the beginning, let us hear what is clearly said:</s>
    <s>"I came forth from the mouth of the Most High."</s>
    <s>When the Most High established the firmament, secured the earth, and the fountain of water burst forth from the deep abyss, I was with the Father in the highest places, arranging all things with Him.</s>
    <s>And again it is said:</s>
    <s>"All wisdom is from the Lord God, and it was always with Him, and is before all time."</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>To show that the Word existed from the beginning, the Father more clearly declares, saying:</s>
    <s>"My heart has uttered a good Word" (Psalm Forty-Five: One).</s>
    <s>We believe that He is God, while the Father always remains:</s>
    <s>because the Word, Wisdom, and Strength are His Son.</s>

    <s>The prophets have foretold the birth of the Virgin Mary.</s>
    <s>Concerning the birth of Christ, the prophet Isaiah testifies, saying:</s>
    <s>"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Counselor, Mighty God; His authority and kingdom shall last forever" (Isaiah Nine: Seven).</s>
    <s>Thus, the Only-begotten of the Unbegotten Father, Christ, according to the flesh, was born from the seed of David, made a visible man, whose Father is the invisible God.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>It was necessary for the human race that the Virgin conceive Him whom the Father had begotten as invisible from the beginning, that the Virgin should bring forth for us as visible, and remain a virgin after childbirth.</s>
    <s>And He, who was begotten without a woman's union from the heavenly Father before all ages, was born a perfect man from the virginal womb, without a carnal father.</s>
    <s>For the Holy Spirit, entering the virginal chamber of modesty, caused such a Christ, made man, to proceed from her, who would restore what was lost and forgive all sins, who, innocent, would shed His innocent blood for the redemption of human frailty, and through the visible man, the invisible God would present His Only-begotten visible to men.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Therefore, Jesus Christ was born in the flesh and circumcised on the eighth day.</s>
    <s>In whose circumcision, just as circumcision ended, so through the baptism of Christ, the consecration of baptism had its beginning.</s>
    <s>The water of the Jordan did not sanctify Him by washing, but the waters were purified by the Son of God entering them.</s>
    <s>Thus, as the Father had foretold through His prophets, a virgin conceived, and the creature brought forth her Creator on earth.</s>
    <s>He rose on the third day after His passion and ascended into heaven, witnessed by the apostles.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Of His glorious passion, the Apostle Paul writes to the Philippians, saying:</s>
    <s>"Though He was in the form of God, He did not count equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in human form, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross" (Philippians Two: Six to Eight).</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, we, thinking of God this way, do not say that He was a mere man born of the Virgin Mary, nor do we preach one Son of Man and another Son of God separately, lest we make one person of the flesh and another of divinity, but we profess and believe in one Christ in the Word of God and in the flesh, and we testify and worship Him as the Only-begotten Son by nature.</s>
    <s>We also openly declare that the Word of God took the beginning of flesh and blood, and made our body His own specifically, and came forth as a perfect man from the virgin, yet not from this world.</s>
  </p>


  <p>Heavenly power was cast down, so that it would lose the generation it had from the eternal Father. This indeed is what the reason of the Catholic faith testifies.</p>
  
  <p>In this religion, we have learned that the holy Fathers and God's chosen soldiers were true contenders, who truly believed that the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ was a virgin. Not because the deity and nature of the Word took origin from her, but because that most sacred body of Christ, animated by a rational soul, was born from the pure womb of the same virgin, to which the Word of God was substantially united and born in the flesh.</p>
  
  <p>Hence, the Apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonians, says: <break time="500ms"/> </p>
  
  <p>Therefore, we who worship this holy faith and follow Christian law profess that according to substance, the Word of God is unified with the flesh, and we worship one Christ, God, the same human with his own flesh. We truly testify with our hearts, proclaim with a pure mind, and confess with a humble mouth that the Son of God was crucified in the flesh, suffered death in the flesh, and became the firstborn from the dead, in whom remains the perfect life of believers, who as God is the life-giver of all the faithful.</p>
  
  <p>I write these things, beloved, so that peace and harmony of the Churches may be preserved, and the indissoluble bond of charity may remain, and the gifts of divine generosity may not diminish.</p>
  
  <p>We venerate and believe in the Trinity in unity and believe that the Father and the Son were from the beginning, and we confess and honor the Paraclete proceeding from both, not as three gods, but as one God only: to whom we faithfully offer our dues, so that our Lord and Redeemer, who performs such great miracles in His servants, may not disdain to forgive our sins, and we will see greater things than these, with His help whose majesty and beauty, unfading glory, power, and honor remain inestimable forever and ever. Amen.</p>
