    <p>On the threefold celebration of the Blessed Virgin Mary, dear brothers, in which the angel announces, the Virgin conceives, the only-begotten Son of the unbegotten is clothed in flesh, a few things must be said. Although he who announces is worthy of great praise, she who conceives by hearing is worthier; most worthy, however, is He who is conceived.</p>
    <p>This is the day of salvation, celebrated by us with due reverence, which reconciles the earthly with the heavenly; on which the divinity of the Redeemer descended to us, so that our humanity might ascend to the heavens.</p>
    <p>This is that solemn day which begins with the angel announcing how the Virgin will give birth to the one born of a Virgin, how the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin, how the untouchable God deigned to be touched, who is the eternal light that illuminates everyone coming into this world.</p>
    <p>This is the solemn day which lifts and elevates us from the earth to the heights and honorably exalts us above the heavens of heavens, as the present sermon will declare to you.</p>
    <p>Since the first man was expelled by the forbidden tree of knowledge and inappropriately tasted it, the deceit of demons led humans astray through the allure of vices, deceived them, captivated them by deceiving, and in captivity, plunged them into outer darkness. There is weeping and gnashing of teeth, as the Lord testifies.</p>
    <p>For when the glory of the devil aroused ambition, ambition provoked envy, and the human race was grieved to be transferred from the earth to the heavens. For because he had miserably fallen, he inflicted the solace of his misery upon himself by this.</p>
    <p>Therefore, considering the Father, the loss of the human race through the deceit of the serpent, He deigned to liberate the world by the incarnation of His only-begotten Son, so that as the woman was expelled from the seats of paradise by the exhortation of the demon, she might merit to receive the glory of immortality by the angel's salutation.</p>
    <p>The exhortation of the enemy deceived Eve; the salutation of Gabriel strengthened Mary. The angel announces to destroy the deceit of the devil: the Virgin is overshadowed by the power of the Most High, with the angel announcing, so that the woman long deceived by Satan's messenger is restored.</p>
    <p>The incorruptible God is clothed in flesh and descends, so that by this, according to man, Jesus, the old man might ascend, who, by inappropriately tasting the fruit, came to this misery and valley of tears. For it is read that when the woman deceived her husband, it was said to her by the Lord: In pain, you will bear children, and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.</p>
    <p>These three inconveniences are suffered by those who do not imitate the virginity of Mary: as if the Lord were saying to her: When your desire is for your husband, you will be subject to his servitude; but when you give birth, you will suffer the detriments of pain and sorrow. But these three are excluded from the happiness of the Virgin Mary, and not only from that Virgin, but from all who devote their virginity to Christ.</p>
    <p>Come therefore, virgins, who vow virginity to the Virgin, vow the integrity of the body to the Virgin, who exhibited unstained chastity to the Lord. Therefore, listen to how much merit that same Virgin possessed. For she not only merited to be visited by the angelic address but also to encompass within the confines of her virginal womb Him who in no way could be encompassed.</p>
    <p>Our mother Eve is burdened with three evils, but blessed Mary is excluded from these and rejoices in a threefold happiness. For she is strengthened by the angelic salutation, blessed after being strengthened, and announced to be fruitful with the fullness of grace.</p>
    <p>For it is written: The angel was sent to the virgin. We confess that this virgin is she of whom it is read in Isaiah: A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse (that is, the Virgin Mary), and from his roots a Branch will bear fruit, that is, Christ. For He himself declares in the Song of Songs, saying: I am the flower of the field. And entering, he said to her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</p>
    <p>Oh, the angelic voice full of sweetness and joy! For when he said, Hail, Mary, he exhibited a heavenly salutation to the Virgin. But when he said, Full of grace, he showed that the sentence was excluded, by which the first parents were made far from God, and the grace of heavenly blessing restored.</p>


    <p>Through her, they were freed from slavery and brought into paradise.</p>
        <p>When he said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb," he not only declared her womb's fruit blessed but also all those who, following the Virgin Mary, remain in virginity.</p>
        <p>O blessed Virgin, O Virgin chosen by the Creator of the world! You will conceive Him who was born before all ages, without a mother from the eternal Father, becoming a mother without the union of any man.</p>
        <p>In this case, the ear was the spouse, and the angelic word was the husband. You will conceive as a virgin, and after giving birth, you will remain a virgin, and the Son of God will descend into you, so that He who was to ascend with the power of supremacy and the glory of His majesty to the East, may turn His grace of majesty to the West.</p>
        <p>Do not let hearing this confuse you, nor let the conception disturb you. This conception is not by necessity but by the incomprehensible power of God. He will be clothed in flesh and hidden in your virginal womb, and the Son of God will begin to be the son of man, always remaining what He was. We believe Him to be unchangeable, mercifully taking on what He was not, so that He can be comprehended in you, whom the whole world could not contain.</p>
        <p>Through this conception, your virginal chastity will not be diminished but rather the integrity of your chastity will be more greatly amplified. You have become the Mother of the Creator while He was with the Father: and when He was born from you, His Mother, He remained with the Father. Always with the Father, because He has no beginning and no temporal origin. Always with the Father, who remains without beginning and end.</p>
        <p>You have become the heavenly ladder, the rod of Aaron that blossomed above all, that is, you shone with dignity in virginity above all others. You have become the ladder by which heavenly glory descended to the lower realms, so that humility might be lifted to the heights of heaven.</p>
        <p>O new and unheard-of union! O ineffable and wondrous mixture! For He who created everything from nothing is created; He who could not be contained is comprehended; He who makes all rich becomes poor; Christ, who is perfect, deigns to empty Himself.</p>
        <p>It is said that He emptied Himself of the form of divinity in time so that we might be enriched by His heavenly perfection.</p>
        <p>Therefore, dearest brothers, let us beseech the Virgin to reconcile God to mankind and harmonize earthly things with heavenly ones. Let her intercede for the past, praying to the Son for the future.</p>
        <p>O Virgin, give not only bodily food but also the bread of angels descending into your womb, so that we may fear the Son of God. For the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.</p>
        <p>If anyone fears the Lord, they will keep His commandments: then carnal purification will follow, so that we may be able to contemplate the rays of divine light. After carnal purification is given to us, the illumination of our hearts will follow.</p>
        <p>Listen, therefore, and incline your ear to our prayers. O Virgin, who is rightly praised by us, who is venerated by us for remaining a virgin after giving birth, pray to God for us, so that He may grant us constancy, bestow patience: so that unity may be strengthened, tolerance increased so that when the pain of sorrow and misery, calamity, and sadness comes, you may deem us worthy to present us to your only-begotten Son, who is one God: whom we confess as one in substance, three in persons.</p>
        <p>Who is in all, and over all, and in all of us; who is sought in part, and known in part: who does not want the death of the sinner, but that he may turn from his wicked way.</p>
        <p>Pray that we may become perfect light; so that we may praise you in the glory of your Son: to whom is honor and power, through all ages. Amen.</p>
