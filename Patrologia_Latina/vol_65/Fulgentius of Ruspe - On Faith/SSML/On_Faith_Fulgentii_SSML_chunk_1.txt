    <s>Prologue.</s>
    <s>1. I received your letter, dear Peter, in which you mentioned your desire to go to Jerusalem and asked to be instructed by our letters on the rule of true faith that you should uphold in those parts, so that no heretical falsehood could deceive you.</s>
    <s>I am indeed glad that you are concerned with keeping the true faith free from any taint of perfidy, without which no conversion can be beneficial, indeed, it cannot even exist.</s>
    <s>Apostolic authority says that without faith it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6).</s>
    <s>Faith is the foundation of all good things.</s>
    <s>Faith is the beginning of human salvation.</s>
    <s>Without this, no one can belong to the number of God's children; for without it, neither in this world does anyone obtain the grace of justification, nor in the future will they possess eternal life.</s>
    <s>If one does not walk by faith here, they will not reach the vision.</s>
    <s>Without faith, all human effort is in vain.</s>
    <s>It is like someone who, wanting to reach a homeland where they know they will live happily, leaves the correct path and imprudently follows error, not reaching the blessed city but falling into a pit, where no joy is given to the arriver, but destruction is brought to the faller.</s>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s>2. However, for a sufficient discourse on faith to be delivered, neither is there enough time because you wish to have our response quickly, nor is the task of this discussion small, as it could scarcely be completed even with long speeches.</s>
    <s>For you did not ask to be instructed on faith in such a way that you would specify one particular heresy against which our discussion would be focused.</s>
    <s>But since you ask for a definition of faith in general and wish it to be concluded briefly, you can see how impossible it is for us to fully comprehend such a great matter in a short time.</s>
    <s>We could not be sufficient for this even if we had ample time and the kind of intellect that would allow us to write many volumes on what you ask of us.</s>
    <s>But because God is near to all who call upon Him in truth...</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</s> 
<s>He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him; he also will hear their cry and will save them.</s> 
<s>I hope that, just as he has given you a holy concern for this faith, he will also give me the ability to serve your good and praiseworthy desire adequately.</s> 
<s>Even if I cannot explain everything from which every heretical error can be recognized and, once recognized, either refuted or avoided, I will, with the name and help of the Holy Trinity, who is the one true and good God, speak of those things in which the reason for the Catholic faith is contained without any shadow of error.</s> 
<s>By holding on to these, you will also be able to identify and avoid those things which, even if they are not specifically refuted in this work, will be shown by what is generally and absolutely stated here to be the inventions of human error, not taught by the rule of divine truth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Wherever you are, because, according to the rule proclaimed by our Savior, you know you were baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, hold fast with all your heart to the belief that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God.</s> 
<s>This means that the holy and ineffable Trinity is naturally one God, as it is said in Deuteronomy: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one."</s> 
<s>And, "You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve."</s> 
<s>However, because we have said that this one God, who alone is true and naturally God, is not the Father alone, nor the Son alone, nor the Holy Spirit alone, but the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together, we must be careful not to say or believe that the Father is the same as the Son or the Holy Spirit, or that the Son is the same as the Father or the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is the same as the Father or the Son.</s> 
<s>This would be entirely wrong.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The faith that the holy patriarchs and prophets received from God before the incarnation of the Son of God, and which the holy apostles heard from the Lord himself while he was on earth and, being instructed by the Holy Spirit, not only preached in words but also left in their writings for the most beneficial instruction of future generations, proclaims one God in the Trinity, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</s> 
<s>But the Trinity would not be true if the same person were called Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</s> 
<s>If the substance of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were the same, but the person were also the same, there would be nothing in which the Trinity could truly be said to exist.</s> 
<s>Furthermore, the Trinity would not be true if the one God, who is the Trinity, were not one in nature but different in nature as the persons are distinct from one another.</s> 
<s>But because in that one true God, the Trinity, it is naturally true not only that he is one God but also that he is the Trinity, he is therefore the true God in persons and one in nature.</s> 
<s>Through this natural unity, the Father is entirely in the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Son is entirely in the Father and the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is entirely in the Father and the Son.</s> 
<s>No one of them exists outside of any of the others because none precedes the others in eternity, exceeds them in greatness, or surpasses them in power.</s> 
<s>For neither the Son nor the Holy Spirit, as far as the unity of divine nature is concerned, is either anterior or greater.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    For indeed, the Father is not greater than the Son or the Holy Spirit regarding the unity of the divine nature, nor is He prior or greater. The Father is neither prior nor greater than the Son (as stated in the same text, chapter "Nunc postquam"); nor can the eternity and immensity of the Son, as if prior or greater, naturally precede or exceed the eternity and immensity of the Holy Spirit. Just as the Son is not posterior or lesser than the Father, the Holy Spirit is not posterior or lesser than the Son. For what is eternal and without beginning is that the Son was born from the nature of the Father; and what is eternal and without beginning is that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the nature of the Father and the Son. Therefore, we rightly believe and say that the three are one God, because there is one eternity, one immensity, one divinity of the three persons by nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, let us hold that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are naturally one God; yet the Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son (as all Catholics agree). There is one essence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which the Greeks call "ousia," in which the Father is not something different, nor the Son, nor the Holy Spirit, though personally the Father is different, the Son is different, and the Holy Spirit is different. This is clearly demonstrated to us at the very beginning of the Holy Scriptures, where God says, "Let us make man in our image and likeness" (Genesis 1:26). When He says "image" in the singular, He shows that there is one nature in whose image man is made. But when He says "our" in the plural, He shows that the same God in whose image man is made is not one person. If in that one nature of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, there were only one person, it would not say "in our image," but "in my image;" nor would it say "let us make," but "let me make." If, however, there were three substances to be understood or believed in those three persons, it would not say "in our image," but "in our images;" for one image could not belong to three unequal natures. But since man is said to be made in the one image of one God, the essential divinity of the Holy Trinity is intimated. Then, and a little later, for what God had previously said, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," Scripture narrates as follows: "And God made man: in the image of God, He made him" (Genesis 1:27).
  </p>
  <p>
    The prophet Isaiah did not keep silent about this revelation of the Trinity of persons and unity of nature, as he says he saw the Seraphim crying out: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts" (Isaiah 6:3). Where the third "Holy" is said, we recognize the Trinity of persons; and where "Lord God of hosts" is said once, we recognize the unity of the divine nature. In that holy Trinity, which is repeated by us so that it may be more firmly engraved in your heart, there is one Father, who alone essentially begot one Son from Himself; and there is one Son, who alone is essentially born from one Father; and there is one Holy Spirit, who alone essentially proceeds from the Father and the Son. The same person could not do all this, that is, beget Himself, be born from Himself, and proceed from Himself. Therefore, since begetting is different from being born, and proceeding is different from begetting or being born, it is clear that the Father is different, the Son is different, and the Holy Spirit is different. Thus, the Trinity refers to the persons of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, while the unity refers to the nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as, according to that divinity in which the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one, we do not believe that the Father was born, nor the Holy Spirit, but only the Son; so also...
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>The Catholic faith believes and proclaims that the Son was born only according to the flesh.</s>
    <s>In that Trinity, it is proper to the Father alone that He was not born, but begot the only Son.</s>
    <s>It is proper to the Son alone that He was not the begetter but was born from the essence of the Father alone.</s>
    <s>And it is proper to the Holy Spirit that He was neither born nor begot, but proceeds from the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>If, according to the divine nature, God the Father was not born from any God, He would still be born from a virgin according to the flesh.</s>
    <s>If the Father were born of a virgin, He would be both the Father and the Son in one person.</s>
    <s>But if this one person were born only from a virgin and not from God, He would be truly called not the Son of God, but only the son of man.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The Son of God Himself would not say, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," (John 3:16).</s>
    <s>And again, "For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him," (John 3:17).</s>
    <s>Nor would the blessed John say, "Whoever loves the father loves the child born of him," (1 John 5:1).</s>
    <s>Nor would the Son Himself say, "My Father is always at His work to this very day, and I too am working," (John 5:17).</s>
    <s>For if the one who is called the Son were also the Father, He would not truly be called the Son of God, because He would be born only from a virgin and not from God.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Finally, the Father Himself would not testify from heaven and declare with an audible voice that Jesus is His Son, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," (Matthew 3:17).</s>
    <s>Apostle Paul also would not say of God the Father, "He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all," (Romans 8:32).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Since all these things are divinely spoken for our teaching and because they are divine sayings, they are surely true.</s>
    <s>It is true that the Catholic faith preaches that the Son alone was born of the Father according to divinity, eternal with the Father, immortal, impassible, and unchangeable God.</s>
    <s>And according to the flesh, it was not the Father but His only begotten Son who was born in time, suffered while preserving His impassibility, died while preserving His immortality, and was truly resurrected while preserving His unchangeability.</s>
    <s>He has everything in common with the Father that He naturally had from eternity without beginning, and nothing in common with the Father in those things that He, the eternal and exalted One, took upon Himself humbly and temporarily in His own person.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Again, if not the one who is the proper and only begotten Son of God the Father, but the Holy Spirit were born from a virgin, the holy Church would not accept and confess in faith the Son who was made of a woman, made under the law, born of the Holy Spirit from the Virgin Mary.</s>
    <s>If the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of the Father and the Son, took on the form of a servant, He would not descend from heaven in the form of a dove upon the man made flesh.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, God the Father, not born of any God, once begot from His own nature without beginning the Son, equal to Himself, and naturally eternal with the same divinity as He Himself.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    The same eternal and true Son of God, who is naturally one God with the Father according to divinity, as it is said: </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the one and the same Son of God was born before all ages and was born in time. Both births are of the one Son of God: divine, according to which he is the creator in the form of God, co-eternal with the Father; human, according to which he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant. Not only did he form himself in the conception of his mother's womb when he became man, but he also emerged from the same maternal womb as God made man. He hung on the cross as God made man, lay in the tomb for three days as God made man, and rose from the dead on the third day as God made man. In the tomb, he lay in the flesh only, and descended to the underworld in the soul only. On the third day, when the soul returned from the underworld to the flesh, he rose from the tomb as God in the flesh. On the fortieth day after the resurrection, he ascended to heaven as God made man and sat at the right hand of God, from where he will come at the end of the world to judge the living and the dead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the Word made flesh is one Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the mediator of God and humans. He is the mediator because he is both true God and true man, having one nature of divinity with the Father, and one substance of humanity with the mother. He bore the penalty of our sins from us unto death; he has the unchangeable justice from God the Father. He died temporally because of our sin, but because of his justice, he is always alive and will grant immortality to mortals. He preserved his perfect humanity in the perfection of his divinity; he absorbed the truth of his mortality through the acceptance of death, with the truth and unchangeability of his immortality.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what blessed Peter testifies, that Christ swallowed death so that we might become heirs of eternal life (1 Peter 3:22). Blessed Paul also teaches that Christ swallowed death and brought light to life and incorruption (2 Timothy 1:10). Christ tasted death because he is true man; the same Christ swallowed death because he is true God. As the Apostle says, he died in weakness, but he lives by the power of God (2 Corinthians 13:4): the same one who, according to the prophecy of blessed David, became man in Zion and established it the Most High (Psalm 86:5).
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the divinity of Christ is not separate from the nature of the Father, as it is written: </p>


<p><s>Because the Word became flesh and lived among us.</s> <s>That nature which is always begotten from the Father took on our nature without sin, to be born of a virgin.</s></p>
<p><s>For the eternal and divine nature could not temporally conceive and be born from human nature in any way, unless the ineffable divinity in itself accepted true human conception and birth temporally.</s></p>
<p><s>Thus, God is eternal and true.</s> <s>He was truly conceived and born from a virgin in time.</s></p>
<p><s>When the fullness of time came, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption as sons.</s> <s>God became the Son of Man by nature, who is naturally the Son of God the Father.</s></p>
<p><s>John the evangelist confirms this, saying, "The Word became flesh and lived among us," and then adds, "We have seen His glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."</s></p>
<p><s>The creator and Lord of all spirits and bodies, that is, of all natures, created the virgin, to be created from the virgin.</s> <s>He made His own mother, when He took true flesh from her to be conceived and born.</s> <s>Thus, God became mercifully human in the truth of a servant's form, and in the form of God, remaining naturally true as God and human.</s></p>
<p><s>Therefore, believe that Christ, the Son of God, one of the Trinity, is true God, and do not doubt that His divinity is from the nature of the Father.</s> <s>Believe that He is truly human, and that His flesh is not of a celestial, airy, or any other nature, but the same nature as all human flesh.</s></p>
<p><s>God formed the first human from the earth and forms other humans from humans through propagation.</s> <s>Although Christ's flesh and all human flesh are of the same nature, the flesh that God the Word united with Himself from the Virgin Mary was conceived without sin, born without sin.</s> <s>Thus, the eternal and just God was mercifully conceived, born, and crucified as the Lord of glory.</s></p>
<p><s>But how can we describe the unique excellence of that flesh, whose divine person is from its very conception, whose birth is unusual, so that the Word became flesh, and was one person with His flesh, the Only Begotten and eternal God?</s> <s>Human flesh is born through human copulation, with the man planting the seed and the woman conceiving and giving birth.</s></p>
<p><s>And because when a man and woman unite to generate children, there is parental lust involved, the conception of children from their flesh cannot be without sin.</s> <s>It is not propagation that transmits sin to infants, but lust.</s> <s>It is not the fertility of human nature that makes humans be born with sin, but the foulness of lust, which humans have from the just condemnation of that first sin.</s> <s>Therefore, blessed David, although born from a legitimate and just marriage, where neither the guilt of infidelity nor the stain of fornication could be found, cries out because of original sin, to which the children of wrath are naturally bound.</s> <s>This includes not only the children of the impious but also all born of the sanctified flesh of the just.</s></p>


  <p>
    <s>
      Look, I was conceived in sin, and my mother gave birth to me in guilt.
    </s>
    <s>
      Even Saint Job says that a person cannot be pure from filth, not even if his life on earth is just one day long.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, the only begotten Son of God, who is in the bosom of the Father, took on human flesh and a rational soul to purify both body and soul.
    </s>
    <s>
      He, who is truly God, became truly man, not as a different God or a different man, but the same God and the same man.
    </s>
    <s>
      To remove the sin that human generation contracted through mortal flesh, He was conceived in a new way: God incarnate in a virgin mother, without a man's involvement, without the lust of the virgin conceiving.
    </s>
    <s>
      Through God made man, conceived without lust and born from the untouched womb of the virgin, the sin that all humans are born with is cleansed.
    </s>
    <s>
      In this mortal body, mothers cannot fulfill the work of fertility unless they first lose the virginity of their flesh.
    </s>
    <s>
      Only the only begotten God removed the sin of human conception and birth.
    </s>
    <s>
      When He was conceived, He took the true nature of flesh from the virgin, and when He was born, He preserved the virginity of His mother.
    </s>
    <s>
      This is why God became the Son of the Virgin Mary, and Mary, a virgin, became the mother of the only begotten God.
    </s>
    <s>
      The one whom the Father begot from eternity, the virgin brought forth in time.
    </s>
    <s>
      This virgin, whom God, who was to be born from her, filled with special grace so that she had in her womb the one whom the universe has as Lord from the beginning, and saw Him born in a solemn manner, whom not only human but also angelic beings recognize and adore as the Most High in the unity of the Father's substance.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Thus, the sin and the punishment of sin, which entered the world through the crime of a corrupted woman, are removed from the world through the birth of an untouched virgin.
    </s>
    <s>
      In the condition of the human race, through a woman made from a man alone, we were bound by the chain of death.
    </s>
    <s>
      In redeeming the human race, divine goodness acted so that through a man born from a woman alone, life was restored to humans.
    </s>
    <s>
      There, the devil associated human nature with the likeness of sin through a wicked deception.
    </s>
    <s>
      Here, God took human nature into the unity of His person.
    </s>
    <s>
      There, a woman was deceived to become the daughter of the devil.
    </s>
    <s>
      Here, a virgin was filled with grace to become the mother of the supreme and unchangeable only begotten God.
    </s>
    <s>
      There, an angel, cast down by pride, took hold of the mind of the deceived woman.
    </s>
    <s>
      Here, God, humbling Himself through mercy, filled the womb of an untouched virgin from which He was to be born.
    </s>
    <s>
      The Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was in the form of God (which He could not be unless He was born from the nature of the Father), according to apostolic teaching, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, He took the form of a servant, that is, the nature of a servant, into His person.
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, the creator of humans was made in the likeness of humans and was found in appearance as a man.
    </s>
    <s>
      He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to the Father to the point of death, even death on a cross.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, consider this statement of the Apostle carefully, and in it, you will understand how to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is both God and man.
    </s>
    <s>
      Do not confuse or divide the truth of both natures in one person.
    </s>
    <s>
      When you first hear about the Lord Jesus Christ being in the form of God, you should recognize and firmly hold that the term "form" implies natural fullness.
    </s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>The nature of God the Father has always been, from whom He was born.</s>
    <s>Therefore, He is of one nature with the Father, equally eternal and immense, equally immortal and unchangeable, equally invisible and ineffable, equally good and just, equally compassionate and merciful, patient and very merciful and truthful, equally strong and gentle, equally wise and omnipotent.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, hold firmly in faith all these things we have said about the Son of God, because He, having all these in the unity of nature with the Father, is undoubtedly equal to the Father.</s>
    <s>For this reason, the Apostle immediately adds, saying, "He did not consider it robbery to be equal to God" (Philippians 2:6).</s>
    <s>For the equality of the Son with the Father in divinity was not a robbery, but of nature.</s>
    <s>Also, what the Apostle subsequently adds, saying, "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in appearance as a man; He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross," all these things about that only-begotten God the Son of God, about that Word of God of whom the evangelist says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1); about that power of God and wisdom of God, of whom it is said to God, "You have made all things in wisdom" (Psalm 104:24); about that principle with which the Father Himself is one principle, and in which He made heaven and earth, that is, all spiritual and corporeal nature; about the only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, as I said, take all these things personally: yet preserving His eternity, immensity, immortality, unchangeability, invisibility of His divinity.</s>
    <s>These things the Son of God naturally and equally has in common with God the Father, so that although He was truly made man for us, He remained equal to the true God the Father, from whom He was born, true God and Truth.</s>
    <s>He therefore emptied Himself, but from His fullness we have all received (John 1:16): if He had lost His fullness by emptying Himself, He would certainly not have what to give us.</s>
    <s>However, if He did not have it, we would undoubtedly receive nothing.</s>
    <s>From His fullness we have all received.</s>
    <s>Therefore, from what He gave us from His fullness, He showed that even when He emptied Himself, He did not lose the fullness He had: because if He had lost His fullness, He could not give from it at all.</s>
    <s>He took the form of a servant: for the emptying of the supreme God was nothing else but the acceptance of the form of a servant, that is, human nature.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, both forms are in Christ, because both the divine and human natures are true and complete in Christ.</s>
    <s>That is why the holy Evangelist proclaims Him full of grace and truth (John 1:14), because He is full in divine nature, in which God is Truth; and in human nature, in which man is made true through grace, He is full.</s>
    <s>In that fullness, He is God, in the form of God equal to God; in this fullness, a servant, in the form of a servant, because He was made in the likeness of men, and was found in appearance as a man.</s>
    <s>Therefore, emptying Himself, He took the form of a servant to become a servant; but He did not lose the fullness of the form of God, in which He is always the eternal and unchangeable Lord: made according to the form of a servant, a true man, of the same nature as His servant mother; and remaining in the form of God, a true God, of the same nature as His Lord Father.</s>
    <s>In the form of God, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, He is the one and only Creator of all things; according to the form of a servant, He alone was formed by His and the Father's and the Holy Spirit's operation: what He is as Creator, He naturally shares with the Father and the Holy Spirit, but as created, He took the form of a servant according to which He was created.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>These parts are missing, the form of a servant according to which he was created, from all manuscripts.</s>
    <s>And indeed, not inappropriately.</s>
    <s>He alone personally possesses it in himself.</s>
    <s>Whose future birth according to the flesh, and death, and resurrection, and ascension into heaven, the law and the prophets never ceased to foretell, as he himself commanded, obeying both in words and deeds.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For even in the sacrifices of carnal victims, which the Holy Trinity itself, who is the one God of the New and Old Testament, commanded our fathers to offer, the most pleasing gift of that sacrifice was signified, by which for us the God the Son alone would mercifully offer himself according to the flesh.</s>
    <s>For he, according to apostolic teaching, offered himself for us as an offering and sacrifice to God in a sweet-smelling aroma.</s>
    <s>He is the true God and the true high priest, who for us entered into the holy place not by the blood of bulls and goats, but by his own blood once for all.</s>
    <s>This was signified by that high priest who entered the holy of holies with blood annually.</s>
    <s>Therefore, he is the one who in himself exhibited everything necessary for our redemption, being both the priest and the sacrifice, the same God and the temple:</s>
    <s>the priest, through whom we are reconciled;</s>
    <s>the sacrifice, by which we are reconciled;</s>
    <s>the temple, in which we are reconciled;</s>
    <s>the God, to whom we are reconciled.</s>
    <s>Yet, he alone is the priest, sacrifice, and temple, because all these things are God according to the form of a servant; but not God alone, because this is with the Father and the Holy Spirit according to the form of God.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, we are reconciled through the Son alone according to the flesh, but not to the Son alone according to divinity.</s>
    <s>For the Trinity reconciled us to itself through the fact that the Trinity made the Word flesh.</s>
    <s>In whom the unchangeable truth of both human and divine nature remains, so that just as his divinity, which he has unchangeable from the Father, is always true, so his humanity, which the highest divinity has united to itself, is always true and unchangeable.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>I have inserted these few points about the faith of the Holy Trinity, who is the only true God by nature, as much as the brevity of time and speech allowed.</s>
    <s>Now I will tell you what you should believe without doubt about creation.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Hold firmly, therefore, that every nature which is not the Trinity, God, was created out of nothing by the Holy Trinity, who is the one true and eternal God.</s>
    <s>Thus, everything in the heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers, is the work and creation of the Holy Trinity, who is the one God, the creator and Lord of all things, eternal, omnipotent, just, and good, naturally having always existed and being unable to change.</s>
    <s>And this God, who has always existed without a beginning because he is supremely existent, gave things created by him to exist:</s>
    <s>yet not without a beginning, because no creature is of the same nature as the Trinity, the one true and good God, by whom all things were created.</s>
    <s>And because he is supremely good, he gave all natures which he made to be good:</s>
    <s>yet not as good as the creator of all good things, who is not only supremely good but also the highest and unchangeable good, because he is the eternal good;</s>
    <s>having no defect, because he was not made from nothing;</s>
    <s>having no progress, because he has no beginning.</s>
    <s>Therefore, creatures made by God can progress because they began to exist; they can decline because they were made from nothing.</s>
    <s>The condition of their origin leads them to defect, but the operation of the Creator advances them to progress.</s>
    <s>Thus, in the first place, the eternity of the Trinity, who is the true God, is naturally recognized without a beginning, because he made some things so that, although they began to exist, they can never cease to exist.</s>
    <s>In this, his omnipotence is understood, because he created all things.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>He made the visible and the invisible, meaning both the physical and the spiritual, out of nothing.</s>
    <s>In these, the diversity of things greatly commends the goodness and omnipotence of the Creator.</s>
    <s>If He were not all-powerful, He would not have made the highest and the lowest with the same ease.</s>
    <s>And if He were not supremely good, He would not have taken care of even the lowest things.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Celestial and earthly bodies are different.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in both great and small created things, the goodness and omnipotence of the Creator are great.</s>
    <s>For He made everything wisely with supreme and true wisdom, to whom it is natural to be wise and to act wisely.</s>
    <s>The simplicity of God's manifold wisdom commends the greatness of His majesty, not only in the greatness of the high creatures but also in the smallness of the lowly ones.</s>
    <s>While all the good things He created are much lower and more unlike their creator, not being made from Him but entirely from nothing, they are also not equal among themselves.</s>
    <s>Each thing remains as it was made by God to be, some in one way and some in another.</s>
    <s>For bodies were not given existence in the same way that spirits were, and even bodies are not equal among themselves.</s>
    <s>There is diversity among celestial and earthly bodies, with celestial bodies differing in size and brightness.</s>
    <s>As the Apostle says, "There is one glory of the celestial bodies and another of the earthly bodies."</s>
    <s>Even among celestial bodies, there is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</s>
    <s>The diversity of physical natures shows that each of them does not have what it has from itself but from the disposition and work of the most omnipotent, unchangeable, and wise Creator.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>God is everywhere.</s>
    <s>If any physical creature were of the same nature as the Holy Trinity, which is one God, it would not be in any place locally, nor would it ever experience temporal change, nor move from place to place, nor be limited by its size.</s>
    <s>All these things show that the maker of such natures is He to whom no place is wide or narrow because He is wholly present in both narrow and wide places.</s>
    <s>He is not changed by time because He alone can wonderfully order the course of time, not with temporal change but with eternal stability.</s>
    <s>He does not think in time about how the series of times passes by the succession and departure of things.</s>
    <s>Nor is He limited by any size of mass because He is not confined by any boundary.</s>
    <s>He is not distributed through parts of the world by His parts, filling larger parts with larger portions and smaller parts with smaller portions, yet is never entirely absent from any part.</s>
    <s>He is God who says, "I fill heaven and earth."</s>
    <s>Therefore, everything He made, that is, spirits and bodies, the highest and the lowest, celestial and earthly, living and those to which He did not give the ability to live, the Lord God ineffably fills and contains everywhere wholly.</s>
    <s>He is not divided in things that are divided, nor is He changed in things that change.</s>
    <s>If He were not naturally unchangeable, the unchangeable order of His counsel and disposition would never remain in mutable things.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>God is the life of all things.</s>
    <s>God, the immense creator of physical and non-physical things, first shows that He is not a body because He did not give life to some bodies, even though He created all bodies.</s>
    <s>He is naturally life because if He were not life, He would not have made living bodies.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>Nothing that isn't alive can make something alive.</s>
    <s>Therefore, bodies that cannot live at all are not of the same nature as God.</s>
    <s>Similarly, those bodies are not of the same nature as God, even if they contain individual, irrational spirits that give them life and sensation.</s>
    <s>Nor are the irrational spirits themselves of the same nature as God, even though they are known to provide life and sensation to bodies; these spirits have no light of understanding to know or love their creator.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Even the spirits that are undoubtedly rational and intellectual cannot be of the same nature as God, who is naturally unchanging and immense.</s>
    <s>Although God has no diversity in Himself, He shows diversity in His operations through these rational and intellectual spirits.</s>
    <s>For instance, those spirits that are inserted into earthly and mortal bodies do not move locally; they are present entirely in whole bodies and entirely in their parts.</s>
    <s>However, the variety of thoughts shows a certain temporal motion and change in them; sometimes they know, sometimes they don't; sometimes they will, sometimes they won't; sometimes they are wise, sometimes they are foolish; sometimes they are unjust from being just, and sometimes they become just from being unjust; sometimes they are enlightened by the light of piety, and sometimes they are darkened by the error of impiety.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>It is evident that angels, who are not burdened by any earthly matter, are not of the same nature as God but are made from nothing.</s>
    <s>Their natural mutability is known because part of their nature has changed for the worse.</s>
    <s>Those who have not been corrupted continuously receive the sweetness of the Lord's abundance, given by Him who created them from nothing, and they do not falter by their natural condition.</s>
    <s>Although they cling to God without any temporal variability, as they have received the gift of eternal incorruption and immutability, they still have a natural limit distinguishing them from each other, as none of them exist in another.</s>
    <s>When one of them is tasked with a particular work, another is assigned to a different task by divine authority.</s>
    <s>All these things show that even the holy angels are creations of the Holy Trinity, whose marvelous wisdom and power are evident in the disposition and operation of every single thing He has made as He wished.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, God created some spirits to exist forever and others to cease existing as spirits at some point.</s>
    <s>He brought forth some of these ceasing spirits from water and others from earth, as He wished.</s>
    <s>Superior spirits were made to have no natural connection with bodily elements; He created them eternal and gave them the ability and intelligence to think about, know, and love divinity.</s>
    <s>He created them in such a way that they would love Him above themselves, recognizing they were created by His work without any preceding merit.</s>
    <s>To ensure this love would have just and appropriate praise, He also granted them the freedom of will, allowing them to direct their holy love either towards Him, who is above them, or towards themselves or things below them, by misguided desire.</s>
  </p>


<p>
<s>It is not in the nature of anything to exist forever, whether in misery or happiness, unless it can think of God by the gift of God Himself.</s>
<s>This intellectual nature exists in the souls of humans and the spirits of angels.</s>
<s>For God gave the ability to know and love Him only to angels and humans.</s>
<s>Because of the freedom of will, which ought to be given to an intellectual creature by the Creator's kindness, He granted them the ability and the will to know and love Him, so that each one could both possess and lose it.</s>
<s>However, if anyone willingly lost it, they could not retrieve it by their own will.</s>
<s>So, the beginnings of holy thoughts would be infused again into those He wanted by the free gift of His goodness, which, at the very beginning of creation, arranged spirits and bodies, places and emotions, as He wisely willed, in a wonderfully fitting manner.</s>
<s>Therefore, angels and humans, because they were made rational, received the gift of eternity and blessedness from the creation of their spiritual nature.</s>
<s>If they continually adhered to the love of their Creator, they would remain eternal and blessed together.</s>
<s>But if, by their own free will, they tried to do their own will against the command of the highest Creator, blessedness would immediately leave the disobedient, and a miserable eternity would be left to them, tormenting them with errors and pains.</s>
<s>And concerning the angels, He decided and fulfilled that if any of them lost the goodness of their will, they would never restore it by divine gift.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, the part of the angels that departed from their Creator God, by whom alone they were blessed, found the beginning of their damnation in their voluntary turning away.</s>
<s>So, beginning to be punished was nothing other than being deprived of the love of that blessed good.</s>
<s>God commanded that they remain in eternal punishment, and also prepared for them eternal fire.</s>
<s>In this fire, all the rebellious angels would never be able to escape their evil will or their punishment.</s>
<s>As the evil of unjust turning away remains in them, so also the eternal damnation of just retribution remains.</s>
<s>Their leader, the devil, led the first humans into sin out of envy, and not only them but also their entire offspring inherited the merit of death with the vice of sin.</s>
<s>But God, merciful and just, just as He confirmed the other angels in the eternity of His love when the devil and his angels fell by their own will, did not allow the entire human race to perish forever.</s>
<s>Instead, His free goodness predestined those He wanted to be brought back to the light, rejecting the darkness in which every human birth is involved due to the condemnation of original sin.</s>
<s>He demonstrated this especially by freeing those from the bonds of original sin by the undeserved grace of the Redeemer, while eternal damnation held others, especially infants, who could not have any merits, good or bad, of their own will.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The beginning of good will and thought is not born of man himself but is prepared and given by God.</s>
</p>


<p>
<s>It shows that neither the devil nor any of his angels, having been cast down into this lower darkness due to their fall, could regain or will ever be able to regain a good will.</s>
<s>If it were possible for human nature, after turning away from God and losing the goodness of its will, to regain it by itself, it would be much more possible for the angelic nature to do so.</s>
<s>This is because angels are less burdened by the weight of an earthly body, and thus would have this ability to a greater extent.</s>
<s>But God has shown from where a good will is given to humans, which the angels lost when they had it, and now cannot regain it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, since a good will is worthy of eternal happiness through God’s grace, and angelic and human wickedness should not go unpunished, we faithfully expect, according to the rule of the Catholic faith, that the Son of God will come to punish all sinful angels and to judge the living and the dead.</s>
<s>For blessed Peter testifies that God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into hell, delivering them to be kept in chains of darkness until judgment (2 Peter 2:4).</s>
<s>About judging the living and the dead, blessed Paul says: I charge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom (2 Timothy 4:1).</s>
<s>At his coming, from the body of the first man, which God formed from the earth, to the bodies of all people, which began to live when they were given a soul, they will be raised by the one who created them.</s>
<s>Each body will be given back to its individual soul in the resurrection, which began in the wombs of their mothers so that they might start living.</s>
<s>This is so that the souls, at the judgment of the just Judge, may receive retribution in their own bodies, whether it be for the kingdom or for punishment, according to the quality of life they had in the present life.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The origin of a bad life.</s>
<s>The quality of a bad life begins with unbelief, which takes its start from the guilt of original sin.</s>
<s>Whoever begins to live in such a way that they end their life before being freed from this obligation, if their soul lived in the body for even one day or one hour, it must endure the endless punishments of hell with that same body.</s>
<s>There, the devil with his angels will burn forever, who was the first to sin and persuaded the first humans to sin.</s>
<s>There, too, will be the fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, slanderers, and robbers.</s>
<s>All those who commit the works of the flesh, which the blessed Apostle says will not inherit the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:21), if they have not turned from their evil ways before the end of this life, will be burned in eternal fires.</s>
<s>For every person who remains in the delight of iniquities and the hardness of heart until the end in this world, as harmful pleasure held them here, so will eternal torment hold them without end.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>The bodies of the wicked.</s>
<s>There will also be a resurrection of the wicked, but without the transformation that God will give only to those who live justly in faith.</s>
<s>This is what blessed Paul means when he says: We shall all indeed rise, but we shall not all be changed (1 Corinthians 15:51).</s>
<s>Showing that the just will be changed by divine gift, he says: And we shall be changed (1 Corinthians 15:52).</s>
<s>So, the wicked will share in the common resurrection of the flesh with the just, but they will not have the grace of transformation, which will be given to the just.</s>
<s>For the corruption, dishonor, and weakness in which the bodies of the wicked are sown will not be removed from them, and these will not be extinguished by death.</s>
<s>This is so that the constant torment of the body and soul will be the punishment of eternal death.</s>
<s>But the just souls, whom the Redeemer God has justified here by grace through faith, will...</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>
      God grants the grace of living well and the perseverance to continue to the end.
    </s>
    <s>
      In the very bodies in which they received the grace of justification from God here, and in which they lived justified by faith, in the love of God and neighbor, they will enjoy the eternal happiness of the heavenly kingdom.
    </s>
    <s>
      Their bodies will be glorified, and without a doubt, while remaining truly of the flesh, as God created them, they will not be like earthly bodies but will be spiritual.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the bodies of the saints, which are sown as natural bodies, will rise as spiritual bodies.
    </s>
    <s>
      Through this transformation, which is given only to the just, it will be fulfilled as the Apostle says (1 Cor. 15:53), "This perishable body must put on imperishability, and this mortal body must put on immortality."
    </s>
    <s>
      The male and female sexes, as the same bodies were created, will remain.
    </s>
    <s>
      Their glory will vary according to the diversity of their good deeds.
    </s>
    <s>
      Nonetheless, all bodies, whether male or female, that are in that kingdom, will be glorious.
    </s>
    <s>
      The Judge knows how much glory to give each one, because He justified them freely by His mercy in this life and intends to glorify them by His justice there.
