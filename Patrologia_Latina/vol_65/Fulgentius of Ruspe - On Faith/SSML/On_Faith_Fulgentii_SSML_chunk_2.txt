      God gave humans the time to acquire eternal life only in this life, where He also made repentance fruitful.
    </s>
    <s>
      Here, repentance is fruitful because a person can live well after abandoning wickedness, change their unjust will, alter their merits and deeds, and act in the fear of God to please Him.
    </s>
    <s>
      Whoever does not do this in this life will indeed have repentance in the future world for their sins, but will not find forgiveness before God.
    </s>
    <s>
      Because although there will be the sting of remorse, there will no longer be any correction of the will there.
    </s>
    <s>
      Such people will condemn their own iniquity, but they will not be able to love or desire righteousness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Their will shall be such that it will always have the punishment of their wickedness, but will never be able to receive the affection of goodness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as those who will reign with Christ will have no remnants of a bad will, so those assigned to the punishment of eternal fire with the devil and his angels will have no rest and will never be able to have a good will.
    </s>
    <s>
      Just as the co-heirs with Christ will be given the perfection of grace for eternal glory, so the companions of the devil will have their punishment increased by their own wickedness when, assigned to outer darkness, they will not be illuminated by any inner light of truth.

    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, repentance can be useful to every person in this life, whenever they do it, no matter how wicked or old they are.
    </s>
    <s>
      If they renounce their past sins with all their heart, shed not only bodily but also heartfelt tears before God, and strive to cleanse the stains of their evil deeds with good works, they will immediately receive forgiveness for all their sins.
    </s>
    <s>
      The Lord promises us this through the prophetic word, saying: "If you return and groan, you will be saved" (Isaiah 30:15, according to the Septuagint).
    </s>
    <s>
      And in another place it says: "My son, if you have sinned, do not add to your sins, but also pray for your past sins, that they may be forgiven you" (Sirach 21:1).
    </s>
    <s>
      Prayer for sins would never have been commanded if forgiveness were not granted to those who pray.
    </s>
    <s>
      But repentance benefits the sinner only if it is done in the Catholic Church, to which God granted the power of binding and loosing in the person of blessed Peter, saying: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19).
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, whenever a person truly repents of their sins and corrects their life with God's enlightenment, they will not be deprived of the gift of forgiveness, because God, as He says through the prophet, does not desire the death of the dying.

<p>
<s>But rather so that he may turn from his evil ways and live, says the Lord Almighty.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>However, no one should stay in their sins under the hope of God's mercy, just as no one would want to stay sick hoping for future health.</s>
<s>Those who neglect to turn away from their wrongdoings and promise themselves that God will forgive them may sometimes be overtaken by God's sudden wrath, finding neither time for conversion nor the benefit of forgiveness.</s>
<s>Therefore, Sacred Scripture kindly warns each of us saying, "Do not delay in turning to God, and do not put it off day by day; for suddenly his wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance, he will destroy you."</s>
<break time="1s" />
<s>Also, blessed David says, "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</s>
<s>Similarly, blessed Paul agrees with these words, "See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."</s>
<s>Thus, a hardened heart lives either by not converting, despairing of the forgiveness of their sins, or by hoping for God's mercy but remaining in the perversity of their sins until the end of this life.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Sin against the Holy Spirit.</s>
<s>Therefore, loving God's mercy and fearing His justice, let us neither despair of the forgiveness of sins nor remain in our sins, knowing that the fairness of the most just judge will demand all debts that the mercy of the most merciful Redeemer has not forgiven.</s>
<s>Just as mercy receives and absolves those who convert, so too will justice repel and punish the hardened.</s>
<s>These are the ones who sin against the Holy Spirit and will not receive forgiveness in this age or the next.</s>
<s>Indeed, the human soul is an intellectual spirit, designed to seek, recognize, and discern the time of its actions, for which it will receive what divine justice has ordained in judgment, and the time of that retribution, during which it will not be possible to change actions or usefully request the forgiveness of sins from divine mercy.</s>
<s>Other spirits of all animals, which do not have intellect, originate either from the earth or from the waters (for reptiles and birds come from the waters, while some creatures that crawl and some that walk come from the earth), and they are spirits as long as they live in their bodies.</s>
<s>A soul that has not been made capable of reason by divine will begins and ends its life with its flesh: because when it does not give life to the body, it does not live itself.</s>
<s>Thus, in a miraculous way, while the soul is the cause of life for all flesh, an irrational spirit lives only as long as it can remain in the flesh and is extinguished when separated from its flesh.</s>
<s>Thus, while it is the life of its flesh, it cannot live when it stops giving life to the flesh; and if there is no flesh to which it can give life, it will also immediately lose that life.</s>
<s>Therefore, eternity is not given to irrational spirits, nor is any judgment prepared for them, in which they would be rewarded with happiness for good deeds or punished for bad deeds.</s>
<s>This is because no distinction of actions is required in them, as they have not received any capacity for understanding from the divine.</s>
<s>Therefore, their bodies will not be resurrected because there was neither equity nor inequity in their souls, for which they would be rewarded with eternal happiness or punishment.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Thus, these animals carry out the course and adornment of the present age according to the incomprehensible will of the Creator.</s>
</p>


  <p>
    <s>From their deeds, they will give no account, because they are not rational beings.</s>
    <s>For does God care about oxen? (I Cor. V, 10).</s>
    <s>But humans, because they are rational, will give an account to God for themselves and for all the things they have used in this present life.</s>
    <s>And based on the quality of their actions, they will receive either punishment or glory.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or bad (II Cor. V, 10).</s>
    <s>That is, when according to the word of our Creator and Redeemer: All who are in the graves will hear his voice and come outâ€”those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned (John V, 28, 29).</s>
    <s>So that those who have done evil will go into eternal fire, always burning with the devil, the prince of all evil, while those who have done good will go into eternal life, reigning forever with Christ, the King of all ages.</s>
    <s>They will reign with Christ, whom God has predestined to the kingdom by His free goodness.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For He prepared them by predestination to be worthy of the kingdom, calling them according to His purpose to obey.</s>
    <s>He prepared them to be justified, so that by receiving grace, they would believe rightly and live well.</s>
    <s>He also prepared them to be glorified, so that, being made co-heirs with Christ, they would possess the kingdom of heaven forever.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Baptism should not be repeated.</s>
    <s>To this kingdom, at different times, they have arrived through the sacraments that Christ instituted for the faith in His incarnation, whom God saved freely without any preceding merit of good will or good works.</s>
    <s>As from that time when our Savior said: Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God (John III, 5), no one can receive the kingdom of heaven or eternal life without the sacrament of baptism, except for those who in the Catholic Church shed their blood for Christ without baptism.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For whether in the Catholic faith, heresy, or schism, anyone receives the sacrament of baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, they receive the entire sacrament; but they will not have the salvation, which is the power of the sacrament, if they hold that sacrament outside the Catholic Church.</s>
    <s>Therefore, they must return to the Church, not to receive baptism again, which no one should repeat in any baptized person, but to receive eternal life in the Catholic community.</s>
    <s>One cannot be suitable to obtain it if they remain alienated from the Catholic Church despite having the sacrament of baptism.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Even if they give large alms and shed their blood for the name of Christ, because they did not maintain the unity of the Catholic Church in this life, they will not have eternal salvation.</s>
    <s>Where baptism can benefit someone, alms can also benefit.</s>
    <s>Baptism can indeed exist outside the Church, but it cannot benefit unless it is within the Church.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, only in the Catholic Church can the reception of baptism, works of mercy, and the glorious confession of the name of Christ benefit anyone, provided they live well in the Catholic Church.</s>
    <s>For just as without the Catholic Church's community, neither baptism nor works of mercy can benefit anyone, except perhaps to be tortured less, but not to be counted among the children of God; so within the Catholic Church, eternal life is not acquired by baptism alone if one lives poorly after baptism.</s>
    <s>For even those who live well must continuously engage in works of mercy, knowing that although their sins are light, they still commit some daily, for which even the saints and the righteous should always say to God in this life: Forgive us our debts.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>As we forgive our debtors (Matthew 6:12).</s>
    <s>Just as sins often creep into the lives of men through permissible and God-given things, and the more the body is filled with stronger foods, and the human heart is entangled with physical acts and desires, the more frequently guilt is incurred in this mortal life.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>43. Abstinence. --- Therefore, humble servants of Christ, who wish to serve their Lord without hindrance and without the distraction of guilt, do not seek marriage at all, and abstain from meat and wine as much as their health allows.</s>
    <s>Not because it is a sin to have a spouse or to consume wine and meat: for the blessed Apostle says: "For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer" (1 Timothy 4:4-5).</s>
    <s>God also instituted and blessed marriage at the beginning of humanity (Genesis 2:22).</s>
    <s>That is why the Apostle says: "Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled" (Hebrews 13:4).</s>
    <s>Therefore, servants of God abstain from meat and wine not because they consider these things unclean, but because they follow the practices of a purer life.</s>
    <s>And in not marrying, they do not think marriage is a sin, but they believe that perpetual continence is better than good marriages, especially in this age, when it is said about continence: "He who can accept it, let him accept it" (Matthew 19:12); and about marriage it is said: "But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry" (1 Corinthians 7:9).</s>
    <s>In one, virtue is encouraged, in the other, weakness is remedied.</s>
    <s>Therefore, since illness must always be considered, if someone is first deprived of marriage and then wishes to enter into a second or even a third marriage, they will not have sinned, as long as they keep these marriages pure, meaning that neither the man nor the woman engages with anyone other than their spouse.</s>
    <s>In such cases, even if there is some marital excess, as long as it does not violate the lawful bed, it will be a venial sin.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>44. The vow of continence. --- But these rules apply to those who have not vowed continence to God.</s>
    <s>However, anyone who has castrated themselves for the kingdom of heaven and vowed continence to God in their heart will have condemnation if they are stained by the deadly sin of fornication or if either a man takes a wife or a woman marries, according to the Apostle's judgment (1 Timothy 5:12), because they have broken their first faith.</s>
    <s>Therefore, according to the Apostle's judgment (1 Corinthians 7:3), it is right for a husband to give his wife her due, and likewise, the wife should give her husband his due, because if a man marries, he does not sin, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin.</s>
    <s>But, according to the same Apostle's words, whoever is determined in his heart and has no necessity but has power over his own will and has vowed continence to God must keep it with all the care of his mind until the end, lest he have condemnation for breaking his first faith.</s>
    <s>Similarly, married men or women who have vowed perpetual continence to God by mutual consent should know that they are bound by their vow and no longer owe the debt of physical intimacy, which was once lawful, but owe the continence they vowed to God.</s>
    <s>For each will possess the kingdom of heaven, which is promised to the saints, if they forget what is behind and reach forward to what is ahead, as it is said in the Psalms: "Vow, and pay to the Lord your God" (Psalm 76:11), knowing it is lawful and for the advancement of a better life.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>Cognize that it pertains, and willingly vow, and quickly repay, and in this act of repaying the vow, always strive to improve with better efforts.</s>
    <s>For to everyone who vows to God and repays what they have vowed, God Himself will also grant the promised rewards of the heavenly kingdom.</s>

    <s>And indeed, it cannot be that the true God is not naturally the Truth.</s>

    <s>and the Holy Spirit of the Father and the Son alone, who descended in the form of a dove upon Christ when he was baptized and coming up from the water, and on the fiftieth day after the resurrection, filled the faithful gathered in one place with the division of fiery tongues (Acts 2:3).</s>
    <s>That voice, by which the Father alone spoke; and that flesh, by which the Only Begotten God became man alone; and that dove, in whose form the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ; and those fiery tongues, in the division of which he filled the faithful gathered in one place, are the works of the whole Holy Trinity, that is, of one God, who made everything in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible.</s>

<s>Nature is nothing but good.</s>

<s>All natures were created by Him, and they are good because they were made by the highest good;</s>

<s>There is no nature of evil, because every nature, as far as it is nature, is good.</s>
<s>But because good can be increased or diminished in it, it is called evil to the extent that its good is diminished.</s>
<s>Evil is nothing else but the absence of good.</s>
<s>Thus, it is clear that rational creatures have a twofold evil:</s>
<s>one by which they voluntarily fell from their highest good, their creator, and the other by which they will be punished against their will with the eternal fire's punishment.</s>
<s>They will suffer the latter justly because they committed the former unjustly;</s>

<s>But this ability to not be changed for the worse from the state of happiness in which they are, was not naturally instilled in them but was given by the bounty of divine grace after they were created.</s>
