    <s>We should not abandon them, but rather tolerate the bad among the good, as much as faith and charity demand, meaning if they sow no seeds of treachery in the Church or lead brothers to any evil deed by deadly example.</s>
    <s>No one within the Catholic Church who believes rightly and lives well can be stained by another's sin, if they neither consent to nor support the sinner; it's beneficial to tolerate the bad among the good within the Church, if this is done by living well and giving good counsel, so that seeing and hearing what is good, they reject their own evil and tremble at being judged by God for their bad deeds.</s>
    <s>Thus, with the gift of grace coming first, they become ashamed of their iniquities and turn to a good life through God's mercy.</s>
    <s>The good among the bad within the Catholic Church should only be separated by the difference in their deeds, so that those who share in the divine sacraments with them do not share in their evil works.</s>
    <s>At the end of the world, the good will be separated even physically from the bad, when Christ comes with his winnowing fork in his hand and cleanses his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning the chaff with unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12); when through just judgment he separates the righteous from the unjust, the good from the bad, the upright from the perverse: he will place the good on his right and the bad on his left, and from the mouth of his righteous and eternal judgment, as pronounced with everlasting and unchangeable sentence, all the wicked will go into eternal fire, but the righteous into eternal life (Matthew 25:45): the wicked always burning with the devil, but the righteous reigning forever with Christ.</s>

    <s>Chapter 44. Persisting in faith.</s>
    <s>85. For now, believe faithfully, hold strongly, and defend truly and patiently these forty chapters, which firmly pertain to the rule of true faith.</s>
    <s>If you know anyone teaching contrary to these, avoid them like a plague, and reject them as a heretic.</s>
    <s>For these statements we have set forth conform to the Catholic faith, so that if anyone wishes to contradict not only all but even any single one of them, in that they stubbornly oppose each of these and do not hesitate to teach contrary things, they appear as a heretic and an enemy of the Christian faith, and should be anathematized by all Catholics.</s>
    <s>Although the shortness of time and the haste of the messenger has compelled us to omit some things that should have been included for recognizing and avoiding various heresies, yet if you do not neglect to review and thoroughly understand all that is contained in this little work, you will be able, with careful discernment, to judge spiritually about the rest.</s>
    <s>For the Apostle says that the spiritual person judges all things (1 Corinthians 2:15): until each of us reaches this point, let us walk in what we have reached, that is, faithfully persevere in what we have surely accepted.</s>
    <s>But if he thinks differently about anything, God will reveal this to him as well. Amen.</s>

    <s>ADMONITION regarding the following chapter 45.</s>
    <s>No one denies that the following chapter did not truly come from Fulgentius, but was appended to this completed work by some other unknown author, if one reads the whole book of Fulgentius and pays even moderate attention to the final words of the last chapter.</s>
    <s>For after proposing 40 chapters, or rather rules of true faith, he says that the shortness of time and the haste of the messenger compelled him to omit in silence some things that should have been included otherwise.</s>
    <s>Hence, it is not likely that he (adding moreover the clear conclusion of the whole work) would have increased the already completed work with this longer chapter, which contributes nothing, or nearly nothing, to the matter at hand, or would have repeated the sufficiently brief rules in a shorter speech.</s>
    <s>Furthermore, even if these reasons were not enough to prevent us from attributing this chapter to Fulgentius, all the manuscripts we have seen—four from the Vatican, two from England, and one very old from Corbie, written in a script that suggests it is a thousand years old or more, almost from the time of Fulgentius or shortly thereafter—all of these manuscripts include everything which in this chapter...</s>

  <p>
    <s>Oh, the chapter is read from the beginning, and it ends with these words, "God will reveal this to him too. Amen," written by the same hand, Fulgentius, Bishop of the holy Catholic Church of Ruspe. The Book on the Rule of True Faith ends.</s>
    <s>However, because it was a matter of religion to not exclude anything previously published here, it seemed appropriate to attach this entire chapter to this work as a unique appendix.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>1. The true foundation of faith is fundamentally to believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are naturally one God, such that we believe the only-begotten Son is truly born of the Father, and the Holy Spirit truly and naturally proceeds from both the Father and the Son, and that the Holy Trinity is one, true, eternal, and unchangeable God.</s>
    <s>It is also fitting for salvation to believe that one person of the Trinity, that is, the only-begotten God, was made man solely for our salvation; and that he is truly one true God and one true man, having one nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit according to divinity; and according to humanity, Christ's rational soul is of the same nature as the souls of all humans, and Christ's flesh is of the same nature as that of all who descend from the first man.</s>
    <s>Thus, neither Christ's soul nor his flesh is of the same nature as his divinity because he was truly created according to humanity; but just as his divine nature is common to the Father and the Holy Spirit, so his soul and body naturally share with our souls and bodies.</s>
    <s>By his divinity, he has freed the flesh and soul of believers in him from the dominion of sin and the punishment of eternal death by removing sin.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>2. Armed with this belief, you will not forget to pray day and night for divine mercy, pleading for the blessed hope of all who believe in him, who is Christ the Lord, that you may firmly hold and faithfully keep the truth of this faith: for the Holy Spirit abundantly provides help to those who faithfully pray, as the prophet says, "The Lord is near to all who call on him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him, he will hear their cries and save them. The Lord watches over all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy" (Psalm 145:18-20).</s>
    <s>And again, he says to God, "See, those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you" (Psalm 73:27).</s>
    <s>As for himself, he says, "But as for me, it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord my refuge" (Psalm 73:28).</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>3. Therefore, adhere to God, dearest son, and place your hope in him with all your heart, faith, and love.</s>
    <s>In the service of the world, offer faithful service to the earthly king because God loves this, and the Apostle commands it.</s>
    <s>But in the matter of faith, by which Christ redeemed us with his blood, let all fear depart from our hearts.</s>
    <s>We owe our souls to him whose blood redeemed us.</s>
    <s>We must love him above all whom we know as the most merciful Redeemer of our souls.</s>
    <s>We must fear his eternal and true power above all, whom we hope will come as the most just judge.</s>
    <s>We must seek his promises with all the affection of our hearts, who can grant eternal life to both soul and body.</s>
    <s>We must fear his wrath, who can cast both soul and body into hell: in whose judgment, without favoritism, without ambition of powers, masters and servants, kings and soldiers, rich and poor, humble and exalted will be judged equally; where any servant who has held the faith of God in truth will inherit the eternal kingdom, but the unfaithful master will be burned in eternal fire; where the life of faithful servants and masters will neither end nor will their joy cease, but the unfaithful, whether servants or masters, according to the prophetic word, "Their fire will not be quenched, and their worm will not die" (Isaiah 66:24).</s>
    <s>The wicked will go into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>4. Let us pay attention to those whom the Savior predicted would go there, namely those to whom he will say, "I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me anything to drink; I was naked, and you did not clothe me."</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>You didn't clothe me.</s> 
    <s>I was a stranger, and you didn't welcome me.</s> 
    <s>I was sick and in prison, and you didn't visit me.</s> 
    <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="mæθ.">Matth.</phoneme> 25:42</s> 
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If someone is rightly thrown into eternal fire for not giving bread to Christ in his hungry followers, what will happen to those who deny themselves the bread that came down from heaven through their lack of faith?</s>
    <s>If someone is burned in everlasting flames for not giving a cup of cold water to Christ in his thirsty followers, what will happen to those who, having been reborn from water and the Holy Spirit, allow themselves to re-baptize with the holy baptism they received once for salvation and the sacrament of holy regeneration?</s>
    <s>If we believe that those who neglect to show hospitality to Christ in his foreign followers are subjected to eternal torment, what will happen to those who exclude the Lord Christ from their hearts, welcome the devil with blind faith, and leave the holy Church, which is the pillar and foundation of truth <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="aɪ tɪm.">I Tim.</phoneme> 3:15, surrounded by heretical falsehoods?</s>
    <s>If someone who does not visit Christ's followers who are sick and in prison is assigned to eternal fire, what should we say about those who violently afflict God's followers, persecuting them solely for their faith, either by the filth of prisons or the exile of deportation?</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But in all these things, although the faithless may rage, God still provides help to His own.</s>
    <s>And while the enemies of faith desire to corrupt anyone through cunning seduction or violent compulsion, Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, grants strength to despise the promises of deadly persuasion and to oppose human terrors with the strength of divine fear.</s>
    <s>The only requirement is that the will does not turn away from God, and thus the reward of faith is attained.</s>
    <s>For it is the same faith that either eternal punishment is inflicted for unfaithfulness, or eternal joy is the reward for preserved faith.</s>
