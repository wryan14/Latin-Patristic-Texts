            "original_latin": "His igitur atque innumeris hujusmodi testimoniis,\nquibus Dominus Deus noster misericors praedicatur\n et justus, ostenditur quantum diligenda sit ejus misericordia,\nquantumque justitia metuenda monstratur. Misericors enim et miserator Dominus, patiens\net multum misericors et verax, sicut novit a converso\nsubmovere supplicium, sic in eo qui converti noluerit,\nnullatenus sinit inultum remanere peccatum. Idcirco\nsi quos in praesenti saeculo pia Dei bonitas a\ndominatione peccati non liberat, ipsos in futuro severitas\njusta condemnat. Hinc est quod divinis indesinenter\neloquiis mali salubriter admonentur, ne\nremaneant in servitute peccati, sed misericordiam\njusti Dei, dum sunt in hac vita, requirant. Bonis quoque\npraecipitur (Psal II 11 12 13), ut servientes\nDomino in timore, et exsultantes ei cum tremore,\napprehendant disciplinam; ne quando irascatur Dominus\n et pereant de via justa. Ipse itaque Deus qui\nest misericors et justus, sicut admonet, ut propter\njustitiam et misericordiam timeatur et diligatur a\nmalis, ut conversi careant poena quam justitia minatur,\net accipiant indulgentiam quam misericordia\npollicetur, sic admonet ut propter justitiam et misericordiam\ndiligatur et timeatur a bonis, quo possint\nqui ejus praeventi misericordia boni sunt, et dilectione\nmisericordiae in bonis operibus permanere, et\ntimore justitiae a peccatis semetipsos sollicite custodire;\net consideratione propriae infirmitatis instructi\nnunquam de suis viribus confidant, sed divinae virtutis\nauxilium jugiter et humiliter poscant.",
