The Christian faith, therefore, which knows the Only Begotten God and that He was born solely from the nature of the Father and created from the Virgin Mary, recognizing that both natures truly remain in Him, thus truly confesses Him to be equal to God the Father, so that without the crime of lying and impiety, it also proclaims Him to be lesser.

For because He has one natural divinity with the Father and one natural humanity with the mother, the Son is equal to the Father in that He is truly God from the Father. The Father is greater than the Son in that the Only Begotten God is truly human.

This, therefore, is the true faith, this is the holy piety, this is the Christian belief: to believe in one and the same Son of God, both the nature of the Father’s divinity, and not to deny the substance of the mother’s humanity; not to believe in a different divinity of the Son from the divinity of God the Father, nor to separate the humanity of the Son from the humanity of the Virgin mother, but to believe in the same true God the true and entire humanity of our kind, in the same true and entire human being, to believe in the full and complete divinity of the Father’s nature.

For he who denies the unity of the Father’s substance in the Son is polluted by Arian impiety; but he who denies the truth of the flesh in the Only Begotten God is profaned by the crime of Manichaean heresy; and he who denies in the same Son of God the human, that is, rational soul, is immediately defiled by the sacrilege of the Apollinarians.
