In one and the same Christ, just as the weakness of human flesh could not give or restore life by itself, because the power to lay down life and take it up again did not come from human weakness, but from divine strength;

so the eternity of divine power, which naturally has the property of living unchangeably and unfailingly, could not feel any weakness or death on the cross.

Therefore, the only begotten Son of God is recognized as true God born from the Father and true man made from the mother, because He showed signs of weakness in the truth of the flesh, and demonstrated signs of power in the truth of divinity;

showing clearly in the unity of His person that He naturally shares one aspect with us and another with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

For Christ naturally shares with us a connection of soul and flesh; but with the Father and the Holy Spirit, He naturally shares the connection of divinity.

How then could the Son of God have in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit those things which belong to the flesh, since He did not confuse His flesh with His divinity in any way?

Thus, it does not contradict the Catholic faith that we believe our nature was assumed in the unity of the person by the only begotten Savior, while we acknowledge that the substance of the Holy Trinity remains one.

Indeed, the whole Trinity made that humanity of the Son, but just as the whole Trinity made it, the whole Trinity did not assume it, because the person, which is not common to the Son with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is itself the one in Christ that is of divinity and flesh.

However, where there is any distinction, whether of persons or substances, it is not always referred to the communion of acceptance whatever is found in the communion of work.

Because this seems obscure when expressed only in words, it is better to provide an example to facilitate understanding as much as the matter allows.
