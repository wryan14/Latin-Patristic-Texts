So, when the blessed Apostle trusts that by God's grace we cannot be separated from His love, how can those who do not hesitate to preach a divided Holy Trinity not feel themselves entangled in the deadly snare of impiety, when they cannot show the works of the Trinity as separable in any way?

For in what the evangelist says about the Son: "All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made" 
John
 1:3; and in what the blessed David sings: "How magnificent are Your works, Lord! You made everything in wisdom" 
Psalm
 104:24; and the blessed Apostle professes Christ as the power and wisdom of God, about whom it is said: "For in Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powersâ€”all things were created through Him and for Him" 
Colossians
 1:16; it is clear that all the works of the Father are the same works of the Son, and the same works of the Holy Spirit. 

The Holy Trinity indeed works inseparably: there is no work done by the Father that is not done by the Son, or done by the Son that is not done by the Holy Spirit. For it is written, "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth" 
Psalm
 33:6.

Regarding the wisdom, which we say is created among the angels, we read in the book of Ecclesiasticus: "Wisdom was created before all things, and understanding of prudence from everlasting" Ecclesiasticus 1:4. To show that the angels were also made by the Word of God through whom all things were made, the Holy Scripture immediately added: "The fountain of wisdom is the Word of God, and her ways are everlasting commandments" Ecclesiasticus 1:5. And shortly after, to show that the angels belong to the works of the Holy Spirit, it is said: "One only is most high, the Creator Almighty, the powerful King, and greatly to be feared, who sits upon His throne and rules. God created her in the Holy Spirit" Ecclesiasticus 1:8.

What, therefore, can be denied to have been made by the Holy Spirit, from whom the power of the heavens is said to be established, and whose works are proclaimed as created wisdom? For when the blessed Apostle spoke of the divine gifts which God granted to His Church and said: "Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone" 
First Corinthians
 12:4; then, after listing the diversity of heavenly gifts, he added: "All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as He wills" 
First Corinthians
 12:11.

What, among all creatures where wisdom reaches from one end to the other mightily and orders all things sweetly (Wisdom 8:1), can be found apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, since Christ, who is the power and wisdom of God, declares that He casts out demons by the Spirit of God? For He Himself said: "But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you" 
Matthew
 12:28.

How then does Fastidiosus deny the inseparable Trinity, when no Christian dares deny that the works of the Trinity are the same and inseparable in all creatures? For the one God, namely the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, works inseparably. The Only Begotten of God indeed declares that His works are the same as those of His Father, saying: "For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise" 
John
 5:19. And yet what the Son does, He does in the Holy Spirit, by whom He casts out demons.
