God the Father, His Word, and the Holy Spirit—that is, the Holy Trinity—is the only, true, and good God. In Him, there is no thought that changes with time. Unlike humans, He did not think one way before creating the world and another way after creating the world, nor will He think differently after the figure of this world passes away, for the plan of the Lord remains forever.

Just as He is unchangeable, He is also inseparable. The Trinity is one God, neither a body nor a created spirit, because a body is confined by place, and every created spirit is limited by its nature. The Trinity, however, is one God, eternal, with no times co-eternal with Him; He is immense, and no creature can contain Him. Because He is immense, He is wholly present everywhere; He cannot be confined by place nor stretched or contracted by space.

God is wisdom, God is truth, God is love. This is the Father, this is the Son, this is the Holy Spirit, this is the Trinity itself, who is the one, true, and good God. Therefore, if anyone can teach that there is any division in wisdom, truth, or love, let them boldly declare the Trinity to be divided. But if wisdom, truth, and love are in no way divided, then the Trinity is known to be indivisible and inseparable.

It is clear then that the impiety of Fastidiosus was great, since he thought we were to be utterly blamed for confessing the inseparable and indivisible Trinity. As the preceding discussion has shown (which has been strengthened not only by reason but also by a sufficient abundance of divine testimonies), the immense nature of the Trinity cannot be contained by place, nor can any person in the Trinity be subject to sin, because the Trinity itself is naturally eternal, perfect, and unchangeable in justice.

The heretical error indeed tries to assert falsely that the Son is lesser, but with piety preserved, Catholic truth confesses Him as equal. Heretics, thinking of the incorporeal divinity only in corporeal terms, say the Son is lesser by nature. Under the pretense of the Christian name, which they falsely display, they involve themselves in the abominable crime of idolatry. For what is it to say that one person of the deity is greater and another lesser, if not to place idols of different kinds and virtues not on walls, but in hearts, which is worse?

Thus, Arians clearly show they worship two gods when they deny the Son is equal to the Father. They claim the Son is lesser, not by the assumption of flesh (which the truth of faith holds), but by the nature of immense divinity. This is despite it being said of Him, who is the wisdom of God, who is the radiance of eternal light (Wisdom of Solomon 7:26). It is said in the Letter to the Hebrews: "He is the radiance of His glory, and the exact representation of His being" (Hebrews 1:3). Let them consider the radiance of eternal light and recognize that just as that light is eternal and immense, so too its radiance is neither naturally posterior nor lesser in any way; but eternity and immensity are equal.
