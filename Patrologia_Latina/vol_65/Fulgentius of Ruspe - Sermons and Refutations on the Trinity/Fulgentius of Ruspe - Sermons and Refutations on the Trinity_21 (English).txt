However, with a perverse heart and sacrilegious mouth, he arrogantly wanted to assert that the Son is separate from the Father and the Holy Spirit because it is known that only He entered the chamber of the virgin's womb.

About this, it is said in the Book of Psalms: 

"And he is like a groom coming out of his chamber" 
(Psalms 19:6).

Desiring then to affirm his perverse opinion, he did not hesitate to assert this blasphemy, saying that the Trinity could not in any way be separated, which is completely undivided.

Therefore, did the whole Trinity take on flesh? 

Did the whole Trinity suffer the injuries of passion? 

Did the whole Trinity lie in the tomb? 

Did the whole Trinity descend into hell? 

Did the whole Trinity rise from the dead on the third day? 

Did the whole Trinity ascend into heaven on the fortieth day?

Does the whole Trinity sit at the right hand, or did the whole Trinity send the Spirit to the apostles on the day of Pentecost? 

Or to which God could the whole Trinity say on the cross, 
 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" 

Or to which Father did the whole Trinity say, 
 "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit?"

If they can, let them declare. 

But if they cannot say this, they destroy themselves with their own darts, 
 who argue that the Trinity is inseparable.
