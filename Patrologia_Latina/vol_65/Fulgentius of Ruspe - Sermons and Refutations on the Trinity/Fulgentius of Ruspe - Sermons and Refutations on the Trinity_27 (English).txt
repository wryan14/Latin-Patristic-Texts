Now indeed, because we say there are two natures in Christ: one divine and one human, we believe and confess that the human nature, that is, flesh and a rational soul, was assumed not by the whole Trinity, but by the Son alone.

In the unity of person, not in the unity of nature, the Only Begotten God took on flesh and soul. The person of the Son is not the same as that of the Father or the Holy Spirit.

Therefore, the unity of person, with the property of each substance remaining intact, just as it did not make the person in Christ double, did not make the assumption of human nature common to the Holy Trinity.

For the Son of God, just as there is one common nature with the Father and the Holy Spirit, so there is one common person.
