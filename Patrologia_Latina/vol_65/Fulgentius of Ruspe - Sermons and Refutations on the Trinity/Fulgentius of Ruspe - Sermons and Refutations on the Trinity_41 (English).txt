Since the Arians do not understand what we have said—that in the one divine nature, something is made by the entire Trinity, which is not taken on by the entire Trinity; nor is it believed possible that the entire Trinity made that flesh, which, however, one person of the Trinity took on—let us, as the Apostle says in 
First Thessalonians 2:7
, be like little children among them, and offer them this example to nurture their spiritual understanding without tiring or disturbing their narrow hearts.

We know that the divine Trinity is one, inseparable, and indivisible, whose nature cannot be divided into three persons, nor can the three persons be confused into the unity of an indivisible nature. For even the human mind, in which we said the image of God resides, has received a certain indication of the holy Trinity within itself, without having a distinction of three persons within it. This is something the divine Trinity has uniquely preserved for itself.

Therefore, although there is memory, intelligence, and will in the human mind, these three are not three persons: because in each human being, in whose mind, or whose mind is the image of the divine, not only the mind but also the soul and body are naturally found to be one person. Therefore, in creation, as much as the magnitude of the matter we are discussing allows, we perhaps find such an example in nature that we cannot find in persons. We said that the humanity of the Son of God was made by the entire Trinity, which, however, was accepted not by the entire Trinity but by the Son alone into His person. For that flesh was made by the entire Trinity, that is, by the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; but only the Word became flesh.

Since, as we said above, regarding creation, we cannot find three persons in one mind, that is, in one body, we do not struggle to find at least two natures in one person. For the person of each living human being consists of a rational soul and a body: from which, however, many things are done in such a way that although they are done by both soul and body together, sometimes they pertain only to the soul or only to the body.

For who does not know that only the body is refreshed and nourished by physical food, in whose consumption the operation of both flesh and soul is common? For the soul acts through the body, or rather with the body, when the body eats; yet only the body receives what the soul together with the body acts to receive. In that consumption, therefore, there is a joint operation of the soul and flesh, but the reception is solely of the flesh. Only the flesh is nourished by physical food to the extent that only it becomes fat if it receives it. However, the nourishment and fattening of the soul consist not in physical bread but in spiritual bread. For man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God (Matthew 4:4).

In the perception of this word, however, so that the soul is nourished by its food, the flesh is joined in the work. This happens when the soul brings the bodily ears to the words to hear them, or the bodily eyes to the scriptures to read them. So, in this, too, there is a joint operation of the flesh and soul, where the reception is solely of the soul. Let the Arians see these things in creatures and not doubt that the divine nature of the holy Trinity is one, and that it was possible, indeed it happened, that that flesh was made by the one and inseparable work of the entire Trinity; but in the sacrament of the incarnation, it pertained only to the person of the Only Begotten God.
