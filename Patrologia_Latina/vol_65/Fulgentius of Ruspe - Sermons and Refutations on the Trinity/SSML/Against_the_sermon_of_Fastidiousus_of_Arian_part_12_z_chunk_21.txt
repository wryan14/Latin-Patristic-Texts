    However, with a perverse heart and sacrilegious mouth, he arrogantly wanted to assert that the Son is separate from the Father and the Holy Spirit because it is known that only He entered the chamber of the virgin's womb.

  <p>
    About this, it is said in the Book of Psalms: <break time="500ms"/>
    "And he is like a groom coming out of his chamber" <break time="500ms"/>(Psalms 19:6).
  </p>
  <p>
    Desiring then to affirm his perverse opinion, he did not hesitate to assert this blasphemy, saying that the Trinity could not in any way be separated, which is completely undivided.

    Therefore, did the whole Trinity take on flesh? <break time="500ms"/>
    Did the whole Trinity suffer the injuries of passion? <break time="500ms"/>
    Did the whole Trinity lie in the tomb? <break time="500ms"/>
    Did the whole Trinity descend into hell? <break time="500ms"/>
    Did the whole Trinity rise from the dead on the third day? <break time="500ms"/>
    Did the whole Trinity ascend into heaven on the fortieth day?
  </p>
  <p>
    Does the whole Trinity sit at the right hand, or did the whole Trinity send the Spirit to the apostles on the day of Pentecost? <break time="500ms"/>
    Or to which God could the whole Trinity say on the cross, <break time="500ms"/> "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" <break time="500ms"/>
    Or to which Father did the whole Trinity say, <break time="500ms"/> "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit?"
  </p>
  <p>
    If they can, let them declare. <break time="500ms"/> 
    But if they cannot say this, they destroy themselves with their own darts, <break time="500ms"/> who argue that the Trinity is inseparable.
