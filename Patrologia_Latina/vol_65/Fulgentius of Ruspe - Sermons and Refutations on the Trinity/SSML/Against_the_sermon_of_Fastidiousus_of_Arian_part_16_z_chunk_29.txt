    It is therefore unique to the Son alone to have mercifully taken on the form of a servant. For that acceptance of the servant's form pertained to the person of the Word of God, which did not transition into the divine nature by confusion. Thus, the acceptance of that servant's form, according to which the Son of God, who is the Lord of all things and in whom all the fullness of divinity dwells, became truly and fully human, took nothing away from His divine fullness, nor did it remove any dominion.

    Because in that one person, the divine and human nature remained without confusion. Hence, in the one and same Christ, both the truth of the human nature shone forth, and the unchanging eternity of the divine nature remained. For what He naturally possessed in eternity was neither diminished nor changed by what He took on in time.

    For He became a servant in appearance, but did not cease to be naturally the Lord of all things. And He became poor according to the flesh: yet nevertheless remained exceedingly rich according to His divinity. Hence, the blessed Apostle asserts that Christians are enriched by poverty, saying: "You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich" <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="tuː kəˈrɪnθiənz">Second Corinthians</phoneme> <w role="ivona:NN">8:9</w>.

    He would not make us rich by His poverty if, being made poor, He did not possess the riches of His natural divinity. Therefore, He became poor according to the form of a servant, but remained rich according to the form of God. The poverty of the servant's form is not common to Him with the Father and the Holy Spirit; because after taking on the poverty of human nature in the unity of the person, the divine substance remained rich in Him.

    And what was the poverty of the rich Son of God but our weakness and our mortality? Whatever the Only-begotten God endured in weakness and death according to the flesh, His divinity did not feel. For God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈroʊmənz">Romans</phoneme> <w role="ivona:NN">8:3</w>, in which there was true flesh, but there was no pollution of sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the likeness of sinful flesh was in the flesh of Christ, although it was not flesh of sin, for it was weak, passible, and mortal, subjected to wounds and pain. Yet all these things were common to Christ's divinity and humanity personally, not substantially. The person of Christ is completely distinct from the person of the Father and the Holy Spirit. This one person of divinity and humanity in Christ remains in such a way that it neither allows one nature to be separated from the other nor permits both to be confused.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the true life, is the way for us because He had true weakness in the truth of the flesh; and He is the true life for us because true virtue remained in His true divinity. Discerning this, the Apostle says, "For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God" <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="tuː kəˈrɪnθiənz">Second Corinthians</phoneme> <w role="ivona:NN">13:4</w>.
