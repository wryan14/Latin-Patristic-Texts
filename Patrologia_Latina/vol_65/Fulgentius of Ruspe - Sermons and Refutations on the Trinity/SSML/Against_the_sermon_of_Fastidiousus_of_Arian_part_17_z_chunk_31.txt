            In one and the same Christ, just as the weakness of human flesh could not give or restore life by itself, because the power to lay down life and take it up again did not come from human weakness, but from divine strength;

            so the eternity of divine power, which naturally has the property of living unchangeably and unfailingly, could not feel any weakness or death on the cross.
