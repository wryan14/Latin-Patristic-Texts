    Therefore, that word which is born from memory, according to the nature by which it is found in memory to be born, cannot be conveyed to the ears of any person without a physical voice. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, in order to be expressed to others, it is clothed in the form of a physical voice. A physical voice from the mouth is joined to this word.

    And so it happens that the word, which was entirely in the mind spiritually, comes to others through a physical voice, and it does not depart from the mind from which and in which it spiritually remains. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For it is necessary that it remains entirely in the mind, even when it is entirely expressed in the voice. 
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Yet we cannot say that the expression of the word is not made by memory or will alone. For everyone who speaks remembers and thinks about what they are going to say; and they speak because memory and thought work together with the will to produce speech. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For anything a person knowingly says, they surely say willingly, so much so that if a person is compelled to speak against their will, they will not speak as long as their will is not inclined to do so.

  <p>
    This is why those who, now under fear or pain of temporal matters, tribulations, or tortures, have abandoned the truth of the Catholic faith and turned to impiety and disbelief, will find no excuse to say they denied the true faith unwillingly, as it appears they did so by their own will. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For even if the mind is led to deny faith by tribulation or torture, it did not deny unwillingly. To deny the faith, one first thinks and wills it, and thus expresses that denial: because thought along with will decided that it should be done.
