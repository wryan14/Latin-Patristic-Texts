    <p>If that wretched Fastidiosus had not rejected this faith, without a doubt he would not have perished.</p>
    <p>But because he denied it both in deeds and in words, it is not surprising that he became wicked in action, corrupt in speech, and an enemy of light, walking in darkness.</p>
    <p>Physical fornication, which first took hold of his mind and body, then led him to the precipice of spiritual fornication. For he took the members of Christ and made them members of a prostitute. And thus, he did not hesitate to lose the chastity of faith, because he did not regret losing the chastity of his body.</p>
    <p>See how much evil the lust of the flesh brought him, which could lead that wretch to deny the truth! This was the storm that carried away the chaff from the Lord's threshing floor and fixed it among the thorns of heretical impiety. This made him speak against his own conscience and utter perverse words in contempt of the Trinity.</p>
    <p>For he did not believe what he said to be true, but with a double heart, he preferred to say something other than what he believed.</p>
    <p>Possessed by such despair, he took away his own hope of forgiveness and sought to fulfill the pleasures of lust without restraint. From his own mouth, which should have been used for justification, he received an increase in condemnation. When his tongue, which should have spoken words of repentance, spoke words of blasphemy.</p>
    <p>Thus, that wretched Fastidiosus preferred to go to the place where he could blaspheme against God with sacrilegious insolence. In his fornications, having no fear of God, he did not even fear man.</p>
    <p>Woe to that wretch, who wanted to be separated from the fellowship of the church so that he would never lack punishment; and who wanted to sin without any fear so that he might deserve to burn forever.</p>
