        Where are those two years now that Fastidiosus thought were happy because he spent them in fornication as he wished? How quickly they passed! Even if they had been not just two hundred but two thousand years, they would have passed quickly.

        What will the wretched man do when he comes to the judgment of the one he denied? What will he receive for such actions and words? What will he receive, that man who was indulgent with his body, blind in heart, and blasphemous in error? He who first violated the temple of God within himself by fornication, then left the church physically as well. What will he receive from that Holy Trinity, he who preferred to be a servant of lust and treachery? Surely nothing but the eternal fire, which is prepared for such deeds.

        And in this time, Fastidiosus's fornication ended quickly, but his eternal burning in that fire will not end. Therefore, Christians should avoid both forms of fornication that miserable Fastidiosus fell into; keeping their souls, they should maintain purity of both heart and body. They should hold onto the faith within the Catholic Church. They should believe and confess the inseparable and indivisible Trinity, which in its divine nature has nothing created, nothing even partially begun; whose single and inseparable work made everything in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible.

        They should also believe and confess the Only Begotten God, who was born of the Father according to true divinity, and created from the Virgin according to true humanity; and through the work of the Trinity, took on flesh and a rational soul in the unity of the person for the salvation of the world. Holding firmly to this, they should act and persevere in good works. For in Christ Jesus, the only thing that counts is faith working through love. <break time="500ms"/> And anyone who departs from it will be guilty of his own soul. But anyone who perseveres in it to the end will be saved.
