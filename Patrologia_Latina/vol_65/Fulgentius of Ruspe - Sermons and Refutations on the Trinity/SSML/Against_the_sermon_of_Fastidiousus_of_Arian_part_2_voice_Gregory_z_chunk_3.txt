        We say, very wise brothers, what the divinity deigns to bestow upon our smallness. God is the author of justice and life; indeed, He is our justice and our life. <s>He did not create man for sin or death.</s> As Scripture says, <break time="500ms"/> "God did not make death, nor does He delight in the destruction of the living" <break time="500ms"/> (Wisdom 1:13).
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>So what then?</s> <break time="500ms"/> Death happened to the man whom God had made. <s>It is not said to be the work of the Creator, but of the deceiver, the devil.</s> <s>After man was deceived by the devil, he, who willingly committed iniquity, unwillingly fell into death:</s> <s>he transgressed unjustly, and was justly punished.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        God, seeing these two things in man, guilt and death, <s>one which he had done badly, the other which he had justly suffered;</s> with these two very strong chains man was held bound. He commanded that the Lord Christ should take on flesh, <break time="500ms"/> not in which He would become a sinner in debt, but in which, without the debt of sin, He would undeservedly endure death for debtors. <s>Not so that the Son of God would be bound by the chain of iniquity, but so that the sinful man would be freed from the chain of iniquity.</s> This is what the Apostle says, "The great mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, taken up in glory" (First Timothy 3:16).
    </p>
    <p>
        And truly, most learned Christians, what greater kindness could there have been than that the Son of God, obeying the paternal command, <break time="500ms"/> should take on human flesh for carnal men, and endure death for mortals with life? And He who was born before the ages, <break time="500ms"/> founded by the Father, should be born from a Virgin in the last time? <s>He who gives life to the world should lie dead in a tomb?</s> How many tears should now be shed, or how much affliction of the heart should be mourned, that many still refuse to abandon the hardness of their stubbornness, while indiscriminately desiring to serve harmful inclinations.

    <p>
        They do not comply with healing remedies, or reject the will of correction, <s>opposing their contrary hands to life-giving words as to medicinal tools.</s> <s>Thus they wound themselves from where they should have been healed and turn the power of spiritual medicines against themselves.</s> Thus they increase the rot of their wounds from where they could have attained health.
    </p>
    <p>
        A twofold error crept in long ago, which, binding the souls of the lost until now, does not allow them to breathe to seek the truth. <s>The Homousians assert the inseparable and indivisible Trinity, neither the Son being lesser than the Father, nor the Father being the creator of His Son;</s> the Donatists also proclaim that the good are polluted by the communion of the wicked, while they cast far away the gift of healing salvation of the holy Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among them, the holy mother Catholic Church is known to chant with Davidic murmur, as we have sung in the present psalm: "Lord, lead me in Your justice because of my enemies" <break time="500ms"/> (Psalm 5:9). For I am led in Your justice, while I believe in You, Almighty God, unbegotten and uncreated, the creator of Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as testified by John the Baptist: "After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me" <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:11). And Peter the apostle preaching and saying: "Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ" <break time="500ms"/> (Acts 2:36). Solomon also previously declaring from the person of Christ: "I was established before the ages" <break time="500ms"/> (Proverbs 8:23). Behold, Scripture testifies that He was made, created, and established, whom sacrilegious people detest believing in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, they assert the inseparable and indivisible Trinity, as said above. And if the Son, of whom the evangelist says: "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:14), with His divinity's power briefly obscured, alone entered the chamber of the Virgin's womb, He was undoubtedly separated from the Father and the Holy Spirit. But the Trinity could not at all be separated from one, which evidently cannot be divided in any way, according to their absurdity. Therefore, the entire Trinity took on flesh, the entire Trinity felt the injuries of suffering, <s>the entire Trinity lay in the tomb, the entire Trinity descended to the underworld, the entire Trinity rose from the dead on the third day, the entire Trinity ascended to the heavens on the fortieth day?</s> And at whose right hand does the entire Trinity...
    </p>
    <p> 
        And at whose right hand does the entire Trinity...
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Is he sitting?</s>
        <s>Or which Spirit did the entire Trinity send to the apostles on the day of Pentecost?</s>
        <s>Or to which God could the entire Trinity in heaven say: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="psɑlm">Psalm</phoneme> 22:1?</s>
        <s>Or to which Father did the entire Trinity say: "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luːk">Luke</phoneme> 23:46?</s>
        <s>If they can, let them declare.</s>
        <s>But if they cannot say, they destroy themselves with their own arrows, who contend that the Trinity is inseparable.</s>
        <s>For the vanity of the Donatists does not consider that the benefit of baptism was given to humans for this reason: that those who are burdened by others' errors from the beginning, relieved by the help of healing grace, might henceforth bear only their own burdens.</s>
        <s>Nor was it the communion of the sacrament, but the consensus of sin that would condemn each one.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Because just as the Lord said He would repay the sins of the parents to the third and fourth generation, because earthly and carnal birth is shown to be subject to original sin: so in another place, as He testifies that both the soul of the father and the soul of the son are His, the second and heavenly birth is known to be completely free from others' sins.</s>
        <s>For immediately it follows: "The soul that sins shall die" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ɛzəkil">Ezekiel</phoneme> 18:20.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>To this sentence Solomon's admonition agrees, showing that one is not burdened by another's sins: "My son," he says, "if you are good, it will be for yourself and your neighbors; but if you become evil, you alone will bear the evil" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="prəvɜrbz">Proverbs</phoneme> 9:12.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Therefore, the Catholic faith, fleeing from the precipices of every error, and, with the Lord leading, proceeding on the path of heavenly journey, declares with sober belief: "Lord, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies" <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="psɑlm">Psalm</phoneme> 5:8.</s>
    </p>
<p>
    <s>And then asking the Father through the Son for the Holy Spirit, in the righteousness of the path, by whose free gift the ability to walk is obtained, it acknowledges that those not yet baptized are subject not only to their own sins but also to those of others, whom it knows to be conceived in iniquity.</s>
    <s>But it asserts that those washed in the water of birth are free from others' iniquity if the consent of the will is not held in crime.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>For as many as believed in Him, says John the Evangelist, He gave them the power to become children of God; to those who believe in His name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 1:12-13.</s>
    <s>Thus, just as those born of the will of the flesh and the will of man inherit others' sins, although they do not yet have their own: so those born of God, if there is no fault of their own will in them, are not stained by the injury of others' iniquity.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Because just as the first birth implanted what the newborn did not do by eating, so the second birth, having washed away original sin, imputes sin only to the will.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in this part, we must be separated from the evil ones, in which, having the firstfruits of the Spirit, buried with Christ in baptism, we have risen.</s>
    <s>In this, too, we put off the old man, who is corrupted according to the desires of error, with the grace of God preceding and accompanying us, so that we may put on the new man, who is created according to God in righteousness and in the holiness of love: Through the Lord.</s>
