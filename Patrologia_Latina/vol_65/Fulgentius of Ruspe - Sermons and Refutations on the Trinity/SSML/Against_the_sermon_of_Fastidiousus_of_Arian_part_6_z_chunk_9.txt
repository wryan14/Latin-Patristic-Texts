    But let the Arians not claim any issue of divergence just because we said that the Son, too, does everything through the Holy Spirit. They might think that someone should be considered lesser if something is done through him by another. Let them listen to our Savior, who completely opposes this perversion by saying:
  </p>
  <p>
    "But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God" (John 3:21).
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, let the Arians choose how they want to understand God mentioned in the Sonâ€”whether as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. If they consider it to be the Father in whom good works are done by men, they themselves destroy their own argument when they blaspheme against the person of the Holy Spirit. For they would not dare to call the Father lesser, to whom they do not want to proclaim the Son as equal in divinity. Therefore, since a man does good works in the Father, and Christ casts out demons in the Holy Spirit, they should recognize the equality of the Father and the Holy Spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    If they say that it is the Son here because good works are done in the Son and in the Holy Spirit, they are compelled to admit not only that the Son and the Holy Spirit are equal but also that the works of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same and inseparable. For "the same Spirit works all these things" (First Corinthians 12:11), as the blessed Apostle testifies.

    If the Arians consider it to be the Holy Spirit, they must be compelled from this passage to acknowledge that the Holy Spirit is God. For it does not say that the Spirit of the Lord, "who does what is true, so that his works may be clearly seen in the Holy Spirit," but "in God," which we do not say is done solely in the Father, nor solely in the Son, nor solely in the Holy Spirit, but in the Holy Trinity itself, which is one God. We confess that the truth is done by man, in whom the blessed David hints that strength is done by the faithful, saying: "We will gain strength in the Lord, and he will bring to nothing those who trouble us" (Psalm 60:12).
  </p>
  <p>
    For he is the one God about whom the blessed Apostle says, "For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever" (Romans 11:36).
