    So then, how is the Holy Trinity said to be separable by the impious, when it works inseparably? From whom, as much as can be understood, it is not thought to be separable even in spirit, as the truth of the matter demands?
    <s>
      For nothing can be separated locally from our God, that is, from the Holy Trinity itself, because the same supreme, true, and good God, just as He made everything, so He contains and fills everything immeasurably.
    </s>
    <s>
      He is not physical, nor local, and therefore even physical things cannot be separated locally from God; because every body is in a place, and no place exists without God.
    </s>
    <s>
      For God is not contained by any place, but He Himself contains every place; in which there is no bulk, and whose power is immense.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, since bodies, which cannot exist without a place, cannot be separated locally from God, without a doubt, neither can the spirits that God created be separated locally from God.
    </s>
    <s>
      For every spirit that God created, wherever it is, there is God: who, although He is not in wicked spirits through grace, by which He grants holy life and happiness to whom He wills, He is always in all His creatures through natural power, so that no creature or part of a creature can be found in which God is not present through power.

    <s>
      Therefore, the nature that can be separated from God is the one that could or can be subject to sin.
    </s>
    <s>
      And there is no other thing that can depart from God except the substance that can or could sin by its own will.
    </s>
    <s>
      For Isaiah says: "Behold, the hand of the Lord is not shortened, that it cannot save, nor is His ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have separated you from your God" (Isaiah 59:1-2).
    </s>

    <s>
      In the Book of Wisdom, it is also shown that men are separated from God not by places, but by wicked thoughts and unjust actions.
    </s>
    <s>
      For it is said there: "Perverse thoughts separate from God. Proven virtue corrects the foolish: for wisdom does not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins; for the Holy Spirit of discipline flees deceit, and removes itself from thoughts that are without understanding" (Wisdom 1:3-5).
    </s>
    <s>
      Here, who does not see the Trinity of persons indicated by their properties?
    </s>
    <s>
      For it is said that perverse thoughts separate from God, by which the person of God the Father is recognized.
    </s>
    <s>
      Then it is added, that wisdom will not enter a malevolent soul, by which Christ is indicated, whom Paul calls the power and wisdom of God.
    </s>
    <s>
      Then it is said that the Holy Spirit flees deceit, and removes itself from thoughts that are without understanding.

    <s>
      Lest anyone think that any wicked or impious persons could be separated locally from this Holy Trinity, which is one, true, and good God, the Scripture speaks thus shortly after: "For the spirit of wisdom is humane, and will not free the blasphemer from his lips, because God is the witness of his innermost being, and a true inspector of his heart, and a listener to his tongue. For the Spirit of the Lord has filled the whole world" (Wisdom 1:6-7).
    </s>
    <s>
      Thus, the divine words do not cease to proclaim the immensity of the Holy Trinity.
    </s>

      Blessed David certainly knew this very well, and therefore said: "Where can I go from Your Spirit, and where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there" (Psalm 139:7-8).
    </s>
    <s>
      Concerning Wisdom, that is, the Son of God, Scripture says, "She reaches from one end to the other mightily and sweetly orders all things" (Wisdom 8:1).
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, since nothing is locally separated from the Holy Trinity, which is entirely everywhere, but only iniquities and perverse thoughts, as we have already said, separate from God; whoever tries to assert that the Trinity is separable must necessarily say that either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit can naturally be subject to perverse thoughts and iniquities.
    </s>
    <s>
      But who could entangle themselves in such a snare of impiety to suspect any separation in that Trinity, where there is natural unity, when Paul the faithful confidently trusts that through received grace, as we have shown above, he cannot be separated from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

    <s>
      But the blessed apostle John also confirms that love is from God, and that love is God with these words: 
      <break time="500ms"/> 
      <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="bəˈlʌvɪd">Beloved</phoneme>, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves is from God.
    </s>
    <s>
      <break time="500ms"/> 
      And, God is love.
    </s>
    <s>
      Of course, it cannot be separated from itself, because it is inseparable.
    </s>
    <s>
      For when people, who can be separated from each other, not only possess it inseparably, but also make one heart and one soul out of many hearts and souls; what madness is it to say that love itself is separable, which usually unites separated minds with inseparable love?
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence it is that Paul said: For even if I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order.
      <break time="500ms"/> 
      And it is written in the Acts of the Apostles that the multitude of believers were of one heart and one soul.
    </s>
    <s>
      Which, of course, only the spirit of faith and love knows.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the love of God has been poured into our hearts.
      <break time="500ms"/> 
      And through this Spirit, it is made that all believers, as the Apostle says, are one body and one spirit.
    </s>
    <s>
      Hence he himself says in another place: For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.
    </s>
    <s>
      The only-begotten Son of God commanded with his own mouth that all nations be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
