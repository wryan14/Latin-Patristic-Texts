Ubi unus Deus, una Trinitas colitur;\nnec Pater major Filio, nec Patre minor secundum\ndivinitatem Filius praedicatur; nec ab eis discernitur\nsubstantia sancti Spiritus, qui cum Patre ac Filio\nnaturaliter unus est Deus. Una est enim Trinitatis\nsanctae potentia, quia in tribus personis una manet\nsubstantia naturalis; una est potestas, quia una est\nmajestas; una aeternitas, quia una divinitas; una\nCreatoris dominatio, quia una creaturae coditio. Quidquid enim Pater creavit, per Filium fabricavit,\net in Spiritu sancto firmavit. Filius autem natus est\n de gignente, Spiritus sanctus procedit de permanente. Nec tamen Filius divisit Patrem nascendo,\nnec Spiritus Deum minuit procedendo, quia nec auget\nhaerendo. Ergo nec nascendo est Filius minoratus,\nnec procedendo Spiritus separatus. Ipse enim\nbeata Trinitas illa permanet, quia ibi substantialis\nunitas permanet: et quoniam nihil est in Trinitatis\ndivinitate creatum, propterea ibi nihil est utique\nseparatum. 9. Haec, dilectissimi fratres, fideliter tenete, in his\njugiter permanete. Haec sit in corde cogitatio, et ore\nconfessio. Tenete fidem quam 668 accepistis in\nnomine Trinitatis. Servate unitatem spiritus in vinculo\npacis, et turturis, et columbae: ut spiritales in\ndomo Dei semper esse possitis. Quod ipse praestare\n dignetur, qui cum Patre et Filio vivit et regnat\nDeus.",
