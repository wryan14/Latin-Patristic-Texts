00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,481
Notice regarding the two following sermons.

2
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:13,042
These two sermons, previously unpublished, were transcribed from a Vatican manuscript by the distinguished Luca Holstenius in the past and sent here by the eminent Cardinal Barberini.

3
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:22,334
Since it was not possible to publish them in sequence with the other sermons of Saint Fulgentius, it seemed fitting to include them here at the end of his works.

4
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:34,338
We have little doubt that the first sermon truly belongs to Fulgentius; however, we believe the second should be attributed to another author, who is indeed respected, although possibly later than Fulgentius.

5
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,993
We have not yet discovered who that author is.

6
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:41,855
SERMON ONE. On the Circumcision of the Lord.

7
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:48,745
Every year, we celebrate and honor the mystery of the divine incarnation, the extraordinary sacrament of our reconciliation.

8
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:56,302
This remembrance of such a blessing highlights what has been given to us, who are unworthy, and reminds us of what we owe to such glory.

9
00:00:56,302 --> 00:01:04,637
So, brothers, the more we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ was humbly lowered for our sake, the more we should recognize His indescribable glory.

10
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:08,637
In Him, God the Only Begotten clearly showed His unwavering love for us.

11
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:15,194
He took on the humility of true flesh and true death for us, not because He had to, but out of compassionate goodness.

12
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:18,805
What good had we done, brothers, to deserve such a great benefit?

13
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:34,196
What were our good deeds that made the Only Begotten God deem it worthy to become man, for the Most High to humble Himself, for the unfailing bread of angels to be nursed at a woman's breast, for the King of the ages to endure insults, for eternal life to patiently face death?

14
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:39,864
Therefore, reflect, O man, on the kindness of such condescension, so that you may humbly offer thanks.

15
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:46,309
Understand that you give not honor but insult to divine grace if you begin to doubt the greatness of such a benefit.

16
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:53,255
Instead, let us believe without hesitation that all we have heard about the humility and humanity of the Lord Savior is true.

17
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:58,644
Thus, let us give even more thanks, brothers, for when we deserved punishment, we received grace.

18
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:04,145
Through this grace, while death was justly owed to the lost, life was freely given to the unworthy.

19
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:09,479
The humility of the Most High Savior did not bring Him any loss, but it brought us a great gain.

20
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,813
It did not bring down the exalted, but lifted up the humble.

21
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:22,297
To complete the work of our redemption, the Son of God chose to be born in true human form from the flesh of a Virgin, even though He is the Creator of all flesh.

22
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,244
The maker of man became truly human.

23
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:30,896
He was wrapped in cloths, laid in a humble manger, circumcised on the eighth day, and carried by human hands to His temple.

24
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,627
O most merciful goodness of God!

25
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,682
O exalted humility of the highest God!

26
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:39,171
He, who was nourished as an infant by His mother, also created her in His vastness.

27
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:45,229
As a small child, He was carried by His parents to His temple, where holy people worshiped Him as the great God.

28
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:51,935
He commanded a sacrifice to be offered for Himself, even though He came to be sacrificed without sin for our transgressions.

29
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:59,399
Therefore, consider, O man, what you owe to the one who is exalted and humbled for you; to your exalted Creator, to your humbled Redeemer.

30
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:09,512
However, dearest ones, the integrity of the Christian faith has always maintained that whatever we read or hear was done by Christ according to the canonical narration of the Evangelists.

31
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:16,111
We first believe without doubt that the history is true, and then we seek spiritual understanding in the historical truth.

32
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:22,006
For when the history of the divine text is believed to be true, the Manichaean is confounded in his severity.

33
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:30,280
While he does not believe in the truth of the flesh of Christ, the Son of God, he attempts to impose falsehoods on the holy Scriptures, both old and new.

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,554
He miserably curses the divine history of the Old Testament, and in the New Testament, he denies himself the remedy.

35
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:56,727
He does not wish to believe that human flesh was molded by God, nor that the circumcision of the flesh was commanded by God to our holy fathers, nor that sacrifices from the flesh of animals were offered to the living and true God in ancient times, nor that the Sabbath was observed by the command and will of God, nor that a temple was built for the Lord at God's command.

36
00:03:56,727 --> 00:04:04,948
Thus, while he does not discern the quality of times in the holy Scriptures, he scorns and despises the most beneficial truth of the Lord's incarnation.

37
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,617
To convincingly challenge and convert the Manichaean, let's hope he is persuaded by today's gospel reading.

38
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:18,406
We must defend the truth of the Old Testament to clearly demonstrate that the God of both the Old and New Testaments is one!

39
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:35,760
As the holy Gospel reveals, we've learned that Christ, the Son of God, was truly circumcised, and a sacrifice of flesh was offered for Him, according to the customs of that divine institution at the time, whether it was the circumcision of the flesh or the rule of fleshly sacrifices established in the Old Testament.

40
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:49,282
Why, dear friends, should you not rightly believe in the Old Testament, when it is said that man was formed by the hands of God, especially since in the New Testament, to save man from eternal loss, the Only Begotten God became truly human for us?

41
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:58,753
Why should it not be believed that God commanded circumcision at an appropriate time to signify something important, when the Son of God himself had it done to His own body?

42
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:11,235
And why wouldn't our God have commanded the Jewish people in the past to offer symbolic sacrifices of flesh, when God Himself, the Only Begotten, born of the Jews, saw it fit to offer Himself for our sins according to the flesh?

43
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:18,242
Therefore, let the Manichaean pay attention to the clear and harmonious truth of both Testaments, and turn away from his vanity.

44
00:05:18,242 --> 00:05:24,811
Let him see the Old Testament as a foreshadowing of future events, and the New Testament as the revelation of past ones.

45
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:39,264
In the Old Testament, Christ, God of both Testaments, promised what He would fulfill, and in the New, He fulfilled what He had promised: neither a liar in promise nor deceitful in giving; but always good, always just, always holy, always powerful, always merciful.

46
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:50,268
In the Old Testament, He is the most powerful creator of both flesh and soul, and in the New, the most merciful receiver of the same flesh and soul; thus, He becomes the savior of flesh and soul first.

47
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:54,812
Let the Manichaean hear these things, reflect on them, recognize them, and believe.

48
00:05:54,812 --> 00:06:00,669
And in believing, let him return to the Catholic Church, where he will find the blessing of true salvation.

49
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:11,416
Through these actions that the Lord carried out in His physical body,
He aimed not only to demonstrate the harmony of both the Old and New Testaments
but also to beneficially shape the behavior of Christians.

50
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:16,439
He intended for us to observe His physical actions for our salvation and then imitate them spiritually.

51
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,439
Therefore, Christ was born as a small child on earth to teach Christians humility.

52
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,096
He was obedient to His earthly parents so that every Christian would always show respect to their father and mother.

53
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:31,071
Christ was wrapped in humble clothes so that Christians would not take pleasure in expensive clothing.

54
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:39,898
Christ chose to appear poor on earth so that wealthy Christians would learn not to love earthly riches;
instead, by giving alms to the poor, they could store their riches in heaven.

55
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:51,164
For this reason, Christ was placed in a narrow manger, despite the vastness of His mind,
so that those who believe in Him would have spiritual nourishment,
and Christians would learn not to covet the homes or possessions of others.

56
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:59,016
How could any Christian not be content with even the humblest home or their own means,
when the narrowness of a small manger sufficed for Christ, the Son of God?

57
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:05,162
Through the circumcision that the Son of God underwent in the flesh,
He foreshadowed the spiritual circumcision of our hearts.

58
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:13,258
This circumcision is indicated to us by the word of the law, as Moses says,
Circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be circumcised to your God
(Deuteronomy 10:16).

59
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:20,720
This command aligns with the blessed Apostle, who says,
A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly,
nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.

60
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,011
No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart,
by the Spirit, not by the written code.

61
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,864
Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God
(Romans 2:28-29).

62
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:36,277
Therefore, Christ underwent circumcision in the body so that Christians might have it spiritually in the heart.

63
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:43,911
For this reason, the one who was without sin removed the foreskin of the flesh, so that we might cast off the desires of wickedness.

64
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:49,479
Christ was carried by hands to the temple, so that a Christian might ascend to heaven through good works.

65
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,577
Christ desired a sacrifice to be offered for him, so that a Christian might offer himself at the altar of the Lord.

66
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,653
Above all, let him hasten to offer himself by living well.

67
00:07:58,653 --> 00:09:26,043
If he delights in presenting a pure sacrifice to divine eyes, we recognize a certain spiritual sacrifice in the very essence of that offering: "A pair of turtledoves and two young pigeons" as mentioned in Luke Chapter Two, Verse Twenty-four.
In this type of birds, dearest brothers, a great sacrament of the Catholic faith is commended to you. In the dove, love is recognized; in the turtledove, chastity is found.
For the turtledove remains faithful to one mate; the dove does not abandon the unity of those living together. Therefore, a Catholic Christian truly becomes a spiritual turtledove if he preserves the true faith of the Trinity with firm belief and rejects the sense of heretical wickedness as the stain of fornication.
He will truly be a dove if he remains patiently in the Catholic community until the end and withstands temptations and scandals with unshakable firmness, so that neither heretical fornication corrupts the chastity of faith in the heart, nor bitter dissension abandons the unity of ecclesiastical chastity.
This is the legitimate Church that keeps faith with one God as with a legitimate husband and multiplies the congregation of children in love.
In this turtledove and dove, dearest brothers, remain diligently, guard it with all your vows, so that neither an Arian violates it, nor a Donatist tramples it, nor a Manichaean pollutes it.
For they, like evil hawks, desire to scatter the unity of the dove and to violate the chastity of the turtledove. For the Manichaean does not believe in the true flesh of Christ, the Arian diminishes his true divinity, and the Donatist scatters the unity of the Catholic body.

68
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:38,297
Manichaeus doesn't recognize the Redeemer's sacrament, the Arian overlooks the greatness of the Savior, and the Donatist, like a ravenous wolf, didn't hesitate to scatter the flock of the good Shepherd.

69
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:45,808
So, as I mentioned, they pursue those who seek compassion and are unaware of the truth, like evil hawks, wishing to harm them.

70
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:54,451
They reject the love of doves, despise the purity of turtledoves, and if possible, they either devour with their mouths or tear with their claws.

71
00:09:54,451 --> 00:10:00,531
Therefore, dearest brothers, keep the Catholic truth in faith and preserve the Catholic peace in love.

72
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:07,804
A sacrifice pleasing to God is offered by those who preserve the true sacrament of the Catholic faith with brotherly love.

73
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:23,124
Where one God, one Trinity is worshiped; the Father is not greater than the Son, nor is the Son lesser than the Father in divinity; and the substance of the Holy Spirit is not distinguished from them, for He is naturally one God with the Father and the Son.

74
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:35,999
The power of the holy Trinity is one, because in three persons remains one natural substance; there is one power, one majesty, one eternity, and one dominion of the Creator, as there is one condition of the creature.

75
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:41,483
For whatever the Father created, He made through the Son and established in the Holy Spirit.

76
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:46,312
The Son is born of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him who remains.

77
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:54,836
Yet the Son does not divide the Father by being born, nor does the Spirit diminish God by proceeding, because He does not increase by adhering.

78
00:10:54,836 --> 00:11:00,439
Therefore, the Son is not diminished by being born, nor is the Spirit separated by proceeding.

79
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:10,752
For the blessed Trinity remains as it is, because there is substantial unity: and since nothing is created in the divinity of the Trinity, nothing is indeed separated there.

80
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:14,865
Hold these truths faithfully, dearest brothers, and continue in them.

81
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:19,217
Let this be the thought in your heart and the confession with your mouth.

82
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:22,793
Hold the faith you have received in the name of the Trinity.

83
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:31,198
Preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, like the turtledove and dove, so that you may always be spiritual in the house of God.

84
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:35,550
May He grant this, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Son, God.

85
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:40,847
Sermon Two: On the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary

86
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,459
This feast honors the same person as those and is equally important.

87
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,752
We will clearly demonstrate this with evidence in this sermon.

88
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:54,073
The solemnity of this day, though unknown to some Christians, is highly honored by many above other feasts of the year.

89
00:11:54,073 --> 00:12:05,971
Especially in the place where the Catholic Church has its leader, it is observed with such reverence that on this day, the entire city gathers together, their candles shining brightly, to celebrate the solemnity of the Mass.

90
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:18,028
No one enters the public place without holding a light, as if they were to present the Lord in the temple, or rather to receive Him; they show the light of faith, which shines within, through the outward sign of their offering.

91
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:24,880
Today, according to the law and the gospel, forty days after Christ's birth, the Lord was presented in the temple by His parents.

92
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,288
Today, He was received by Saint Simeon and offered to the Father with sacred gifts.

93
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:33,644
Today, Simeon and Anna proclaimed the redemption expected by the people of Israel.

94
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:36,777
Oh, what a loving sight, which only the devout truly enjoy!

95
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:40,283
Here stands the virgin and mother, not of just anyone, but of God.

96
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:44,904
Here the child, the virgin's son, is received, whose divinity the world cannot contain.

97
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:48,941
Here prophets come forward, and both men and women prophesy about the child.

98
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:53,455
An offering is made for the child, not to cleanse sins but to declare the sacraments.

99
00:12:53,455 --> 00:13:07,637
And because I wish to elevate the praise of this day, I would like to go through the Gospel reading in conversation, knowing these things are narrated, so that what I say may correspond with it; indeed, so that my words of exhortation may align with what it narrates.

100
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:15,003
Finally, Luke, the evangelist, offers a more detailed and orderly account of Christ's incarnation than the other evangelists.

101
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:37,272
After the angel's announcement in the year 669, the birth heralded by angels, and the circumcision on the eighth day at his parents' home, Luke continues:
"When the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were completed, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, 'Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord'"
(Luke 2:22-23).

102
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:46,991
It's clear to all believers that the Redeemer's mother was untouched by any stain from his birth, as she didn't need purification by staying away from sacred places during that time.

103
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:55,536
Because, without human desire or corruption of the flesh, the virgin gave birth and remained a virgin forever; thus, no male was born from her to open her womb.

104
00:13:55,536 --> 00:14:03,386
Yet, while narrating the law, the evangelist doesn't reveal the divine incarnation's mystery to the impious but shows the mother observing the law.

105
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:08,406
It's not surprising that she would follow the law her Son came not to abolish, but to fulfill.

106
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:11,503
She knew how she conceived and who she had given birth to.

107
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:16,630
But by observing the common law, she awaited the purification day, concealing her son's majesty.

108
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:28,165
That's why, when she found him in the temple at age twelve, she referred to him as Joseph's son, saying:
"Son, why have you done this to us? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in sorrow"
(Luke 2:48).

109
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:34,413
She undoubtedly knew she conceived him without Joseph's involvement and gave birth without any loss of her virginity.

110
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:39,646
But why did she conceal the mystery of his conception and birth, knowing he was the boundless God?

111
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:44,506
Did she envy others when she brought him to the temple and entrusted him to the holy elder?

112
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:45,254
Certainly not.

113
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:50,968
Perhaps, filled with the spirit of prophecy, she chose not to reveal the world's redemption to the impious.

114
00:14:50,968 --> 00:15:00,260
For she already knew, full of grace and inspired by divine spirit, that if the rulers of this world had recognized him, they would never have crucified him for our salvation.

115
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:11,561
So, present him, most blessed Virgin, as one who follows the law, in the temple, whom you brought forth, so that not everyone but only a few may know who it is you have given birth to.

116
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:23,720
Let the humble stone, cut from the mountain without hands, be revealed, so that it may be rejected by the builders until it strikes the statue on its feet, grows into a great mountain, and fills the entire world.

117
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,391
Oh, how small, oh, how great is he whom you have given birth to!

118
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:33,585
Small in humanity, great in divinity; small in the kingdom of the Jews, great in the kingdom of the nations.

119
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:37,256
Yet not everyone in the kingdom of the Jews considers him small.

120
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:42,245
For even you, who gave birth to him, grew from the same people of Israel into a branch.

121
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:45,572
You rose as a branch from the root of Jesse and blossomed.

122
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,268
Like Aaron's rod, you blossomed and bore fruit.

123
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:58,534
Because you recognized his vastness above all, although you saw him born very small from you, without a doubt, you trembled and worshiped the Almighty God whom you bore as a baby.

124
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,968
Worshiping, you trembled.

125
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:06,105
Yet, because you recognized him as your son according to humanity, you nursed, cherished, and nurtured him.

126
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:12,070
Who, do you think, could reveal to us the feelings of your heart in such service, O most blessed Virgin?

127
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:26,982
When, on one side, you saw the tiny infant born from you, and on the other side, beheld the immense God; here the created, there the creator; here the weak, there the very strong; here needing to be fed, there feeding; here not speaking, there teaching angels.

128
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:41,435
Who, I ask, can reveal to us the secrets of your heart, in what ways you turned your thoughts to both, as you held in your hands the one and the same Son of God and man, worshiping him as Lord on one side and kissing him as a little child on the other?

129
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,475
Who would not be amazed at such an ineffable miracle?

130
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,999
Who would not almost be rendered speechless?

131
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:56,405
A young girl gives birth to her creator and the creator of all, nourishes her nurturer and the nurturer of all, brings to the temple her ruler and the ruler of all.

132
00:16:56,405 --> 00:17:01,280
Oh, what a wondrous sight, at which not only human but even angelic nature is amazed!

133
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,671
To this, dearest brothers, lift your eyes of faith; to this, come with the affection of piety.

134
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:13,585
Receive Christ, who is humbled in the flesh for you, but worship Him as the exalted God in His divinity.

135
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,186
Embrace the child, yet consider His immensity.

136
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,844
Love the humbled one, and fear the exalted one.

137
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:37,902
Now truly, beloved, if we seek to understand the mystical meaning of why our Redeemer wanted to be carried by His mother and relatives from His own city to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, we find that the glorious mother and virgin, along with her relatives, represented the Church that believed in the apostles from among the Jews.

138
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,937
For when is the Church not a virgin?

139
00:17:39,937 --> 00:19:18,845
The Apostle addresses its members, saying:
"I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy, for I have promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ" Second Corinthians chapter eleven, verse two.
When is she not a mother? As it is said through the Psalmist:
"And of Zion it shall be said, 'This one and that one were born in her'" Psalm eighty-seven, verse five.
And the Lord in the Gospel says:
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother" Matthew chapter twelve, verse fifty.
When are the chosen ones not relatives, who are called brothers and sisters? Therefore, the mother and relatives of our Redeemer carry Him from Nazareth to the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, because that early Church in the first disciples, rejected by the Jews, brought the knowledge of the same redemption to the nations.
For the Church is rightly called Jerusalem, meaning Vision of Peace, not only from the Gentiles but also from the Jews, of which it is said through the Psalmist:
"Jerusalem is built as a city that is closely compacted together" Psalm one hundred twenty-two, verse three.
She is also the temple, as it is said to the faithful through Paul:
"The temple of God is holy, which you are" First Corinthians chapter three, verse seventeen.
Therefore, when the apostles come from Judea, announcing Christ to the nations, Jerusalem indeed meets Jerusalem, and the temple meets the temple, for they all are one city, Jerusalem, and one temple. In this city, and in this temple, Christ is presented by the apostles.
Hence the Church itself speaks with the voice of the Psalmist, saying:
"We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple" Psalm forty-eight, verse nine.

140
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:22,898
Imagine yourself in the heart of the church, which is your temple.

141
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:38,321
Whether you look at it from a historical perspective or a mystical one, the reason Christ was brought by his parents to the holy city and temple is clarified when we hear:
To offer a sacrifice as stated in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.

142
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:46,547
(Luke 2:24)
The law commanded that if someone couldn't afford a lamb, they could offer either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons to God.

143
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,660
This offering was equally acceptable.

144
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:58,314
In this offering of birds, we see a foreshadowing of the ultimate sacrifice for the world's salvation, namely the Lord's passion, through which we are reconciled to God.

145
00:19:58,314 --> 00:20:08,482
Paul speaks to the faithful about this sacrifice:
Walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God, a sweet-smelling aroma.

146
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:12,709
(Ephesians 5:2)
And again: Who loved me, he says, and gave himself for me.

147
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:27,732
(Galatians 2:20)
Since all the chosen are members of Christ, this offering of birds also symbolizes the mortification of the chosen ones, to whom the apostle says:
I urge you by the mercy of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God.

148
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:33,559
(Romans 12:1)
An offering of mortification is only acceptable to God if there is true faith and unity.

149
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:40,814
Thus, it is significant that the sacrifice, mystically offered for the Lord, is described as coming from turtledoves and doves.

150
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:44,869
In the turtledove, chastity is found, and in the dove, unity is valued.

151
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:50,467
The turtledove remains faithful to one mate, and the dove does not abandon the unity of the group.

152
00:20:50,467 --> 00:21:01,378
Therefore, a Catholic Christian becomes a spiritual turtledove when they hold firmly to the true faith of the Trinity and reject heretical teachings as they would the impurity of fornication.

153
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:09,818
Then there will truly be a dove if it remains patient in the Catholic community until the end and stands firm against the challenges of temptation.

154
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:17,889
This means that neither heretical corruption taints the purity of faith in the heart nor bitter disagreement disrupts the unity of the Church's chastity.

155
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:25,274
This is, indeed, the Catholic Church, which holds its faith with one Lord like a lawful husband and grows the congregation of many in faith.

156
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:44,107
It continues: "And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple" (Luke 2:25-27).

157
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:50,015
Nothing less is attributed to this particularly holy man, who resides in Jerusalem, meaning the vision of peace.

158
00:21:50,015 --> 00:22:01,357
He is just through his works of faith, devout in reverence, attentive to the consolation of Israel, filled with the Holy Spirit, and strengthened by the Spirit's response regarding the command of the incarnate Word.

159
00:22:01,357 --> 00:22:08,056
Oh, with what fervent desire did this man await, according to the promise of the Holy Spirit, to see the Redeemer in the flesh!

160
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:14,597
What urgency do we suppose was in his prayer that deserved to be assured by a divine response about the things he asked for?

161
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,710
What were his continuous words of lament in holy preaching?

162
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,352
For he did not cease to ask until he received a response regarding the things he sought.

163
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:35,171
Indeed, in past times, many were filled with a similar desire, as the Lord testifies to the disciples, saying: "Many kings and prophets wanted to see what you see and did not see it; and to hear what you hear and did not hear it" (Luke 10:24).

164
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:39,971
But this was granted only to those who appeared at the last in the fullness of these times.

165
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:46,934
But if we attentively consider the desire of the following saints, for whom to live is Christ and to die is gain (Philippians 1:21).

166
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:54,762
We see that they are just as eager to witness the divinity of the same Savior, much like his desire to be seen in the flesh.

167
00:22:54,762 --> 00:23:00,796
This is why Paul says, "I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much better" (Philippians 1:23).

168
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:08,861
Similarly, the Psalmist expresses, "My soul thirsts for the living God. When shall I come and appear before the face of God?" (Psalm 42:2).

169
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:19,884
Who can see in one Simeon the many, where one represents all the elect; those who are now righteous through faith and action, reverent with future hope, and in awe of the coming consolation?

170
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:40,075
The Holy Spirit is recognized as dwelling within them, as the Apostle says, "The love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us" (Romans 5:5); and it is also said to the faithful, "Your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God" (First Corinthians 6:19).

171
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:46,457
They also receive a promise from the Holy Spirit that they will not see death before seeing the Lord's Christ.

172
00:23:46,457 --> 00:24:00,382
In this still imperfect life, with the grace of the Holy Spirit, they see with the eyes of faith the one who promised to be with them until the end of the age (Matthew 28:20), not as a small child in the flesh, but immeasurable in divinity.

173
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:08,389
They echo the Apostle, "Though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer" (Second Corinthians 5:16).

174
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:13,553
They dwell in Jerusalem and, in the Spirit, come to the temple where Christ is presented.

175
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:21,559
Truly, they are Jerusalem who dwell in Jerusalem; they are the temple who come to the temple, in whom and through whom Christ is received.

176
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:30,320
Briefly, brothers, we discuss these matters to avoid becoming a burden as we strive to highlight the sacraments of this day, and what is holy and pure.

177
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:45,057
It goes on: "And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him in his arms and blessed God, and said: 'Now you dismiss your servant, Lord, according to your word in peace'" (Luke 2:27, 28, 29).
