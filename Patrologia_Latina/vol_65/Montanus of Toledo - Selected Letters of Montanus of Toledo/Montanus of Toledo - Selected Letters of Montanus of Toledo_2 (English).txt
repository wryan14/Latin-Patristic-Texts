To the most beloved lords, brothers, and sons of the territory of Palencia, Bishop Montanus sends eternal greetings in the Lord.

The most powerful leaders of all the Lord's churches are shaken by the terrible warning given through the prophet Ezekiel, Chapter 33, under the name of the watchman, saying: 
 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel: therefore, hear the word from my mouth and warn them for me. 
 If I say to the wicked, 'Wicked one, you will surely die,' and you do not warn them or speak out to dissuade them from their wicked ways in order to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood." 
 And the rest that this reading shows about the souls of the one who warns and the one who is warned.

Moved by this message, and knowing the responsibilities of my office, I have made it my duty to ensure that Christ does not question me about the soul of any lost person; 
 especially since the ancient custom has passed down the metropolitan privilege to the city of Toledo; 
 and thus, the care of not only the parishes but also the cities concerns the priest of this city. 
 Therefore, as the Apostle says: "What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit?" 
 We have heard of the new presumption of presbyters ruling over you, if indeed it can be called new and not detestable, which has never crept in from the beginning of the Catholic faith until now, that what the invocation of the Trinity used to sanctify through the hands of the high priest, an ignorant presbyter of discipline would presume to make chrism for himself. 
 If this is out of ignorance, such a foolish priest ought not to be; if it is out of presumption, who does not know that he is a schismatic, bringing in such an unheard-of thing and contrary to religion in this aging world?

Let the most sacred book of Numbers, Chapter 11, be turned in your hands, oh presbyters, in which the honor of your office began in the persons of the seventy elders; 
 and you will find out what matters have been granted to you as a prerogative. 
 God willed you to be helpers of our labor in the second rank of dignity, not violators of certain sacred things. 
 Thus, Nadab and Abihu, offering unauthorized fire, not due to their office, were consumed by divine fire. 
 Thus, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, envying Moses, enjoying God's grace and divine words, and saying: 
 "Has the Lord spoken only through you? Isn't the whole assembly holy?" 
 To the new schismatics came the destruction of a new perdition, so that the earth, with a gaping mouth, insatiably swallowed those whom divine indignation had condemned. 
 Why should I mention Uzziah, who, not content with the royal scepter, elevated against right and law with an authoritative boot, prepared to offer the atonement, which was due only to the priests, was so covered with leprosy by heavenly vengeance that from then until his death he remained deprived of both the priestly and the kingly office? Likewise, Uzzah, when the oxen stumbled and he reached out to steady the ark of God, was struck down by God: clearly showing that under no circumstances, not even under the pretext of humility, should divine offices and heavenly sacraments be touched by anyone to whom the office does not belong.

Therefore, let them beware, let them beware, who think it lawful for themselves what they know to be unlawful for others; 
 lest a similar punishment strike them as those we have mentioned. 
 Or perhaps you are ignorant of the rules of the holy fathers and synodal constitutions, which command that parish priests should not seek chrism through lesser persons, but either by themselves or by the rectors of sacred places annually from the bishop presiding over them? 
 I believe that those who ordered to seek also entirely took away the power to consecrate. 
 Therefore, let your charity take care, lest after the prohibition of our humility, until a bishop accustomed to you and prepared by the Lord is provided, anyone repeats the forbidden.

Let no one presume and begin to endure the severe censure of ecclesiastical discipline. Let everyone use the privilege of their own honor, which they know belongs to the order of the priesthood; not what belongs to the highest pontificate, let an improper minister assume. Whoever is found guilty in such matters after this warning, let them know they are condemned under the unbreakable bond of anathema. To whom, in this very matter, not a little humanity is granted, because we now allow him to pass unpunished.

Indeed, if the Lord wills, when the time of the Easter festival arrives, if it is impossible for you to request, you should indicate it with your letters, and we will be able to send the grace of this sacred liquid voluntarily, provided that no illicit act is presumed.

In the same way, we have learned that bishops of another kind are invited by you for the consecration of basilicas, and although they are connected with us in Christ by the bond of one faith, they are neither known to agree with the privileges of the province nor with the benefits of the Lord's affairs, because such a reputation has already reached us. Therefore, we have decreed by a beneficial ordinance that if such a necessity arises, you should inform us by letters, and either through us or through someone from our brothers and fellow bishops who seems fit to us, and the consecration of churches, with God's guidance, can be celebrated.

Furthermore, we particularly know that the most pernicious sect of the Priscillianists is honored by you both in acts and in name. I ask, what is this madness to fall excessively in love with him whom you do not wish to imitate in deed? For, to bring a few of his filthinesses to your attention, except for those things in which he burst out profanely against the Divinity and blasphemed with a sacrilegious mouth, a heap of all vices flowed together in him, like into a sewer of filth, so that the shameless adulterer would strip the shame from his followers; and to more easily reach the effect of his nefarious crime, the deeds also assign to him the use of witchcraft. What, finally, does any faithful soul venerate in this, which is suitable for religion, who is not only rejected by holy priests but also condemned by worldly princes by the justice of their laws for the quality of the mentioned crime?

Whoever reads the books published by the most blessed and religious man, Bishop Thoribius, to the holy pope of the city of Rome, Leo, will learn more fully what kind of man he was, in which he explained and exposed this filthy heresy, and sent it forth, hidden by its own darkness and the cloud of perfidy, into the open. From these books, indeed, a pious reader will find how to beware, what to answer against sacrilegious people. Therefore, I ask you to condemn and anathematize the perfidy with its author, to hold the rule of right faith, and to take care to exhibit caution in all the above-written matters, so that it may be easier for me not to be condemned for silence, and for you to be able to provide the greatest fruit of obedience before our Savior God. The peace of the Lord be with you all. Amen.
