    To the distinguished Lord and exceptional Christian, Lord and son Thuribius, Bishop Montanus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      We have known and approved of you as a nurturing supporter of the Catholic faith and holy religion, even while engaging in worldly affairs.
    </s>
    <s>
      When you flourished in the secular world, your life shone so clearly that you followed the Lord's teaching: giving to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.
    </s>
    <s>
      Justly, then, I shall name you the promoter of divine worship, especially in this province.
    </s>
    <s>
      Do you realize what great reward awaits you in the eyes of God, whose diligence and persistence caused the errors of idolatry to disappear and the detestable sect of the Priscillianists to disintegrate?
    </s>
    <s>
      If they still refrain from honoring the name through your admonition, they are not ignorant of the works that have collapsed.
    </s>
    <s>
      As for the faith of earthly lords, what shall I say?
    </s>
    <s>
      You exerted your efforts so that the fierce spirits of those who lived with you were led to a healthy rule and regular discipline.
    </s>
    <s>
      Whatever reached us from the Palencia assembly, I have taken care to inform your eminence, so that through your reprimand, the wicked presumption may cease in the future.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Certain priests, as we have been informed, presumptuously dare to not so much consecrate as violate sacred things, taking upon themselves the right of consecrating chrism, which has always been the prerogative of the highest pontiffs.
    </s>
    <s>
      I don't know whether to call it madness or something else.
    </s>
    <s>
      This is undoubtedly sacrilegious, and I believe your pious conscience is aware of it; therefore, I hope that to weaken this excess, you use the authority of the strictest priest, and restrain the violators of such a grave matter with more severe reprimand.
    </s>
    <s>
      If they presume to repeat the crime after being warned, their obstinacy will be condemned by a suitable sentence.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Similarly, we have learned that due to the need to consecrate basilicas, our brothers, bishops of other dioceses, are invited and gather in these places.
    </s>
    <s>
      Although the bridal chamber of Christ's spouse is one throughout the whole world, and its bishops are united in the same bond of love and faith, the Fathers of the Second Council of Toledo admonished them to ensure that no one would be chosen or ordained as bishop except by the bishops of the same province with the metropolitan's authority, as already decreed by canon 4 of the Council of Nicaea.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, the bishop illegitimately elected and ordained, and the invader of the Palencia Church, committed a great offense against Metropolitan Celso and the other provincial bishops.
    </s>
    <s>
      Montanus, the outstanding zealot of sacred canons, expelled him from the unjustly occupied seat according to canon 6 of the Council of Nicaea, which stated that anyone made a bishop without the metropolitan's consent should not be considered a bishop.
    </s>
    <s>
      However, he did not act harshly towards him but, considering the matter of episcopal ordination and dignity, assigned him three municipalities in the same diocese to govern, from which he could also receive appropriate sustenance.
    </s>
    <s>
      Since this was the case, those devoted to the Palencia man petitioned Montanus to restore the aforementioned co-bishop to the Palencia seat; and this we believe is the petition he calls improper in this letter, as it was contrary to the sacred canons.
    </s>
    <s>
      He had clearly explained this in the letters he sent them.
    </s>
    <s>
      To show how kindly he had acted towards him, Montanus adds that he did not assign those municipalities to him rationally, that is, motivated by any merit of his own, but solely out of consideration for episcopal dignity.
    </s>
    <s>
      Moreover, so that the Palentinians would not think those municipalities would remain severed from the Palencia Church in perpetuity, he adds that this was only granted to him while he lived.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>May it lead us to abandon this conjecture,</s>
    <s>as we read that Segovia already had its own bishop in the year 589,</s>
    <s>who subscribed to the Third Council of Toledo.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Even though it was Montanus' will at that time</s>
    <s>that those three towns should not be separated from the Church of Palencia in any way,</s>
    <s>it could have happened that the people of Segovia,</s>
    <s>finding a convenient opportunity, after their first bishop had died, requested their own pastor to succeed him,</s>
    <s>and achieved this without much trouble;</s>
    <s>especially since the Palencia diocese was so extensive that it could not be conveniently governed by one pastor.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>We read that many such divisions of dioceses were made in that century in the Province of Galicia,</s>
    <s>so that the interests of each flock could be better served with smaller episcopal boundaries.</s>
    <s>These things have been said sufficiently to shed some light on a very obscure matter.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Meanwhile, we arrogantly assume nothing,</s>
    <s>but desire that others will think of better things.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>To our predecessor, as well as to our lords and brothers,</s>
    <s>the bishops of Carpetania and Celtiberia,</s>
    <s>your fellow bishop has done, in the letters we sent to your charity;</s>
    <s>so that you may know what kind of result such an improper request could have had.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Certainly, the towns of Segovia, Brittablo, and Coca,</s>
    <s>were granted to him, not reasonably, but due to the dignity of the name:</s>
    <s>so that the bestowed blessing would not be cheapened by a wandering person.</s>
    <s>Know that this was granted only to him, while he lived.</s>
    <s>Therefore, we want to ensure that you do not neglect the ancient custom for any reason.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If this admonition of ours has no effect on you,</s>
    <s>it will be necessary for us to inform our Lord accordingly,</s>
    <s>and also to suggest to our son Ergani,</s>
    <s>that the commands of his authority or the strictness of a judge will severely punish such an attempt,</s>
    <s>not without your detriment:</s>
    <s>for, by the Lord's grace, his piety is such that he allows nothing to be changed from what has been proven to preserve the ancient law.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>May the Divine Trinity protect you.</s>
    <s>Amen.</s>
