Felix Pope IV to all bishops.

(This and the following letter suffer from the defect of forgery.)

1. The celebration of Mass should not be conducted anywhere other than in places dedicated to God unless a great necessity compels it.

2. What should be done about the doubt in the consecration of churches? 

To my dearest brothers, all bishops established in various provinces, Felix the bishop in the Lord sends greetings. By the great gift (Saint Leo, letter 54) of God's mercy, the joys of the entire Catholic Church have multiplied, as the state of the Churches thrives in the order established by the successors of the apostles. And when we recognize that the cunning of the ancient enemy is disturbing this, we are deeply saddened. For this reason, brothers, we urge, advise, and demand that you do not deviate from the path of apostolic institution (Same, letter 84), nor disagree with the head, but hold the faith and order established by the apostles and apostolic men without any hesitation. For if the pillars of a great house fall, the house itself will not stand. Likewise, if you, who are the pillars of the Church, begin to falter, the holy Church, which is governed by you, will wither and fall. 

These things, brothers, that I say are to be greatly feared, considered with utmost moderation, and should be avoided from happening. For the truth itself says: You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, with what shall it be salted? (Matthew 5).

Therefore, dearest ones, I advise you because I am indebted to you, and I love you very much. And when I hear good things about you, I am exceedingly joyful: and conversely, when I hear bad things, I am deeply troubled. Although I am separated from you by long distances of land and sea, I am entirely united with you in heart. And I trust in every way in your blessedness towards me, because since you love me in return, you are not far from me.

Hence, we give thanks to that grain of mustard seed (Luke 14; Matthew 13), which, from the appearance of a small and insignificant seed, has grown so that its branches have spread out everywhere, allowing the birds of the sky to nest in them: and thanks be to that leaven which has mixed the whole human race into unity in three measures of flour: and to the small stone, which was cut out of the mountain without hands, and has covered the entire face of the earth, spreading itself everywhere so that by bringing the whole human race into unity, the body of the whole Church would be completed, and thus this partial distinction of members would pertain to the benefit of the whole structure.

Therefore, we are not far from you either: for in Him who is everywhere, we are one (John 20). Let us then give thanks to Him, because by dissolving enmities in His flesh, He has made it so that in the whole world there is one flock and one fold under one shepherd, always remembering what our distinguished preacher advises us, saying: Be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (Ephesians 4).

I gratefully received the writings of your Holiness, which you sent to the apostolic see concerning certain questions, as if to the head, to receive answers from there, where the whole Church took its beginning of all religion, and I have taken care to briefly respond to you.

1. Regarding the consecration of churches and the celebration of Masses, it is clear to all who know the precepts of the New and Old Testaments that they should not be conducted anywhere other than in places consecrated to the Lord without great necessity. We read that Moses, at the Lord's command, made and consecrated the tabernacle with its table and altar, and other vessels for divine worship (Numbers 7): and not only did he consecrate them with divine precepts and prayers, but also anointed them with holy oil at the Lord's command. How these things were done, and how these sacred items were handled, carried, erected, and taken down by no one other than priests anointed with sacred unction and consecrated to the Lord with holy garments, and the Levites, is found in the very institutions that were written by Moses at the Lord's command in the law of the Lord. 

How they were done and...

O David, the most pious of kings, glorified the worship of God and wanted to build the temple of the Lord. However, because he had shed so much blood, he was forbidden. He gathered the expenses, and Solomon, his son, completed what David had desired to do, with God's command and assistance.

Solomon consecrated the temple with the altar and the other things needed for divine worship. In the Book of Kings, among other things, it is written: Solomon said, 
"Building, I have built a house for your dwelling, a most firm throne for you forever."
 The king turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel. For the whole assembly of Israel was standing, and he said: 
"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and by his hands fulfilled it, saying: From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city from any of the tribes of Israel to build a house that my name might be there; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. And David my father wanted to build a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. But the Lord said to David my father: Because you intended in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well to have this in your mind. Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who will come from your body shall build the house for my name."

"The Lord has confirmed his word that he spoke, and I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised. And I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."

Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven, and said: 
"Lord God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing mercy to your servants who walk before you with all their hearts. You have kept what you promised your servant David my father. You spoke with your mouth and fulfilled it with your hands, as it is today. Now, Lord God of Israel, keep what you promised your servant David my father, saying: You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your children are careful to walk before me as you have walked before me. And now, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you spoke to your servant David my father. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built! Yet regard the prayer of your servant and his plea, O Lord my God. Hearken to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day: that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, 'My name shall be there,' to listen to the prayer which your servant offers toward this place. And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And hear in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive."

"If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and comes and swears before your altar in this house, then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness. When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name, and pray and plead with you in this house, then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers. When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin when you afflict them, then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel."

Show them the good way to walk on, and give rain on the land you have given your people to possess.

If famine arises in the land, or pestilence, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillar, and they are afflicted by their enemies besieging their gates, any plague, any sickness, any prayer, or any plea that any person from your people Israel makes;

If anyone recognizes the plague in their own heart and spreads out their hands in this house, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and act to give each person according to all their ways, as you see their heart (for you alone know the hearts of all the children of men);

So that they may fear you all the days they live on the face of the land you gave to our fathers.

Moreover, concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when they come from a distant land because of your name (for they will hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm), when they come and pray in this house, hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house I have built bears your name.

When your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you send them, and they pray to you toward the city you have chosen and the house I have built for your name, then hear their prayer and their plea in heaven and uphold their cause.

If they sin against you (for there is no one who does not sin), and you become angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, and they are taken captive to the land of the enemy, far or near, yet if they take it to heart in the land where they have been taken captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity, saying, "We have sinned, we have acted perversely and wickedly," and if they turn back to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city you have chosen, and the house I have built for your name; then hear their prayer and their plea in heaven, your dwelling place, and uphold their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions which they have committed against you, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, so that they may have compassion on them. For they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace.

Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, listening to them whenever they call to you. For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your inheritance, as you spoke through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.

When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and plea to the Lord, he rose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven. He stood and blessed the entire assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:

“Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to his people Israel according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses. May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers; may he never leave us nor forsake us. May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commands, decrees, and laws he gave our fathers. And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need, so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God and that there is no other. And may our hearts be fully committed to the Lord our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands.”

Just like today, so the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the Lord. Solomon sacrificed peace offerings that he offered to the Lord: twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. Thus, the king and the sons of Israel dedicated the temple of the Lord. 

Regarding the consecration of churches, 
St. Leo
, in letter 92, chapter 15, states that whenever there is doubt and no certain document or reliable witnesses to confirm the consecration, you should know without any doubt that they need to be consecrated to avoid such hesitation causing further issues. 

This is because it is not considered a repetition if it is not known to have been done. With these testimonies of the Scriptures confirmed by apostolic authority, a brief response to your inquiries should suffice. 

However, you must foresee and preach to everyone that unlawful acts should not be performed, and the commandments of the Lord should be kept and faithfully observed. 

We also ask you, brothers, to follow the words of the apostle: correct the unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient with everyone. See to it that no one repays evil for evil; but always pursue what is good for each other and for everyone. 

Always rejoice, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances. This is the will of God in Christ Jesus for all of you. Do not quench the Spirit, do not despise prophecies; test everything, hold on to what is good. Abstain from every form of evil. 

May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, so that your whole spirit, soul, and body may be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
