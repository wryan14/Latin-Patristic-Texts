TO SABINA. He praises her dedication and service to the church, and how she prioritizes religion over family honors and empty pomp.

It is clear to everyone that you are a distinguished member of the Church, that your religious devotion is immense, and that you are held in the highest esteem by us. For at the pinnacle of nobility, you show an even greater nobility in your devotion to the Church, rejoicing more in the recognition of Christâ€™s teachings and obeying His commandments, and you take more pride in your faith than in the prestige of your lineage.

The highest virtue is overcoming the glory of the flesh, and it is a great grace from Christ to surpass nobility with good character, deserving illustrious lady daughter.

Therefore, dearest, being certain of this life, strive to illuminate all its moments with eternal and divine duties, so that He who made you distinguished will make you even more glorious through the ages. Therefore, we encourage you, beloved, not to delay in always fulfilling the good you have begun, because it is not the beginning but the end that is praised.

We urge you to love and seek wisdom, so that you may reasonably and wisely manage and judge the things entrusted to you, as the Lord says through the prophet: "Instruct yourselves, you who judge the earth."

Therefore, fear the Lord, keep His commandments, and love Him with all your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself. The Most High God created wisdom in the Holy Spirit, saw it, numbered it, measured it, and poured it out over all His works and all flesh according to His gift to those who love Him.

The fear of the Lord is glory, and boasting, and a crown of exultation. The fear of the Lord delights the heart and gives joy and gladness for a long life. For those who fear the Lord, it will be well in the end, and on the day of their death, they will be blessed.

The love of God is honorable wisdom; those to whom it appears in vision love it in vision and in the recognition of its great deeds. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; it was created with the faithful in the womb, it walks with the chosen women, and it is recognized with the just and faithful.

The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of knowledge. Religiousness will guard and justify the heart, and it will give joy and gladness. For those who fear the Lord, it will be well, and in the days of their completion, they will be blessed.

The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and its fullness comes from its fruits. It will fill all their houses through generations, and its storerooms with its treasures. The crown of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, filling peace and the fruit of salvation; He saw it and numbered it, and both are gifts of God.

Wisdom shares knowledge and understanding of prudence, and it exalts the glory of those who hold it. The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and its branches are long-lasting.

In the treasures of wisdom, there is understanding and the religiousness of knowledge: but wisdom is an abomination to sinners. The fear of the Lord drives out sin; for those who are without fear cannot be justified. For the anger of his spirit is his destruction. The patient will endure until the time, and afterward, there will be a return of joy. Good sense will hide his words until the time, and the lips of many will speak his understanding.

In the treasures of wisdom, there is the indication of discipline; but the cultivation of God is an abomination to the sinner. Son, if you desire wisdom, keep righteousness, and God will give it to you. For wisdom and discipline are the fear of the Lord; and what pleases Him is faith and meekness, and it will fill His treasures.

Do not be stubborn, and do not be incredulous to the fear of the Lord, and do not approach Him with a double heart. Do not be a hypocrite before men, and do not stumble with your lips. Consider these things, lest you fall and bring scandal to your soul, and bring dishonor upon yourself, and God reveals your secrets.

Always strive for faith and justice, and for the salvation of your soul, and act courageously for the help of your brothers, so that you may receive a reward from the Lord. For it is written in Ecclesiasticus: "Son, observe the time and avoid evil. Do not be ashamed to speak the truth for the sake of your soul. For there is a shame that brings sin, and there is a shame that brings glory."
