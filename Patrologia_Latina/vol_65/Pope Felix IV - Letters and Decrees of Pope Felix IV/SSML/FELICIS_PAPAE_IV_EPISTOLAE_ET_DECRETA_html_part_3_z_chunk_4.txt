  <p>Felix the Fourth, bishop of the city of Rome. The diligence of our predecessors in maintaining church peace and order is to be commended, because a pastor who must keep watch and resolve disputes either condemns or corrects. We should follow this same path, as we hold their position by God's mercy and should follow their examples.</p>
  
  <p>Due to envy, certain issues have arisen with the priests of the Church of Ravenna, which have disturbed the minds of all Catholics, involving disputes, seditions, and corruptions that try to disrupt all ecclesiastical discipline. We, keeping the fear of God before our eyes, must not encourage illicit acts or ignore them, but rather organize what is just according to Solomon's saying: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈsɑləmən">Solomon</phoneme>'s saying: "Do not give passage to water."</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, reviewing the chapters presented to us by our brother Ecclesius, the priests, deacons, and clerics of the Church of Ravenna, in the presence of our brother and fellow priest Ecclesius and his clerics listed below, we decree that those whose lives and conduct cannot be impugned by the authority of sacred canons should assume clerical duties. According to the rules of the holy Fathers, we command that clerics, who are willing and announced, should be solemnly promoted at the appointed times, as far as presbyters and deacons are concerned.</p>
  
  <p>The ancient custom should be maintained regarding the Church of Ravenna and the Church of Classis. Clerics or monks seeking an inappropriate position or place should not rely on the patronage of the powerful, which might make the bishop seem either ungrateful for not acting or unjust for acting. The fourth part of the patrimony of the Church of Ravenna, that is, three thousand solidi, should be distributed in the customary manner to all clerics or to those who usually receive it.</p>
  
  <p>If, by the will of our Lord, additional income or inheritances occur, these should also be added to the fourth part, so that what is distributed to each person is clear, according to merit and place, as God has established everything according to justice and measure, so that everyone, unless due to illness or a valid reason, should diligently observe all their duties at the altar.</p>
  
  <p>The revenues and accessions of estates, except for family expenses or gifts offered on various occasions and necessary banquets for hosting guests, should benefit the bishop. No one from the clergy should attempt to form any conspiracy or secret meeting, as even among laypeople this cannot go unpunished in the Church of God. Just as we wish that divine mercy does not allow such acts, if anyone attempts it, they should feel the authority of the canons and the ecclesiastical discipline as the Apostle says: "Rebuke those who sin before all, so that the others may fear."</p>
  
  <p>The good should earn praise for their diligence in God's works; they should feel the affection of their own priest, who seems to honor the proposal through their obedience; they should take pride in the love of their bishop, who does not cease to perform duties pleasing to God in their offices. As the divine words speak: "The worker deserves his wages."</p>
  
  <p>Regarding the patrimony of the Church, persons from the clergy chosen by the bishop's judgment, with the assistance deemed necessary by the bishop, should be sent under proper surety, whose faith and diligence have been proven, so that the sustenance of the poor is not defrauded, the amount of the Church's patrimony is not hidden, and each cleric under the fear of God and their own priest should faithfully account for what has been entrusted to them.</p>
  
  <p>That which is holy and religious...</p>


  <p>
    But with the intention of cursing, it was neither appropriate for us to speak nor to explain in words. 
    It has come to our attention that some of the clergy have attended spectacles, which is so cruel that it disturbs the souls of Catholics because of its curse. Those whom they heard reciting divine words in the house of God, they see attending these spectacles against the commandments. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In these matters, discipline is confused, and divine precepts are trampled upon. Therefore, it is necessary for the bishop to be concerned about this part as well, so that if they do not do it, they should not do it in the future, and if they do, they should be corrected according to church discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
    If any of the clergy hold urban or rural properties belonging to the Church, we establish that these should be placed under a fair estimation of rent. This ensures that what they are accustomed to receiving in their own ways, they retain, and what remains, they contribute to the church’s profits. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding urban and rural properties and other movable goods left by the faithful for the benefit of their souls to various named basilicas, the old custom should be maintained.
  </p>
  <p>
    The notaries, according to the order of the registry, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, should, at their own risk, receive the ecclesiastical documents in the presence of the priests and deacons, under the description of faithful records. This ensures that whenever the cause requires, they may faithfully produce, deliver, and receive them. However, we order them to do all things with the command and arrangement of their bishop.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reason, all ecclesiastical documents must be described, so that in no way do the received documents perish, nor at the time they are necessary for ecclesiastical utilities can they not be produced. Those notaries who are diligent in their duties should receive without diminution the benefits allocated to them or their predecessors from ancient times. They should also, as reason demands and antiquity has ordained, deliver the records and securities of the entire ecclesiastical patrimony, subscribed by the bishop's hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, for those who do not tolerate any necessity for secular conversation and to whom ecclesiastical properties, either urban or rural, have been given, the bishop should, through those clerics he commands, recall them to the Church's dominion. Henceforth, except for the cause above mentioned, they should not presume to give.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mastalo, the archdeacon of the Church of Ravenna, should receive without diminution the benefits allocated to him by ancient custom, as it has been shown those before him received.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monasteries of men or women dedicated to God should be ordained by the bishop, so that reason, justice, peace, and discipline may be maintained for all.
  </p>
  <p>
    The nature of our position requires us not to remain silent about these things. It is our brother Ecclesius’s duty to guard them, because justice maintained with the canons generates peace. From justice comes charity, through which we see God, and by whose grace, we can keep these precepts. Therefore, it is fitting for us to be negligent in nothing, but vigilant in all things, so that the talent entrusted to us, with the increase of good works, we may return to the giver of all good things.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have recognized this. Coelius Felix, bishop of the Catholic Church of the city of Rome, have subscribed to this constitution between the parties.
