Letter Two
To the distinguished and magnificent Lord Chlodoveus, King, from Remigius

Great news has reached us that you have undertaken the administration of military affairs. It is not surprising that you have begun to be as your ancestors always were. 

First and foremost, you must ensure that the judgment of the Lord does not waver from you, where your merit, which has reached its highest peak through the diligence of your humility, stands firm. As the saying goes, a man's actions are proven by their end.

You should seek advisors who can enhance your reputation. Your generosity must be pure and honorable, and you owe respect to your priests, always seeking their counsel. If you maintain good relations with them, your province will be more stable. 

Uplift your citizens, help the afflicted, support widows, and nurture orphans, if that is better than educating them, so that everyone will love and fear you. Let justice come from your mouth: let nothing be hoped for from the poor or strangers, lest you prefer to receive gifts or anything else. Let your court be open to all, so that no one leaves it sad. 

Whatever ancestral wealth you possess, use it to free captives and release them from the yoke of servitude. If anyone comes into your presence, let them not feel like a stranger. Joke with the young, discuss with the old, if you want to reign and be considered noble.
