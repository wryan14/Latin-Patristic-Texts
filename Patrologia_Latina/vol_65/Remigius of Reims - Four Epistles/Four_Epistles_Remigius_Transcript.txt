Introduction to the Letters of Saint Remigius, Archbishop of Reims
One. In the acts of Saint Remigius, bishop of Reims, there is a disagreement among scholars and learned men regarding the timeline: Baronius, Pagius, Henschenius, Cointius, Labbeus, and Sammarthanus, among others. However, in our judgment, we preferred the chronology set by the writers of the literary history of Gaul, who place the birth of the blessed bishop in the year 439 and state that his ordination was completed in the year 461. They believe he died on the 13th of January in the year 533, at the age of 94, having served as bishop for seventy years or more, as Gregory of Tours writes.
Indeed, Remigius himself testifies in a letter written in the case of the priest Claudius after the death of King Clovis in the year 512, that he had already presided over the episcopal seat for fifty-three years by then. Therefore, he must have been ordained in the year 461. According to Hincmar, followed by Flodoard, he was elevated to the pinnacle of the pontificate at the age of twenty-two, more taken than elected. Hence, it is deduced that he was born in the year 439.
Furthermore, we have learned from Gregory of Tours that he held the episcopate for more than seventy years. Flavius, Remigius' successor in Rome, is known to have subscribed to the Council of Clermont on the 9th of November in the year 535, thus it seems he did not live beyond the beginning of the year 533, when it is said he died on the 13th of January. This opinion is considered the most plausible.
Two. Regarding the notable deeds of this bishop of Reims, it is sufficient to remember that he baptized Clovis, the king of the Franks, in the year 496, on Christmas Day, as Avitus, bishop of Vienne, writes to Clovis on this matter. "In the western regions, a new light of a new splendor shines in the king. The birth of our Redeemer fittingly began its radiance: so that you may be reborn to salvation from water on that day on which the world received the Lord of heaven for its redemption."
Gregory of Tours discusses Clovis' conversion and baptism in more detail, writing, "More than three thousand of his army were baptized." Hincmar, in the Life of Saint Remigius, says Clovis was baptized with his entire people. An old author concurs, stating, "Later the entire people of the Franks were baptized." Therefore, the blessed Remigius was rightly called the apostle of the Franks. Nor should the famous saying recorded by Gregory of Tours be omitted here, where our bishop of Reims addressed King Clovis as he approached baptism with a certain divine majesty: "Humble your neck, Sicambrian; adore what you have burned, burn what you have adored."
The other deeds of the blessed Remigius should be repeated from the above-mentioned writers, which Sammarthanus briefly presents.
Three. Saint Remigius, says Gregory of Tours, was a bishop of outstanding knowledge and well-versed in rhetoric studies. Our bishop of Reims was indeed distinguished in his disciplines and of great learning, as attested by Sidonius, bishop of Clermont, who writes to Remigius: "There is rarely, if ever, anyone whose meditation is matched by his arrangement of causes, the position of letters, the composition of syllables. Moreover, appropriateness in examples, trustworthiness in testimonies, propriety in epithets, elegance in figures, strength in arguments, weight in meanings, flow in words, and thunder in endings."
The structure is strong and firm, the connections of perfect conjunctions with unbreakable pauses; yet no less smooth and light, and rounded in all respects, so that the reader's tongue may pass smoothly over it without stumbling, not stammering through rough joints as it rolls over the palate. In the end, it is wholly fluid and malleable, as when a finger glides over glassy surfaces or onyx without encountering any jagged obstacles or breaking."
What more can I say? There is currently no speech by a living person that your skill cannot surpass with effort. This is the Bishop of Arvernia speaking.
After these words were reported, our Baronius adds: "If only Sidonius himself, who writes these things, had completed what he threatened in letters to him with these words: If you delay enriching our barrenness with your eloquent conversations, we will seize the opportunities of the market, and with our connivance and support, a band of thieves will plunder your chests: you will then begin to be stirred in vain after being robbed, if now, when asked, you are not moved by duty."
But, to use the words of Sirmond, the declamations of Remigius, whose eloquence Sidonius so greatly commends, have not reached us: and this is not a recent loss; even Hincmar himself and Flodoard, who included this letter of Sidonius in their history, seem to have been completely unaware of them.
Indeed, as Baronius interprets, "we are not permitted to enjoy these nocturnal writings of Remigius, which, while he was alive, he preferred to bury in oblivion out of humility rather than dedicate to perpetuity."
Regarding this matter, you may see the writers of the Literary History of France, Volume 4.
However, not all the literary monuments of the blessed Bishop of Reims have perished completely. Four of his letters still survive, which, whether you consider their eloquence, judgment, or especially the priestly vigor in defending ecclesiastical rights, are recognized as worthy of such a bishop.
About these letters, as well as the others we have attached to them, there is nothing more to say here except what we have noted in the footnotes.
Furthermore, regarding the Explanations of the letters of the blessed Apostle Paul, previously published under the name of Remigius of Reims by Juan Bautista Villalpando, learned men have long noted that they were falsely attributed to him: among them are Cointius, Pagius, the authors of the Literary History of France, and most recently Dom Abbot Lebeuf in his work titled "Collection of Various Writings to Serve as Clarifications for the History of France."
Thus, it is indeed surprising that Huet, the distinguished scholar, adhered to Villalpando's opinion, attributing that work to the blessed Bishop Remigius of Reims, which others more correctly proved should be ascribed to Remigius of Auxerre.
Letter One To the illustrious and meritorious King Clovis, from Remigius
It pains me, and it pains me greatly, because of your sorrow that your sister Albofledis, of glorious memory, has passed away.
But we can find comfort, because she left this world in such a way that she should be remembered more than mourned.
For she lived a life such that it is believed the Lord took her, and she, chosen by God, migrated to heaven.
She lives in your faith, even if she has been received through desire.
Christ fulfilled it, so that she received the blessing of virginity; she who is consecrated should not be mourned, she who blooms in the sight of the Lord with the flower of virginity, and indeed is crowned with the crown she received for her virginity.
Let it not be that she is mourned by the faithful, she who has earned the good fragrance of Christ, so that through Him whom she pleases, she can provide help to those who ask.
My lord, drive sadness from your heart: with a composed mind, govern the kingdom wisely, taking on higher counsels with a focus on serenity.
Strengthen your body with a joyful heart: by shaking off the numbness of sorrow, you will more keenly watch over salvation.
The kingdom remains for you to manage, and with God’s guidance, to oversee.
You are the head of the people, and you bear the leadership.
Do not let those who are accustomed to seeing happiness through you see you affected by bitterness in mourning.
Be the comforter of your own soul, maintaining the vigor of your innate providence, so that sadness does not diminish the purity of your mind.
As for her present passing, who, as I believe, is joined to the choirs of virgins, the King rejoices in heaven.
Greeting your glory, I commend my familiar priest Maccolum whom I have sent.
I ask that you forgive me for not meeting you in person, as I have presumed to send these words of exhortation.
However, if you command through the bearer of this letter that I should come, disregarding the harshness of winter, neglecting the cold, and overcoming the hardship of the journey, I will endeavor to reach you with the Lord’s help.
Letter TwoTo the distinguished and magnificent Lord Chlodoveus, King, from Remigius
Great news has reached us that you have undertaken the administration of military affairs. It is not surprising that you have begun to be as your ancestors always were.
First and foremost, you must ensure that the judgment of the Lord does not waver from you, where your merit, which has reached its highest peak through the diligence of your humility, stands firm. As the saying goes, a man's actions are proven by their end.
You should seek advisors who can enhance your reputation. Your generosity must be pure and honorable, and you owe respect to your priests, always seeking their counsel. If you maintain good relations with them, your province will be more stable.
Uplift your citizens, help the afflicted, support widows, and nurture orphans, if that is better than educating them, so that everyone will love and fear you. Let justice come from your mouth: let nothing be hoped for from the poor or strangers, lest you prefer to receive gifts or anything else. Let your court be open to all, so that no one leaves it sad.
Whatever ancestral wealth you possess, use it to free captives and release them from the yoke of servitude. If anyone comes into your presence, let them not feel like a stranger. Joke with the young, discuss with the old, if you want to reign and be considered noble.
Letter ThreeTo the truly holy and deservedly most blessed brothers in Christ, Heraclius, Leo, and Theodosius
Paul the apostle speaks in his letter: "Love never fails" (First Corinthians 13:8), which did not settle in your hearts to send such letters to me.
For I offered a simple prayer for Claudius, whom you do not write as a priest, so that you might show your indignation towards me.
I do not deny that he has gravely sinned, but you should have respected my age, even if not my merits.
With divine favor, it has been said that I have presided over the episcopal seat for 53 years, and no one has addressed me so insolently.
You say it would have been better if you had not been born. This would have been convenient for me, so I would not have heard the reproach of a transgressor.
I made Claudius a priest, not corrupted by a bribe, but by the testimony of the most excellent king, who was not only a preacher of the Catholic faith but also a defender.
You write that what he ordered was not canonical. You hold the highest priesthood. The governor of the regions, the guardian of the homeland, the conqueror of nations commanded it.
You burst forth with such bile against me that you did not even respect the author of your episcopate.
I asked that Claudius, the perpetrator of sacrilege, be preserved for penance.
In Jonah chapter 3 verses 5 through 10, we read that the Ninevites escaped destruction predicted by a heavenly announcement through penance:
which John the precursor of the Lord preached in the Gospel of Matthew, that with the kingdom of heaven approaching, the people should do penance so that they might not perish.
In Revelation, it is written to the angels of the churches by the command of the Lord and Savior, that they should correct by penance what they had done less worthily.
From the angry words of your holiness, I understand that you do not pity the fallen after their downfall.
But I see that you rather wish that he does not turn back and live, when the Lord said: "I do not desire the death of the dying, but that he turns back and lives" (Ezekiel 33:2).
This is what we should follow, this will of the Lord not to overlook, but to hold: because he placed us not for wrath, but for the care of men, and to serve piety rather than fury.
You state in your letter that a certain Celsus who believed Claudius, was abducted, and you do not know whether he is alive or dead and command me to be his investigator; and you do not know whether he should be sought in the world or in the underworld: and you want me to restore his property which I do not know was taken.
You command the impossible, to accomplish the impious.
You write that I am a Jubilee in years, mocking rather than rejoicing out of love, to which the bond of charity being broken, you neither spare nor respect insincerely.
Letter FourTo my truly holy and most blessed brother in Christ, Bishop Falcon
As far as I have learned, and proven by actions, it was more of a priority to your blessedness to insult me than to greet me.
What a fitting beginning you gave, to harm me as a bishop before I even saw you as a bishop!
You flew too quickly on tender wings, with a light-hearted spirit, not with the advice of maturity.
Indeed, at the very start of your bishopric, you attempt to enter another's jurisdiction, when you should have respectfully entered your own.
So was it right for you to believe that the Mosomagense Church should be occupied by your illicit ordinations, which the metropolitan of the city of Reims has always governed under the guidance of Christ?
I still think you do not know your own affairs, and you already invade others'.
So, in your haste, you consecrate priests, establish archdeacons, and appoint the head of the most distinguished school and the readers' militia.
I do not complain that you did not consult me in these matters; I wish you had consulted yourself!
For if your holiness was ignorant of the canons, it was very premature to transgress before learning them.
But if you knew the statutes of the churches, it was all the more grievous and dangerous for your foolishness to trample on the decrees of the ancient and magnificent bishops.
Be careful, you who presume to take what is not yours, lest you lose what you seem to have.
Since the rights of the ordination you performed are not valid, with what counsel will you defend the beginnings of your priestly office if you mix the offense of reckless transgression with obstinacy or impotence?
It will be a greater disgrace to have violated an ancient sanction than to be praised for standing against the canons you created.
But what shall I say about the orders of those whom your blessedness has promoted?
It amounts to more, for if we discuss it according to the statutes and severity of our ancestors, not only will their status, but your entire bishopric will come into question.
The Lord in the Gospel says to Peter: "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
And Peter replies: "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you" (John 21:15).
To whom the Lord commands three times, under this response: "Feed my sheep."
I, because I am completely inexperienced in feeding the sheep of Christ with the abundance of heavenly sustenance, cannot; but being taught by sacred teachings, I advise you to feed those who have been entrusted to me by Christ's command, and forbid you to invade them.
Always act so that what is worthy accompanies you.
Serve the church which, by divine dispensation, you have merited to preside over, and watch over the salvation of the Lord's flock as a diligent shepherd.
I wish my modest resources could suffice for what I desire for you in the name of the Lord!
But since my own are lacking, I do not require the services entrusted to me by the Savior to be saved by a hireling.
John in the Apocalypse (Chapter 2, 3) indeed addresses his seven angels, and writes to each church.
Therefore, the actions and merits are judged as per the precepts of those in charge: what is proven to need correction, he chastises.
Therefore, since the form of pontifical action is delivered under the name of angel, I grieve over the audacity of your presumption, that you, a new one, change ancient laws, a rash one, divine laws to earthly ones.
Let us hear, let those priests you have chosen hear. Your priests themselves should hear us.
I trust that the judgment of the Creator will not be in your favor, but against you, from those judging.
For who, for the integrity of his sense, would not condemn him who broke out against the rule of the Church, who ought to have kept the rule of the Church?
You command, as I hear, that the tributes of the tenants be brought to you, and you order that the revenues of the fields be delivered.
It is understood that you coveted the property of the church, not the church itself, when you anxiously demand what I, to whom they rightfully belonged, remitted rather than sought.
Let it not be hidden from you that the levitas and priests you ordained out of order have already been removed from their office.
For I have considered that it did not befit me to admit those whom it was not lawful for you to ordain.
Alas, how much you have repelled me from the intent of your worship, since you prefer to act wrongly than to keep fraternal bonds!
I had wished that you had remained a cleric since you were made a priest against your will.
In all honesty, I confess that it troubles me just as much that you made an inexcusable mistake as it does that I was treated with contempt.
