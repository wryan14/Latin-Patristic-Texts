Introduction to the Letters of Saint Remigius, Archbishop of Reims

One.
 In the acts of Saint Remigius, bishop of Reims, there is a disagreement among scholars and learned men regarding the timeline: Baronius, Pagius, Henschenius, Cointius, Labbeus, and Sammarthanus, among others. However, in our judgment, we preferred the chronology set by the writers of the literary history of Gaul, who place the birth of the blessed bishop in the year 439 and state that his ordination was completed in the year 461. They believe he died on the 13th of January in the year 533, at the age of 94, having served as bishop for seventy years or more, as Gregory of Tours writes.

Indeed, Remigius himself testifies in a letter written in the case of the priest Claudius after the death of King Clovis in the year 512, that he had already presided over the episcopal seat for fifty-three years by then. Therefore, he must have been ordained in the year 461. According to Hincmar, followed by Flodoard, he was elevated to the pinnacle of the pontificate at the age of twenty-two, more taken than elected. Hence, it is deduced that he was born in the year 439.

Furthermore, we have learned from Gregory of Tours that he held the episcopate for more than seventy years. Flavius, Remigius' successor in Rome, is known to have subscribed to the Council of Clermont on the 9th of November in the year 535, thus it seems he did not live beyond the beginning of the year 533, when it is said he died on the 13th of January. This opinion is considered the most plausible.

Two.
 Regarding the notable deeds of this bishop of Reims, it is sufficient to remember that he baptized Clovis, the king of the Franks, in the year 496, on Christmas Day, as Avitus, bishop of Vienne, writes to Clovis on this matter. "In the western regions, a new light of a new splendor shines in the king. The birth of our Redeemer fittingly began its radiance: so that you may be reborn to salvation from water on that day on which the world received the Lord of heaven for its redemption."

Gregory of Tours discusses Clovis' conversion and baptism in more detail, writing, "More than three thousand of his army were baptized." Hincmar, in the Life of Saint Remigius, says Clovis was baptized with his entire people. An old author concurs, stating, "Later the entire people of the Franks were baptized." Therefore, the blessed Remigius was rightly called the apostle of the Franks. Nor should the famous saying recorded by Gregory of Tours be omitted here, where our bishop of Reims addressed King Clovis as he approached baptism with a certain divine majesty: "Humble your neck, Sicambrian; adore what you have burned, burn what you have adored."

The other deeds of the blessed Remigius should be repeated from the above-mentioned writers, which Sammarthanus briefly presents.

Three.
 Saint Remigius, says Gregory of Tours, was a bishop of outstanding knowledge and well-versed in rhetoric studies. Our bishop of Reims was indeed distinguished in his disciplines and of great learning, as attested by Sidonius, bishop of Clermont, who writes to Remigius: "There is rarely, if ever, anyone whose meditation is matched by his arrangement of causes, the position of letters, the composition of syllables. Moreover, appropriateness in examples, trustworthiness in testimonies, propriety in epithets, elegance in figures, strength in arguments, weight in meanings, flow in words, and thunder in endings."

The structure is strong and firm, the connections of perfect conjunctions with unbreakable pauses; yet no less smooth and light, and rounded in all respects, so that the reader's tongue may pass smoothly over it without stumbling, not stammering through rough joints as it rolls over the palate. In the end, it is wholly fluid and malleable, as when a finger glides over glassy surfaces or onyx without encountering any jagged obstacles or breaking."

What more can I say? There is currently no speech by a living person that your skill cannot surpass with effort. This is the Bishop of Arvernia speaking.

After these words were reported, our Baronius adds: "If only Sidonius himself, who writes these things, had completed what he threatened in letters to him with these words: If you delay enriching our barrenness with your eloquent conversations, we will seize the opportunities of the market, and with our connivance and support, a band of thieves will plunder your chests: you will then begin to be stirred in vain after being robbed, if now, when asked, you are not moved by duty."

But, to use the words of Sirmond, the declamations of Remigius, whose eloquence Sidonius so greatly commends, have not reached us: and this is not a recent loss; even Hincmar himself and Flodoard, who included this letter of Sidonius in their history, seem to have been completely unaware of them.

Indeed, as Baronius interprets, "we are not permitted to enjoy these nocturnal writings of Remigius, which, while he was alive, he preferred to bury in oblivion out of humility rather than dedicate to perpetuity."

Regarding this matter, you may see the writers of the Literary History of France, Volume 4.

However, not all the literary monuments of the blessed Bishop of Reims have perished completely. Four of his letters still survive, which, whether you consider their eloquence, judgment, or especially the priestly vigor in defending ecclesiastical rights, are recognized as worthy of such a bishop.

About these letters, as well as the others we have attached to them, there is nothing more to say here except what we have noted in the footnotes.

Furthermore, regarding the Explanations of the letters of the blessed Apostle Paul, previously published under the name of Remigius of Reims by Juan Bautista Villalpando, learned men have long noted that they were falsely attributed to him: among them are Cointius, Pagius, the authors of the Literary History of France, and most recently Dom Abbot Lebeuf in his work titled "Collection of Various Writings to Serve as Clarifications for the History of France."

Thus, it is indeed surprising that Huet, the distinguished scholar, adhered to Villalpando's opinion, attributing that work to the blessed Bishop Remigius of Reims, which others more correctly proved should be ascribed to Remigius of Auxerre.
