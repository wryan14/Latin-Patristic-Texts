      "original_latin": "Bona  et digna et sancta res, et apta prorsus satisque\nconveniens de sanctis vigiliis nunc dicere, et\nconferre sermonem, quando ipsa lucubratio geritur\na sollicitis et religiosis: nox caeca est, et necessaria\ncaligo corporibus, quae non solum homines, sed\netiam in somno detinet animantes, ut, reparatis  viribus\nper soporem, possint diurnos labores sustinere\nvigilantes. Bonus Deus, qui ita prospexit, ita constituit,\nut homo exiturus ad opus suum et ad operationem\nsuam usque ad vesperam, haberet vicarium tempus,\nin quo a laboribus duris et multa fatigatione\nrequiesceret (Psal CIII 23). Ergo diem ad opus,\nnoctem fecit ad requiem; et pro hoc, sicut pro omnibus,\ngratias debemus agere illi qui praestitit . Novimus\nautem multos hominum, ut aut majoribus suis\n placeant, aut sibi aliquid peculiariter prosint, noctis\nparticulam ad aliquod opusculum segregare, et id\npro lucro ducere, quod furati de sopore suo, operari\npotuerunt . Quod si in carnalibus instrumentis, id\nest, victui ac vestitui necessariis, qui vigilant non\nreprehenduntur, imo laudantur; quanto magis nos\nsacras vigilias, tam spirituali opere fructuosas, orationibus\nscilicet, hymnis, lectionibus fecundas, observare\net amare debemus, ut a Domino Deo mercedem\nrecipiamus ?",
