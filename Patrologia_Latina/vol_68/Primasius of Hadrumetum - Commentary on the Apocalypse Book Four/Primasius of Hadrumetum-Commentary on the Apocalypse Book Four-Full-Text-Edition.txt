Commentary on the Revelation of Saint John
by Primasius of Hadrumetum
Book Four

Chapter Thirteen

I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns were diadems.
This sea represents the abyss, from which it was said the beast would rise.
In both cases, it signifies the people: a people emerging from the people, and a beast rising from the people.
The beast is a general name, contrary to the lamb, but in the narrative, we must understand which part of the beast is being referred to.
Sometimes, the devil is called the beast. Sometimes it's the body, or one of its heads, which seemed to be slain but resurrected, simulating true faith.
Sometimes only the leaders are called the beast.
The beast rising from the sea is called the body of the devil, with ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns were diadems, and on its heads were names of blasphemy, because it wants to be considered a god, and is rightly said to bear the name of blasphemy.
The ten horns and seven heads will be discussed in more detail later, as both are sufficient everywhere.
The beast I saw was like a leopard, with feet like a bear, and a mouth like a lion.
It is compared to a leopard for the diversity of nations, to a bear for its brutal malice, and to a lion for the strength of its body and the arrogance of its tongue.
The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and great authority.
The Apostle speaks of the body of the devil, saying, "Whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, to those who perish" (Second Thessalonians 2).
One of its seven heads seemed to be slain, but its deadly wound was healed.
One of its heads is called the Antichrist, because the seven are not in number, but in the significance of the universal earthly kingdom, contrary to the lamb.
The dragon, that is, the devil, will certainly give his power and his throne to this one.

Just as wisdom resides in the good soul of the righteous, the enemy takes the throne in the evil ones he possesses the most, using them to lead others astray and often performing wonders through them with God's permission.
He advances with such impiety to deceive the minds of the young, daring to present himself as one of the seven heads, imitating the true head, as if he were slain and resurrected, and to be accepted instead of Christ, who truly accomplished this.
The nations dwelling on the earth were amazed.
The beast changed the names so that it would not be said, "the amazed beast followed the beast."
He placed "earth" for earthly people, who preferred to follow and worship him, that is, those who are said to worship the devil in the Antichrist as in an idol.
This is what it means when it says: "And they worshiped the dragon because he gave his power to the beast."
Again, they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like this beast? And who can fight against it?"
When he is praised by his followers for his prominence, as we read, and for opening the mouth of the nations and the virtues of the good, and for the admiration of the earthly thing: therefore, when he is praised and exalted in boasting, the entire body of the beast is described.
And he was given authority to act for 42 months.
These months also complete three years and six months, during which the severity of the present persecution is foretold, but now specifically the final persecution: for because of the four well-known parts of the world, if you multiply the legal Decalogue by four, in which is the sign of perfection, you complete 40.
If you add to these the two commandments of charity in action, you achieve 42.
For words alone would not help if not fulfilled by deeds; through these, the Church is said to be temporarily fortified like with the wings of an eagle, fleeing the dragon's snares into solitude, to be nourished for 1,260 days, which complete 42 months, so that the same number may not be marked with empty significance.

He opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. That is, against God and the Church which dwells in heaven. For which the Apostle says in Philippians chapter 3, "Our citizenship is in heaven," and in Romans chapter 8, "Now you are not in the flesh."
Otherwise, I think the temple here also signifies the glorified body of Christ, which the Antichrist is said to blaspheme when he dares to assign to himself the honor specifically due to it. Hence, in the Gospel, the Lord says, "So that, if it were possible, even the elect would be deceived," but immediately follows, "But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened" Matthew chapter 24.
Power was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. By saying he opened his mouth, it shows he burst into this damnable confidence, so what he previously dared to do secretly, he now dares to blaspheme publicly. He dares to assign to himself the honor specifically due to it and speaks wickedly on high, so that, contrary to Christ, he wants to be accepted in place of Him, either by force or by deceit.
He will temporarily receive power, which he will use badly, intending to harm the body of Christ, just as persecutors did to the suffering Christ. He is further exalted and with his own is more severely tormented. About this, the Lord says in John chapter 19, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above." Therefore, if Christ had given this to His persecutors at the moment of His passion, as mentioned in John chapter 14, when the ruler of this world found nothing in Him worthy of death, it is no wonder if He permits the wicked to rage in His Church for a time, so that it may be said they have overcome it? Although a part must be understood from the whole, which can be overcome.
Power was given to him over every tribe, people, language, and nation. And all who dwell on the earth worshiped him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

It's not enough to simply say that the beast, often mentioned as being opposed to the Lamb, is not the Lamb or Christ, whom it pretends to be. No one has earned the right to be written in the Lamb's book-not the beast itself nor those who agree with it. This can be understood because it was stated earlier: all the inhabitants of the earth worshipped it.
That is, those who are earthly worshipped the devil, to whom it was said: You will eat dust Genesis 3.
About whom Jeremiah says: Those who turn away from you will be written in the earth Jeremiah 17.
Or the psalm says, And let them not be written with the righteous Psalm 69.
If anyone has ears, let them hear.
Whoever leads into captivity will go into captivity. Whenever the spirit says something here that must be heard more intently, it is introduced in this way.
Speaking of the power that the devil and the beast will receive, we should not take the fleeting arrogance of this ruinous peak seriously. It instructs us by saying: Whoever leads into captivity will go into captivity.
As if to say, the devil and the beast, who now seem to capture nations with their nets, will themselves soon be captured with their own.
And whoever kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.
Knowing such things will be immediately avenged at the coming of the Lord, it therefore says: And whoever kills with the sword must be killed with the sword, definitively stating the person of the devil and the Antichrist. Therefore, it says indefinitely: Whoever leads into captivity will go into captivity; and whoever kills with the sword must be killed with the sword.
Hence the Apostle speaks, saying Second Thessalonians 2: Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the spirit of his mouth and destroy by the brightness of his coming.
Then indeed, when death is swallowed up in victory First Corinthians 15, all the saints must wait patiently and with long-suffering; therefore he added: Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
Hence the same apostle Galatians 6: Brothers, he says, let us not grow weary: for in due time we will reap if we do not give up.

And I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It exercised all the authority of the first beast on the earth.
The two horns like a lamb represent the Two Testaments appropriate to the Lamb, but this beast tried to claim them for itself. It is said to speak like a dragon because, in hypocrisy-pretending to be truthful-it deceives those it seduces. It wouldn't appear like a lamb if it openly spoke like a dragon.
It pretends to be a lamb to infiltrate the Lamb, which means the body of Christ. It speaks like a dragon to trick and drive away those who seek the way of truth. It exercised all the authority of the first beast on the earth.
The first beast, which was seen rising from the sea, had been given great power by the devil. This beast exercised its power in the presence of the other beast. In the leaders it appoints, all the power of the people is like that of locusts and horses in their tails. The leaders, standing before the people, act in ways that serve the devil's will, under the guise of the Church's hypocrisy.
The fact that both beasts clearly form one body and practice the same wickedness shows that the hypocrisy of the second beast serves the first beast. Therefore, it added: so that the inhabitants of the earth would worship the first beast, whose deadly wound had been healed. It performed signs, even causing fire to come down from the sky in front of people, and it deceived those who dwell on the earth. Alternatively, as another translation has it, the earth and those who live in it.
It makes a transition of names. It called that beast with the heads the earth, and its head the beast. For it had said that the wound of its head was healed. Now, it says the beast, whose wound was healed, showing that it calls all parts of the beast the beast, because in all its functions, the devil, who is the beast, is present.
Therefore, the beast with two horns, which is part of the beast, makes the beast worship the beast. It said the earth, to transfer the name to the head as if it were the beast killed, without saying: the beast made the beast worship the beast.

For one thing, a beast is different from the earth, because the beast represents the people, and the earth causes death. However, he did not mention the earth and those who live in it without reason. It would have been enough to say "the earth" or "those who live on the earth," but he demonstrates the power of deception, showing that both soul and body are miserably enslaved to it.
When someone falls by force without being deceived, they are only a captive in body. But someone who is deceived is captured in both body and mind. Therefore, he said: "He makes the earth and those who dwell on it worship the beast, whose deadly wound was healed, and it lived."
Let's examine this more closely. Our Lord Jesus Christ had a wound from the sword and lived; but here he mentioned the beast, which had a wound made by the sword and lived. He says that the dragon and the beast are worshiped. This deviates, as only the dragon is worshiped by his own.
Just as the Church has a mediator between itself and God, so the devil has between himself and his followers, but only in name as an imitation of Christ. This beast, which he mentioned, does not have a person between the devil and his followers, because it exists only in name, by which they claim to worship Christ, who died and rose again (Romans 8). In this name, they worship the devil, who created this image for his followers. For even Satan transforms himself into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11), deceitfully presenting only the name of Christ to his followers.
Moreover, he fills both his own place and that of the mediator, as he has no mediator except for the image of Christ. He says that the beast has the wound of the sword and lives. For the beast is what interacts with his followers under this name. Therefore, when he said that the beast is worshiped, having the wound of the sword and living, he points to the devil, about whom the Apostle says (2 Thessalonians 2): "Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were God."
Thus, the three are: the devil, the beast as if slain, and the people with their leaders, with the image mediating between them.

If at any time it is said that the middle one is worshiped, the matter falls into the devil's hands. He fills his place and that of this middle name, opposing himself to be worshiped in a damnable manner by imitating theft with a simulated shadow of the name.
He performed great signs, even making fire come down from heaven in the sight of people. While many signs are said to be done by him, this sign is remembered above the others. This translation speaks as if from the past while announcing the future. Elsewhere, however, signifying the future, it says: So that he makes fire come down from heaven, that is, from the Church to the earthly. As from the diversity of nations or from the enemies deceived by cunning, making his ministers speak in new and many tongues, as if indicating that they received the gift of the Holy Spirit, who is truly read to have announced in the form of fiery tongues over each of the disciples of Christ.
Acts 2:
For the Lord also especially commends this sign of believers, saying:
Mark 16:
These signs will follow those who believe: In my name, they will cast out demons, they will speak in new tongues, etc.
Therefore, it is not surprising if that beast, which falsely usurps the name of the slain and living Lamb, fraudulently claims the largesse of the Holy Spirit through imitation and simulates condemnation with his ministers, as we remember Simon once attempted but could not succeed.
For even about the expulsion of demons and many other signs, when Satan's ministers themselves enumerating will say:
Matthew 7:
Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name? etc.
The Lord does not approve of those boasting but condemns and rejects the stubborn. And therefore, perhaps, he wished to specifically name this excellent sign of fire, which signifies the Holy Spirit, because no greater sign could be found. For while many things seem to be common with us in heresies, this particular gift is glorified to be held solely by the Church of Christ. Finally, the magicians of Pharaoh performing similar miracles to Moses.
Exodus.

The Holy Spirit is described as having frustrated them when, in their assertions, they succumbed and confessed the truth, saying: "This is the finger of God."
The Gospel testifies that the finger of God is called the Holy Spirit, as seen in Matthew twelve: "I cast out demons by the Spirit of God;" and in Luke eleven: "I cast out demons by the finger of God."
Therefore, the intensity of the deception is clear, as the beast is thought to possess that spirit which, when resisted, rendered the fraud of the magicians ineffective. Hence, it follows: "And he deceived those who dwell on the earth by the signs which he was granted to perform in the presence of the beast, and told the inhabitants of the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound by the sword and lived."
This simulation prevailed to such an extent that the earthly were deceived by the signs of the beast, favoring it with miserable assent, and encouraging each other to create an image of the beast in their hearts. As if now they would not doubt, confirmed by the judgment of the previously mentioned fire, that he truly is Christ, when in fact he is the devil in the Antichrist, presenting such deceptions that he is said to give a spirit to the image of the beast, and that the image of the beast should speak.
This passage can be understood in two ways: Either because, compelled by the judgment of power, it is now persuaded to all the wicked, as if by the devil operating, and by the leaders insisting on the people, that there should be one and the same profession for all, so that if anyone did not speak through the image of the beast, that is, mutual imitation, they would be killed. Thus, it finally says: "So that the image of the beast would speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
Alternatively, as in Genesis three, where the serpent deceived the woman, he similarly deceives many through the idol, making his consultants receive responses: that is, through the Antichrist, to whom they think honor should be given as to God, when he is the man of sin and the son of perdition, as mentioned in Second Thessalonians.

It goes like this: It was given the power to give life to the image of the beast, so that the image could speak and cause those who did not worship it to be killed. It made everyone-great and small, rich and poor, free and slave-receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.
He wanted to divide individuals by their parts, often embracing them confusedly in one body and in the name of the beast. The hand signifies work; the right hand symbolizes the simulation of truth; the forehead represents the profession of faith. Because they are deprived of both goods, they are said to be marked on both.
No one could buy or sell anything unless they had the mark of the name of the beast or the number of its name. The mention of buying and selling teaches that just as the Church gives a symbol for our salvation, so too do they in evil know they are constrained and bound by such a defense. They are not allowed the freedom to buy or sell, just like merchants held by a uniform sign unless they have the mark of the beast's name and number.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding, calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and its number is 666.
One more thing: Whoever has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name. Earlier, he mentioned the mark alone; later, he used synonyms, saying the mark, the name, and the number of the name.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding, calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. Therefore, we will take the number he mentioned, so that in the number we may also recognize the name and the mark. Its number, he said, is 666, which we will interpret according to the Greeks, especially because he was writing to Asia, and according to their language: I am, he said.

Alpha and Omega.
Despite the deceptions of the opposing side, where the devil tries to falsely claim divine honor to represent the Antichrist, which opposes divine honor, whether through a mark or through the number of his name, which is the will and action of the most wicked beast, he warns us to investigate its nature.
If you calculate the name using the characters used by the Greeks to denote numbers, you will find it sums up to 666; it is also interpreted as contrary to honor, meaning incompetent, troublesome, and inappropriate: for honor does not suit him, but rather a curse.
Therefore, through the number, the name is found, and from the name, the calculated number, and by the interpretation of the name, the quality of the merits is recognized.
Likewise, another name, which also sums up to the same number, can be wisely observed, making 600 and 6.
The interpretation of this number is understood as "I deny."
It is no wonder that this term applies to the Antichrist, which means denial, while the name of Christ corresponds to belief, as He testifies in John, Chapter 6: "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him who sent Me"; and also in John, Chapter 14: "You believe in God; believe also in Me."
So, whether you say contrary to honor, which is "antemos"; or I deny, which is "arnsum," both can justly refer to the Antichrist, indicating through both the noun and the verb, the nature of the person and the harshness of the work.
For the name of Christ, which the Antichrist desires to take upon false imitation, properly completes the number of days, which in the persecution of the Antichrist, is often predicted to be present, that is, 1,225 days, in whose guise adversity fraudulently opposes itself.
This is expressed in the mark, that is, in the monogram, where the entire name of Christ is included in shorthand.

The actual numerical value of the mentioned name, when calculated, also adds up to 1,225 days. We remember that in the number forty-six, we see the form of the Lord's body, which Christ, the second Adam, took from Mary to correct the errors of the first Adam. This is why in the Gospel it says:
"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
And the Jews replied,
"This temple was built in forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?"
The evangelist explains this by saying:
"But he spoke of the temple of his body."
And rightly so. The name Adam in Greek letters completes the number forty-six. When this number is broken down and written separately, it still completes the number forty-six in Greek letters, which, when combined, make 1,225. We mentioned this earlier in the monogram. Now, with the name broken down, it is shown that the same numerical sum concludes, showing that when both agree, it suggests not an empty but a certain mystery. This relates perhaps to what the Apostle says about the deception of the Antichrist:
"So that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
For in this book, it says:
"The temple of God was opened in heaven, evidently referring to the one born of the Virgin."
As the false imitation of the slain Lamb and similar things, so the temple of God is transformed in appearance, not in truth. I do not doubt that some may be troubled by the number 1,225, as three and a half years do not make the same numerical sum. But it should be known that Scripture does not always indicate this time in one way or under the definition of one number. For in the book of Revelation, when speaking of the woman in distress, it says:
"She will be nourished for a time, times, and half a time."
Elsewhere, it speaks of the dragon and the beast.

"He was given," he says, "power for 42 months; and likewise, 'I will give,' he says, 'to my two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days,' showing that there is a difference of 17 days between 42 months and 1,260 days."
"Not only in this book do we find this number varied, but also in the visions of Daniel, where this time is represented by different quantities of numbers."
"In the Book of Daniel, he says, 'A time, times, and half a time,' meaning one and two years in the Hebrew manner."
"He also mentions, '1,290 days.'"
"Elsewhere in the tenth vision, he specifies 1,395 days, all of which seem to illustrate the significance of this time, suggesting that the day of judgment or the second coming should not be revealed to human knowledge, allowing the richness of divine word and various accounts to engage the devout."
"To the disciples who inquired, 'If you present this time, and when the kingdom of Israel,' the Lord responded: 'It is not for you to know the times which the Father has set by his own authority.'"
"For in Greek, that is, 46, written through its characters, if summed up with specific numbers, aligns with the signification of the time itself, making 1,317."

Chapter Fourteen

And behold, I saw a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000, who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. This vision shows the likeness that they worship and to which adversity tries to conform. It was also necessary to declare the invincible camp of the Church, so that no one would think that the Church had succumbed or perished under such violent persecution, and so that it would not be believed that any of the elect had fallen.
He chose to mention those who decided to take the narrower and more constricted path, demonstrating that it's the imitation of the adversaries, not the truth, that the good men of God are known to rightly bear. They had, he said, his name (that is, the Lamb) and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
This finite number, however, must be understood as infinite and sacred by the signification of a secret mystery. By tripling the number three, it becomes nine, and by multiplying four by four, it becomes sixteen. Nine times sixteen equals 144, in which number the completeness of the virginal examination is mystically suggested, ensuring that when such a copious multitude is mentioned, there is no doubt about the other members of the Church.
And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters or great thunder. The voice I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. They sang a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they remained virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes.

Some believe this passage refers not only to virgins in faith and body but also to those who temperately use legitimate marriage, acknowledging the examples of prophets and patriarchs who pleased God with utmost holiness. Such exemplary men would not be considered separate from the company of virgins.
However, with careful attention, one sees in the divine distribution of gifts a clear difference in merits within the Church of Christ, in profession, order, and vow. This particularly highlights the dignity of those in marriages who are proven to have no offense in entering them and have gained great merits by using them solely for propagating offspring, as the prophetic intention of such marriages anticipated Christ's coming.
Setting aside their other virtues, which we know from Scripture, no one should think that virginal honor, marital chastity, or widowed continence can be equated. This is proven by many divine Scripture oracles and is especially declared in this passage. Saint Augustine, eager to explain it, did so in his book on holy Virginity, which I have translated to show that virgins hold an honorable place above others. Beyond the righteousness of faith, by which the entire Church is a virgin, they have vowed themselves to Christ, preserving even the integrity of the flesh.
He says: Let marriages have their good, not because they procreate children, but because they procreate honestly, lawfully, chastely, and socially, and because they equally and diligently raise those procreated; because they keep faith with each other in marriage; because they do not violate the sacrament of marriage. Yet all these are human duties.

The purity of virginity and devout self-control, abstaining from all sexual relations, is a divine gift. In our corruptible flesh, it represents a meditation on perpetual incorruption. Let all physical fertility yield to this; let married chastity yield. The former is not within our power, and the latter is not eternal. Physical fertility lacks free will, and married chastity does not attain heaven. Those who embody something of the non-flesh in the flesh will have a greater reward in that common immortality.
And after a little while:
Therefore, he says, First Corinthians 7, I have no command from the Lord to preach about virgins. This teaches the preacher to focus on eternal salvation; the one who announces this is indicated by the announcement. Hence the psalm, Psalm 104: He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire.
It follows: Fear God rather, and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come. Although we have known from the beginning of the Christian faith that the kingdom of heaven is near, here he urgently announces that the hour of his judgment is now approaching. Therefore, this kind of preaching must be presented to all, just as the Lord says in Matthew 24: This Gospel will be preached in all the world, and then the end will come. To indicate the time when the final persecution will press, he added, as if to say that the temporal power of the beast is to be disregarded, and the Lord is to be feared more than men, whom his mentioned creature confesses forever.
And worship him, he says, who made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of waters. Another, a second angel, followed him saying: Fallen, fallen is that great Babylon which made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Babylon is interpreted as confusion. It signifies the city and people of the devil, and all the corruption of vices, which he always exercises to his own ruin and that of the human race.

This text, which is said to have already collapsed, uses the past tense to describe the future, as is often done in Scripture when a prophecy is certain to be fulfilled. For example:
"They divided my garments among them" (Psalm 22), and similar instances. This is because the proud are already known to fall when they dare to be proud.
Hence the Psalm (Psalm 73):
"You cast them down when they were exalted," meaning they were certainly cast down when they were lifted up.
According to its custom, Scripture says, "All nations have fallen by the wine of her fornication," referring to the desired city, composed and gathered from all nations, itself drinking from the wine of fornication. For all nations, intoxicated by errors, this is the city, yet it divides it in its own way.
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice:
"If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand, they will also drink the wine of God's wrath, poured out full strength into the cup of His wrath."
About the beast and its image, enough has already been said, but because certain heretics abandon us due to their false beliefs, while others deviate from our traditions due to their wickedness, showing themselves to perish through hostile evil, here briefly, the inscription of the beast added to those living is included on the forehead or hand.
The cup of wrath should not be understood here solely as that which the Lord says (John chapter 3):
"The wrath of God remains on him," indicating original sin; but also that which He said speaking to the stubborn Jews (John chapter 8):
"You will die in your sins," indicating the consequences of damnable actions.
And they will be punished with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever. In the presence of the Lamb, it says, whose judgment they will endure, whom they proudly despised, and whose followers they unjustly sought to dominate, indeed, His angels, who know by God's revelation that they suffer just punishments.

They will have no rest day or night, whoever worships the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.
From the dead and the living still of this type of narrative, he has built up the whole body of the beast.
For what is already said to be tormented in the dead, this is still worshipped by the living.
But those who worship the beast and its image, that is, the devil, either in that slain head or in the whole body, will have no rest day or night.
This is the wisdom of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
Hence the Lord in Matthew 10: "He who endures to the end will be saved," and the Apostle in Hebrews 10: "You need endurance."
Thus, here it is said that the patience of the saints consists in persevering to the end, fleeing the beast's association and the mark of its name.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord."
They are said to die in the Lord, who, commendable in faith and life, have deserved to be called away.
Hence it follows: From now on, says the Spirit, they will rest from their labors.
Just as he said that the impious would have no rest day or night, so now he says that the faithful have deserved rest from their good works.
For it was necessary to mention the deeds of the wicked, but also to proclaim the happiness and fullness of the good:
which, because it consists in the leaders and the people, he briefly includes both here, saying indefinitely first: "Blessed are those who die in the Lord"; for those who labor in the vineyard, he says in Matthew 20, "They will rest from their labors," thus promising happiness to everyone, as he assures a special reward of rest after labor to those working in the vineyard.
Hence the Apostle.
"We ask you," he says in First Thessalonians 5, "to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work."
Or even about himself in First Corinthians 15: "I worked harder than all of them," for their works, he says, accompany them.
About these, the prophet says in Psalm 112:6:

89): And guide the work of our hands over us.
And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on it was one like the Son of Man, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
The cloud represents the incarnation of our head, Jesus Christ, or the body of the Church, which Christ clothes, showing it purified after the fires of persecution, crowned with a golden crown. These are the elders with golden crowns or the twelve apostles, whom he primarily acquired at the beginning of preaching the faith.
Hence, we read in Psalm 20: "You have placed on his head a crown of precious stone."
The sharp sickle, furthermore, represents the judicial sentence deserved by the wicked, to be justly imposed upon them by divine judgment for the sake of the Church, which Pastor Christ always watches over.
Hence Zechariah says, "This is," he says in Zechariah 5, "the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land."
And another angel came, calling out to the one sitting on the cloud: "Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe."
We know from the Lord's explanation in Matthew 13 that the reapers of the earth are angels, and the end of the age is marked by the judgment of a ripe harvest: in this harvest, because both the fragile stalks and chaff, and the grains of wheat, are known to be present, we recognize it more fittingly signifies the just ends of the good and the wicked when he says the sickle is to be applied to the ripe harvests.
To whom else should this be primarily intimated but to the Church?
Then the one sitting on the cloud put in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. At the time of the final judgment, after spiritually battling with the beast, the Church will be able to recognize with greater illumination whom she should firmly consider her own, and whom as alien. This is indeed to sit on the cloud, as having received judicial power divinely, to discern between the good and the wicked.
"You will sit," says the Lord in Matthew 19, "with me on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
But what follows about the other angels seems entirely to hold the Lord's judgment, saying in Matthew...

Thirteen: The reapers are angels. Just as the threshing floor is for the harvest, the winepress is for pressing grapes. This allows for the time to burn the chaff and discard the grape skins, so that the hidden dwellings of heavenly habitation may follow to store the fruits.
And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, also holding a sharp sickle. Similarly, another angel, who had power over fire. The one with the reaping sickle also has the grape-harvesting sickle; and the one who said to the reaper, "Reap," also said to the grape-harvester, "Harvest." For it is one act and will happen at the same time.
But in both the harvest and the grape harvest, just as in the cultivation and building of the Church, the breadth of the divine word is shown, as the Apostle says in First Corinthians chapter 3: "You are God's field, God's building."
And he sent into the great winepress of God's wrath, and it was trodden outside the city, with blood flowing from it up to the horse bridles for 1,600 stadia. By saying "God's wrath," he placed judgment here for God's wrath, which he says was inflicted on the proud, whom he also calls great. He says, "You humbled the proud as one wounded," using "winepress" in the feminine gender and "great" in the masculine, as the Greek manuscripts contain.
Outside the city, meaning outside the Church, with the future departure made, the treading will be of all sinful men. This winepress or threshing floor encompasses the useless things and proves the incorruptible as vessels of fire, and the righteous by the trial of tribulation, as mentioned in Ecclesiasticus chapter 27.
The blood flowing up to the horse bridles signifies retribution reaching the leaders of the people. When the devil and his accomplices begin to suffer the penalties of the persecution they inflicted, the blood of the saints that was shed is said to reach up to them and their leaders. These leaders, represented by horses, wage wars in the person of heretics, along with all the errors that follow them. As previously preached, "In blood you have sinned, and blood will pursue you for 1,600 stadia," that is, through the four parts of the whole world.

Fourfold unity is made up of four parts, just like the four-faced figures and wheels.
Four times four hundred thousand equals one million six hundred thousand.

Chapter Fifteen

I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels with the seven last plagues. Order was restored as he wanted to recount the same plagues of the final persecution, capturing the listener's attention by saying: A great and marvelous sign. We understand that the Church is represented by the seven angels because, in them, God's indignation is completed.
Then I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire. This refers to the water of baptism, consecrated by the fire of the Holy Spirit, or in relation to the quality of fire marked by martyrdom. As it is written: The furnace tests the potter's vessels, and tribulation tests righteous men. I saw those standing by who had been victorious over the beast and its image, standing firm, showing steadfastness in faith.
The psalm describes them in almost the same words, saying: He who made the heavens with understanding, clearly designating spiritual beings who enjoy the clear understanding of heavenly truth, and adds: He who founded the earth upon the waters, surely immovable over baptism. Although they seem to be nourished with milk, they are not carried about by every wind of doctrine.
Here, they are said to triumph over the beast and its image, holding the harps of God. Their hearts are dedicated to praise and harmonious with the truth of both Testaments, or the flesh stretched on the wood of the passion, where not only the sound of the voice is marked but also the effect of good work. Therefore, he mentioned the great man Moses, as God testified by saying: My servant Moses, who is faithful in all My house.
They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb. Here, he more fully expressed the intention of the chosen ones, who say from the heart: Remove from me the way of iniquity, Lord, and have mercy on me through Your law; or, For Your law, I have waited for You, Lord, and similar things, indicating that they also are part of the number of the faithful, participants in the aforementioned victory.

In Moses, the old covenant, and in the song of the Lamb, the new covenant is signified, showing that the fullness of the chosen ones, armed from both, exists perfectly in both. They say: Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, King of all nations.
The pages of both Testaments attest to this with consistent truth, for all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth Psalm 25. He is more fittingly called the King of all nations here, because God is no longer known only in Judea, nor does the dew from heaven seem to fall only on the fleece Judges 6, but as Malachi says in Chapter 1: From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place, a pure offering is sacrificed and offered to my name.
It follows here: Who will not fear and glorify your name? For you alone are holy; all nations will come and worship before you, for your just judgments have been revealed. These things are explained abundantly, as they are now seen to be fulfilled in action.
After this, I saw, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened. Here it says that the hidden secrets of testimonies about Christ and the Church are now revealed. And seven angels with seven plagues came out of the temple. From the Church, against which the opposing side has continually rebelled with insidious attacks, it says that the plagues proceed, either for the defense of the saints, in whom earlier the Lord Christ endured insults, as it is said to Paul Acts 9: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
Or, as Peter recalls in First Peter Chapter 4, it is time for judgment to begin with the house of God. It is certain that people are scourged in two ways: either to justly punish sins, as in Pharaoh Exodus 14, or to test greater virtue, as in Job Job 1. And it is not without reason that we read this from him Psalm 119: The Lord tested me like gold that passes through fire; I have kept his ways and not departed from the commands of his lips.

However, I think the number of angels or plagues symbolizes total completion, much like it often says in Leviticus: "And I will strike you with seven plagues."
They were dressed in clean and bright linen. Linen usually symbolizes mortification. So, even in its whiteness, the blameless judgments of God are evident. It's fitting to think of clean linen, as those who are mortified use this whiteness to gaze upon the glory of God's judgments with an unveiled face.
Second Corinthians 3.
And they were girded around their chests with golden belts. Scripture teaches us, as it says in Proverbs 16, according to the Septuagint: "Take wisdom like gold." It is fitting around the chest, where the priestly breast is often commanded by law to carry the breastplate, representing judgment, so that a mind well aware of divine things would not dare to criticize but praise the judgments. By the radiance of that gold, others are encouraged to praise as well.
One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven bowls, full of the wrath of the living God who lives forever and ever.
Earlier, he mentions seven angels with as many bowls, holding the prayers of the saints. But now, he says they are full of the wrath of God. Indeed, the same bowls are said to contain both the sweet fragrance of supplications and the wrath of punishments, when they are poured out by the saints for the coming of God's kingdom. God's judgments are no longer hidden like the abyss but open like bowls, bringing salvation to the righteous and destruction to the wicked.
Psalm 36, as the Apostle says:
Second Corinthians 2: "For we are the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing: to the one, we are an aroma of death leading to death, and to the other an aroma of life leading to life." For if it is said of our Lord:
Luke 2: "Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many," what wonder is it if the bowls bring sweetness to the righteous but vengeance of plagues to the wicked? Should we understand them here and not elsewhere?
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory and power of God.

The smoke signifies that not everyone can understand the mysteries of God's judgments. People's minds, troubled by plagues, are confused and fearful. The smoke in the temple lasts until the end of the vials. It follows, "And no one could enter the temple," meaning the hidden sanctuary, "until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished." Psalm seventy-two says: "This is my labor before me, until I enter the sanctuary of God, and understand the end." Smoke often signifies confession. Just as smoke precedes fire, the flame of faith and charity is preceded by the confession of sins. Psalm one hundred four says: "He looks at the earth and makes it tremble, he touches the mountains, and they smoke." The Lord looked at Peter, as mentioned in Matthew, chapter twenty-six, and with the tears of confession, Peter washed away his fear-driven denial. This means: "No one could enter the temple, until the seven plagues were finished," implying that no one could say: "I walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of your house," as in Psalm one hundred, and, "The king brought me into his chambers," from Song of Solomon, chapter one, unless they had confessed all past sins. Psalm seventy-five states, "The thought of man will confess to you." Smoke and remnants of thought will celebrate the solemnities as a secure praise of obtained justification. Therefore, until all the plagues are finished, the Church is shown in lamentable confession and in those who bear the fruitful penalties of prior offenses, and in those who are proven by a better devotion.

Chapter Sixteen

And I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath.
The inevitable outcome of this divine command is revealed, showing the power the Church has earned by divine authority: the power to pass judgment on the condemned and mercifully grant absolution to the repentant.
The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and a terrible and harmful sore afflicted all who have the mark of the beast and who worship its image.
This deadly sore is so potent that even a small affected part of the body can bring about death, more so than the remaining healthy parts can preserve life.
While the preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ brings salvation to believers, it stands as a testimony of condemnation for unbelievers. The entire body of the lost can be seen as having received this terrible sore from this plague.
We read about Christ in Luke chapter two: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against."
The Jewish people, from whom it is said the Antichrist will be born, lost any righteousness they might have had from the law because they refused to accept Christ who was promised to them, leading to their irreparable demise.
In their perspective, the elder brother says to the father in Luke chapter fifteen: "Look, all these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends."
The people who spurned the Lamb, preferring a goat on the left, as if rejecting the righteous for the lambs on the right, are to be condemned on the left, despising Christ and accepting the Antichrist.
Therefore, perhaps it says here: "A terrible and harmful sore afflicted the people who have the mark of the beast and who worship its image," indicating that, confused by this grievous sore, they are judged to be punished with eternal torment.

Regarding this sin, as if it were the worst ulcer, the Lord says in the Gospel of John, chapter 15:
"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin.
But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father."
This is an incurable wound. However, because many will follow them in their evil ways, he mentioned at the end, regarding those who bear the mark of the beast, to make it clear he wasn't speaking only about the Jewish nation.
Just as in goodness, by imitating the faith, the nations too are called the children of Abraham by the law-not by being born of his flesh, but by confessing Christ, who rose from the dead as a victor from the tribe of Judah-
So in evil, it is believed that Jews from the nations will have followers who, by accepting and following the Antichrist, said to be born from the tribe of Dan (Genesis, chapter 49), will be marked as accomplices in their crime and share in the punishment of eternal damnation.
And the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood, and every living soul in the sea died.
Water turning into blood can be understood as perceiving spiritual matters carnally. In the first of the plagues, as read in the book of Exodus, chapter 7, inflicted on the Egyptians, we recognize these events as symbolic.
Back then, sweet waters were turned into blood, whether the rivers of Egypt or rainwaters, as some translations indicate, saying: "And their rainwaters into blood," which the Greeks also rendered as ebremata.
But now, the question arises because the second bowl is said to be poured into the sea, that is, into bitter and salty waters. And it became, he says, blood, and every living soul in the sea died.
From this, I think those are indicated, who among the Jewish people not only endeavored to understand the spiritual law carnally, but also could not recognize Christ in it.
For if they had known, says the Apostle in First Corinthians.

If they had understood this, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. But they were so overwhelmed by the weight of their sins, as if struck by a second, even worse wound, that they desired the image of the beast and, bearing its name, believed the Antichrist should be worshipped instead of Christ. This is perhaps why it is placed here in the second bowl, because in Exodus (Chapter 7), it is described as happening in the first plague, where the waters turned to blood, killing every living thing in the sea, that is, in this world, just as it is written: "There is no one who does good, not even one" (Psalm 14). Clearly, they are marked by barrenness, as it is said: "I looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes" (Isaiah 5). These are the ones who spoke with such weakened tongues, condemning themselves: "His blood be on us and on our children" (Matthew 27). And the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. It refers to the other nations in general, who, being led astray by natural error and involved in filthy desires, also start to think carnally about divine matters, which can be understood as the teachings of the Gentiles. That is why it says: "They became blood," just as in Genesis: "My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh" (Genesis 6). Also, in the Book of Wisdom, it says: "They were troubled by foul blood in their rebuke"; and because to set the mind on the flesh is death, as the Apostle says (Romans 8), and the mind set on the flesh is hostile to God. Therefore, regarding such people, who are said to offend with these sins and again fall into grievous crimes: "I heard," it says, "the voice of angels praising God." And I heard the angel of the waters say: "Just are you, who are and who were."

The angel of the waters, a messenger of the people, brings an inner effect to those resonating with divine praises. You who are righteous, because you have judged this way-those who shed the blood of saints and prophets-you have given them blood to drink, because they are worthy.
Both Jews and Gentiles physically shed the blood of the saints, which the Lord remembers to avenge, from the blood of righteous Abel, as mentioned in Matthew 23, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah. This plague of blindness can be understood as those who misused their senses and diverted them elsewhere. It's as if to say, those who understood the spiritual law carnally are justly handed over to the corruption of the flesh and blood, where both sin and punishment of sins are known.
Hence, the Apostle says in Second Thessalonians 2, because they did not receive the love of the truth to be saved, God will send them the operation of error, so that they believe a lie, and all who did not believe the truth but consented to iniquity may be judged.
And I heard another voice saying: Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments. Here, too, is something similar to what is often said in the Psalms-Psalms 40, 71, 88, and 105-"Let it be, let it be." However, we should say this by imitating it, not by delaying to explain the open meaning.
And the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to him to scorch people with fire. People were scorched by the great heat and blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues. It was not solidified, but to the angel who poured out on the sun. However, this fire should not be thought of as the fire of hell, nor is any place left for blaspheming there, when the time comes for the damned for their fruitless repentance. They will say, as the law reminds: "What did pride profit us? And what did the boasting of riches bring us?" (Wisdom 5).
Therefore, I think the fire and heat here should be understood as the body of the devil being irreparably tormented by the stability of the saints, compelling them to blaspheme, driven by that heat.

Perhaps it is said above the sun, the sun of justice, as if placed in the ablative case. Just as:
I will watch over my word to perform it
Daniel says: Let us seek mercy from the face of Almighty God concerning this secret, so that from where the chosen receive the firmness of enlightenment, the wicked may be said to take fire.
They did not repent to give Him glory. The very death of the blasphemers is that they prefer to accuse God of wickedness rather than themselves of impiety. Even after the plagues, they do not repent; instead, they heap insults while being scourged. Just as bronze vessels subjected to a great fire, bubbling from the inside, boil over and exceed their capacity, so does the part of the beast resisting in vastness. When they see the Church of Christ fighting with tireless constancy, inflamed with the torches of unbearable envy, they exhale the fire conceived in their hearts with impure mouths in blasphemies.
We read of this fire: Zeal seized an unlearned people and now fire will consume the adversaries.
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened, and they gnawed their tongues in pain.
The throne of the beast, or his kingdom, is said to be darkened as if judicial power is obscured. Darkened by the joy of eternal happiness, while they praise the present good as supreme happiness and hold the truth in unrighteousness, they gnaw their tongues.
This sense is echoed by the psalm, saying: Their mouth spoke vanity, and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity,
and They spoke iniquity on high.
Elevated by momentary prosperity like smoke, from where they ought to have turned back in repentance, they rejoice in darkness.
For, as Job says, they spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they will go down to hell.

And the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the king coming from the East, that is, Christ, about whom we read:
"Behold the man whose name is the East, for whom the way is prepared to come to judge."
By the name of the river Euphrates, just as with the sea, rivers, springs of water, the sun, and the throne of the beast, upon which the angels are said to have poured their bowls, impure people are designated.
And its water was dried up, meaning that nothing of the former people will remain that does not fit with the fire of the approaching judgment. As earlier it says, the harvest has withered and the vintage has come, so here it metaphorically says the water of the river was dried up, with nothing green remaining, but everything to be examined by the divine fire of judgment, by which either the wicked will be consumed like hay, or the saints will be approved like gold.
And I saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits coming out like frogs.
Although for various passions of vexations and vices of all kinds, different qualities of evil spirits are said to exist, and not without reason (for in the Gospel elsewhere it says: Deaf and mute spirit; elsewhere it says unclean spirit; elsewhere the prophet says: The spirit of fornication has destroyed them, for no other reason than that they are driven to commit the filthiness of sins), yet here he calls all three unclean because he designated one body of the devil made up of familiar distinctions, recalling that greater power he holds, introducing the dragon as the devil, the beast as the Antichrist with the teachers of his doctrines.
Therefore, he saw one spirit and, because of the number of parts of one body, he says three, so that the entire number of the lost would be shown to be driven by one evil spirit.
Perhaps for this reason, comparing their audacity to the horrible filthiness of frogs, he added:
"For these false prophets, like frogs, are damned to croak noisily in the night of error."

Frogs are considered loathsome both in place and sight, with their annoying croak, just as the devil and his followers are seen as abominable to the truth and deservedly condemned to eternal and just fire.
The blessed Apostle speaks plainly in Second Corinthians 6:14: "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols?"
So, when it is said that an unclean spirit comes out of their mouths like frogs, it means: How can you compare dirt to heaven? Frogs suit horrendous false prophets just as dirt suits them. He asserts that teachers of truth are as different from frogs as holy people are, so that even those who cannot discern their frauds, struck by the horror of frogs, strive to avoid such people who, like frogs, prevent the ignorant from perceiving the truth with calm devotion.
For they are the spirits of demons, performing signs. Just as Pharaoh's magicians in Exodus 7 are believed to perform signs, they are also permitted to perform signs up to the sign of the frogs with their enchantments. They go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for battle: not gathering everyone to one place, but intending each nation in its place to fight under their superstitions.
On that great day of God Almighty. The Day of the Lord is understood in different ways. Sometimes it means the whole time from the passion of the Lord until those who are to be condemned in the final judgment are gathered, as if prepared. Sometimes it means the day of judgment; sometimes it means the time of persecution. Thus, it is clear that such people are gathered throughout the entire time of this present life.

He will come suddenly, like a thief. Hence the Apostle, First Thessalonians 5, says, "like a thief in the night, so he will come." Blessed is he who watches and keeps his clothes so that he does not walk naked and expose his shame. Whoever, he says in Galatians 3, has been baptized into Christ has put on Christ. I believe these are the spotless clothes being commended here to be kept, so they are neither torn by a second baptism nor stained by the spots of the wicked. In both cases, the shame of the transgressors is revealed, which the watchful one avoids more diligently.
He gathered them to a place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon. In another summary, he interpreted the place, saying in Revelation 20, "He gathered them for battle, whose number is like the sand of the sea." The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, "It is done: It is finished." There were flashes of lightning, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great signs.
Summarizing the same persecution, he recalls an incomparable upheaval, in which he says there are miracles and preachings. But whether on the part of the good contradicting falsehood, or on the part of the wicked, those signs he mentions persist to exercise the good and harden the wicked. Or whether signs from both sides call to each other alternately, it is not clear here as it was done by Moses and the magicians of Pharaoh in Exodus 7. If any of these things are so, even the signs, like the earthquake, are to be foreseen, with the coming doubt shining incomparably more.
That great city was divided into three parts. The great city, because of the multitude of people and the pride carried by excessive daring, will be divided into three parts: one of heathens, another of heretics and Jews, and a third which is rejected among false brothers, who profess to know God but deny him by their deeds because they are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work, as stated in Titus 1. It follows: And the cities of the nations fell.

That is all the strength and confidence of the Gentiles, and that great Babylon remembered in the sight of God has come. It signifies the confused multitude of all the condemned. To give, it says, her the wine of the wrath of His anger. The retribution of due vengeance is prescribed to be given to the wicked.
And all the islands fled, and all the mountains were not found. By the names of the islands and mountains, the knowledge of the Church is symbolized because of their eminence of stability, to which it is said through Isaiah:
Isaiah Chapter 24: "In teachings glorify the Lord, in the islands of the sea the name of the Lord God of Israel."
And also in Isaiah Chapter 2: "And in the last days, the mountain of the house of the Lord will be prepared on the tops of the mountains."
This flight occurs when the society of the wicked is finally driven away, so the confused mixture of the Church with the wicked is no longer found. Hence, the Prophet Jeremiah says in Chapter 51:
"Flee from the midst of Babylon, and save each one his own life."
But then Babylon falls, when it has finally received the power to persecute the saints. Therefore, before the ruin, the heart will be exalted, and before the glory, the spirit will be humbled.
And huge hailstones, each weighing a talent, came down from heaven upon people, and people blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague of the hail was very great. He places the wrath of vengeance in the hail, of which we read elsewhere:
"The wrath of the Lord descends like hail."
The Lord promises to protect His own from this, saying through the Apostle in First Thessalonians Chapter 1:
"Who rescued us from the coming wrath."
It is not without reason that a talent's weight is mentioned, except that by the fairness of divine judgment, each sin is inflicted with its diverse punishments. For a talent is measured by one weight among the Greeks, and by another among the Romans. Some sins are different, some scourges are different, and some are both, which is too long to discuss now. Here, blaspheming the Lord because of the hail is recognized both as the sin and as the plague of sin, by which the wicked are so cut down that they do not repent, but rather, maddened by the scourges, become worse.
Finally, Isaiah says:
"Lord, You were angry, and we sinned."

Chapter Seventeen

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters."
Isaiah also depicts something similar about the devil, predicting his downfall through the figurative person of the Babylonian prince. Isaiah chapter fourteen, verse twelve: "How you have fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"
The Holy Spirit, considering the collective of all the lost, gives them various but fitting names. He sees them advancing in arrogance, corrupted by sins, and led astray by errors, raging with such impiety that they even oppose the meek.
He describes her appropriately as a prostitute because she has abandoned the Creator and prostituted herself to demons. She is called great due to the enormity of her transgressions, through which she has long insulted the saints. "On many waters" means among many peoples with whom she has committed fornication, seeking earthly kingdoms arrogantly. Thus, he divides her among kings and earthly people, indicating that she arises from them.
From the wine of her fornication: the prelude to vices signifies corruption. Just as wine exalts the mind, the lust of vices blinds the staggering.
"And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness." The wilderness represents the absence of Divinity, whose presence is paradise. In the Spirit, because these things can only be discerned by the Spirit.
"And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast." The divine word adorns her as a woman, from whom sin began, and because of whom, as it is written in Sirach chapter twenty-five, verse twenty-four, we all die.
She is said to sit on the beast, symbolizing her pride and presumption. The scarlet beast is bloodthirsty, representing a body contrary to the Lamb. This beast can be understood as the devil, the head as if slain, or his people, which is entirely Babylon, meaning confusion.

So, scarlet with wickedness, and drunk with corruption as if with blood, full of names of blasphemy-since it is worse to commit blasphemy by deeds than to be called a blasphemer. Here, it says she is full of names, so it is clear she lacks no excesses.
Because it is one thing to sin against God and another to sin directly against Him, the one who blasphemes is more guilty of sinning against God.
Having seven heads and ten horns. In the last persecution, as foretold by the prophecy of the holy Daniel (Daniel) (Daniel chapter seven), ten kings will come. These are often represented in this book by the seven heads and ten horns of the beast. It is said that crowns are upon them because, with all other kingdoms destroyed, they alone can rule the whole world. The crowns of conquered kingdoms are like trophies displayed on proud heads.
The seven heads are also seven mountains, as wisdom suggests, signifying Rome, which sits on seven hills and once ruled the entire world. This is brought up to show the similarity to the kingdom of these ten kings, and in the name of Rome, it represents the power of the whole kingdom.
The number seven is used to show the universality of this domination, as it is made from three and four-that is, from odd and even numbers-suggesting completeness. As already mentioned, the seven churches were a good symbol, with the one Church of Christ predicted to possess the world. Now, this same number appears in the seven heads of these kings, indicating the universal power they will have.
Holy Scripture often uses the number seven both in good and evil contexts. For the Holy Spirit is believed to have sevenfold operations, as testified by the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah) (Isaiah chapter eleven). Likewise, an evil spirit is often depicted as sevenfold.

The monarchy and the kingdom of Christ's Church often stand in opposition. This opposition not only openly oppresses the faithful but also tries to deceive them with a false appearance of truth.
This open power is represented by ten horns, and its deceptive nature by seven heads. A fierce persecution is predicted, where deception is backed by power; what lacks in deceit is compensated by force.
He previously mentioned this deceit, saying: "One of the seven heads appeared as if it had been mortally wounded, but its mortal wound was healed." This means that from the entire secular power against the Church, one head, the Antichrist, seeks to be accepted in place of Christ. He claims to have come back to life, misleading those who are unaware away from Christ, who truly died and rose again.
He also mentioned earlier that the dragon, the devil, gave him his power, throne, and great authority. Therefore, it is full of names of blasphemy. There is no worse blasphemy than for someone opposed to Christ, as the name Antichrist suggests, to want to be seen as Christ. Those who he cannot break through terror, he tries to seduce with a semblance of truth. Those who avoid open error, he leads into seemingly plausible falsehood.
The Lord warned about this in the Gospel, saying in Matthew twelve and Luke eleven: "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest but finds none. Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first."
Was he not speaking earlier of one unclean spirit? Why did he mention seven others more evil unless it is recognized as a sevenfold unclean spirit, making it seven times worse even with hidden evils? To make this clearer, the reader should pay close attention.

The good spirit embodies wisdom, opposed by the evil spirit of foolishness; even worse is the pretense of wisdom.
The good spirit is the spirit of understanding, but the evil spirit is that of stupidity; even worse is the pretense of discipline.
The good spirit is the spirit of counsel, but the evil spirit is that of imprudence; even worse is the pretense of prudence.
The good spirit is the spirit of fortitude, opposed by the evil spirit of laziness; even worse is weakness disguised as virtue.
The good spirit is the spirit of knowledge, opposed by the evil spirit of ignorance, and worse still is the misuse of knowledge.
The good spirit is the spirit of piety, but the evil spirit is that of impiety; even worse is the false appearance of piety.
The good spirit is the spirit of the fear of God, opposed by the spirit of recklessness; even worse is the deceit of fake religion.
Therefore, to show the pretense of the opposing side, he wanted to linger here a little longer, so that this explanation may benefit our understanding of many passages.
The Apostle also foretells this all-encompassing persecution in power or deceit, saying in Second Thessalonians 2: "Then the wicked one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the brightness of his coming, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deception of wickedness, in those who perish, the power of strength signifies the deceit of lies."
Clothed in purple and scarlet. In purple, the juice of pretended governance; in scarlet, the bloody appearance of impiety is shown, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls, that is, with all the allurements of supposed truth, which we have sufficiently expressed before in those wicked spirits.
Finally, he explains what lies within this beauty, saying: "And she had a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurities of the fornication of the whole earth. Gold, therefore, is hypocrisy, because, as the Lord says: Outwardly they appear righteous to men, but inwardly they are full of all impurity."

And on her forehead a name was written: The Mystery: Babylon, the mother of fornications and abominations of the whole earth.
So that the superstition of error would not openly deceive those unaware of the truth, let them be aware of the title on her forehead.
And I saw that woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus Christ.
Appropriately, the generosity of the divine word showed her as raging within.
And I was amazed when I saw her with great wonder.
And the angel said to me: Why are you amazed? I will tell you the mystery of this woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has seven heads and ten horns.
The beast you saw was, and is not, but will ascend from the abyss, and will go into destruction.
From the beginning of the world, the rise and progress of two cities have been taught in the sacred scriptures until now: one of God, the other of the devil, symbolized by this beast as the entire body of all evil.
And therefore it says, it was, and is not; because it is built up by the order of generations that pass and succeed each other.
Therefore it follows: And it will ascend from the abyss, and go into destruction.
For it is carried out by divine judgment, hidden indeed, but just.
Hence the psalm (Psalm 36): Your judgments are a great deep.
Or because it is about to come forth from the hearts of the wicked. Therefore the psalm (Psalm 42): Deep calls to deep.
And all who live on the earth will marvel, those whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain, from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and will come.
It indicates the same ones from whose members the damned body is built, but if the names cause ambiguity.
For in his letter he says in the singular number, Just as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come.
And a little later, They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.

Therefore, their names are not written in the book of life. Those who live at the end of the world, experiencing their own damnation, will realize too late that it wasn't Christ they thought of, having been deceived by the veiled seduction of the beast. But they will understand that it is our Christ, whom they will justly face as their judge, rightfully condemning them.
It continues:
From the foundation of the world.
As the Lord knows who are His, to whom He also promised to say:
Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Matthew 2:5;
so also, those who are not His are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, known from afar and preordained for the punishment of eternal fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels.
For the Lord is exalted and looks upon the lowly, and from afar, He knows the proud.
Psalm 13:8
Hence He says:
Matthew 7:
I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity.
Seeing the beast that was and is not.
And here is the meaning, for those who have wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, and they are also seven kings.
We have frequently said in another way that the genus is shown in each species.
For what is the entire beast but the seven heads.
Thus, he says the heads are both seven mountains and seven kings, that is, the entirety of the wicked part which exists in rulers as in kings and in subjects.
Hence, it is called by various names, because of the diversity of actions, which oppress with force and deceive with fraud, when they creep into unstable minds through the pleasures of sensible things:
as we read in Scripture
Jeremiah 9:
Death has entered through your windows, which I think should be specifically referred to the five-part sense, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, from which the Lord says to the Samaritan woman:
John 4:
For you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband.
What is referred to as husbands there, here we understand as kings, whose ruling we recognize as governing and administering the beginnings of human life, which seem to be shared with the beast.

And now, the one you have is not your husband, indicating she was using him wrongly.
He has already said: Five have fallen, one remains.
But he says, another has not yet come, indicating that the remaining part of the same evil body will succeed to the next generation, to be possessed by the same evil spirit, which we previously stated has seven forms.
The five that have fallen, the one that remains, and the one that is yet to come make seven, and when he comes, he must remain for a short time.
And the beast that was and is not, is also the eighth, but belongs to the seven, and goes to destruction.
The one he calls the eighth, he clarifies as being of the same kind by saying: He belongs to the seven and will go to destruction, to show he is of the same evil kind, and to indicate the exceeding wickedness in hypocrisy by surpassing the number seven.
Just as in the previously mentioned testimony of the Lord, speaking of one unclean spirit, mentioning seven, he suddenly added, saying (Luke 11): He takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself.
So now, starting from seven, he wanted to indicate seven others of the same kind in one, that is, the eighth.
Therefore he says: He belongs to the seven and will go to destruction, bringing the same punishment of the same kind. It is rightly said he belongs to the seven, who is also placed as the eighth, and he added, and goes to destruction.
At the final judgment, he says all wickedness will be ended.
And he says how: And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom.
He indicates the whole kingdom of the world, which, as described a little earlier, in kings and subjects, but they receive authority for one hour with the beast.
Here, the hour is taken to mean a time period, taught by example and meaning, from the Passion of the Lord, from which the apostolic voice cries out: It is the last hour.

So, for as long as what is to come will last, it is said that they have not yet received the kingdom. Although he currently rules over many, his insane power to boast will be sharper when he deceives many with signs as well.
They will all have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. What was said earlier about being with the beast is now made clearer: they will give their power to the beast, specifically to that head which seemed to be slain but came back to life. With unanimous consent, they will offer all their worship and servitude to it.
They will fight against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is the Lord of lords and King of kings. When describing the power of the opposing side, it was more fitting here to proclaim the victory of the Lamb, who, showing His triumph in His followers, added: And those who were with Him were called, chosen, and faithful.
He rightly mentioned the chosen first, because the Lord says in Matthew 20: "Many are called, but few are chosen."
And he said to me: The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes of the wicked, and languages. It is often taught here that waters symbolize peoples. The ten horns you saw and the beast will hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked.
As if to say, the corruptions of carnal desires which they now love like her will turn to hatred for them when they recognize towards the end that they are doomed to inevitable judgment and see the clear victory of the Lamb. Then the beast will be divided into parts.
This can be understood in two ways: either because, as we read in Proverbs 13, "Among the proud there are always quarrels"; or because everyone who loves iniquity hates his own soul, as mentioned in Psalms 10.
For who will be good to someone who is bad to himself, as stated in Ecclesiastes 14? They will devour her flesh and burn her with fire.
As if the angel, speaking from the perspective of the Church, said, those harmful ones who rise against me to eat my flesh, as mentioned in Psalms.

They will consume their own flesh and burn with fire after provoking God to anger with their excesses, desolating the world.
As the angel succeeds them due to their blasphemies, it is said they do what naturally happens to them.
For God has placed it in their hearts to fulfill what pleases Him, to be in agreement and fear, and to hand over the kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.
As the Apostle says in Romans Chapter 1, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what should not be done.
It is also now said: For the Lord has placed it in their hearts to do what pleases Him.
For it pleases God to administer justice, by which we know He inflicts vengeance on the wicked.
So those who handed over their kingdom to the beast will justly pay the penalty with her until the words of God are accomplished, which consist of judgment and mercy.
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, as stated in Psalm Chapter 24.
The woman you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.
She is the same one who, due to the corruptions of flesh and blood, flourished with worldly power.
Since she consists of these kings, she is said to rule over them, dividing herself as usual, from genus to species, into the woman, the city, and the kings.
Over her, the words of the Lord will be fulfilled, both mercifully redeeming His own and justly condemning the disobedient.
As the mention of completion is made, let this book fittingly conclude.
