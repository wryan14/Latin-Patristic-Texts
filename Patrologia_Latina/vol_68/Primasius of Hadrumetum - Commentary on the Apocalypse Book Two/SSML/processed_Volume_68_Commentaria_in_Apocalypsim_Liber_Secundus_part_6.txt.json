In coelo,\nid est in Ecclesia silentium semihorae, initium ostendit\nquietis aeternae et partem silentii vidit, quia eadem\nadhuc visurus erat. Quod septimo signo non\n quantum futurum sit vidit, ut apertius ei multa ostenderentur. Et interruptum est silentium, quod si\nesset juge, hic narrandi finis fuisset. Verum adhuc\nfuerat iterandum, idcirco series narrationis ordiendae\nconvenienter post silentium pariter meum, sequenti\nlibro resumptum, sortietur exordium.",
