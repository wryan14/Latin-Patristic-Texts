Privilege of the Monastery of Saint Germanus, Bishop of Paris

To the apostolic lords, holy and in Christ brothers, all bishops of the city of Paris with the grace of God in the future, and enriched by heavenly visitation, Germanus the sinner.
It is well known to everyone what kind of person and how great was the most glorious King Childebert of illustrious memory regarding monasteries and churches, or towards men who fear God. His utmost goodwill has granted many generous benefits and perpetual stability to our immunity. Namely, thinking that those who would preserve these temporal things would reap much greater rewards from God, if he would found churches and temples, support the poverty of the needy, offer small things for great things, and gain heavenly things for earthly ones.
Hence, for the merit of his burial, he commanded some things to be considered by us and surrendered what was considered. Thus, this illustrious prince built a basilica in Paris in honor of the holy cross and Lord Vincent, along with other saints together, and placed his burial there, and decreed through the page of his testament that we should have the abundance of his generosity, and designated the merit of having it to such an order.
But while the page of his testament and the faith of his heart thrived temporarily under human frailty, due to the cunning of some, so that eternal blessedness would not be granted to him, and the written document would not take effect, and the appointed abbot and congregation would not receive it, and they would perish in scarcity of food and clothing, his memory advised me, and such security terrified me out of love for him, along with the affection of piety and charity; for he was our immunity and security, peace and recovery, and separation from all civil business, after God, while he was alive.

Considering his piety in this matter and our efforts to uphold the will of the other kings, we want your brotherly love to align with ours. This ensures the honor of that holy place and the memory of the aforementioned glorious prince will shine there for all times. The church should have an abbot from its own congregation who, under the governance of kings, will provide for that place through successive generations.
Let any bishop of Paris be excluded from that place, so he has no power over anything pertaining to it. We also decree that no metropolitan or any of his suffragans may presume to enter for any ordination unless called by the abbot to celebrate the mystery of sanctity, consecrate churches, or institute the blessings of clerics or monks, which he should not refuse.
Furthermore, whatever has been assigned or donated from today, both from my time and from all my successors residing in the see of Paris, or from God-fearing princes of that people—in estates, villages, fields, gold, or silver—I want, ask, and implore that it may be fully possessed.
I also decree through this charter of immunity and concession that my aforementioned basilica remain free from the obligation of deeds. Since this was not customary before, and now granted to me by kings and princes, I did not want to omit your pious will in this document. I ask that it be strengthened and confirmed by you in all respects, so it may remain valid henceforth.

If anyone ever tries to oppose this decision of mine, which I have decreed for the sake of stability with the advice and persuasion of the metropolitan and other bishops, or if they seek to contradict it, let them be excommunicated by all the bishops and priests of God, both now and in the future, and be estranged from peace.
At the future judgment, with the saints and friends of God, in whose honor this writing has been made, let them feel my judgment and that of my lords, the metropolitans and the present bishops, upon them, and let them be accursed, maranatha.
Furthermore, to give this document greater authority, I wished to strengthen it with the writings of the provincial lords, bishops, and my brothers, the priests and deacons.
Done in the city of Paris, on the twelfth day before the Kalends of September, in the fifth year of King Charibert.

To the lordly apostolic men, holy and in Christ brothers, all the bishops of the city of Paris, with the grace of God for the future, and enriched by heavenly visitation, I, Germanus the sinner.
It is well-known how noble and great was the glorious King Childebert of illustrious memory, regarding monasteries and churches, or towards men fearing God, whose highest benevolence granted many abundant benefits, and established perpetual stability for our immunity.
He believed that by saving these earthly things to be harvested, much greater things would be attributed to him by God, if he would fund churches and temples for the sake of Him, sustain the poverty of the needy, offer small things for great ones, and acquire heavenly things for earthly ones.
Hence, he also commanded us to consider some things for his burial merit and ceded what was considered.
Therefore, this illustrious prince built a basilica in Paris in honor of the Holy Cross and Lord Vincent, along with other saints in one place, and placed his burial there. He decreed that we should have the abundance of his largesse through the page of his testament, and established the merit of having such a place for his order.
But while the page of his testament and the faith of his heart flourished temporarily under human frailty, some acted deceitfully, preventing eternal happiness from being granted to him, and the writing from taking effect. Consequently, the appointed abbot and congregation did not receive, and perished in the barrenness of sustenance and clothing.
His memory warned me, and such security terrified me for love of him, and at the same time the affection of piety and charity; for he, after God, while he remained, was our immunity and security, peace and recovery, and seclusion from all civil business.

Out of respect for his piety and to honor the wishes of other kings, we ask for your brotherly love to be in agreement with us.
We want the honor of that holy place and the memory of the glorious prince to shine brightly there for all time.
The church should have an abbot from its own congregation, who, under the governance of kings, will care for that place through successive generations.
No bishop of Paris should have authority over that place, and no metropolitan or any of his suffragans should enter for any ordination unless specifically invited by the abbot to celebrate a holy ceremony, consecrate churches, or institute blessings for clerics or monks, which they must not refuse.
Furthermore, whatever has been allocated or donated from this day onward, during my time and the time of my successors as bishops of Paris, or from God-fearing princes, in terms of estates, villages, lands, gold, or silver, I wish, ask, and implore that it be fully retained.
I have also decided through this charter of immunity and cession that my basilica should remain free from any obligations.
Since this was not customary before but has now been granted by kings and princes, I wanted to include your pious will in this document and request that it be strengthened and confirmed by you in all respects, so that it may remain valid henceforth.

If anyone opposes this decision of mine, which I've resolved to write down for the sake of stability, with the advice and persuasion of the metropolitan and other bishops—or if anyone tries to refute it at any time—let them be excommunicated by all the bishops and priests of God, both present and future, from the thresholds of the holy churches, and let them be excluded from peace.
At the future judgment, with the saints and friends of God, in whose honor this writing has been made, let them feel the judgment of myself and my lords, the metropolitans and bishops present, upon them, and let them be anathema maranatha.
Moreover, to ensure this document achieves complete firmness, I wished to strengthen it with the writings of the bishops of my province and my brothers, the priests, and deacons. Done in the city of Paris, on the 21st of August, in the 5th year of King Charibert.
Germanus, a sinner, read and signed this document of cession and immunity made by me on the aforesaid day. Nicetius, Bishop of Lyon, in the name of Christ, at the request of the apostolic lord and my brother, Bishop Germanus, and Lady Queen Ulthrogothe, and Lady Chrodesinta and Chroberga, read and strengthened this constitution, to be kept by the successors of Lord Germanus, the bishop, from this present time forever, with my handwritten subscription on the noted day.
