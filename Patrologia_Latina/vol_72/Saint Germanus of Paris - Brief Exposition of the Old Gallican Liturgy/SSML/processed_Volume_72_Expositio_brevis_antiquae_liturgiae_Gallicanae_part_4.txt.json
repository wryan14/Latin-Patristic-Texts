Just as the hand of the Lord came upon the prophets, so that they would leave remnants of the earth in the condemned; so, as the clerics chant, the priest proceeds in the likeness of Christ from the sanctuary as if from heaven into the ark of the Lord, which is the Church, to both admonish and encourage the people to cultivate good works and extinguish evil ones.\n  </p>\n</speak>",
