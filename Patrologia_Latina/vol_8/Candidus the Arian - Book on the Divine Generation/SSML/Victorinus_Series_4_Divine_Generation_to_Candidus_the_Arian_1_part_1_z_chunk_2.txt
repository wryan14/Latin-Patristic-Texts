    <s>Who has bewitched your great understanding, noble Candidus?</s> 
    <s>To speak about God is beyond human daring.</s> 
    <s>But since a moral intelligence is placed in our soul, and a spirit sent from above to form the eternal impressions of understandings inscribed in our soul:</s> 
    <s>it moves unspeakable matters to the unsearchable mysteries of God's will and operations, as if an exaltation of our soul's mind.</s> 
    <s>For it wants to see, even now situated in such a body, what is difficult to understand alone, but impossible to declare.</s> 
  </p>

    <s>For the blessed Paul says:</s> 
    <s>"Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out" <break time="500ms"/> (Romans 11:33)!</s>
    <s>Isaiah also says:</s>

    <s>You see, therefore, how valuable knowledge of God is.</s>

  <p>
    <s>But since you write so boldly about the divine generation:</s> 
    <s>we will show you first from the scriptures the eternal generation of the Son of the Lord Jesus Christ.</s> 
    <s>Do you consider the scriptures we read to be vain?</s> 
    <s>If someone is a Christian not only in name but also in reality, they must honor the scriptures, calling upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Hear another thing from us.</s> 
    <s>We say that God is our Father, and very much so.</s> 
    <s>For what reason, and in what way?</s> 
    <s>Because, I say, He predestined us in love to adoption through Christ <break time="500ms"/> (Ephesians 1:5).</s> 
    <s>Does God also have Christ as a son by adoption?</s> 
    <s>No one has dared to say that: perhaps not even you.</s> 
    <s>Do you see what kind of blasphemy would arise from this statement?</s> 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>We say that we are heirs of God the Father, and heirs through Christ, being sons by adoption:</s> 
    <s>and that Christ is the true Son, through whom it is made possible for us to be sons and co-heirs with Him in Christ.</s> 
    <s>You have said many things about Christ that are true and as they are:</s> 
    <s>for He is the power of God, and almighty, and the entire Word, and all operation, and all life and many other things.</s> 
    <s>Has He achieved such goods, being made from things that are not?</s> 
    <s>And is He blessed, who is not from what truly is?</s> 
    <s>Whoever conceives such an understanding is without God, sacrilegious, and full of blasphemy.</s>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>The Lord Himself is above all things that are, and all things that are not.</s> 
    <s>And therefore, since He, as you say, was made from things that are not, could He Himself make all things that are from things that are not?</s> 
    <s>However, we believe God to be what is and always is, not what once was not.</s> 
    <s>He therefore provides what is, and provides through ineffable generation, and provides existence, intelligence, life:</s> 
    <s>not that He is these things, but above these and always all things.</s> 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>If, therefore, God is not what is not, but is above what is, truly being, His power of being, which is excited in generation by operation, begot the being with an ineffable motion, in every way perfect, from the whole of power, whole.</s>
    <s>Therefore, God is the whole procession:</s> 
    <s>but Jesus is this whole being, now in existence and life and intelligence, in every way a universal perfect being.</s> 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <s>This is the end, this is the beginning, this is the Son, this is the whole Word, this is He who is with God and in God the Word, this is Jesus Christ, before all things that are, and that truly are; the first and all existence, the first and all intelligence, the first and in every way perfect.</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    First Being, the name before all names; for from it come all names, as will be explained.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      But I want to hear, my dearest Candidus, what you think is that which is not.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if God is the cause of all things, both of what exists and of what does not exist, then God is the cause.
    </s>
    <s>
      But if He is the cause, He is not what does not exist.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the cause is as being: indeed, it is from and through what will be.
    </s>
    <s>
      And thus, it is the cause truly above being.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, what is not yet being, that is, what is not; for this, being is the cause.
    </s>
    <s>
For this reason, it is called "overflowing": and according to this logic, God is the cause both of things that are and things that are not.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, we must define what is not: which is understood and called in four ways.
    </s>
    <s>
      According to the complete and total negation, as the privation of existence.
    </s>
    <s>
      According to the nature of one thing compared to another, as this is not that.
    </s>
    <s>
      According to not yet being, which is to come and can be.
    </s>
    <s>
      According to what is above all that is, having existence; for it is not any of these things, nor does it agree with any of them.
    </s>
    <s>
      So what do we call God? Being, or not being?  
    </s>
    <s>
      But certainly, we call Him BEING; for He is the father of what exists.
    </s>
    <s>
      But the father of what exists is not BEING, if what He is the father of does not yet exist.
    </s>
    <s>
      This cannot be said, it is blasphemous to think, to call the cause of what exists, non-being.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the cause is prior to those things of which it is the cause.
    </s>
    <s>
Therefore, God is the supreme being; and as supreme, God is called non-being: not by the privation of all that is, but as another being itself, which is non-being: according to what is to come, the NON-BEING: according to being the cause of the generation of what exists, the BEING.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, it is true to say that God is the father of BEING, according to the cause of what exists and what does not exist.
    </s>
    <s>
      By the will of God, both what exists and what does not exist come into being.
    </s>
    <s>
      And you should not think that what does not exist is by the privation of what exists.
    </s>
    <s>
      For none of these things neither exist nor are understood.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if the world and all heavenly things subsist, everything also exists.
    </s>
    <s>
      There is no μὴ ὄν, according to privation: but there is a certain subintelligence, understanding the privation of things from what exists, not subsisting, not even that subintelligence itself, nor existing as those things that are.
    </s>
    <s>
      But some things that do not exist, in a way, exist, like those that are now: which after generation both exist and are called, and before generation were either in their potential or in their idea.
    </s>
    <s>
      But from where or from what were they generated?
    </s>
    <s>
      According to those ways indeed; according to the nature of one thing compared to another, and according to what is not yet, what will be, and can be.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore, God is first and above what exists and above what does not exist: as the generator and father of them, according to the cause.
    </s>
    <s>
      Then, according to the generation from God or according to the creation, what exists appeared.
    </s>
    <s>
      And what does not exist also appeared.
    </s>
    <s>
      Some things that exist, truly exist, others exist, some do not truly not exist, others do not exist.
    </s>
    <s>
      But those that truly do not exist, the fullness of God does not receive into being.
    </s>
    <s>
      For according to what being is, and what is somehow being, is the fullness of God.
    </s>
    <s>
      For fullness is in the only manifestation existing in the understanding of those things that truly do not exist: which according to subjection, from those that do not truly exist.
    </s>
    <s>
      Yet somehow the mind, beginning all things, imagined around what truly does not exist.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Listen to how I say this.
    </s>
    <s>
      There are certain things manifest by nature, like those that exist and all heavenly things: such as the spirit, the mind, the soul, thought, education, virtue, reason, opinion, perfection, purpose, life, intelligence: and even higher, existentiality, vitality, intellect: and even above all these, being alone: and this which is one alone being.
    </s>
    <s>
      In this, if our mind rightly enters, it comprehends these things and is formed by them: and understanding stands, no longer existing in the confusion of inquiry.
    </s>
    <s>
      But since such understanding is from another, a certain comprehension and definition is produced.
    </s>
    <s>
      Other beings, we understand only to be beings: because in that whatever is of this kind, is of another and different.
    </s>
  </p>


    <p>
        Therefore, what is truly intelligible are those things that truly exist. Other things that merely exist are intellectual. These are all the things in the nature of intellectual souls, not yet having understanding. They exist but are suited for understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        For when the mind is awakened in the soul, it illuminates and enlightens the intellectual power of the soul, giving it form and understanding. Intelligence and perfection are born in the soul. Therefore, the soul is called substance, because every substance is a subject. A subject is something that underlies another. The soul underlies the mind, and the existence of the soul underlies the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the soul is substance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, all things that belong to the soul exist only as being, not as truly existing. The soul comprehends what truly exists. If the mind enters the intellectual soul, it also comprehends truly existing beings. The soul understands because it is a soul. Thus, from those things that truly exist, intelligence is made of what exists. Other things that do not truly exist and that do not exist derive intelligence from these by the conversion of the intelligence of being.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-being is not understood as non-being but is understood in relation to being. Therefore, non-being is taken as a kind of eradication of being. Eradication, however, is a kind of unformed thing and is not like being. For every being is formed and shaped in existence or quality. Unformed, however, is something. Therefore, non-being is in some way something. Non-beings exist, and therefore those that are not truly also exist. They are more inclined to being than those that are non-beings. For this reason, there is a natural order of being among beings.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have spoken of what exists and what truly exists. Now let us speak of what truly does not exist and what does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the essence and power of God are both intelligible and intellectual, all things that exist appeared through intelligence. Intelligence operates in two ways: by its own intellectual power and by the limitation of understanding, also through sense. Sense, being an image of the intellect and a limit of understanding, if it perfectly perceives the operation of intelligence which strengthens it in acting and doing, becomes close and near to pure intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        This comprehends the heavenly things, those in the ether, those in nature, and those generated and regenerated in matter. These, whose power is in sensory intelligence, are in some way being and not being. For heaven, and all in it, and the entire world consisting of matter and form, are in mixture. Therefore, it is not simply. The parts of this world, participating in the power and nature of the intellectual soul, are in the nature of those things that are not truly not. They use intelligence, but according to sensory intelligence, and they are reversible and changeable according to sense. According to intelligence, they are irreversible and unchangeable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sense apprehends only qualities; the substance, that is, the subject, it neither perceives nor apprehends. Qualities are reversible; substance is irreversible. Although the soul is substance, it is nevertheless reversible. How is this? Understand it thus.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the soul accepts and understands the things in the world, if it understands those things that are animals and animated, in that it has a soul, those things are not truly not. In some way, they are non-beings, according to their having a soul. In some way, they are non-beings according to their having reversible matter and qualities. These are what we have called non-being truly non-being.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we understand matter under the soul (I say matter in the soul, whatever is without an intellectual soul, with a broad sense) it comprehends around qualities as non-beings. Qualities are reversible, and in this way, non-beings. The subject itself, which is called matter, is indeterminate, and therefore it is said to be without quality.
    </p>


  <p>
    When it is determined, it is called quality and not material. But the primary qualities are in the primary bodies: fire, air, water, and earth. These exist by themselves, without mixing or uniting with anything else. For if these are qualities, and these are material, then qualities are material. It does not happen to material as an accident; it is quality itself. It cannot be quality by itself, but because of what it is; this itself is material.
  </p>
  <p>
    And as long as it is material, it is nothing but material. Just like the soul, insofar as it is intellectual, it is the soul; and insofar as it always moves and moves itself, not according to duplication nor according to accident, this is the soul. But these qualities are the substance of the soul. Thus, material itself is quality, and material itself is substance. But the soul differs from material. Some say that the soul is material, that the subject and quality are the same substance, and that the substance is both the soul and material. But they differ, as I said, because the intellectual soul understands itself, but material, although it is intelligent, has neither understanding nor any sense in any sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    And therefore, the soul is what exists: when it is alone and pure, it is among those that exist. But mixed with material, it is among those that are not truly existent. But material alone is the nurse of all that is not. The soul and material together are the nurse of all, but the soul, by its own virtue, is the nurse of all and the generator of life, while material without the soul, having become barren and dense, remains forever, having animation from the soul. So these are, and are called, non-existent. Thus, it is with those things that are not.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have four categories: those that truly exist, those that exist, those that are not truly non-existent, and those that are non-existent. By the conversion and combination of these names, two more modes are implied: those that are not truly existent, and those that are truly non-existent. But those that are not truly existent signify only those that exist: for only those that are not truly existent are. But those that are truly non-existent have no place to exist. For it is wrong and impossible, in a universe full of God, for things that truly do not exist to be said to exist and to be. These differ only in understanding, as we have declared, not from those that do not exist, but from those that exist according to the privation that arises in the soul, neither existing in their own substance nor in understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let us go on to see what God is and where He is. Are the things that are truly first and more honorable in themselves God? But even these have a cause, and their giver and father is God. Nor is it to be said that He is these things to which He gave existence. For since He is one and only, He wanted them to be like Him; and not Himself to be like them: but He wanted that which is one to be many.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps you will say, O Candidus, that this is my discourse: and according to this reasoning, I say that the Son of God was born from those things that are not, according to choice, not according to generation. But what are those non-existent things that we said to be? Are they those that do not exist at all? But it is already agreed that they are not: it is also agreed that those that do not exist are said in four modes: of which two are according to nothing at all, and according to above all; the others are according to the nature of another, and according to what is not yet; and yet it has the potential to be, and not yet action to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    What then is God, if He is neither one, nor those that truly exist, nor those that exist, nor those that are not truly non-existent, nor those that are non-existent? For God provides as a cause to all these. But it is wrong to suspect that God is among those that truly do not exist. For we necessarily say that God, by preeminence and eminence, is above all existence, above all life, above all knowledge, above all being, and being of all beings: indeed unintelligible, infinite, invisible, without intellect, insubstantial, unknowable: and while above all, yet nothing of those that exist. And since He is above those that exist, He is nothing of these that exist. Therefore, God is non-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what is this non-being that is above being? Which is understood not as being, nor as non-being at all: but as understandable in ignorance, because it is being.
  </p>


  <p>
    Since it does not exist; because by its own power alone, it brought forth and generated being into manifestation. And there is a reason for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what about God who is above being, who produced beings from what He is, as He is? Or from another? Or from nothing? From another? But from whom? For nothing existed before God. Nor from another like God, for nothing is equal to Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    From nothing? But how? If He produced being, it is true to say that He generated being from Himself who is above being rather than from nothing. For that which is above being is first a hidden being. The manifestation of the hidden being is generation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since power, being, generates being through operation: for nothing is without cause in generation. And if God is the cause of all things, He is also the cause of being in generation: since being above being, He is closer to being, and like its father and generator. For indeed, the pregnant one hides what she will give birth to. For the fetus is not non-existent before birth, but it is hidden: and through generation, it reaches manifestation as being through operation, which was being in potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, to speak the truth, being through the operation of being, indeed generates outwardly through operation. But what does it generate? What was inside. But what was inside God? Nothing else but being; truly being: but more so the pre-existing, which is above all being; a type, I say, which is being above beings, being already operating in potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is Jesus Christ. For He Himself said: If they ask, Who sent you? say, the One who is. <break time="500ms"/> (Exodus 3:14) For only that being is always being, the One who is.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, the Son Jesus Christ, being the only born Son: because that pre-existing generated nothing else but being before all things and in every way perfect being; which cannot exist with another, and because what is in every way perfect needs no other. The universal being, and the only being, and one and above the general type of being, is one and the only being.
  </p>
  <p>
    But because that being is not the being that has perfect power, it was generated by power, being before all things that truly are, and the ancient beings from which all things are. He is, I say, from whom are all things that are, and through whom, and in whom. For this reason, being through operation is the image of that being, which is power, remaining always in itself according to no progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    What next? We say Jesus is the first being, before all things being, through whom all things are. For this is the name above every name: for the beginning of names is being, and the beginning of substances, as I have frequently declared in many ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, we say Jesus Christ is naturally being around God, and more so in the beginning was the Word, and we say this Word is God. Then there are three by John, which we confess to be eternal: and we say it to be so. For it is said that in the beginning was the Word, and as you say, there is no beginning that precedes another beginning: for the beginning without a beginning is indeed called the beginning. Therefore, He who was in the beginning, is from eternity, whether in God or around God. <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:1)
  </p>
  <p>
    For the Word was around God, and in the beginning. Therefore, He always was. If He always was, it is necessary that He exists, not with those things that are not, nor was He made.
  </p>
  <p>
    John says: No one has ever seen God. <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:18) Again: The only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:18)
  </p>
  <p>
    We have, therefore, the same things, that Jesus Christ is being, that He is the Word, that He was in the beginning, that He was around God, that He was and is in the bosom. Do not all these things clearly and plainly signify that He is the Son of God to whom these things are attributed, being and being before all things?
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Father is God, before He is being, is He accepted as the power of that which is being? That which is being sprung from His power in His Father; receiving manifestation, which had been hidden: and this is the divine and ineffable generation. Therefore, the doctrine must be eradicated, that Jesus is from things that are not, or has come from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us look again at another thing. Jesus is the Word. What then is the Word? I say; because it is a certain active paternal power, and which is immovable, and which itself...

  <p>
    <s>The psalm asserts that it is in action, not in potential.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So, if that is the case, why was the Word with God?</s>
    <s>It was necessarily with Him so that through the Word all things would be generated, and without Him nothing would be made.</s>
    <s>Therefore, God works through the Word, and the Word always works.</s>
    <s>It is an active, unmoved power, which always operates and causes what was potential to become actual.</s>
    <s>This is what we say existed in the beginning.</s>
    <s>Being in the beginning does not mean being born.</s>
    <s>And truly, for this reason, God is the Word because He was in the beginning like God and was with God.</s>
    <s>The Word is not born since God Himself is the Word, but the Word is at rest and silent, so that you understand the necessity of knowing that the Word was not born much more than that it came from things that are not.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>What about our knowledge then?</s>
    <s>How is it carried?</s>
    <s>How does it move around the Word?</s>
    <s>It does not see the Word as if it is for something else or belongs to someone else according to what it is.</s>
    <s>It is to establish something else, and in no other way.</s>
    <s>Therefore, the Father and the generator of all is the Word, through whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.</s>
    <s>But the power of the Word itself, the power of establishing and making something else, should not be understood and heard as in the cause of all things.</s>
    <s>For He Himself is constituted even of the Word itself.</s>
    <s>If indeed He is the first cause, He is not only the cause of all others but also the cause of Himself.</s>
    <s>Therefore, God is from Himself, and God is.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But since being itself, which is to move and understand, this is to act; the first is power; and constitutive power, I say, is first.</s>
    <s>Therefore, being itself necessarily precedes.</s>
    <s>Therefore, understanding, moving, and acting are from that which is being.</s>
    <s>However, according to what is, it is in action: this is to be the son; and this more so than being the father; being is to act and to work.</s>
    <s>For there, being is not different from working.</s>
    <s>That one is simple, and one and the same always.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in the father is the son, and in the son is the father.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>How then did it come to be?</s>
    <s>How are the son and the father, if they are together?</s>
    <s>And not only are both together, but one and the same and simple.</s>
    <s>But this should not be questioned; it is enough to believe.</s>
    <s>Let us say, therefore, when permissible.</s>
    <s>The first is evident; because the Word is neither different nor from someone else, but with God.</s>
    <s>For the Gospel says: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God" (John 1:1).</s>
    <s>And again it says: "The only begotten son who is in the bosom of the father" (John 1:18).</s>
    <s>How do you take or understand these words?</s>
    <s>The Romans say "towards God," as if inwardly, or deeply inward, that is, in the existence of God: and this is true.</s>
    <s>For in that which is being, there is also working.</s>

                According to Aquila, it is the same as this: In the beginning, God made, as the Hebrews pronounce Moses' saying: either in the beginning, or in the main point, God made it in Christ. Therefore, Christ is both the beginning and the main point.

And this is said frequently: He created everything in Christ. For the Word is Christ as the seed of all things. Therefore, Christ is first, for He was before every creature.

But how is it consubstantial, with substance not yet existing? The names, indeed, are from those things which are later, and from those which are after God, both invented and assumed. And because it is not possible to find a name worthy of God, we name God from the things we know, understanding that we do not name or call Him properly: just as we say, God lives, God understands.
            </s>
            <s>
Therefore, we name the actions of God from our own actions, while He is above all; not only existing, but as if existing, not truly existing, but existing in a small manner. In this way also we apply substance, existence, and other such things to God, and we call His essence substance differently, the created substance being different in relation to what it is, and to its own being.

                Similarly, when we say that God became Christ or man: not that He truly became, but because He is one, and is in all, and all are in Him: therefore, He is said to have become all things to all, so that they would be; not that He became to be, but that He became so to be.
            </s>
            <s>
                For it is not said that the Son of God became, but, as it says in Acts chapter 2, verse 36, that He was made Lord for us; just as Solomon says in Proverbs chapter 8, verse 22: "And He made me over your ways."

            <s>
                For it supposes immediately about the eternal and divine generation, as it says in verse 25: "Before all, the Lord begot me." And John says in John chapter 1, verses 3 and 4: "What was made, in Him was life."

            <s>
                What then? Did not God make the creature, and in the creature firstly the heavens and the earth? Therefore, He did not make Christ. Christ was born, not made. For wherever it is said made, after the first and eternal generation, it is said to be after the effect. Just as it says in Galatians chapter 4, verse 4: "made of a woman;" and in the Acts of the Apostles chapter 2, verse 36: "Therefore, let the whole house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified."

            <s>
            Therefore, concerning the generation which is the Son of God, it is clear that His substance is consubstantial, in majesty, in proper significance and understanding, understood according to the being of the existence of the substance. And so it is demonstrated, how consubstantial.

                You have, my dear Candidus, what remains to be said. If Jesus is the Son of God, by generation a son. For you say: "If generation is movement, and movement is change; it is impossible to understand that change is in God: therefore, it is necessary to say that nothing is generated by God: therefore, Jesus is not the Son of God by generation."
            </s>
            <s>
                You have indeed deduced with good order: but whom have you misled? Perhaps me? but more likely yourself. For you said that Jesus made God. What then? Is not making movement? no less than acting. For acting is making: just as making is acting. Therefore, with both in movement, it is necessary to follow change: which to establish in God, as it is declared, is incongruous.
            </s>
        </p>
    


  
    <p>
      So, it must be acknowledged that either there is no motion, or not all motion is change. But to act is motion: and God acted according to motion; who in no way can be changed, and it is absolutely incongruent for Him to receive any accident. Therefore, it remains that not all motion is change.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not all motion is change, what is more to be chosen concerning Jesus? According to generation or according to action? According to divine understanding, it is generation. For even though God simultaneously speaks and does what He does: speaking is motion, with silence pre-existing: saying from silence is change. So, if God made through the Word, the Word existed before making. If the Word existed before making, it existed according to generation before. For the mind generates the Word. Therefore, the generation of Jesus, who is the Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those knowledgeable about these matters say that Jesus is the Son in three ways: in truth, by nature, and by position. He is the Son in truth, precisely because He is substance: and He is therefore simultaneously and of the same substance, as the Father and the Word and the Son and God. He is naturally the Son in animal generation. By position, He is the Son in adoption. There are also other ways: by morals, by age, by discipline: as the Apostle Paul says in First Corinthians 4:15: "I have begotten you." The mode of truth is therefore the highest and most divine of all. But what is the manner of His generation or sonship, whether by the indicated means or others: I confess to God, by whose power this has been done.

      It has been sufficiently stated by us, I believe, in other books, from whom the progression and descent come; and the return of the promised Holy Spirit has been declared: and about the triple unity and individual trinity. Nor can I bear hearing your doctrine about the Holy Spirit, full of blasphemy: "That this Spirit is for sanctification, and who only sanctifies and teaches: and that He was made like every creature." Yet the Spirit differs in His own action from the Son, to whom He is always present: just as the Son differs in action from His Father, who is the Father by what He is. So, of these three that exist as one and the same, there is one divinity and not a divided majesty; but neither opposition nor atheism; but three in one, and one in three: and three times placed, one and the same and sole. But about these three, we have another discourse.

      Now save us, Father, forgive us our sins. And indeed, to speak of what God is, is a sin: and to say how He is, is a sin: and not to worship Him with one voice as much as possible in sobriety, but to want to declare Him. But since you have given us, Holy Lord Father, the Spirit (First Corinthians 12:11) distributing to us as He wills, give us also knowledge. For we have faith, and we say: yet we have complete ignorance about You. Nevertheless, always confessing You as God the Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord, and the Spirit in every word, who lives with You and the same Son forever. Amen.
