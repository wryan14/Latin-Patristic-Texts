    TWO PRINCIPLES OF THE MANICHAEANS, AND ON THE TRUE FLESH OF CHRIST.<break time="1s"/>
  </p>

  <p>
    <s> To speak to someone who has long held, through much reading and tireless night work, what should be confessed according to the faith of the law is redundant, Justin, but it is out of love.</s> 
    <s>Hence I preferred to reveal how much I value you, and I gladly accepted that I labored for you so that you might understand what still needs to be sought out regarding what Manichaeus, and as Andrew eloquently speaks in his acts, and revealed in the Treasury.</s> 
    <s>When I was summoned, I attentively inquired whether you truly said these things or not: that diverse and contrary things come to us from one principle.</s> 
    <s>I had to discuss this according to my wish, and I did not refuse to respond to the same.</s> 
    <s>I wish, however, brother, that this effort would be worthwhile.</s> 
    <s>Read the designated little book frequently, and by turning over what is said, penetrate or investigate the secret of deeper inquiry.</s> 
    <s>For the inner sight surpasses words, and the suspicion of the immense mind itself, even when hidden, rises and blinds, and when it is sought piously and reverently, it delights rather than terrifies.</s> 
    <s>For both men will live, when the intention of the holy mind inquires if there is one principle, and this flesh of ours, which, along with the hidden herbs and grasses you love, venerates one and the same creator of itself and the whole world, as it is to act.</s> 
    <s>But I, admiring and astonished by your stubborn counsel, that you hate the flesh and revere the grasses, do not yet know whether you confess these things from one or different sources.</s> 
    <s>If you say from one, do you see what you fall into: if from another, it is reckless to praise one creator for other things, while blaming and reproaching your own for what is in itself.</s> 
    <s>But lest I scold by saying these things rather than responding, if they have moved you, they will be said later: for now, accept what you have sought.</s>

    <s> To consider it worthwhile and permissible to inquire about things beyond us and the world, when we are almost unknown to ourselves, is mad and insane, and to be in true danger to doubt where and how, or by whom you are, when you do not dare to doubt that you exist and are with the flesh, and clearly see yourself living in the world, and to be freed by the help of your creator, when you are obedient to him: and you have confessed that there is one Savior, and that you are made by one creator, you fear to confess, dividing indeed one creator of the flesh, and another creator of the soul.</s> 
    <s>We say, therefore, imagining that both dominate the world, and guard their creation in man: insisting equally that what each perfected from their kingdoms should not perish.</s> 
    <s>The bright sun refutes these things, and chaste virginity and the glorious chorus of stars, and the whole fabric of the world rejects and casts away these things, that their origin comes from two different and unbegotten sources.</s> 
    <s>For the sense is violated by profane mists, if such great splendor of immense brightness stands with older darkness and its part.</s> 
    <s>For it happens that if the whole world was to exist from two principles, then the sun itself is from them.</s> 
    <s>Clearly, since it is not ours to hold understanding in these matters, and to remain in this wandering of sense, we flee and dread to confess that we are from him, of whom we are also victors.</s> 
    <s>Finally, I desire you to understand what it is to say that the flesh is without him from whom all things took their beginning: and that it inhabits the higher realms, where that mentioned virginity, glory, and preached light are: which, because it descended into Christ, cannot be estimated to be absent there.</s> 
    <s>For it is from there that Christ has flesh, as your reverence does not allow you to say from Mary.</s> 
    <s>Shall we then say that what God took is from another?</s> 
    <s>What was to be done by the one taking, if not the creator who made it?</s> 
    <s>And if he composed it, is it not worthy to deserve it?</s>

  <p>
    <s>Here, as I see, the inventor and creator is praised, if eternity deigned to dwell in it.</s> 
    <s>If, however, that flesh which is in Christ is another, not yet older, and God the creator is found later.</s> 
    <s>If older, why is it not in the world, and why is it in heaven, where no fleshly being exists?</s> 
    <s>And if it is not in the world which is in Christ, from where did the creature in foreign realms of external speech come?</s> 
    <s>Or from where is it joined with the soul here?</s> 
    <s>Or why is it able to capture souls so frequently for itself, that it almost appears more powerful in foreign realms?</s> 
    <s>And what does the creator of the inner man labor for?</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    <s>To free the inner self from the flesh?</s>
    <s>Or why did he admit him to be confined where he was to be freed?</s>
    <s>Surely, the whole world is the kingdom of truth and light, and its creator rules over it.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>If in this entire kingdom, there is one thing that belongs to another, which is called flesh, and this alone has such power and ability that the soul is tossed about by its impulses, fluctuating and weary, then we see how powerful the creator of the flesh is in his own kingdoms.</s>
    <s>For if we understand that this kingdom, which is the whole world, belongs to him from whom we believe the flesh is his servant; we will say that the sun, and that chorus, and the unique virgin, have shone from the hidden source.</s>
    <s>This I indeed gladly embrace, and with great joy I rejoice to profess one creator of all these things, and him whom it is right to consider as light, and truth, and the whole, recognized through the secret cause of pious inquiry penetrating with care to be venerated.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Thus, the memory of the exulting soul elevates the senses, and the origin of all the concerns of the fluctuating spirit is consoled by the better cause of reasons for celebration.</s>
    <s>Whatever ages are spoken of, or kingdoms are counted, or worlds are considered, whatever precedes all ancient things, it is one, unique, and immense, and it is concluded that it is the whole, but is called one.</s>

    <s>Otherwise, Justin, what he himself is, is different from what is from him.</s>
    <s>What he himself is, is one, and the whole is whatever he himself is: but what is from him is innumerable.</s>
    <s>And these are the things with which everything enclosed and encompassed by the one whole is filled.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But as the things from him are varied, it is fitting for him who is from himself and is one to rule over various things.</s>
    <s>And as he appears omnipotent, he should also be found the origin of opposites.</s>
    <s>And this indeed is clearly of that forest, which distinguished every tree in the matter of species, different and unlike in the kind of trees: and yet the whole forest and the distinct confusion within it, in the matter of innumerable millions of thousands of trees, is seen and observed to be wood, and yet not denoted by nature.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>These are the similarities that have been decreed, and which happened to be from another for them to exist, you and I observing recall.</s>
    <s>But those, those immense and from themselves, themselves lacking similarity, devoid of comparison, failing in example, no one will doubt: by which one is compelled to confess, and driven to it by the entrance of our intention to those hidden things of the high, reaching to the boundaries of the indefatigable, to penetrate the more sacred of secrets to be venerated of things, only as much as nature can, as far as speech suffices to say, to approach, to touch, or to attempt.</s>
    <s>And therefore, I ask what will be similar to the immense.</s>
  </p>
  <break time="500ms"/>
  <p>
    <s>Tell me, if you can, who grants faith to the comparisons, believing yourself to have attained truth through the shadows of images.</s>
    <s>But as I see, you are not failing, Justin, in matters, but the matters to you.</s>
    <s>And if, as you used to say and now say, there is another kingdom, is this other kingdom not something immense?</s>
    <s>But I do not see it fitting to be called immense, if it is not denied to another: for where it begins to be for another, there the end of the other fails, and neither is infinite.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But if it is so that it is finite, I reject or misuse it from whichever of them.</s>
    <s>However, because we are from another, and the world is not from itself, whatever its size, it is finite, if not to others, certainly to its creator: thus it is sacred to confess its infinite creator.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, all things in the world, and those that are the world itself, I observe and recognize to be from that principle which is one and alone, from itself, in itself, which is immense and extends infinitely, and proceeds so that it does not cease and fail, where it exists for another: or it cannot be considered to be another which, however, is external or divided, becomes a rival or stands as an enemy, which, being placed and remaining in its own, is conquered and receives captivity, and after war is present within the victor's kingdoms, and being transferred there ceases to exist, where it was before the war.</s>
    <s>Certainly, if it is still there, it is not yet conquered: and if it is, perhaps it will be repaired.</s>
    <s>How often will this happen? How many ages will this battle last? When will it cease?</s>
    <s>If it is already extinguished or conquered, it is not in its own: and is it anywhere?</s>
    <s>Indeed, it no longer exists and ceases.</s>
  </p>


    <p>
        Their deeds perished along with their source, and they were taken away. If they perished, they are nothing now: and the flesh that exists is not theirs, but rather belongs to the one who conquered.

        <s>Even if this is so, these trophies are not enemies, but spoils taken by the victor.</s>
        <s>You still confess today that the flesh is hostile to God.</s>

    <p>
        <s>Let what is primary be held in such order, and far back before the world began, let this suspicion gather errors.</s>
        <s>Certainly, you say that both beings, whom you remember clashed in war, have come from themselves: equal in virtue are those whose origin and eternal existence are found in themselves.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Should I dare to say that one is better than the other, and to suspect that one is greater?</s>
        <s>Do I not either run into or fall into eternal guilt by claiming that what is eternal can be surpassed, and that something which is one by itself cannot exist?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>And should I not fear to declare that something eternal will not be overcome, and that what we confess as omnipotent will not at some point assert dominion over something?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>The error of sacrilege is revealed as a blind matter and darker than all darkness.</s>
        <s>Worry drives the deluded to say that what exists by itself can be defeated, so that even the victor, who exists by himself, is troubled by fear of the captive, as if what is innate could be subjected.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Thus, the omnipotent victor expanded himself from the oppressed kingdoms, and you ask if what is innate might be eradicated or taken away.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Indeed, it will not be that what exists by itself, which follows, will not exist in the future, since succumbing to the victor's power either it will perish or be led away.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Then whom shall we say was not content with their own, so that the battle you recall arose?</s>
        <s>Light or darkness?</s>
        <s>If it was the light, it needed the darkness, and was delighted by the gloomy.</s>
        <s>Where is the omnipotence that is considered whole, if there was something in it that was not there, which was external, and belonged to other realms, and it was the truth for itself, which indeed had not yet been the dominion of the omnipotent?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>But now let us suppose that the darkness initiated the war, and let us state that the shadow of inherent brilliance conspired with its own solid beings.</s>
        <s>If that light was fire, the darkness came together to the burning, so that what was solid in them, coming from outside, would be burned in the conflict.</s>
        <s>But if they are empty and therefore not used, where, I ask, is the solid coming together with the empty?</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>To think this, and to proceed with such internal thoughts, is clearly bold and insane.</s>
        <s>To imagine a conflict between the empty and the solid, the deep and the high, the finite and the infinite, light and darkness, falsehood and truth, the small and the whole?</s>
        <s>I cannot endure, brother, to state these dissonances as arising equally, and to remember them with the same eternity and place them so that they both exist: but I attribute existence to the one who exists by itself, while I wish to assert that the other does not exist.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>For if you reject these, explain what substance the empty has, what is external to the infinite, what is older than the eternal, what is equal to the whole: so that I may understand it exists and is a thing, and I will not deny two origins of things.</s>
        <s>If some Indian or Persian speaks these things, let them instruct their own people, let them age with their own pivot.</s>
        <s>For there it is different to understand the divine, for whom it is different to use the law.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Although they are men by nature, they are separated by language, and also distinguished by reason, nor should we consider those differently, whose bodies are nourished differently, they are dressed differently, their forms are shaped differently by custom of use, they are retained differently, and many are even born with different forms, and what I speak are nations with different customs.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>Have you seen how many Manis, Zorads, or Buddhas have deceived by teaching these things?</s>
        <s>Let us be called back to seeking.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>What we are, Justin, we are from the one who is omnipotent, and who is seen to exist from himself; for whom, in what is not, it is not to be.</s>
        <s>Thus, it does not befall him to bring about a conflict.</s>
        <s>Truly, the two types, which are contrary or diverse, of good and evil, solid and empty, high and deep, true and false, light and darkness, eternal and temporal, life and death, and all opposites, are not from two principles as the order of things teaches and reveals.</s>
    </p>


    
        


    <p>
        <s>Everything is given by another to come to pass.</s>
        <s>For darkness is not continuous, not solid, not penetrating: but a void that perishes with light and has no existence when it shines.</s>
        <s>Indeed, darkness does not exist in the act of light because they do not have substance; they receive the substance of light and perish.</s>
        <s>So if darkness perishes by light, it comes to appear from the same source, in the same way that depth comes from height, and nothing from the whole.</s>
        <s>For while the whole is eternal, nothing is that which has no substance anywhere.</s>
        <s>The high exists, but its depth is: for if the high did not exist, depth could not appear.</s>
        <s>If you do not know the solid, you cannot perceive the void.</s>
        <s>Therefore, there are those things which have substance, and there are those which use another's substance: because those things which have substance come to appear to those which do not have substance, like frost or ice: which appear, but because they do not use their own substance, they come to exist by the act of cold, melt, and dissolve.</s>
        <s>And yet ice is from water, but is hardened by the cold of the air.</s>
        <s>Therefore, I see two things of water: liquid and ice.</s>
        <s>Therefore, the substance is the liquid: but what comes to it in the act, it is itself that becomes ice which freezes.</s>
        <s>But since ice itself has no substance, it perishes and is taken away, and yet the liquid water remains as substance.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>And indeed these are worldly things: which are either from the creator or from nature.</s>
        <s>But those higher things, the last and the first without beginning, which have no likeness, fail in comparison, which are not formed by the example of images, to which nothing is equal, nothing is prior: which cannot be estimated beyond, which are comprehended by this alone, that they are known as incomprehensible, they do not have an action from cause or form, and those things which are said, which this composed world has.</s>
        <s>But as they have strength, which are uncreated, which are unbegotten, which are infinite, which are the whole, so perceive or consider them to be: that there is one and only thing that is omnipotent, that holds all of the whole, that is perceived as infinite, this is and consists, standing invisible in its solid, ruling and reigning, using the admirable substance of its veneration with that divine act of its own, by which it is either moved or unmoved.</s>
        <s>Nevertheless, that very thing which is falsely grants origin as the whole: for nothing, when the whole is omnipotent, comes to pass through it so that nothing may also appear.</s>
        <s>For the omnipotent will not be the whole if nothing else besides it will be.</s>
        <s>Therefore, what is called nothing exists, but does not have substance: and what is called the whole exists and has substance.</s>
        <s>But to it, it is to be, to that it is not to be.</s>
        <s>Therefore, God is the truth, who is the whole, and consists infinite.</s>
        <s>Because, nothing can exist outside the whole, rightly that, Justin, which is understood as non-local, is considered outside the limits, it is called false: if, however, any reason can admit, that you may understand the end wherever you perceive it to be the whole, and investigate.</s>
        <s>For if the whole is occupied by the eternal, nothing has a place where it can be: and if the omnipotent is everything, nothing will be understood in that way only which is what is outside the whole, it is not something that may be held.</s>
        <s>Finally, if you measure the omnipotent in such a way, that you also have another who is not omnipotent, a greater place will be said to be of God, and larger than both: if different principles are used by their own kingdoms, and they stand as rivals.</s>
    </p>
    <p>
        <s>To understand or hold that there is something greater than the eternal omnipotent is the barbaric sense of careless confusion: and to think that what is coeternal fights, and to think that one of the eternals is conquered, is of him who says that even the light itself will not be in any age; but if you hear that, you will already understand that the sun will not be.</s>
        <s>And since it began to be, if there is a danger to it existing that it will perish, therefore the unbegotten fights, and the unbegotten is conquered by the unbegotten.</s>
        <s>Do you dare to estimate which of the unbegotten began first? and perhaps you are silent about the order alone, and you talk about them beginning equally?</s>
        <s>Can you judge greater and lesser from the eternal unbegotten?</s>
        <s>If you prefer darkness, you will give it all the beginning, and it will be greater in being.</s>
        <s>If you confess light to be older, you will admit everything from it.</s>
    </p>


  <p>
    You see that the one who is coeval cannot be conquered by either, nor will it remain for the other what one has received. And where will this Almighty or Eternal be? Will he be victorious in one of them, and in equal existence will he become a dissimilar cause? Will the war of the unbegotten be governed by outcomes, or will he accept chances? Let the soul's sense avoid this error and human hope reject confessing such insane intelligence. One unbegotten exists; from one Lord, all things originated. Indeed, the cause of its diversity is found omnipotent by all creatures, and before beginnings and endings.

    <s>If out of two eternals one will be conquered, the cut-off eternity will remain.</s> <s>Therefore, light and darkness have parallels, and within themselves differences, indeed opposites: one power agrees, but in the other it will cease sometime.</s> <s>Now it is not the same, if it is hoped for anywhere, if one of them fails first, it will be, Justin, that you admit there is one principle, if one is the victor out of two.</s> <s>Certainly, what I understand in the highest above, and in every extreme height, nothing dwells that can be called evil, which beyond the Angels and Archangels, the reverent veneration of human devotion suspects.</s> <s>It is sacrilegious to say that evil dwells in such places, or if there it has a seat, and the creator himself is perceived, ruling over all creatures, and the devil himself dominates.</s> <s>For if he is coeternal, he is there, or if he is not there, he is in some unknown kingdom of his.</s> <s>I believe the other has neither sun, nor heaven, nor world, nor light, nor truth.</s> <s>And if his kingdom is elsewhere, it has nothing in common with us: or if he is in this world, he is already defeated, already by the sun, he no longer has strength.</s> <s>If you admit this, you understand that this cannot be called the principle, which you see dominated and captured.</s> <s>Does it make sense that there are two summits, two depths, two infinites?</s> <s>Two infinites cannot be said, because where one begins, it is the end of the other: but the summit is so if beyond it nothing exists, and so the depth, if within it nothing is, and the whole is then held when nothing else is held.</s> <s>If this one and only God is the highest, infinite, and whole, and omnipotent, and all-holding, he is the one and only principle.</s>

  <p>
    <s>Do not be disturbed, do not be anxious, terrified, and stunned by the admiration of such venerable truth, because evil cannot arise from a good author.</s> <s>I rightly inquire into these things in creatures, so that what is created does not emit anything different from itself, like bitter from sweet, water from fire, infernal offspring from shadow, man from wood, flesh from the incorporeal, and other things which the whole world enumerates.</s> <s>But these cannot be attributed to the omnipotent.</s> <s>There is discipline so that there is a law for him about what can exist from him, what cannot, what is from him, what is through him.</s> <s>You rightly collect and bind these things, if omnipotent...</s>
  </p>


  <p>
    You do not acknowledge it at all. But if his power and eternity are spread throughout everything, and neither did he come into being from another, then certainly everything either comes from him, through him, or is created by him. Therefore, even evil received its existence from him. Yet this evil, which is called a demon, for other things that you might call evil have no substance or nature. The demon, however, is sometimes good, sometimes bad, consisting of an angelic creature, as the expression from Attica teaches, saying: "Good Demon" and "Bad Demon." And we will later say that he who is called bad is actually good. But the other things you call evil will not have a cause of birth if the vices of errors rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>So, do not be crushed by the impulse of evil, thinking it drives one into vices as if it were some existing substance created or made.</s> 
    <s>It is the soul, which, standing in freedom, violated the dominion granted to it by the license of free will.</s> 
    <s>It is more deceived by curiosity and desire than by pride.</s> 
    <s>Then, the lord of two substances rules over us, or rather, the twin or multifaceted nature of human kingdoms rules over countless nations.</s> 
    <s>For you are so delighted by examples that you love to perceive eternal, perpetual things through mortal and fleeting things.</s> 
    <s>You deny the flesh in Christ and confess the man:</s> 
    <s>you do not wish to believe he was born, but you do not deny he lived;</s> 
    <s>you shout that he was killed by the Jews, and you think what was wounded did not exist.</s> 
    <s>So you assert that the dead members of the condemned, right and left, were tortured, as if the destruction of Christ himself was fulfilled:</s> 
    <s>and you do not wish to believe he was a true man in the flesh, where you find a true burial.</s> 
    <s>Behold, Justin, you try to assert what truly is not, and strive to approve what neither is nor was.</s> 
    <s>But instructed by your own teacher, I speak firmly:</s> 
    <s>Was it possible for the eternal to die; was it not possible for him to have flesh?</s> 
    <s>Was it possible for him to establish what was not; was it not possible to grant the world two natures, of light and darkness?</s> 
    <s>Would the Lord, the origin of opposites, not be powerful enough, who exists from himself to be?</s> 
    <s>Cease, Justin, cease to capture the barbarism of this vanity with diligent care, and strive to remove a Roman man from the sacrilege of the Persians or Armenians.</s> 
    <s>For it is not fitting for the darkness or the authors of the devil, Mani, to dwell in the glory of the true light of the eternal life kingdoms.</s> 
    <s>And now, until now, you have weakened the members of the enemy flesh, as you say, with constant fasting, thinking that the juices of the nourished body hinder the merits and nature of the soul, swelling to the fatness of distended growths, and burdened by the mass of their own bellies, if after this labor of fasting you return to your creator, whom you say is either the devil or the outer darkness.</s> 
    <s>I think it better and clearly declare that you should confess the Almighty God to be your creator so that you may truly be a temple of God, as the Apostle Paul eloquently says: "You are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you" <break time="500ms"/> <sub alias="First Corinthians">1 Corinthians</sub> 3:16.</s>
