Paul, in all his letters, consistently testifies about Christ.

After Christ's departure, he alone saw Christ, and Christ appeared to him alone.

Therefore, the Spirit through Christ and Christ through the Holy Spirit were present.

Likewise, John and Peter testify in First John 1:1:

What we have heard, what we have seen, what we have touched.

In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke writes about David in Acts 2:30-32:

Being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of Christ:

that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

This Jesus God raised up, and of that, we all are witnesses.

In Acts 2:4:

And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues.

The Apostles speak about the sin of the world, that it did not believe in Christ, in Acts 2:22-24:

As you yourselves know, this man, delivered up by the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.

But God raised him.

Also in the Acts of the Apostles, Peter says in Acts 2:34:

David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says:

The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand.

Paul also says in Romans 8:34:

Who is at the right hand of God.

Therefore, they taught that after the resurrection he went to the Father.

He immediately added in the same place:

Who indeed intercedes for us.

Therefore if Christ intercedes, the Paraclete also does.

Likewise in Acts, it is testified in Acts 1:9-10:

While they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.

They watched him going up into heaven, and so on.

Three things have already been said about the testimony concerning Christ: about sin, about righteousness, and now about judgment.

Thus, Paul spoke to the Romans through the Holy Spirit: 

Romans Chapter Sixteen, Verse Twenty: "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet."

Similarly, he said to the Ephesians: 

Ephesians Chapter Four, Verse Eight: "When he ascended on high, he took many captives."

In Revelation, he also said: 

Revelation Chapter One, Verse Eighteen: "And I hold the keys of death and Hades."

Also in Revelation: 

Revelation Chapter Twelve, Verse Seven: "Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon."

The entire passage shows that the devil has been judged.

Therefore, it is established that these three powers—by their common and specific actions and substance, which are the same—constitute unity and divinity.

For this reason, they are referred back to the Son and the Father: for the Father is, as it were, dual, in existence and action, that is, substance and motion, but internal motion, self-generated motion, and since the substance is motion, the Son, since he is motion and self-generated motion, is of the same substance.

These are one and the same without conjunction and simple without duplication, fittingly in their own way of existence, in power and capacity: because one is never without the other, they are one and the same in action; but the one that is external falls into passions, while the other remains internal, eternal, original, and substantial, and therefore always the Father in reasoning and always the Son.

Paul in all his letters says: 

Galatians Chapter One, Verse One: "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

Also: 

John Chapter Ten, Verse Thirty: "Not from men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father."

Also in the Gospel: 

John Chapter Fourteen, Verse Nine: "I and the Father are one: I am in the Father, and the Father is in me."

We also always reverently use the terms Father and Son, and rightly according to the aforementioned reasoning: for motion, as we have taught above, is the Son, and motion itself is life and knowledge, or wisdom.

Paul certainly expressed fully what we wanted to be understood: 

First Corinthians Chapter One, Verses Four and Five: "I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge."

We said the Word is Christ, that is, life, knowledge, the Holy Spirit; therefore, they are one: "For in Christ," he says, "you have been enriched."

Thus, if God and Christ are one, and Christ and the Spirit are one, rightly the three are one in power and substance: the first two, however, are one in a different way, the Father as actual existence, that is, substantiality; the Son, however, as existential act.

The other two are thus two, in that Christ and the Holy Spirit are two in one, that is, in motion, and thus two, so that one is two: the first two are two in one, thus when in one two, and when two one, the Trinity exists as one.

Why should I recount many things about the Holy Spirit, who has been treated in detail? Through him, Christ is conceived in the flesh; through him, Christ in the flesh is sanctified in baptism; he is in Christ who is in the flesh; he is given to the Apostles by Christ who is in the flesh so that they may baptize in God, and in Christ, and in the Holy Spirit.

He whom Christ in the flesh promises to come, by a certain distance of action, is the same himself: Christ and the Holy Spirit; and because he is the Spirit, therefore he is God: because Christ is what the Spirit is, therefore God: whence the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, are not only one, but also one God.
