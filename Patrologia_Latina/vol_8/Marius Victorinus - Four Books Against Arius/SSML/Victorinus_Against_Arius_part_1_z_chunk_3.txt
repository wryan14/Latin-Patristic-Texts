    <s>Being the cause of operations, He makes the divisions of operations, and He is God according to the essence of the Spirit, being of the same substance as the action.</s>

  <p>
    <s>If Christ is the image of God, then Christ is from God.</s>
    <s>For an image is an image.</s>
    <s>The image indeed is God; therefore, Christ is the image.</s>
    <s>But an image is an image, and what is an image is principal.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>The image is secondary, and something different in essence from what is depicted.</s>
    <s>But we do not understand the image as in sensible things.</s>
    <s>Here, we do not understand the substance of the image: it is a shadow in the air or in water through a certain corporeal light of corporeal effluence by reflection, it is a figure, it is nothing in itself, nor has its own motion, being only the substance of the image, having neither body, nor sense, nor intelligence.</s>
    <s>If that in which it is formed is removed or disturbed, it is absolutely nothing and nowhere.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>Therefore, we say Christ is the image of God in another way, first being, and being by Himself; and that He is an intelligent being; and we call Him a living image, and life-giving, and the seed of all that is.</s>
    <s>For the Word by which all things were made, and without Him, nothing.</s>
    <s>But all these things are also attributed to God; therefore, God and the Word are of the same substance.</s>
    <s>And why is the Word the image of God? Because God is hidden, in potential indeed; but the Word is manifest: the action indeed; which action having all that is in potential, life, and knowledge according to motion, produces and manifests all things.</s>
    <s>For this reason, all things that are in potential, the image is action, perfecting the species of each of those in potential, and existing by itself, for from nothing no substance: every being has an inseparable species; moreover, the species itself is the substance.</s>
    <s>Not that the species is prior to being, but that the species makes being definite, that which is being species.</s>
    <s>Indeed, being is the cause of the species being in that which is being.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>And therefore, being is the Father.</s>
    <s>The species is the Son.</s>
    <s>Again, that being itself bestows the species itself being: the being of the species is the image of that which is being.</s>
    <s>This is according to cause: the first being is of the same substance, therefore being of the two, and according to being, the image is of the first being without time: the first and second I say according to cause.</s>
    <s>One is to the other as the Father and the Son.</s>
    <s>But not reversely cause, thus the Father is Father, and the Son is Son.</s>
    <s>In that which is being, both are together, and always both, of the same substance according to being, but according to potential and action, potential is the Father, action the Son.</s>
    <s>Thus, the Son is born, having in action and potentially.</s>
  </p>


    <p>To be, as it is potentially being, has its own action of being in itself, which is potentially being. However, it has, according to understanding, not as it has, but as it is.</p>
    <p>For all things there are simple. But I said according to the Gospel of John, “Whatever the Father has, the Son has the same.” According to this reasoning, the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and both are of the same substance. The Son is the image of the Father, for the being of the two is of the same substance. However, one is different from the other; one is the image, and the other is the image-bearer.</p>
    <p>Again, one is different from the other; one is unbegotten, the other is begotten. But these are timeless, for they are from the beginning and from eternity to eternity. Therefore, neither those who call Christ a mere man, nor those who say He is from nothing, nor those who say He is from some time, nor others of this kind have a place in this understanding.</p>
    <p>Let us also consider this. Moses says the word of God in Genesis, “Let us make man in our image and likeness.” God says this, let us make: He says this to a co-worker, necessarily to Christ, and He says in our image. Therefore, man is not the image of God, but according to the image, for only Jesus is the image of God, while man is according to the image, that is, the image of the image. But He says in our image. Therefore, both the Father and the Son are one image.</p>
    <p>If the Son is the image of the Father, and the Father is the image itself, then both are of the same substance. For the image is substance; it is one and simple, both being and acting there: thus they are both substance and form. But as substance is the image, the Father and the Son are of the same substance, with the Father existing as being and as acting. The Son, however, exists as acting, also as being, each having what it is, according to what is most fundamental, with being existing first, before acting. But the Father is being, and most fundamentally the Father is being itself, which also has action potentially.</p>
    <p>Again, as the younger being, the Son is acting, as the younger from being, having the Son in acting from the first being. Therefore, one is the Father as being, one is the Son as acting, both existing together in each other, as demonstrated. Therefore they are of the same substance.</p>
    <p>Let us therefore say: “Let us make man in our image and in our likeness.” What is it? And what is in our likeness? Then what is this; and in the likeness? For thus it is said, it signifies the difference between image and likeness. Although there is much question about what He said: “Let us make man in our image,” it must now be conceded that it is about the soul of man, whether about both soul and body, or about the soul alone, nothing else is understood except about the soul: for it alone is in the image of God, and in the likeness.</p>
    <p>We say that Christ is the image of God, but He is the Word. Therefore, we say the soul is in the image of God, calling it rational. For the Word is not the soul, but rational: and that all life is Christ, but the soul lives, which life has substance. Therefore, the soul is in the image of God, but Christ is of God. What then do we understand by this, in the likeness?</p>
    <p>As the Word is substance, as has been declared: for the Word is being itself, and being itself; the Word is acting, and is motion being, and as it is simple there, all this is being and acting, which is being there, which is substance. So also the soul, as it is the soul, this is being and substance; but that which moves itself is the image of substance: rather, it is itself substance according to the form of substance, and therefore in the definition of the soul when we say, what is the soul? We properly and substantially say that it moves itself.</p>
    <p>It is clear also from this, that the substantial image, rather, the substance is the soul, which moves itself. But this is rational according to the image of the Word being rational. Therefore, being according to the image is one thing, which indeed is substantial; but being according to the likeness is another thing, which is not substance, but a declarative quality in substance. But as we accept God, so also the image, that is, Christ as substance. However, we accept perfection according to the quality as significant.</p>


    <p>
        We choose. And if it means something similar, necessarily, how do we say that the soul is rational and perfectly rational according to the likeness of perfection in God? We say the soul is perfect, according to the image, thus now and in the world; but according to the likeness later through faith in God and in Jesus Christ, how it would have been if Adam had not sinned.
        <break time="500ms"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, in what it is rational, it is according to the image; in what it will be perfect, it is according to the likeness. So, it is one thing to be an image, and another to be according to the image, and even more to be according to the likeness.

        The first of Photinus, and from him, and before him, those who say that Jesus was a man and made only by man, recognize the impious blasphemy in Christ, who, being in the form of God. When was he existing? Before he came into the body: for he said, that he emptied himself and took the form of a servant: therefore he was before he became a man. And what was he like? The Word of God, the form of God.
        <break time="500ms"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        What does it mean, being equal with God? It means his very own essence and power: for he said he was equal. Indeed, equality is a declaration of both magnitude and quantity: the magnitude of the essence is the magnitude of the mass, for quality has no magnitude, nor does essence have what it is to be. But only as much as essence is, it is of magnitude. And therefore, the blessed Paul, declaring the essence of God, says all these quantities <sub alias="Ephesians">Ephesians</sub> 3:18: "That you may comprehend the height, depth, length, and breadth of God."
        <break time="500ms"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Accordingly, Christ exists equal to God. For he did not say similar to God, which does not signify essence, but another thing in essence, according to likeness by accident, just as according to likeness, man is to God, although the essence of God is different from the essence of man. From this, it is blasphemous to say that man is equal to God. Therefore, if Christ is the form of God, and form is essence, for form and image are the same: the Word is the form and image of God.
    </p>


    
        <p>The Word was always with God. The Word was of the same substance with God, with whom the Word was both in the beginning and always. Being the image and substance, and at the same time being of the same substance, which is called "of the same substance," is evident from this. For the Apostle said: He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant. Did He take only the form of a man and not the substance of a man? For He clothed Himself in flesh, was in the flesh, and suffered in the flesh, and this is the mystery, and this is what is for our salvation.</p>

        <p>Therefore, if He emptied Himself, and Christ emptied Himself, and before He was in the flesh, He was Christ. And if He existed before that, since He emptied Himself, He clothed Himself in flesh. Why did He empty Himself, if, as you say, O Marcellus, or Photinus, He took a man as if it were a fourth? It was necessary for the Word, who was to remain, to take a man and somehow inspire the spirit into actions. But He said, He emptied Himself. Correctly: He who had to clothe Himself in a man.</p>

        <p>What then does "He emptied Himself" mean? That the universal Word was not universal in being the Word, flesh, and became flesh. Therefore, He did not take a man, but became a man. Thus, the form is substance, with the substance in which the form is, of the same substance with the principal substance, and potentially prior, which grants this form to be, and to be in substance, and always to be together: for without one, the other is not. Therefore, the form from the substance, the substance is the form of the substance, this is the Son of God. The form is substance, and always the substance with the form, always the Father, always the Son with the Father, this is the Word with God, this is always.</p>

        <p>But since this form is substance, which is the image and is the Word, whom we call the Son of God, as the Word is of all things that exist, He is the Word. The universal Word is the Son of God, by whose power all things come forth and proceed into generation and consist. Therefore, His power, proceeding and existing together with the Father, makes all things and generates, and this power in that it is prior to Him, which indeed is called action, suffers if anything suffers, according to the materials and substances to which it grants their own being, the universal Word, which always is with the Father, and of the same substance, being immutable and impassible.</p>

        <p>And therefore, it is said of the Son that He is impassible and passible, but in progress, suffering, especially at the end of the progression, that is, when He was in the flesh: for those sufferings are not said, being generation from the Father, the first motion, and being the creator of all things: for those things, being substantial, are more substantial: for the words of beings are according to the power of the substance itself: therefore, they are not sufferings.</p>

        <p>But these things. And again, what do the Photinians say? If the Son is of the same substance with the Father, how did God have a Son born of a man from Mary? And what do the Arians say? If the Son is of the same substance and the Word, and the substance is together with the Father? For it is blasphemy to say this: There was a time when He was not. And this blasphemy: of those things that are not to be. And again, those who say that the Son is of the same substance with the Father are impious.</p>

        <p>For substance, according to what it is, is not different, so as to be similar to another: for it is the same in two, and it is not similar, but the same. But when it is different, it is not said to be similar because it is substance, but according to a certain quality. Therefore, it is impossible and inappropriate for something to be of the same substance. Furthermore, similarity which is in difference is either in the same substance divided into two parts, or in another: for what is receptive of being dissimilar, this is receptive of being similar: but substance, according to what it is, does not receive being similar or dissimilar: but according to what it is receptive, it is said to be similar or dissimilar by quality, with the substance remaining in its power or existence, either the same or different.</p>

        <p>But what is that substance of God or of the Word, is it receptive of dissimilarity, so that it is said to be similar? But it is impossible, and not similar, therefore, not of the same substance. Let us see this also: if similar...</p>
    


  
    There are substances in the same category, like that of a human or an animal: for a man is similar to another man, and an animal to another animal. Or substances in different categories, like a stone to a man, or a statue to a horse. So, how do they say these two are of the same essence?

    <break time="500ms"/>

    If they belong to the same category, like in animals, substance comes first: but if in the same substance, either divided or born from a higher substance; each is either subordinate, and one is subject, but divided, neither equally nor unequally, one is perfect, but two perfect, and from perfect comes perfect. Therefore, not in the same similarity, indeed and similarity: if this, then it must be in another category.

    <break time="500ms"/>

    Whence then, is it something else? Therefore from nothing: or two principles, but none of these, since there is one principle and the cause of all things that exist. The Father according to the Word, who was in the beginning, and therefore always was: therefore not from nothing. If indeed this is so, neither does it mean that another kind or similarity.

    But how does he say that Jesus did not consider himself equal to God, but that he did not consider equality to be robbery?

    But these things. And again, what does he say to the Colossians: that Jesus is before all things. For his generation is twofold: one indeed in divinity and sonship, hidden, divine, and understood by faith: the other, however, in coming into flesh, and bearing flesh. That indeed is the sole generation from God, a manifestation of power: but this is more about the reception of flesh, not generation. Therefore, if he is prior, he is not the Savior from man: if it is generation, it is not a fabrication: but if the generation is from God, it is not from nothing: if Jesus is the image of God, he is of the same essence: for an image, substance with substance, whose image it is and in whom it exists. And that the image is substance, from the substance in which it is or subsists generated, in the declaration of the inner power: hence the Father who is within, hence the Son who is outside. Again, that the Son is the Word, is a substance hastening into action, for the Word is life, and the Word is intelligence, proceeded into the substance of those things that are intelligible, and material, and therefore the action of the Word itself, because of the weakness of those perceiving it, is passible, or rather is said to be passible:

    For blessed Paul says of Christ: He has delivered us from the power of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of his love; in whom we have redemption and forgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created through him and for him, and he is before all things, and in him all things hold together: he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in all things he might be preeminent: for in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell and through him to reconcile all things to himself, making peace by the blood of his cross, whether things on earth or things in heaven.

    The whole mystery is said in this exposition, that of the same essence, is said of the one who is the image of the invisible God, that the Son is the firstborn, that he was not created before all creation; for if he himself was created, he would not say, before all creation: and properly he said the firstborn which is of the Son. Let us therefore join the meaning: firstborn before all creation. Therefore he is begotten as a son; that creation, as what is created: not that he generated another afterwards, but that before all creation he is the firstborn. But all creation is both of those in heaven, and of those on earth, visible and invisible. Therefore the Son is without creation; by nature and generation he is a son.

    Especially in the flesh, he was called the Son, because at that time he saved all beings, and then he conquered the enmities of divinity, and all death, and because he himself suffered according to motion: but the Father did not suffer according to cessation. If these things are so, this alone is lacking: how to understand "homoousion," or that the Son is "homoousion" with the Father. For this doctrine has now been awakened, and indeed long ago it was rumored that it should not be said "homoousion," but rather "homoiousion": now this doctrine has been found. They even dare to say this, that long ago, I do not say how long ago. It is enough for me that it was not given from eternity, nor from the presence of Jesus, but long ago, a hundred years ago, I concede, and more.

    Where was it hidden? Where did it sleep before eleven years ago, when in the city of Nicaea, faith was confirmed by more than 300 bishops, excluding the Arians, in which council these men were the lights of the Church of the whole world? Therefore, if the old doctrine had fled, if it did not exist, it is proven, and now it has begun. If it existed, it either fell silent in conflict, or was driven away by the judgment of knowledge and truth. Perhaps then you were a patron of the doctrine not only in life, but you were a bishop. You remained silent, and your companions and disciples, and co-teachers, and throughout all that time afterward, until the emperor was in Rome, you heard many contrary things, being a guest among those men whom you now anathematize, angry either because they wrote the faith without you. Or were you forced by the magistrates, sent as an envoy in defense of betrayal? But what difference does it make, whether thirty, or seventy, or more, and whether the same faith has often been made to destroy other heresies? Since it is one, and begins from one, and has worked until now.

    But you write these things and say that Paul of Samosata, and Marcellus, and Photinus, and now Valens and Ursacius, and others of this kind found in heresy were destroyed. Were they saying "homoousion"? No. How then were they blaspheming? Paul of Samosata like Arius: out of nothing, and that there was a time when he was not, that the Son was made, and entirely in every way unlike the Father. What about Marcellus and Photinus? They said Jesus was only a man from man, and the Trinity was outside of Jesus. And now Valens and Ursacius are the remnants of Arius. Therefore, their own blasphemy, for which they were cast out. But then you conquered them because you say "homoousion," for they did not say "homoousion," and thus they were defeated.

    Let us then also see what you say, and how you say it. Thus think the Africans, and all the Easterners. Why then do you write to them, to eject "homoousion" from the holy Church? They say this: It should not have been written to them. If it should have been written, it should also persuade them, not only by command, but by reasons and holy scriptures. For you ought not only to destroy "homoousion," but also to establish "homoousion." But now above and below in the perversion of "homoousion" you say nothing else, except that those who say this must confess that the substance preexists, and thus that the Father and the Son are expelled.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    First, it is not necessary. For God is both substance, and the cause of substance, and preexists all things that are, and all existence, and all essence. For from him are all things and those that are, and names. Therefore, from this God the beginning of substance who is, and therefore who is substance, the Son is "homoousion" in him and with him. Indeed, the form of him who is and the image and character, without which God is not understood nor does intelligence ascend. Yet not that he is not, since God is simple; and not that these are as if something else, which are in themselves, or as accidents, but that God himself is. And thus to be "homoousion" is what it is to be, and the Father is what it is to be. But as the Son is, for God is what it is to be, thus the Word is, and this signifies always what he says: "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). And: "The Father is in me, and I in the Father" (John 14:10). And: "If anyone has seen me, he has seen the Father, for we are homoousion" (John 14:9).
    <break time="500ms"/>
    What then does he say, saying: substance preexists, "homoousion" is? What if "homoousion" is, it is not necessary to understand thus that substance preexists, from which these two are substance similar?
  


    Have these things happened? According to your reasoning, you fall into the same trap that you fear in the term <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>.

    Do you alone have the right to understand <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>, with the Father giving substance to the Son? But we do not have this conception that <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme> exists, with the Father as the cause for the Son to exist, the substance being God, and you admit <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>: for you say that both the Father and the Son exist.

    Who is like whom? According to dignity and the dignity of the names, the Son to the Father? But also the Father to the Son: for all things relate to one another. If likeness means that, and we say <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιον</phoneme>, we say that the Son is like the Father. 

    And how do we understand the saying of Isaiah? For he says: Before me there was no other God, and after me, there will be none like me (Isaiah 43:10).

    What then is the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="loɡos">λόγος</phoneme>? Before God, after God, or with God? If before God, not unbegotten God nor Father God, nor the beginning of beginnings: but if after God, not <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːs">ὅμοιος</phoneme>, but another similar God. But if you call this blasphemy, not only in power, dignity, deity, but also in substance: what does it mean to be similar in substance? From that very substance, according to that very substance, it is the same, not similar: for similarity is made by quality, which is likeness in color, habit, affection, virtue, form.

    However, Jesus, that is, the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="loɡos">λόγος</phoneme>, is the image of God, not similarity. He is called the image of God, for not God is the image, but God in image and substance is God, not as two, for there is one substance, one image, hence one God, and one <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="loɡos">λόγος</phoneme>, and one Father, one Son, and these are one: one indeed and this one, not two: and therefore together, and the substance itself is what is another one, and therefore this is not another one, but rather and only one.

    But these things. And again, what do we say substance is, as the wise and the ancients have defined? What is subject, what is something, what is in another not being; and they give the difference between existence and substance, and existence indeed and existentiality pre-existing subsistence without accidents, pure and alone those things which are in it, which is solely what subsists; but substance as subject with all those which are accidents, existing separately in it, in use however receiving both existence and substance, wherever signifying in the same way to be something we use these names.

    Let it be thus, whether in eternal things or in worldly things: for it is allowed to say either existence, or substance, or what truly is substance: there is motion, and not simply motion, but the first motion, which is kind and itself status, and therefore itself substance. But these are of a longer and different question.

    Now we confess that there is substance, which has according to its proper meaning this: to be something <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="on">ὄν</phoneme>; against those who say the name of substance is not found in the holy scriptures. Not indeed is the substance perhaps not named from the substance, where indeed derived <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="epi.ousi.on">ἐπιούσιον</phoneme> than from substance (Matthew 6:11): Give us this day our daily bread? Since Jesus is life, and his body is life, but the body is bread, as it is said: Give us bread from heaven. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="epi.ousi.on">ἐπιούσιον</phoneme> signifies out of it, or in it substance, which is the bread of life.

    So again Paul in the Epistle to Titus (Titus 2:14): A people <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="peri.ousi.on">περιούσιον</phoneme>, around substance, that is around life consisting people, as it is also said in the offering: Cleanse for yourself a people around life zealous for good works around your substance coming. It seems to me the same is signified in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says (Jeremiah 23:18, according to the Septuagint): For who has stood in the substance of the Lord, and seen his word? Who has listened and heard?

    And shortly after he says (Jeremiah 23:22): And if they had stood in my substance, but they write in the substance of substance, not in non-substance. But if anyone surely understands the meaning, he finds nothing else, but this: If anyone stands in what is of God, that is in substance, which in itself <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔː.mo.ɔːˈsi.on">ὁμοούσιος</phoneme> the son, immediately sees his <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="loɡon">λόγον</phoneme>; for we must make what is further, something internal stand, the mind in substance, subs...


  <p>
    Here is the translation of the provided Latin text into modern, easy-to-understand English:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The magnitude of God, that is, in substance, and we immediately understand both God and the Logos, for they are of the same essence, and both together are one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But you see. Let us suppose we say the substance of God is that which is being, and that of Jesus which is being, being God, and piety, and confession: what then is the substance of God? If substance is spoken of in worldly terms, like an animal, like a human, it is necessary to say in eternal terms that the substance is God. But you see God Himself according to that being which we speak of, either as light, or spirit, or being itself, or the power of that which is being, or universal intelligence, or the power of universal intelligence, or universal life or action, or other such things in which it is, the source of all that truly are, or that exist.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But the scriptures say God is light, spirit: these signify substance, not an accident; to which the first thing that is being happens, if this is an accident? But to none: for it is impossible for anything to be beyond that which is being. Therefore substance, according to being, is light, and spirit, which is simple and uncompounded, which there and the same light and spirit: but the image of light and spirit, not by necessity of nature, but by the will of the greatness of the Father: for He Himself encompassed Himself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And therefore it is said, you understand yourself, but also intelligible to the Son, the Son therefore in the Father is the image, and form, and Logos, and will of the Father, according to the will of the Father, different according to the will of the Father the Son. For every will is offspring, according to universal will, the only begotten, once the Logos of all fullness sprang from the power of God: this power being the Logos begot the Logos, that is, brought it into manifestation and operation. Thus by the will of the Father, the will appeared as the Logos Son: thus the will of God is the Logos with Him who always is, and to Him the will itself is filiation: therefore the Father, whose will it is, the Son is the will, and the will itself is the Logos: therefore the Logos is the Son. For the Logos is not a mere speech, but the power to create something, conversing with those to whom it is to be according to the being, the virtue proper to each one's substance, and the form of the Logos itself, which is the knowledge of God: for through the Logos alone knowledge is effected.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Therefore it is said the Logos is toward God, and the Logos is the word, light from light, or spirit from spirit, and substance from substance, not first and second in time, but according to which cause is to the other, so that it may be power: always together, for the radiance of light is not cut off, but always in the light and being light itself, it operates all as the Logos, moving itself, and always moving, having abundance: that of the Father being almighty.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What then is the similarity here, which by counsel is to be made and generated, as you say, to the generation of the Son? The Father moves Himself, the Son generates Himself; but the power of the Father generates the Son Himself: for will is the Son, for if that will is not generating itself, neither is it will: but since it is the will of God, indeed that which is generating, is generated in God. And therefore God is the Father, will is the Son, both are one, rather even one, and only one not by combination, but by simplicity: proceeding indeed by will into active power, not departing however from its own substance and the same motion: these three are one there, substance, motion, will.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Substance is the Father, according to that same motion and will: again the Son is motion and will, and according to that same substance, and this is of the same essence. Let us have for example what I now say: for it is now fitting to say, since many say the soul is in the body, but now according to common usage the soul is in the body. The soul in the human body is, in that which the soul is, substance, like matter, or body. For these are two worldly substances. And just as matter has form, that is, species, as it is body, or something else; one indeed materially is in a concrete mass. For it is necessary for something to be of a certain quantity.
  </p>


  <p>
    No matter how much it is that is material; for matter is defined by quantity so that it exists and becomes a substance, now being something. In this way, the soul, which is an incorporeal substance, has definition and image: a living power and intellectual, being twofold in power and of twin light. For it both gives life to animals, and has a defiled mind, and is of the same substance. Thus, all things are of the same substance: for both substance and motion are the same in the soul, according to its subject, by which it lives and gives life, and by which it understands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Intelligence is one in motion, as it is one itself, which is its form, for it is defined by motion, and exists as one being with double power in one motion: of life and intelligence. Impassively, indeed these, in action two, in one motion, that is, what is generated, and the only-begotten Son of the soul, he himself life, he himself being mind, and the first power with that which is to him life. For what he is, this is what life is: that being is for him what substance is, and life is, and above life; for it does not give life to another, nor to itself: for it does not receive from another as if it were something else, for what it is to be for him, is to be moved, and to be motion; and what is motion, this is life; and what life is, this is intelligence.
