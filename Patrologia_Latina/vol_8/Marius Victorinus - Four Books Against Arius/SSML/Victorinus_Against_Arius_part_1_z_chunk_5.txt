    <p>Listen as I say. Before all things that truly exist, there was one, or the one itself, before it became one. For that one must be said and understood, which has a single imagination of otherness, one alone, one simple; one by concession, one before all existence, before all existentiality, and especially before all lower things, even before being itself, for that one is before being. Before all essence, substance, subsistence, and still all the things that are more powerful, one, without existence, without substance, without intelligence. For above these, it is immense, invisible, indiscernible universally, and in those things which are in it, and in those things which are after it, even those things which are from it. But to itself alone and discernible, and defined by its own existence, not by action, so that nothing else exists in it by consistency, and knowing itself impartially from everywhere, without shape, without quality, nor inequality; without quality as such, without color, without appearance, without form, lacking all forms. Nor is it the form by which all things are formed, both of everything universal and partial that exists. The first cause of all beginnings, the beginning of all intelligences, the preintelligence of all powers, stronger than motion itself, more stable than stability itself. For in motion there is an inexpressible state, and in a state there is an ineffably superior motion. Denser in all continuity, higher in all distance, more defined than all bodies, and greater than any magnitude, purer than any incorporeal, penetrating all intelligence and bodies, the most powerful of all, the power of powers, greater than all kinds, all power, all species, truly being all things itself, greater than any whole, both corporeal and incorporeal, greater than any part in an indescribable power, pure, existing beyond all things that truly are.</p>

    <break time="500ms"/>

    <p>This is God, this is the Father, preintelligence, preexisting, and preexistence, keeping His own blessedness and immovable motion within Himself, and therefore not needing others, perfect above the perfect, thrice-powerful in singularity, a perfect spirit and above spirit. For He does not breathe, but is only spirit in that which it is to be for Him, spirit breathing into Himself, so that He is spirit; for He is a spirit inseparable from Himself, He is His own place, and remains in Himself alone in solitude, existing everywhere, and nowhere in simplicity, one who is, combining all existence, all life, and all blessedness.</p>

    <p>But all these things are one, and simple one, and most of all in the power of what it is to be, that is, the power of existence, life, and blessedness, for indeed it is and exists by the power, which is of existence, and the power is of life and blessedness itself through itself, and therefore the Word of Himself, and living, and acting, having according to itself His own inherent existence, the indiscernible union of spirit, divinity, substantiality, blessedness, intelligence, vitality, goodness, and universally everything in every way, purely unbegotten before, singularity of union without any union. Therefore, with this one existing, one therefore emerged from one, in substance one, in motion one, and indeed motion is existence, because existence is motion. Therefore, this one existentially one, but not like the Father existentially one, who is according to the power existentially one. For He has power, and more so, what will be according to operation.</p>


  <p>
    To be, and according to the truth, does not possess it, but is because power, active coercion is everything. It is without trouble and truly in every way not needing, which is from this to be everything potential. For indeed, the action which is born of power requires acting itself unity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, according to what we call being, one, one life is, which is infinite motion, creator of others, either of those which truly are or of those which exist. Being the Word, to that which is being which are, moving everything from itself, always in motion, having motion within itself, but more so it is motion itself. For the divine Scripture says, "For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself" <break time="1s"/> (John 5:26). This Son is the Word, who is with God, this through whom all things were made, this Son and complete sonship of all fatherhood always who is both Son, and from eternity. But the Son moved himself by motion, for the power progressing, and as immobile pre-existing, and not moved according to what power was. This motion never rests and rises from itself, and hastens into all kinds of motion. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For life which is infinite, and itself appearing in vivification as if outwardly. Therefore, life necessarily is born, but life is the Son, life is motion, from vital pre-existence life, existing in constitution, and appearance of all wholes, which according to the power the Father is, so from the understanding of those which truly are pre-intelligence appears. This existence, therefore, is the life of all existence, and according to life, motion has as if a feminine power, which desired to vivify.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since as demonstrated, this motion while being, and life is wisdom, entirely turned into wisdom, and more into the existence of the Father, more or backward motion moved into the Father’s power, and vivified by him life returning to the Father, made male. For life descends, wisdom ascends. However, the Spirit is also this. Therefore, the Spirit is both: in one two, and as existing life the first existence, necessity was to enter into virginal power, and from the virgin's birth a man to be produced, the Son of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    For in the first motion, I say first coming into appearance, as it failed from the Father’s power, and in the desire inherent to vivify, existing inwardly as life, but by motion existing outwardly it returns to itself. Again turned into itself it comes into its paternal existence, made virtue and perfected. Thus, according to the type, the order had to be, and while in the body, the Spirit, that is, the Son Christ, and as if suffering diminution, and born of the Virgin, and by this as if diminution of its paternal virtue, that is, more divine and first existence to rise again and be renewed, and to return to the Father, that is, into existence and paternal power.
  </p>
  <p>
    How this is, I still dare to say, so that our many incidents may be manifest by much exposition. Let us assume intelligence: according to this manner, God is the power of these three powers of existence, of blessed life, that is, of what is being, what is living, what is understanding. But in each of these, there are three, manifest and what is being first, and second what is being according to itself living and understanding, without any union, but simply simplicity and this manifest as demonstrated, that and such what is being, God being manifestly, as demonstrated; power capable of bestowing being to all, not from that which is being as giving part and paternal and creating power to each what is being proper to it. This, however, through ministering the Word, that is through the life which bestows living to all, and then subsists, someone receiving what is being according to what is receiving life.
  </p>
  <p>
    If therefore the being of God, not from that which is being bestows to all, but ministering this which is life being; but life being in that which is of God, being one and the same is at rest, which is being of the Father, with that which is being of life according to the same.

      Dependence is based on its power from the native power.

      And since all natural power is will, it desires to move life by itself, inherently with impassive motion, directed toward what it is.
    </s>
    <s>
      For natural will is not a passion.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, according to the being of God, in which the power of existence is, substantiality is native, according to power, according to this very being and life is.
    </s>
    <s>
      So if life moved itself, and motion is will, then native motion and native will, since native power is life.
    </s>
    <s>
      But if, according to what life is, motion is, then the proper motion of life is.
    </s>
    <s>
      But since motion is carried from one to another, as from what is inside to outside, which is life and power, and nature, and will: and most importantly, the existence itself, therefore it is called effulgence or progression, or the manifestation of the elevated spirit, operating in giving life to what is the entirety of essence.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, of the life existing within, according to what is motion being life itself, the offspring of what is the father to be life is: according to what motion is.
    </s>
    <s>
      But since motion, as motion, having no exaltation, goes out from what is inside, like sense from the one who is intellect, receiving fountain and universal power, according to motion both inside and outside: for motion is intellect, thus also life as motion, the son is made manifest motion from the motion of the father, which is hidden, which according to the first power is existence.
    </s>
    <s>
      Again, life as motion proceeding from the father's motion, both inside and outside: but indeed life is motion: therefore life is both inside and outside, God lives, life itself lives, therefore both God and life are one.
    </s>
    <s>
      So these two are both in each one, and different and the same: therefore in the son is the father, and in the father is the son.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Therefore truth exclaims, that these are of the same substance according to identity united with otherness.
    </s>
    <s>
      Again, if the father is life, and the son is life, since the son is life as he is motion, both inside and outside, God lives, the son lives, and everything lives outside everywhere with the son existing.
    </s>
    <s>
      And since the father is in the son, the father is everywhere.
    </s>
    <s>
      Again, since the father is in the son: when you see the son, and understand, you will see and understand the father.
    </s>
    <s>
      If anyone sees me, they see the father: for this is said.
    </s>
    <s>
      Because the son is the form of the father: not now understood as a form outside the substance, nor as an appearance adjacent to the substance in us; but a certain subsisting substance, in which is seen and shown what is hidden and veiled in another.
    </s>
    <s>
      But God is as something veiled: for no one sees God: therefore the son is the form, in which God is seen.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if God is existence, power, substance, motion, and life hidden as without form.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, if life is manifest, and manifest according to the power of motion, life according to motion is understood, pronounced, seen in form.
    </s>
    <s>
      Still, thus what is existence, the father: but what is life, the son, since it is impossible to comprehend what existence is: for that is hidden, but life as life already is existence: therefore in life appears what existence is, therefore life is what existence is.
    </s>
    <s>
      But the father God is what existence is, but the son life, therefore the son is the form of the life of the father God, in which the native power is beheld.
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore, one must believe in the son of God, so that life becomes in us, which is both true and eternal life.
    </s>
    <s>
      For if we have faith in Christ of Nazareth, incarnated from Mary, we will have the same son of God, who was and became the incarnated Spirit.

  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      But first, it is necessary to see, how other things are attributed to the father, or to the son?
    </s>
    <s>
      I say the Spirit, the word, the intellect, the holy Spirit, wisdom, substance, first the father and the son are the same, but the son and the holy Spirit are the same: therefore existence and life are the same; therefore existence and blessedness are the same: again, existence and life are the same, and life and understanding are the same.
    </s>

      This has been said about these in the book which is before this, and in others, which in the books before this.

  </p>


  <p>
    I am in one, three, and therefore the same three: therefore the three are synonymous, according to the name that each of these holds in its own power. For what is being, and life, and intelligence: so also to one another; therefore the same and synonymous, the same co-generated, therefore also consubstantial.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a certain otherness appears in these, and especially, therefore the same are not the same; for some of their power is hidden, and others are manifest and are understood. But existing in the same power, they are simultaneously powerful and consubstantial, and in these alone is found the same being, while in others from these in another identity being the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>
      Now it must be examined what the other names placed first mean. I say spirit, word, mind, Holy Spirit, wisdom, substance.
    </s>
    <s>
      The name of spirit is of substance or existence, which indeed signifies being, and is called and understood in what it is.
    </s>
    <s>
      If you want to know what God is, His Spirit signifies what it is to be: therefore God and Spirit signify what it is to be.
    </s>
    <s>
      Again, what is life? What spirit. Therefore spirit and life signify what it is to be: so also the Holy Spirit signifies what it is to be according to that very name, with the difference of the first two named by one name. 
    </s>
    <s>
      Which substantial difference, since it exists, signifies what it is.
    </s>
    <s>
      From these it now appears, since substance in each existing signifies what it is to be. Therefore in these three, Spirit is substance, therefore consubstantial.
    </s>
    <s>
      Since the Spirit is not divided Spirit: for one with three, but nature, power, and action are one existence with the Father, and having what it is to be in three generating substances are omnipotent: nor therefore did existence preexist.
    </s>
    <s>
      For the Father is the generator of His own substance, and the existence of others according to the chief source: nor is existence itself divided: and existence and power in what it is to be, in each of these three according to all majesty and omnipotence, and in all ways perfection, which generates itself, substituting itself, moving itself, always moving itself, consubstantial, simultaneously powerful in what it is to be, and what it is to be with the Father giving it.

      The Savior says: All that the Father has is mine, and therefore I said: He will take from what is mine (John 16:15); for He will not speak of Himself, but whatever He hears, He will speak (John 16:13).
    </s>
    <s>
      Therefore the Holy Spirit, if He speaks, speaks from the Son; but He from the Father. Therefore the voice, and the word, and the Word, these three, because one three.

      But the Father indeed speaks in silence, the Son manifestly, and in speech the Holy Spirit speaks not manifestly, but what He speaks, He speaks spiritually.

      Therefore these three are true lights, but rather one light, truly one word, one voice, one Word, that is, one active power, consonant, before it makes something to be.

      And this is the voice of John crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord (Matthew 3:3): for the soul cries in the wilderness, that is in the world, because it is the Lord God and wants to be cleansed, to enjoy the Lord God; and this it says in testimony of God, and was sent into the world for the testimony of the testimony: for the testimony of God is Jesus Christ, therefore the Son of God, the son of John the Lord.

  </p>


  <p>And by the Holy Spirit, all things are made perfect.</p>
  <p>Therefore, if God is these, simultaneously these three, because one and two, all things exist together in knowledge, existing together in life in the Father, in whom is the Holy and the Spirit according to being, because the three were one, and always are.</p>
  <p>Therefore, if eternal life is the Son's radiance of pre-eternal life, and He is the life of perfect and eternal knowledge, then indeed perfect when He knows what and whose it is, because both Himself and by the Father's decree, then indeed existing within Himself, He does not become infinite, saving and saved by Himself, it is necessary to understand and say: that the power of God is in Him, which is the Father in the Son, but He was infinite by Himself.</p>
  <p>And this means: "and the Word became flesh" <break time="500ms"/> (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 1:14).</p>
  <p>For by infinite motion descending into the lower life, and revitalizing corruption, which is why the universal Word and power of life became flesh, as the angel said:</p>
  <p>"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you" <break time="500ms"/> (<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="luk">Luke</phoneme> 1:35).</p>
  <p>Therefore, Jesus Christ was born according to the flesh from Mary, and from the Holy Spirit, the power of the Most High.</p>
  <p>Therefore, all things, Christ our Lord, flesh, Holy Spirit, the power of the Most High, the Word. He fulfilled the mystery, so that all life with flesh illuminated by eternal light may return from all corruption to the heavens.</p>
  <p>Therefore, neither flesh alone, nor the Holy Spirit alone, nor the Spirit alone, nor the Word alone, but all together our Lord Jesus.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is all happiness in the first unbegotten generation, which is the only generation and is called, He was the Father, He was the Son.</p>
  <p>For the Spirit, moved by Himself, which is perfect life in motion, wanting to see Himself, which is His power, the Father namely, became His own manifestation, which is the generation and is called, and according to this existing externally.</p>
  <p>For all knowledge, as knowledge, is external to that which it desires to know. And I say external, as in the sight of seeing Himself: which is to know or to see that power pre-existing in the Fatherland.</p>
  <p>Therefore, in this without the intellect of time by time, from what was being as if coming forth to inspect that which was because there all motion is the substance of otherness born, quickly returning to identity.</p>
  <p>For it is not by the backside illumination, but as lights, or faces looking at each other in vision, the same one in the same way and perfectly subsisted. But lights all around as faces looking at each other, and they do not have a backside, and mystically God is said to be seen by the backside: there is no diminution therefore the whole always remained one, especially empowered by the union of the power of the Fatherland.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the first motion within, which is the thought of the Fatherland, which is self-knowledge: for pre-knowledge precedes knowledge. According to this natural mode of knowledge externally made, the Son was born, made life: not that He was not life, but because externally life more life, for in motion life.</p>
  <p>This is the Word who is called Jesus Christ, through whom all things were made, the seed of all things as they are, because without life it is impossible for anything to be among those that are, and among those that are not, which are consequences.</p>
  <p>But since we have said one motion and the same, both Word and Holy Spirit, the Word in that it is life: Holy Spirit in that it is knowledge, and understanding is: Because we have said that this is life and knowledge: and because we have said understanding moved in the first motion: For this natural and divine order being power it was necessary for understanding to move to the knowledge of itself.</p>
  <p>The Son was born, the Word who is, which is life by the power of the Fatherland, generating understanding, which is the being of all things that are, like an eternal fountain. Therefore, it is not a mistake if someone understands the Holy Spirit to be the mother of Jesus, both above and below, above indeed as said, below in this way:</p>


  <p>
    It was necessary, for the sake of liberation, that the divine, that is, the seed of all spirits universally existing, and what is the first being, that is, the universal Word <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="lɔ́ɡos">λόγος</phoneme>, be incarnated from the lower matter and all corruption into the mortification of all corruption and sin. For darkness and ignorance of the soul, snatched away by material powers, needed eternal light for help, so that the Word of the soul and the Word of the flesh, through the mystery of death, would drive away corruption into revival. Souls and bodies would be raised to divine and life-giving intelligences by the Holy Spirit, the administrator, through knowledge, faith, and love.

  <p>
    <s>What these things truly mean, listen as I say: The highest mind, and perfect wisdom, that is, the universal Word, was the same in eternal motion, circular motion from the first point and at the highest peak of the circular motion existing near that point, the cyclic cause inseparably turned, as from the Father, and in the Father, existing with the Father, proceeding, existing together, and in the Father was the Son, and in the Son, the Father.</s> 
    <s>The first substance, and in substance already substance, spiritual substance according to the mind, generative and effective substance, the pre-principle of all intelligible and intellectual being, and soul, and all material substance in matter.</s> 
    <s>Therefore, if the first motion, life, I say, and understanding: these are indeed the perfect one and only.</s> 
    <s>Not only is this circular motion, but spherical, and more spherical, and truly in every way the perfect sphere.</s> 
  </p>


  <p>
    To live and to understand, and if life itself is being and intelligence, and the highest points and the middle are in each, so is intelligence. Therefore, one of these three is in itself circular and participating with each other. But more existing together without any interval, it is a sphere and the first, and perfect, and itself alone a sphere. But others are more like a spherical resemblance.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this reasoning necessarily, a point is power, and a line, and a line working as a point: and going out from itself, and not always going out, in staying, and in moving simultaneously, always together, circulating around itself in a circle, being a sphere with God existing everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    For since it is a point from which, and to which all motion is returned by conversion, this is God, the whole word, the whole mind, the whole wisdom, the omnipotent substance, the substance whom we revere, whom we worship, seeing only with the Spirit, raised to him by his will and grace of the cross, by the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ: Amen.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the motion raised cyclically, I say straight, that from point to point, that is from Father to Father in the appearance of this motion and of all divinity, and the word, and the image of the Son exists by the command of God according to the image and likeness of God, the image of the image, that is, of the Son. For the Son is the image of the Father, as has been demonstrated. But this is because the Son is life, therefore the image of life has become the soul, and the soul with its mind, from him who is mind, is the power of intellectual life, not mind itself, but looking to the mind as if it is mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    For vision there is unity, but turning downwards, and turned away from the mind, it drags itself and its mind downwards. Made only understanding, no longer as intelligible, but if it persists thus, it is the mother of those things above the sky, light, not true light, and indeed with its own mind light. But if it looks to the lower, being wanton, it becomes the power of giving life, which it will make to live in the world, and those things in the world down to the stone of stones, itself also made with mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    For indeed, when the word is soul, not the word; and when in the midst of spirits, and intelligibles, and of matter, turned with its own mind to both, it becomes either divine or incorporated. For to its own understanding is its license, and by deprivation of true light it is again called back because of the thin spark of its own mind; for it is alone, but darkened it is said to be downwards. For indeed, the highest points of matter having the purer power of animating, are a cause to light as if it descended in itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why then is it said: it distinguishes this, someone says, if such is the soul. How is it said: Let us make man in our image and likeness? <phoneme ph="ˈdʒɛnəsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> 1:26.
  </p>

    We must first look at what man is, then what an image is, and what differs the image from the likeness, and how man is made according to the image and likeness, not image and likeness made: and what it is, to our image. For man is understood in two ways, as is customary, from body and soul. Some think from body and triple soul: others from body and soul having three powers. Some again say from body and divisible mind, and soul and spirit, by which the flowing body consists. Still others from the four-element body of four powers and the double soul, and double mind.

  <p>
    My understanding is this: for the body, as demonstrated: for God took dust and formed Adam, that is, already made earth, we have the highest points of the earth and the flower as the principles of the body. The Gospel according to Matthew and Luke declares a twin mind, a twin soul. For they say: So will be the presence of the son of man. Then two will be in the field: one will be taken, and one left; two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken, and one left. <phoneme ph="ˈmæθjuː">Matthew</phoneme> 24:40-41. Luke also added about the body two, that night two will be in one bed, one will be taken, and the other left. <phoneme ph="luːk">Luke</phoneme> 17:34.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, because in the field, the word is two, or mind and heavenly word, and another material. And the two grinding are two souls, heavenly and material: and one will be taken.

    Heavenly mind or heavenly word: soul, but the hylic word and soul will be left behind.
  </p>
  <p>
    How is this? Listen. Man must be made of soul and body. From the body, which is composed of earth, he has a hylic soul made of earth. Adam was made, according to the body, an animal, just like an animal is made of water and earth. Other animals have a living soul, but Adam was not so, for God breathed into his face all the sensible power, to which the mind is present in the discernment of senses. Therefore, another, more divine soul with its mind; for the sensible power, the hylic mind is implanted and consubstantial with the hylic. If therefore this is the case, the heavenly Word, that is, the mind or divine Spirit, is in the divine soul. But the divine soul is in the hylic spirit, the hylic spirit is in the hylic soul, and the hylic soul is in the carnal body, which must be purified with all three, so that it may receive eternal light and eternal life. This is accomplished through faith in Christ.

    Let us therefore say how such a soul became according to the image of God and according to the likeness, and if only the soul is man, as Paul says: one is earthly, one is animal, one is spiritual, and all these are in one man. But he often speaks of the inner man, thus the soul: for it gathers the mind and the divine soul. He calls the heavenly man the remaining earthly man. If this is the case, our soul is in the image of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. If Christ is life and Word, he is the image of God in which the Father God is seen. This is what God is to be in life: this is indeed the image as it was said. And if Christ is life, which is to live, this is the Word itself indeed life. This is what it is to be, this indeed what it is to be, the Father is. And if again the life itself is what understanding is: that indeed is the Holy Spirit, and these three are all; and in each one three, and one three and altogether consubstantial.

    If therefore the soul, according to what the soul is, and the soul's being is, and to live and understand is: thus the soul is of the higher Trinity, as the image of the image. For it is according to what the soul is in what it is to be, and giving life, and understanding, having understanding together before, consubstantial in one, and each is as its own substance, not by division, not by separation, not by diffusion, nor by extension, nor by cutting birth, but the eternal three: one being in another being, and these substantially; therefore according to the image. And as the Father is to be, the Son indeed two, but in motion and in act; thus the soul in what it is the soul, as a fatherly power: vivification and understanding in motion. Therefore this being of the soul according to the image of the Father and the Son: thus indeed being according to the likeness, consubstantial therefore also in its unity, and similar substance: in triple power, generating itself, therefore moving itself, and always in motion in the world of motions, the source and principle, as the father and son of its soul's motion and creator, and pre-cause and pre-principle.
  </p>
  <p>
    I still say in secret a great mystery: as the more divine Trinity is one, according to what it radiantly made the soul in the intelligible world into substance and its own substance, which we properly call substance: thus the second soul's trinity explained imagination in the sensible world, the same soul always being above generating worldly souls, and this therefore according to the image and likeness. Let us see therefore if even according to the flesh indeed, and according to the flesh they say before divination, because it was to be that Jesus would take on flesh. But I say perhaps if even in this that the Word, and the flesh is the Word, and God and bodily, and above all body is said: for the power of all and everything is God, not in vain according to the image of the body. For if it is to be that our body and flesh will rise and take on incorruption, and become spiritual flesh, just as our Savior was in everything and was, and rose, and ascended, and it is to be that he will come: and if after the resurrection it will be transformed, receiving the spiritual garment, nothing prevents it according to the image of the higher flesh.

    The Word was made human. For this, the Prophet says in testimony: 
    <s>
      And God made man in the image of God.
      <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="d͡ʒɛnɪsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> 1:27.
    </s>
  </p>
  <p>
    If God made man according to the image, the Father according to the Son's image:
    <break time="500ms"/> 
    if, however, it is said, 
    <s>
      He made them male and female, as has been previously stated,
    </s> 
    He made man in the image of God;
    <break time="500ms"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is clear that both physically and mystically, the Word was present in male and female:
    <break time="500ms"/>
    for He Himself was the Son to Himself, in the first and second birth, both spiritually and physically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks be to God the Father, and to His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, from eternity to all ages of ages. 
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Amen.
