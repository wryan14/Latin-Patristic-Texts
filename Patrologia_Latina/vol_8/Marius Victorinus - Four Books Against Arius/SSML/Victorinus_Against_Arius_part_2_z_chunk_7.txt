      Who would say that God, who exists, is without substance?

    <s>
      It was already said above that it cannot be without substance if it exists. So what is it? Where does this existence come from; from the non-substantial, or from the substantial, that is, from that which is being, or from that which is not being?
    </s>
    <s>
      God, as they say, is being: Christ also is being, but He began nonetheless. This is true. But this existence that began, started from that which was somehow being, just as all divine things, and originated from divines, are always and have always been powerful: their process, however, is an act, and manifestation from movement, and indeed a birth.
    </s>

      Who is the Lord of Majesty; and other things we said above and in other books.

      Let us therefore exclude all those who think these and similar things about Christ: let us speak with those who say Christ is the Son of God, and the born Son, as we confess.

    Only begotten, indeed begotten, not made. That’s not enough. They add, from the Father the Son, from God, God, from true light, true light, and also consequently from the Spirit, Spirit, and in the Father the Son, and in the Son the Father. They admit these things not by reason, but rather out of fear than truth. Some deny that substance should be mentioned here, others mention it, but they want to say it is similar, not the same.

    <break time="1s"/>

    They should first understand what the prophet <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="aɪˈzeɪə">Isaiah</phoneme> said:
    <p>
        <s>
            <lang xml:lang="en-US">No God was before me, and no one will be similar to me after me.</lang>
        </s>
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    If the Son is Christ, of course after God, Christ; but no one similar to Christ after God. Therefore not similar to God, or if not after God, certainly with God, for there is no way it can be consubstantial. And David thus:
    <p>
        <s>
            <lang xml:lang="en-US">No one is like you.</lang>
        </s>
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>

    Then, what we have taught many times, substance in what it is as substance, especially if it is of the same kind, and this is in two or more, this same is not called similar substance; as the soul is substance, though there are many souls, in what they are as souls, it is one and the same substance. Not that the substance preceded and preexisted, but always existed simultaneously, thus in other things. How much more in God? Since He is the origin of substance, with whom the Son by divine birth received substance from the Father, always with Him, and in Him, so that they are other and the same of the same substance, with no diminution of the former, nor reception of the latter, in a consubstantial completeness in unity God and His power always who has been, and always existed, that is God and Logos, God and His form, Father and Son, God and Jesus Christ, God and power and wisdom, consubstantial; therefore if this is said as consubstantial, when they exist together in the same form, of the same time and age. But here consubstantial means of the same substance together and substance without composition or division, but always simultaneously as distinct in their powers and actions.

    <break time="1s"/>

    Here questions arise: First, that in the sacred Scriptures mention of substance is not made, and especially consubstantial is not read. Another, that if this is so, the Father suffered with the Son. Third, that if this is so, neither the Father is greater, nor the Son lesser, nor one sending, the other sent. And these and similar things. So first let’s see about substance: there is no substance in God, nor in Christ: Is it not read? If it is not, as we said above: because it is not at all, we accept it this way; or because it is entirely above substance, it would be blasphemy to say God is not to us: for substance is what God is, what spirit is, what light is. Why then do we add true light? For in divine things, and in God we will accept substance this way, as in material bodies, and in corporal things the soul. For this is the substance there, to be above substance: all confess God to be since He is the power of substance, and therefore above substance and thus substance: for power contains being. Certainly God is omnipotent, and of whom is the origin or cause, He is all in power indeed and in a certain way, hence it is said by Paul:
    <p>
        <s>
            <lang xml:lang="en-US">So that God may be all in all.</lang>
        </s>
    </p>
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Therefore He is being, and existing, and substance, who is all since He is the parent of all, therefore He is all in power. Therefore it should not be doubted to say the substance of God: because when we fall short of the first or highest proper words, we suitably adapt what may fit our understanding here, that what is, to God being, we rightly call substance. In the same way, we should accept Christ to be substance, and from His Father as substance, since He is also light from light, God from God, Spirit, Logos through whom all things were made. And since it is so, that He willed to come down to the mystery of the body with His substance, of which it is said by the Apostle:
    <p>
        <s>
            <lang xml:lang="en-US">For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Deity bodily which is substantially; for God is power, and Logos is action, in either both: for power contains what can be</lang>
        </s>
    </p>


    <p>
        That is, it can be. Therefore, the very power is action, and the action itself is power. Thus, both the Father acts and the Son acts, and the Father acts: therefore, the Father, because power generates action, and therefore the Son is action; because action comes from power: thus, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, but both are in each other, and therefore they are one.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, they are two, because the more there is, the other appears: the Father has more power, and the Son is more action; and therefore, because action is more, action is more because it is an outward action. If this is so, both the Father and the Son are substance, and one substance, and substance from the Father, and substance together, and always and eternally together the Father and the Son, the same and together substance, that is, ὁμοούσιον (homoousion). Has this not been read in the Holy Scriptures?
    </p>
    <p>
        First, whoever denies this admits the matter but seeks the authority of Scripture. How is it not unjust to not admit the matter because the elders perhaps omitted it by some chance or cause, when you can be rationally convinced? But do they deny what has been read about substance? Or about the substance of God and Christ? Or about ὁμοούσιον itself? The substance of God and Christ has been read. The substance of God has been read in the prophet Jeremiah <w>Jeremiah</w> <sub alias="twenty-eight eighteen">28:18</sub> according to the Septuagint: Who stood in the substance of the Lord, and saw his word? Who gave ear and heard? Again, shortly after <sub alias="twenty-two">22</sub>: And if they had stood in my substance, and had heard my words. Again, substance is read in the prophet David <w>Psalm</w> <sub alias="one thirty-eight fifteen">138:15</sub>: And my substance was not hidden from you when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. It is read about Christ in Paul’s letter to the Hebrews <w>Hebrews</w> <sub alias="one three">1:3</sub>: Who is the brightness of his glory and the express image of his substance. There are other examples, but I think these are sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        But among the Greeks, ὑπόστασις (hypostasis) is used, not οὐσία (ousia). Let us see what the difference is. The Greeks call both things that are eternal and things that are in the world and earthly beings: in the eternal, God is almighty, the cause of all things, and the source and origin of all that exists, that is, of all beings. What then do we give to God? That which is being, or do we give being to all, I give, do we not give? Indeed, reason holds that the first being is God. But because being can be understood as not clearly what that being is, if it is already comprehensible, it is called ὂν (on), that is, a form coming into knowledge, which being is already called ὂν and ὕπαρξις (hyparxis); every ὕπαρξις has what is being; but being is not immediately also ὕπαρξις, nor ὂν, unless potentially, not manifestly as to be called ὂν; for ὂν is a certain formed figure of what is being, which, however, is purely understood as pure when it is already understood as formed: for a form generates intellect, clearly pronouncing that form is one thing, and what is formed is another. But what is formed, this is being: the form, however, is what makes what is being understood. Therefore, what is being, we give to God, and form to Christ, because the Father is known through the Son, that is, through the form, which is being; and it was said here <w>John</w> <sub alias="fourteen nine">14:9</sub>: Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. Therefore, both God is ὕπαρξις, and Christ is ὕπαρξις; for ὕπαρξις with form is what is being, and since they are always together, and form is being, and being itself is form, hence the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father: for being is in the Father, which is power, which is prior to what form is. It is again also in the Son being; but this being has its own from the Father, to be for him form being; therefore the one is in the other, and both are one. Therefore, God is ὂν, the Son is ὂν, that is, being with form: for everything that is ὂν being, is with form: this is also called existence, substance, and subsistence, for what is ὂν is, and exists, and is subject.
    </p>
    <p>
        This, however, is what being is without any connection, which is simple, which is one; therefore more manifestly it is subsistence, and it is existence, and it is called substance. If, therefore, it is called subsistence of God, more it is called substance of God, and more this, because it signifies subject, and the principal which is fitting to God. Let it not be, however, subject as in the worldly substance, but what is more honorable and ancient and according to the source of the universe. But what is being, which God grants to those that are, so that...
    </p>


    
        <p>
            Let everything be of the same essence; therefore, having form, and first being the only true: because what is pure being is more substance.
            <break time="1s"/>
            And since, again, form is being, and it itself is substance, this is called hypostasis: for indeed, being formed is substance, being formed is God, which is God, and the Father, so also the Son, which is the Word and Son. Therefore, subsistence is properly said of both, which is substance: because what is the principal being, with form, is called substance. This is also called substance, and thus it was said that from one substance there are three subsistences, so that what is being itself subsists in three ways: God himself, and Christ, that is, the Word and the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hypostasis is rightly attributed to God, rightly to the Word, that is, to the Father and the Son. But the Latins call this substance, because we said that it can also be called substance, namely, what is being, more formed being. Therefore, when read hypostasis, this is essence, as we have proven. Now let us see whether in that place, where we read, it means something else, hypostasis than essence. For many think that wealth and fortunes are signified by this word, hypostasis namely; but if he said: If they had stood in the hypostasis of the Lord, they would have seen His Word (Jeremiah 23:22, according to the Septuagint). What do we understand here by the hypostasis of the Lord, if not that which is God? But God is spirit, light, power, almighty, and such things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here, the one who stands and understands, but was not understanding, stands therefore: however, understanding God understands and sees the Word of God, the Son; it is clear, therefore, that this is the hypostasis of God, because understood and the Word is understood, for they are together, and this is of the same essence.
            <break time="1s"/>
            He says this again: Because if they had stood in my hypostasis, and heard my word. Above to see; here, however, he placed both, that is, in order to understand. For the one who understands the matter, stands in the substance of the matter, that is, at the first source of the matter, so that he may understand all things that are of it. What then? When elsewhere either in David, or in the Gospel hypostasis is placed and read, does it mean anything other than essence? My hypostasis, says David (Psalm 138:15): about God indeed, My hypostasis in the lower parts of the earth. For he says: let no one believe himself hidden, because indeed I am and all that I am and my substance, and in the lower parts of the earth; for God is everywhere, or the spirit of God, which is the substance of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to see that in the Gospel, placed through parable and example. For the head of a family said to his two sons, he divided his hypostasis (Luke 15:12); certainly, we understand fortunes and inheritance. But if this is to be referred to God, it will be hypostasis here too, all power and virtue. One son consumes this who departs from God: for indeed, who wanders from God, neither has the spirit of God, nor light, nor Christ, he consumes the substance of God within himself. For this is the hypostasis of God, as we have said; whether now we call it wealth here, or inheritance, it makes no difference: for thus it was said by the apostle Paul: Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! (Romans 11:33). If therefore, the riches of God are wisdom and knowledge: and if wisdom and knowledge itself is the power of God, but the power of God is Christ, and Christ is the Word; the Word is truly the Son, and the Son is in the Father: therefore he himself is the riches of the Father; he himself is the hypostasis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, it no longer matters, whether we understand hypostasis as riches, or essence, as long as it signifies that by which God is himself. Therefore, it is read of God either hypostasis or essence: this is also understood of Christ. It is said: I am in the Father, and the Father is in me (John 14:10). Which indeed is said twice for this reason, because the Son could be in the Father, not however, also the Father in the Son, but so that fullness and the same one in each might be. But if it is the same hypostasis, it is therefore of the same essence. But the same: for Christ is God of God, and light of light. Therefore, of the same essence. But if this is from eternity and always necessarily together, therefore truly of the same essence. But indeed, this very thing of the same essence is read.
        </p>

            For all that we have said is read: I tell you, who already fa...

    You talk about God, either what light is or what spirit is. So you say God from God, Spirit from the invisible Spirit, and true light from true light, which are the hypostases of God. But when you say Christ, God from God, light from light, and such things: where did you read this? Or is it allowed for you to say such things, from which homoousion is more proven, and we are not allowed to learn homoousion? But if you say light from light because God is called light, and Christ is called light, and likewise the Father is God, and Christ is called God; indeed, it is obvious, but not read in the scriptures, light from light; but it was allowed to take. Therefore, it is allowed to compose non-read things from read things. You deny that homoousion is read; but if some similar things, or similarly named things are read, we must equally accept this named thing. God's essence is light, this light is life, and this life, this intelligence, this being God, this being Christ is sufficiently declared. The Father lives, and I live (John 6:58). The Father has life in Himself, and has given the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:26). All that the Father has, He has given to me (John 16:15). With these and other things, we often prove that the same are in the Father and in the Son, and that always and from eternity: and therefore it is called homoousion.

    But where does this word come from? Listen to the Gospel, listen to Paul the Apostle, listen to the prayer of the offering, because God is life; and eternal life. We Christians, that is, those who believe in Christ, are taught in the Gospel (Matthew 6:9) how we should pray to God the Father, in which prayer we ask for many things, as well as for bread, which is life (as it is said (John 6:59): This is the bread that came down from heaven). This life of both Christ and God, that is, eternal life which is named itself, epiousios bread, from the same essence bread, that is, from the life of God: consubstantial life. For how will we be children of God, except by participation in eternal life? which Christ bringing from the Father gave to us. Therefore, this is (Luke 11:3), give us our epiousios bread, that is, life from the same substance, for if what we receive is the body of Christ, and Christ Himself is life, we seek epiousios bread, for the riches dwell in Christ bodily; the Greek Gospel therefore has epiousios, which is named from substance, and assuredly the substance of God: this the Latins either not understanding or not able to express could not say, and only put daily, not epiousios. Therefore, both the name is read, and in God the substance, and it can be said in Greek even if not expressed in Latin; it is still said in Greek because it is understood. Therefore, we who believe in Christ, because we hope for eternal life from Him, because He is life, when we follow Him, and with Him, and around Him, and around eternal life we are, and we are called a periousios people. Hence the holy Apostle in the Epistle to Titus said in Greek (Titus 2:14): To redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. The Latin, not understanding periousios crowd, periousios, the one around, that is, around the life which Christ both has and gives, put abundant people. What merit is there for the people to be saved by which they abound? This, however, is again a great cause and as if a necessity, hence periousios. Hence the prayer of the offering in the same understanding prays to him: save the periousios people, zealous of good works. Therefore, all things are read, named from the essence hence composed homoousion of God and Christ, which is not alien to reason: for it has the substance, which the previous names have, and it is named in the same way: and this name excludes all heretics; therefore it was necessarily placed by the elders. Therefore, it must be said and always discussed.

    But indeed because it is not understood, and it causes scandal, it must be removed both from faith and discussion, or certainly put in Latin: it is not understood, they say. Therefore, it cannot be said in Latin either. It is not understood, why do you fear it? for those who oppose it, still fear it: if you fear it; you are heretics, you wish to enter with this excluded. If you deny the substance in God, do you wish to remove homoousion therefore, because they confess the substance? Therefore, intelli
  


  <p>Are you afraid? But if Basil also says "homoousion," and this name is offensive to you, then you reject it because you deny the essence in God.</p>
  <p>If, however, you reject it because you understand it, Basil himself also understands who wants "homoousion" to be said, of which we will speak later. "Homoousion" is not a name that is not understood.</p>
  <p>They say, let it be said in Latin. Because it is difficult to say, you desire it; and if it is said, you follow. A great miracle! A word makes you heretics, or rather the sound of the word, which is said in Greek.</p>
  <p>Then if I say it in Latin, since the Church has Greeks, and because all scripture, both Old and New Testament, was written in Greek and Latin, if we do not use Greek, when questioned by the Greeks, what will we answer?</p>
  <p>It is necessary to say "homoousion"; therefore it must be used. What then? Are there not many names in the Scriptures, either Greek or Hebrew, either interpreted or not interpreted?</p>
  <p>As in Matthew chapter 27, verse 46: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani." Also Golgotha and Emmanuel. Also in First Corinthians chapter 16, verse 22: "If anyone does not love our Lord Christ, let him be anathema." Six hundred others, either interpreted, yet used; or not interpreted, and simply used; or anathema, which is not expressed, neither in Latin nor in Greek, and yet it is used daily, as well as Hallelujah and Amen, which are said unchangeably in every language.</p>
  <p>Therefore, it is allowed to use "homoousion" in the same way. Surely a word must be removed, either because it is obscure, or because it is contrary, or because it expresses less or more, or because it is superfluous.</p>
  <p>This is not obscure; for we have already said what it signifies; and you, because you understand it, are afraid: and Basil, because he understands it, changes it. However, it is not contrary, since we all acknowledge the substance: for God is substance, Spirit, light; which are said of God the Father and Christ. This word "homoousion," since it is said of the substance, cannot be contrary.</p>
  <p>But it is expressed less or more. It should be corrected rather than removed. But how is it superfluous? Because it has already been said, where it has been said: or because it is not useful, which especially excludes the heretics, especially the Arians? Which was established by the elders as a wall and a bulwark? But it was established recently. Because a venomous cohort of heretics erupted recently, for which it was established according to the old faith, for even before the discussion, many bishops of the world, three hundred fifteen in the city of Nicaea, sent the decreed faith throughout the world, and thousands of bishops of that time or of subsequent years held the same faith. It was also approved by the Emperor, the father of our Emperor.</p>
  <p>But we want this to be said in Latin: neither will this be denied to you, you who deny the substance in God and are defeated by Basil, and you, Basil, who confess the substance, both of you confess "homoousion" with your own words.</p>
  <p>Indeed, you say God, and you also say light, the same spirit. Whoever says these things, says the substance of God. For whoever says Father or Almighty, or good, or infinite and such things, does not say the substance, but the quality. Likewise, you say the Son is the Word, light, spirit; and these signify the substance. Again, when you say God, you say God from God, true light from true light: you remove Basil's argument of fear, lest there be a superior substance, from which there are two. For if God is from God, and light from light, surely the substance of the Father is of the Son: because the Father Himself is God, He Himself is the substance, from which the Son is the Word, light, spirit: for when the Son is said, also Savior, also Jesus Christ, it is said according to quality, not according to substance.</p>
  <p>Thus the rest are either attributed to the Father or to the Son, therefore you confess the substance. But surely you believe Basil, who says the same things about God and Christ; light is God: spirit, word, and he confesses the substance. But indeed, in these "homoousion" is not: it is so, if you do not understand the same substance in "homoousion." But if the word is composed, the same is signified in two or more as "homoiousios," which is the same in kind: and "homilous," which is the same in age, and as "homonymous," which has the same name, concord in harmony, with the same heart, the same.</p>

    <s>Here, therefore, Arius is excluded, who said sometimes not being;</s>
    <s>his opinion was also that the Son is from what is not, that is, from nothing.</s>
    <s>ὁμοούσιον means to be simultaneously, and substance:</s>
    <s>Against both sacrileges the power of this word repels, by which ὁμοούσιον is said:</s>
    <s>for if it is so, that ὁμοούσιον means of the same substance, as we taught above, it excludes what was said, that Christ is from nothing:</s>
    <s>for if God and the Word are of the same substance, God and the Word are not only not from nothing, but not even from a similar substance.</s>
    <s>But if ὁμοούσιον from what is, is understood to be substance simultaneously, this means the substance is simultaneous, simultaneously God and the Word, and from eternity always simultaneously Father and Son.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>11. From this it is excluded what was said: there was a time when he was not.</s>
    <s>If this is so, by this alone, that is, ὁμοούσιος, all the poison of the Arian doctrine is destroyed.</s>
    <s>O learned bishops! O holy ones! O those confirming faith by the spirit!</s>
    <s>O word, truly the word of God! which God and the Word are shown to be, simultaneously from eternity, and always of the same substance.</s>
    <s>Therefore, in Latin, it is said ὁμοούσιον; hence necessarily it must also be set forth and treated in Greek.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But let us also add something now, by which through your confession and through divine reading it may be proved in Latin that ὁμοούσιον is approved.</s>
    <s>Divine reading says: the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father.</s>
    <s>And lest it be insufficient for faith, our Lord Jesus Christ himself says (John 14:10): I am in the Father and the Father in me.</s>
    <s>What then?</s>
    <s>Do these names exist in each other? or the powers, or the substances, or the wisdom and powers?</s>
    <s>The Father, as Father, cannot be in the Son.</s>
    <s>Likewise, the Son cannot be in the Father, but as the substance of power is, this means, in the other.</s>
    <s>Therefore one is in the other: one is rendered even with each subsisting; yet one, because the same is understood and named in both.</s>
    <s>Therefore, both the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>But in this way.</s>
    <s>If this is so, let’s look at the rest.</s>
    <s>You say, and you rightly say: Jesus Christ our Lord, God from God, and light from light.</s>
    <s>It is close to say similarly this too.</s>
    <s>Let us say, therefore, and truly say in God, light in light.</s>
    <s>For indeed it is not said in return, because one word is in two.</s>
    <s>For the Father and the Son are two names, and therefore they can be exchanged, so that the Father is said in the Son, and the Son in the Father.</s>
    <s>But truly, when one name is said in two, God in God, it will be said in the same way also when it is said of the other, the same reason is when it is said light in light.</s>
    <s>Therefore by necessity of one name it is said once, but because of the two, Father and Son, it is both understood and heard twice.</s>
    <s>Let us say therefore Jesus the Son of God, God from God, light from light.</s>
    <s>Let us also say that, God in God, light in light.</s>
    <s>For if, as we all confess, the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son, and the Father is God, and light, then necessarily and truly it is to say: both God in God, and light in light.</s>
    <s>Is it hard to say that? but it must be confessed that it is so and so it is.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    <s>12. What if it is also read, and from these two one is very clearly stated, so that it is not invented by me, but it is already proved by sacred reading?</s>
    <s>The hymn writer David in the Book of Psalms, which is called the key of all mysteries, sings to God thus (Psalm 36:9): For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light:</s>
    <s>Do we think it is said to God, or to Christ? or to both?</s>
    <s>Because it is rightly to whomever: for in the Father the Son, and in the Son the Father.</s>
    <s>But if to God the Father, this will be that (Jeremiah 23:22 according to the Septuagint): If they had stood in my substance, and ver.</s>
  </p>



<p>
<s>My people would have heard me.</s>
<s>But if it is about the Son, this will be what is written in John 14:9: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Therefore, in your light, we will see the light.</s>
<s>So, there is light, in your light, we will see the light.</s>
<s>There is no doubt when this follows, since that which is in the same way, both in reality and in reading, is proven.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>If this is so, let's gather everything: now the concept of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔmoʊˈuːsiən">homoousion</phoneme> will appear, both understood in Greek and pronounced in Latin.</s>
<s>We believe in God the Father Almighty, and in his only-begotten Son.</s>
<s>Truly, let it be so: That's enough about this.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Isaiah said thus in Isaiah 45:14: "Egypt labored, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans.</s>
<s>Tall men will walk in you, and they will be your servants, and they will follow you, bound in chains they will worship you, and they will plead with you, for God is in you, and there is no other God besides you."</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Jesus Christ our Lord, God from God, light from light: consubstantial, of the same substance.</s>
<s>Thus the rest follow in the creeds, and the faith is explicit and complete, and the concept of <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔmoʊˈuːsiən">homoousion</phoneme> is full, and of the same substance, and in the same substance, and always together.</s>
<s>If it pleases, let it be held so in Latin.</s>
<s>But if one Greek word, which with great expression and great brevity concludes both, pleases to remain, let it persist about God and our Lord; <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="hɔmoʊˈuːsiən">homoousion</phoneme> indeed should be held more and more, written, spoken, discussed, and preached in all Churches.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>For this is the faith at Nicaea, this is the faith of the apostles, this is the catholic faith.</s>
<s>Hence, the Arians, hence all heretics are defeated.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>Peace be with those who think thus, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ our Lord.</s>
<s>Amen.</s>
