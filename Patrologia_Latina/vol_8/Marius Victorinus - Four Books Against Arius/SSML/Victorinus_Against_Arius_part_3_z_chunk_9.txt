    LOGOS, or divine reason, uses itself as its seat and also as its body, a celestial soul. But it uses a sensual mind, or LOGOS, for an insensible soul, just as the sensual part is in the body, and therefore in any kind of body. Everything that comes from the divine returns to its own kind, as if it were a part of them, but as an image, as has been asserted and proven elsewhere. For within the divine itself, the Word of God is an image. Thus, all other things are images of the divine. Just as the Word of God is an image, every soul of this kind is an image of the Word, and other things are images too. But in the sensual nature, they are not images but rather simulacra and imitations because the progression of things is such that the radiance of light is an image of light. Hence, the substance is the same in the highest and eternal things because the image of light is light. Just as from Spirit comes only Spirit, and from truth, truth, and from God, God, so from substance comes substance. For Spirit, truth, and God are substance. Everything that exists has its own being as substance. But this being that we speak of must be understood differently in what it is to be: one is the being of substance, another of quality. But these distinctions apply to sensible things and the world. In the divine and eternal, these two are one. For everything there is simple, and this is God, which is light, which is the best, which is existence, which is life, which is intelligence. We have spoken of this in other contexts as well. Everything there is simple in substance, unconnected, one with number, not one with number, but before number one. That is, before one exists in number, it is plainly simple, alone without imagination, which is the other. Hence, what is born from it is an image, not a division or effusion, but a radiance. Not an extension, but an appearance. Not a germination of potential, but an action of potential. For where there is action, or whence, if not in potential and from potential? And when or where is potential, if not with action and in action? Therefore, nothing is in another, nor is it ever similar, because it is always the same. And because radiance is declared as light, or action is declared as potential. Thus (John 14:9): Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. And because no one sees potential itself alone (John 1:18): No one has ever seen God. And because ceasing potential is life, and ceasing intelligence, but this life and intelligence are action. If anyone sees God, it is necessary to die, because God's life and intelligence are in themselves, not in action. But all action is external; this is our living, which is to live externally. Therefore, it is death to see God (Exodus 33:20): No one, he says, has ever seen God and lived, for like is seen by like. Therefore, we must abandon external life, abandon intelligence, if we wish to see God, and this is death for us.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since this life and intelligence are LOGOS, who is Christ, through Christ, and us all things. Through him, therefore, is LOGOS, and life, and intelligence. Why? Because all these are motion and addition. Therefore we, if we are in Christ the Lord, see through Christ, that is, the true life. This is, through the true image. And because it is true, therefore it is of the same substance, because in action there is potential. Therefore there we see God, and hence that (John 14:9): Whoever has seen me has seen God. And because action comes from potential, therefore the Son comes from the Father, and LOGOS from the Spirit. And because Spirit comes from Spirit, therefore God comes from God. Therefore, from the same substance comes the same substance, as we have taught above. Potential is God, that is, what is the first universal existence, which has within itself, that is, in itself, life and intelligence. But more precisely, that which is existence, this is, which is life and intelligence through internal motion and turned in on itself. Therefore there is motion in God, and from this and action, whence it is said (John 5:19): Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. Therefore, both the Father acts and does, but internally, whence he needs nothing external, always full, always whole, always blessed. But since life and intelligence are motion, all life gives life, and everything that gives life is external.

  It is, likewise, intelligence that understands outwardly, and that which understands inwardly, is drawn and lives from intelligence, either by shining forth or illuminating. Hence, from God and of the same substance is both substance, and life, and intelligence, and likewise movement when it is inwardly within itself, the same as substance: which, when it looks outwardly, and to project outwardly, that is, to work and act, this birth is, this is the nativity. And because movement is one, the only-begotten son, movement itself is either that life or intelligence. Indeed, life must be movement.

  <break time="500ms"/>

  For all life gives life, hence movement is life, which either exists in itself, and turned within itself, is substance itself for itself; or looks outwardly, hence it is more called movement: for inwardly movement is cessation, or moved cessation, ceasing movement. For God must be the parent of both, I mean of cessation and movement, and that substance itself, which by a union and a certain form is the source of both, is simple and one, always one and alone, and, as we said above, whole. When it is received and understood in the ceasing movement, this is God, and he himself is the father, always and eternally father: because always movement from substance, and in substance, or rather substance itself, when it looks outwardly, this is looking outwardly, to be movement or motion: which itself is to see itself, to understand itself, and to want to know itself.

  <break time="500ms"/>

  When it sees itself, it exists doubly and is understood as seeing, and that which is seen: he who sees, and that which is seen, because he sees himself: this is therefore looking outwardly, born or existing outwardly, to understand what it is. Therefore, if it is outward, and if born, it is the son: and if the son, the only-begotten, because alone, who is all action, and all and universal, and one movement, and the same movement and substance: therefore both father and son are one and the same substance: consubstantial therefore, that is, ὁμοούσιον (homoousion).

  <break time="500ms"/>

  Therefore all things are the son, just as all things are the father. But because substance is potentially prior to action and movement, I said prior in force and cause, because substance is the cause of movement: for all movement is in substance, therefore necessarily the father is the generator, and likewise necessarily all things that the father has, the son also has (John 16:15): "All things," he says, "that the Father has, he has given to me." And likewise (John 5:26): "For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself": therefore as the father, so the son is life, and life from himself. For it is life itself, which is the power of living to itself and others, not life from elsewhere. Therefore movement, and principal movement, and one movement, and movement from itself, and only-begotten movement: this is Logos; for indeed life is, through whom all things live. And because it is life, he is the one through whom all things were made, and through whom all things were made: because all things purified return to eternal life. And all things were made in him, because what was made in him is life: for nothing that exists has its being, from which life itself is being what it is.

  <break time="500ms"/>

  Therefore all things were made in Christ, because Christ is Logos. But life neither began, because it always is from itself to itself, hence it never ceases, and is always infinite, and through all things, and in all things from the divine and from the supercelestial to the celestial, and all the heavens, the aether, the air, the humid and the earthly, and all things that arise from the earth, and all other things. Therefore, even our body and flesh have something vital, and all matter is animated, so that the world might exist, from which creatures burst forth by the command of God. Therefore in the flesh is life, that is, Logos; and in life is Christ: wherefore Logos was made flesh. Hence it is not surprising that by mystery he took flesh, so that he might assist both flesh and man, but when he took flesh, he took the universal Logos of the flesh: for therefore the power of all flesh triumphed in the flesh, and therefore he helped all flesh, as it is said in Isaiah (Isaiah 40:5; 52:10; Luke 3:6): "All flesh shall see the salvation of God." And in the book of Psalms (Psalm 65:3): "All flesh shall come to you." Likewise, he also took the universal Logos of the soul: for it is evident that he had a soul, when the same Savior said (Matthew 26:33): "My soul is sorrowful."


  
    <p>
      Even unto death. And likewise in
      <lang xml:lang="en-US">
        Psalm 16:10, "You will not abandon my soul to Hell."
      </lang>
      That he would take the universal reason of the soul is evident in 
      <lang xml:lang="en-US">
        Ezekiel 18:4: "All souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son."
      </lang>
      Likewise, the universal reason of the soul is shown also by the fact that he gets angry, as when he curses the fig tree and says 
      <lang xml:lang="en-US">
        (Matthew 10:15; 11:23): "It will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment than for you."
      </lang>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in many places. Also, he desires, as he says 
      <lang xml:lang="en-US">
        (Matthew 26:39): "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me." 
      </lang>
      There he also reasons: "But let your will be done." These and many other things show the universal reason of the soul: thus, the whole man was assumed, and assumed and liberated: for in him all universals were present, universal flesh, universal soul, and they were lifted up and purified on the cross for the salvation of God, the universal reason of all universals: for through him all things were made, who is Jesus Christ, God and our Savior, and our Lord. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason, therefore, of what is, what can be, and what could have been, like a seed and the power of existing, the wisdom and virtue of all substances from God to all actions, God in the potential of the Father and in the act by which the Son himself is one God with the Father. For since these are living and intelligent existences, let us consider these three: being, living, understanding, thus being three, always one, and in that which is being. But in that which is being, I say, which is there to be: thus, in this being, this is living, this is understanding all substantially, and one in subsistence: for living itself is what being is; for in God, as in us, it is not one thing that lives and another thing that makes life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For if we assume and accept that life itself is existence, and what power it has is existence for it, it becomes clear that we must accept being and living as one and the same: this is the reason, and the same power of intelligence is certainly in it. Therefore, this same understanding is what being is for it, and that being is what understanding is: this very understanding is intelligence: therefore, being, being of life and intelligence, is what life and intelligence are: one thing, then, is what life is, and the same being is what intelligence is. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If these are one in each singly and in pairs, it follows that living itself is what understanding is: for if being is living, and being is understanding; it becomes one to live and to understand, since for them being is one. Additionally, being itself is nothing other than living: for what does not live loses its being, so as long as something exists, it is its living, hence being ceases with life. But when we speak of eternal things, we accept another living: but this same knowing that you live, knowing furthermore is what understanding is: therefore, knowing is understanding, and knowing that you live, this is living: thus, understanding will be living.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is so, that living and understanding are one, and since being is one which is living and understanding; substance is one, subsistence are these three: for when they have their power and significance, and as they are said and are; necessarily they are three, and yet one, since everything that is single is one, these three are, and it is said so in Greek: "from one essence to be three subsistences." This being so, being is the foundation for the others: living and understanding as secondary and afterwards, as by nature they seem to be present in that which is being, or to have arisen from it in some way, and in that which is their being, they have preserved that first and fountain being: for it has been proven that there is never being without living and understanding: nor living and understanding without that which is being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let this be an example for the understanding of this matter. Let us assume vision or seeing by itself, by its power and nature potentially existing, this is its being, having the power of vision for seeing, which will be the right to see: and likewise having the power by seeing to discern each seen thing.
    </p>
  


  <p>What does it mean to understand:</p>
  <p>If these things are powerful, they are said to be nothing other than to exist.</p>
  <p>They remain, and as they are calm and turned inward, they only operate by seeing, or by the act of seeing, existence, and therefore only to be counted as being.</p>
  <p>But when the same vision begins to use the act of seeing, as if by its own progression, as I say, it does not progress, nor does it leave itself, but by the intention and vigor of its own power, which is living for it, everything that is encountered or seen by running into it, it functions with the duty of living, the life of the vision itself, which indicates living with an operative motion of vision, only in that it sees with a pure sense of seeing not discriminating, nor judging what it sees.</p>
  <p>Which indeed we understand by estimation, that we might think to see only without intelligence: when, however, to see, which is to live for the vision, is not to see unless it grasps and comprehends what it has seen, therefore it is also to judge what it has seen: hence in seeing, there is judging: for if it has seen, however it has seen, it has judged that very thing, or what it has seen.</p>
  <p>Therefore, as we say, in seeing there is judging: and in being a vision there is seeing: thus, in their simplicity and unity, vision, seeing, discerning; just as in discerning, there is seeing, and in seeing, there is being a vision, and, to speak truly, it is not in, but being vision, in it is seeing and discerning: thus in each, everything, or each one is everything, one.</p>
  <break time="500ms"/>
  <p>So lift yourself up and rise, my spirit, and with the strength inspired in me by God, recognize that understanding God is difficult, but not hopeless: for He wanted to be known, and therefore He created the world and His divine works, so that we could see Him through all these things:</p>
  <p>Certainly, the Word, His son, His image, His form, gave us the transition to understand the Father.</p>
  <p>So in what nature, in what kind, in what power, in what might do we place, understand, and estimate God? Or by what fantasy of intelligence do we reach and advance toward Him? And when we say He is understandable, certainly by God's inspiration the soul is in us and from Him, which is the greatest part in us: we therefore touch Him with that by which we are from Him and depend on Him.</p>
  <p>Certainly after the coming of the Savior, when we saw God Himself in the Savior, when we were taught and instructed by Him, when we received the Holy Spirit of understanding from Him, what else will such a great teacher of understanding give, but to know God, to recognize God, to confess God? And our ancestors asked what or who God was; and to these it was answered by Him who is always in His bosom (John 14:9, 10): You see me and seek my Father, I have been with you for a long time: whoever has seen me has seen the Father, I am in the Father, and the Father is in me. So what do we say?</p>
  <p>God is Spirit, and Spirit is life: indeed it is said, the Father is life, and likewise Christ is Spirit. And He again said about Himself (John 5:6): I am life. And (John 5:26): As the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself. Likewise, the Holy Spirit is Spirit, certainly He is also life. For Christ received everything from the Father (John 17:7, 8, 10): And He said, I gave everything to Him. And also: What He has is mine. Therefore He has life, and life is from Himself.</p>
  <p>Why is that? Because where there is life, there is life from Himself: and if this is so, there is understanding that He is life, and what it is to live: and what it is that life is: therefore all are united, and all are one and one substance, and truly consubstantial, or together, which is the same substance.</p>
  <break time="500ms"/>
  <p>Therefore the Father is being; for this is the principle and first of all to the fantasy of the second: this God, He with the other two is God, this one God, because what is to live and understand, this itself is what is to be; and from these two, living and understanding, comes from what is being. Therefore, let no one separate the Holy Spirit, and with profane blasphemy, let no one suspect something unknown to be, because He too is from the Father.</p>


  Because He is also the Son, who is from the Father: for after that which is existence, that is being or substance, or in a higher sense which you ascend to with certain names, you may call it either existentiality or substantiality. It is called ὑπαρχότητα, οὐσιότητα, ὀντότητα. All these mean what I say, remaining in itself, enlivening with its own power, by which all things are enlivened and empowered, full, absolute, above all perfections in every way is divine perfection. This is God above mind, above truth, omnipotent in power, and therefore not a form; though mind and truth are a form, but not as an inherent inseparable form, rather as inseparably attached to the declaration of the power of God the Father, the same substance or image or form.

  <break time="500ms"/>

  Thus, the first thing we said about being, which is God, is called silence, and rest and cessation. If so, the progression of power, which is not actually progression, but appearance; and if progression is not leaving where it proceeds from, but with connection progression, more accurately appearance: for there was nothing outside into which progression could occur. For God is everywhere, and everything is God: therefore, the progression of power existed as an act: if God is silence, then the Word is said: but if cessation, then it is motion: if essence, then it is life. As we have taught, in that which is being and living, in that which is silence is the silent Word, and in that which is rest or cessation there is either hidden motion or hidden action. Therefore necessarily from this cessation motion was born, and action was born, or from silence the Word, or from essence life. Therefore this essence, silence, cessation, is the Father, that is, God the Father. But life, the Word, motion or action, is the Son and the only Son; because nothing else but one, either life, or the Word, or motion or action, and more so all these are motion or action: for all those are active, life and the Word thrive in motion and operate in motion; however, the universal motion, which is the principal motion, arises from itself: for what is motion, if not motion from itself? For if it is moved by another, it is something other than motion, which is moved by another: and if that which moves this something, is not motion, it cannot move: for it will not have from where to move. But if motion is born from motion, then motion is born from itself.

  <break time="500ms"/>

  But this is <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 5:26: The Father gave Him life, so that life would be in Him. Therefore motion, and there is one motion, and motion from itself. And while it is partly hidden, hence this apparent motion from the Father is motion. And because it is motion from motion, therefore it is motion from itself, and one motion, hence the only Son. This Logos is universal in all things through whom all things were made. This is life to all, because all that were made live. This is also Jesus Christ, because He will save all to life. Therefore one motion, and one Son and only, because one life, and one life, and only eternal. Therefore the Son is of the same essence as the Father: for the Father is life, and the Son is life, which is essence: likewise the Father is motion, and the Son is motion which is essence, for there is nothing accidental; therefore the Word is the Father, though the silent Word, yet the Word, and the Word is the Son, and this is essence. For whatever is, or acts and operates is essence, and where more essence, the Word. Not as here the sounding air, the Word, but as something acting here, the Word. Therefore one Son, because one motion: one life, because one sole life which is eternal. For not life, which sometimes dies. It never dies, if it knows itself. But it cannot know itself, unless it knows God, and God who is life, and true life, and the fountain of life. If this is so, with God known, it will know all things: because from God all things, and in all things God, and God all things. This <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> proclaims <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> 17:3: This is eternal life, that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. Knowledge is life. And further whether life, or knowledge, it is one motion, and the same motion acting life, and through life knowledge, and through knowledge life: therefore the same motion, fulfilling two offices, life and knowledge. But Logos is motion, and Logos is the Son. Therefore the only Son in that He is the Son; in that however...


  <p>
    Λόγος, the Word, is twofold. For He is both life and knowledge, working through the mystery of the cross for the salvation of souls. He is life because we were to be freed from death. He is knowledge through the mystery of the Holy Spirit because the Spirit was given, taught everyone, and bore witness about Christ. To know is to live, and through this, to know God, which means to have true life, and this is to bear witness about Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, the Son of God, Christ, that is, the Word, is both Son and life. And because He is also movement and knowledge, He is the Son in His work of being life, Jesus existing. In the work of knowledge, He is the Holy Spirit existing, so that there are two existences, Christ and the Holy Spirit, in one movement, which is the Son. And hence, from the Father, Jesus (Sirach 24:5): "I came forth from the mouth of the Most High," and the Holy Spirit also from the Father, because one movement brought both into existence. And because (John 16:15; 17:10) all that the Father has He gave to the Son, thus the Son, who is the movement, gave all to the Holy Spirit: for all that He has (John 16:14, 15) He has from me, He says; for He too is the movement, He has from the movement: for it was not the Son who gave to Him, but He says, "He has from me."
  </p>
  <p>
    Primarily, movement is life, and this life is knowledge and understanding: therefore, whatever knowledge has, it has from life. This is the supreme Trinity, this is the supreme Unity (John 16:15): "All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take from what is mine and declare it to you."
  </p>
  <p>
    This will make it clear enough that what the Father is, life is the Son, and knowledge is the Holy Spirit, that they are one, and one substance, three existences, coming from what is existence, which is the substance of movement, because He too, as we have taught, is the substance, doubling in power, vitality, wisdom, and understanding, so that in all individuals there are three: thus the Holy Spirit is knowledge and wisdom. The sacred readings prove this (First Corinthians 2:16): "Who has known the mind of God, except the Spirit of God?" (Romans 8:16): "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit." Who is a witness without knowledge? And knowledge itself, because it is wisdom, teaches us to be children of God. Also: "Who searches the hearts? Who knows the thoughts of the spirit?" Also, how are both joined to knowledge? (Romans 9:1): "I speak the truth in Christ." Where there is truth, there is knowledge, because truth is Christ; therefore, knowledge is the Holy Spirit. And also: "I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness in the Holy Spirit." What is conscience, but knowledge with another? Now ours with the Spirit, therefore the Spirit is knowledge: and Christ is knowledge, because He is truth; thus both Christ and the Spirit are knowledge. But Christ is life: what if the Spirit is life: for as I said, it is one movement, and the same life which is knowledge: for what is taught in Christ is from God; and when I say taught, I mean from knowledge, whether from Christ or from the Spirit, it is one and the same; for what does Paul say, when he declares that both are the same (Romans 8:6)? "To be spiritually minded is life." For error, imprudence, and ignorance boil and rebel, and this (Romans 8:6) "the mind of the flesh," which is imprudence, and because it does not know God, is death: therefore, the mind of the spirit is life and peace: thus they are already joined, and are one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us prove that God is both knowledge and life, although Paul himself says (Romans 11:33): "Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" So it is said by the same (Ephesians 3:10): "The manifold wisdom of God." Hence the secret of God, hence Christ called wisdom, hence also (Ephesians 3:18): "That you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width, length, depth, and height, to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge." Thus, God is also knowledge, and knowledge frees us, but through Christ, because He is both knowledge, and the gate, and life, and the Word, and all things through whom all things were made.
  </p>


  <p>Therefore, we should both know these things and also have love in Christ. These and many other things show that God is knowledge, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, and also life, as is clearly shown by one example; for in other books we have proven it more abundantly. <s>(John 5:26)</s> <s>Just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son also to have life in Himself.</s> <break time="500ms"/> Likewise, it says <s>(John 6:58)</s>: <s>As the living Father sent me, so I live because of the Father.</s> <break time="500ms"/> These things are thus singular, as all three are singular. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one substance, God, the Word, the Paraclete. They are one, which is substantiality, vitality, blessedness, silence, but a speaking silence, the Word, the Word of the Word. What also is the will of the Father, if not the silent Word? <break time="500ms"/> Therefore, in this way, since the Word is the Father, and the Son is the Word, that is, the sounding and working Word: therefore, I say, if both the Father and the Son are the Word, it is one substance. </p>
  <p>Then <s>(John 5:30)</s>: <s>My judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.</s> <break time="500ms"/> Therefore, one will, hence one substance: because will itself is substance. But the Word itself is shown to be life in this way <s>(John 5:40)</s>: <s>You do not want to come to me to have life.</s> </p>
  <p>Then also, the whole mystery of this is what I explain <s>(John 6:37)</s>: <s>All that the Father gives me will come to me.</s> <break time="500ms"/> Because truly, the same motion is what being is, and being is motion, and because by a certain intelligence being is first, from that which moves, but first according to the cause: therefore, the Father gave to the Son both motion, who has and what being is. Therefore, motion is the Word; thus he who has motion has being. Being, however, is life and knowledge: therefore he has all things, because he has being from the Father: therefore the Son fulfills the will of the Father. And what will, except that since the Father is life, His motion is life? This is the will, to make others live. </p>
  <p>This therefore and of the Word, that is, of Christ <s>(John 6:39-40)</s>: <s>What is the will of the Father who sent me? That I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</s> <break time="500ms"/> But to see Christ is to know God the Son of God, life, and the God of life; and this is to have received the Holy Spirit, the Word, which is life. Hence it is proven <s>(John 6:69-70)</s>: <s>To whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of God.</s> <break time="500ms"/> The whole mystery is Christ the Son of God, Christ the Word, and the Word itself, the Word of eternal life. Therefore, this Word which is life, and whoever hears and believes, surely knows God: therefore, he also has the Holy Spirit. </p>
  <p>Here the full faith is pronounced, indeed by the disciples. Also, He says to the Jews <s>(John 8:19)</s>: <s>If you knew me, you would know my Father also. You neither know me nor my Father.</s> <break time="500ms"/> And rightly so. For although the Son is in the Father, and the Father in the Son, existence or substance in life, and life in substance; yet since substance is invisible, it is not understood except in life. But life is more Christ, although also substance: therefore the Father is known in the Son. </p>
  <p>Why? Because you do not know me, nor the Father; if you knew me, you would know the Father also. What is this itself? You would know that I am from Him, because He Himself is also knowledge, which is the Holy Spirit.

    <p>
        How is it in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> (John 10:17-18)? "The Father loves me because I lay down my life to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again."
    </p>
    <p>
        It is clear that Christ was never called a soul, nor was God ever called a soul. Indeed, the Father is called God, and the Spirit is called God. Similarly, the Son is called the Word, and the Spirit is called God, undoubtedly God: since both are one God. Therefore, the Word and the Spirit are above the soul, with their superior substance, a substance very different from the soul's and inferior, because it was breathed and born from God, and it is the only substance truly called what it is, because it exists in its own forms, just like matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, God is life, Christ is life, and indeed life from Himself, but Christ has life from the Father who gives it to Him: therefore life is superior to the soul. For earlier, life and vitality existed before the soul: therefore God and the Word are of the same essence, the Father and the Son. Just as the Spirit is life and this life, and that life. Similarly, the Word and the Word, and other things. Therefore, the Spirit has the power to take, lay down, and take up the soul again. Indeed, life, and life from itself, has the power to take and lay down that which it makes live by its power and participation: for the soul was made in the image of God's image (Genesis 1:26): "Let us make man in our image and likeness." Therefore, it is inferior and more created or made by God and the Word. Never itself God or the Word. But indeed the Word, not the one who is the general or universal Son, and the seed, origin, and source of all things made through Him. Truly the Word of that soul: how or who, I remember saying, and I will say it in its place. Therefore, universal, because the spirit and life, not the soul, has the power to lay down the soul from itself and take it up again. Therefore, God and the Word, or because they are life or because they are Spirit, live and always live. Surely they live from themselves. Therefore, they are of the same essence. But the soul is of the same essence when it is taken by the divine, that is, by the Word, not indeed by God: for the Word is motion, and the soul is motion, and motion is from itself, hence the soul is the image and likeness of the Word. Therefore, when it is taken, nothing is added to life: for the soul's life is from life, that is, from the power of living. Therefore, when the Spirit takes the soul, it transfers its power and actions to the lower, as it completes the world and worldly things: therefore, the Spirit, and especially the Word of the Spirit, who is life, has the power to take the soul and lay it down: but when it takes it, it is as if it is born into the world, and its power speaks with the world: but when it lays it down, it withdraws from the world and does not work in the world carnally, nor spiritually. This we call its death, and then it is said to be in hell, not without a soul. Hence it asks (Psalm 16:10) that God does not leave his soul in hell. Therefore, because it is going to return to the world, it leads its act back with it from the underworld, thus it takes up the soul again, that is, the act, it takes the world again, and because the Word performs full and complete acts in the world, and who is Spirit, and soul, and body, therefore it was to be sanctified again, because it had taken these things up again. Therefore, it went to the Spirit, and sanctified, returned, acted with the apostles, acted after the Holy Spirit. Who then is the Holy Spirit? That is, the Word, for it is one motion, and thus it is said: and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again. For who came after Christ's departure, except the Holy Spirit, the Comforter?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is as I say: as the Father and the Son are one, so Jesus and the Holy Spirit are one: and therefore all are one, as John declared with the reading joined; for he began from the Word (John 14:6): "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." For who reaches that which truly is, and truly is being, which is the Father, except through life: for life which is true life, because it is eternal, this truly is being, for nothing changes, nothing is corrupted, which are kinds of death, life is being, true life is (Job 17:2): "He lives," he said.
    </p>


  <p>
    God. Therefore, life is God. And in the Book of <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 19, Jesus says, "I live," Whoever comes to Christ comes to life, and thus through life to God. Therefore, God and the Word are united. And hence it is said in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 15, verse 23, "Whoever knows me knows the Father." And in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 9, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." Hence also in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 11, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me?" Hence the mystical statement in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 14, "If you ask anything in my name, I will do it."
  </p>
  <p>
    What does it mean to ask in Christ's name? To become an eternal soul, to see the light of God, to come to see Him, to have eternal life, not riches, not children, not honors, nothing worldly, but everything spiritual, and everything by which we are united to God through Christ. For this is to be glorified in the Son, that is, eternal life, which I will give to those who ask.
  </p>
  <p>
    It then continues fully about the Holy Spirit, what it is, from where it comes, and what it is in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verses 15 and 16: "If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever." What is the Advocate, who asserts and strengthens before the Father all faithful and believing men? Who is this? Is it the Holy Spirit alone, or is it also Christ? For He said, "God will give you another Advocate." When He said another, He meant Himself; when He said Advocate, He declared similar work and somewhat the same action. Therefore, the Spirit is the Advocate, and the Holy Spirit is another Advocate, and He is sent by the Father. Jesus, therefore, is the Holy Spirit: for the movement of the Spirit, whence also the Spirit moves, because the Spirit in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 3, verse 8, "blows where it wills." And He now says, "The Spirit of truth," and so His name is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit also of Christ, and the Spirit of God, therefore all are Spirits. But God is substantively Spirit: for in Him is both substance and movement: or rather the substance itself, which is movement, but remaining in itself, as we have often said and will often repeat for the sake of retention. But indeed, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are truly moved movement; hence working externally, but Jesus is an open spirit: for He is also in the flesh: but the Holy Spirit is hidden; Jesus indeed who infuses understandings, no longer who makes signs, or speaks in parables, teaches that He Himself is, in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 18, "I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you." But He teaches that He is hidden in the Holy Spirit in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 19, "The world will no longer see me, but you will see me, because I live, you also will live." This is also given to the Holy Spirit in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 16, "that He may be with you forever, the Spirit of truth." And He said of Himself in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 6, "I am the truth." Then He added in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 19, "Whom the world cannot see." And He said of Himself in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, "The world will no longer see me." Then He added in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 17, "Because it does not see Him, nor know Him." But no one knew Christ either in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 1, verse 11, "He came to His own, and His own did not know Him." He added in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 17, "You will know Him, because He remains with you, and is in you." And He said of Himself in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 19, "You will see me." And because Christ is life, He added of Himself in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, "Because I live, you also will live." And because the Holy Spirit is understanding, but the world itself lacks both, He added in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verse 17, "Because He remains with you, and is in you."
  </p>
  <p>
    But how is the Holy Spirit either in them or now remains, if He is yet to come later, and has not already begun to be with them through Christ? Therefore, they are united and from one, who is movement. This is explained more clearly in the following, for He says in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 14, verses 25 and 26, "I have spoken these things to you while remaining with you. But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things that I have said. I," He says, "remain in you." For life is given, and Christ no longer departs from them: therefore, they are also with spiritual movement, which is Christ remaining in them: but the souls themselves, in which the spirit remains, never depart, yet it is said in <w role="amazon:NN">John</w> chapter 16, verse 16, "Now I go to the Father."
  </p>
  <p>
    What this means can be easily understood.
  </p>


  
    <p>
      If it is understood from the mystery and the physical mystery:
    </p>
    <p>
      For spiritually, since He is in the Father, and the Father in Him, where, or why would He go? From the same mystery, it is that the Spirit came to Christ in the form of a dove, and that now the Spirit will be sent by the Father, and will be sent to the Father, with Christ going and asking for it to be sent: for life is recalled from death, and life is not the same as life, because the Word is life: for this does not know death, rather this itself kills death; but the life that rose from death in people. Which He certainly took on together with the body, and He reclaimed it from the underworld. Therefore, to sanctify this, He had to go to the Father, but physically and naturally, that is, in that which was to be penetrated potentially and existentially in the Father Himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus He went to the Father. Finally, the time of absence was not prescribed, but rather it was stated (John 20:1, 17, 18, 19, 20, 27, 29), that on the night following the Sabbath He appeared to Mary, not wanting to be touched until He went to the Father: Mary announced to the disciples: on the same night He came to them, showing His hands and side, certainly no longer forbidding to be touched. Later, Thomas touched and felt, indeed at His urging, because he doubted, which signifies that He had already been sanctified. How brief therefore this time is, but it was said for the mystery: I will go to the Father: for since He is in the Father, and the Father in Him, where will He go? Therefore, by the same mystery: whom the Father sends to you, because the Father sends, when Christ sends. Finally, He says: The Father sends in My name, that is, for Me: or in My name, since the Spirit is Christ, and He Himself is the Holy Spirit; or in My name, because the Holy Spirit Himself will bear witness about Christ, for it is said (John 15:26): He will bear witness about Me. Who is He? Whom I send to you from the Father: all are united: I send, I send from the Father, I send the Spirit of truth: therefore, the Word, that is, Jesus Himself sends; for the principal and universal movement which is vital and life itself, sends the movement of intelligence, which as He taught, is from life and is life itself: to know what it is, this is to live, this is to be. But what is this being, than to be from the substance of God, which is to be Spirit? From which we become spiritual, having received the Spirit from Christ, and hence eternal life: therefore this Trinity is called the Spirit. For it is said (John 4:24): God is spirit. Also said by Paul to the Corinthians in the second letter (Second Corinthians 3:17): Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. Certainly these things about Christ, indeed He is called the Holy Spirit who sanctifies the Saints, that is, makes them Saints; and certainly He is the Spirit of God: for He is called prudence, wisdom, and knowledge of all things, for it is added about Him (John 16:8-10): He will convict the world about sin, and about righteousness, and about judgment. About sin, He says, because they do not believe in Me, whether that Christ is life, or that He is the Son of God and sent by God, and who forgives sins. About righteousness, because I go to the Father: for so many in the mystery of the passion, because He kept and fulfilled the faith of the commandments: for when He said, while wanting something else (Matthew 26:42): Your will be done. Also because leaving those warned, no longer to be seen in the same way, it was righteousness to go to the Father, and not only to go to the Father, but already to be with Him: For it is said therefore (Matthew 26:64): He sits at the right hand of the Father. About judgment: because the prince of this world has been judged: for by the mystery of the cross all powers opposed to Christ have been triumphed over by Christ Himself. These, He says, the Holy Spirit will teach. What is chosen? The mystery of salvation is completed by the Paraclete, and what Christ did not complete is cut off: Or because Christ Himself is the same as the Holy Spirit, or because He sends Him, or because the Spirit has all the things of Christ? He has all things, celebrated through Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet let us see what He will do, the Spirit will give knowledge of deeds, and the insinuation of knowledge, as the force of testimony, and will rather hold judgment, either for repentance or for punishment; about sin, He says, because...

        <s>therefore everyone who is baptized, and claims to believe, and receives the faith of truth, that is, the Holy Spirit, becomes holier by the Holy Spirit, and therefore it is said in the Acts of the Apostles 1:8:</s>
