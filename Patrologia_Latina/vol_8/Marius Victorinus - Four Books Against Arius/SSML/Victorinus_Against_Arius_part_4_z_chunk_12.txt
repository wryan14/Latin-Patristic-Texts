  <p>
    We have discussed these things fully in other books. But now we will briefly summarize them. Before the being and before the word, there is the power and potential of existence, which is signified by the word which is "to be," in Greek "to einai." This very "to be" must be understood in two ways: one, as universal and primarily principal, from which in other things there is being, and another being is for other things what it is, of all genera or species, and of such other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the first being is so unparticipated that it cannot even be called one, nor alone, but by preeminence before one, and before alone, beyond simplicity, preexistence rather than existence, the universal of all universals, infinite, unbounded, but to all others, not to itself: and therefore without form it is heard by some intellect. And it is perceived rather by pre-intelligence than by intelligence, it is known, it is believed.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what we said lives or is alive, that infinite, that which is above the living of all universals is itself being, itself living, not anything being, or anything living, hence not "being." For certain is also something that is being, intelligible, knowable. Therefore if not being, nor word, for word is defined, and definer: whether it is reason, or the power of existence itself, or those things which intelligence receives, so that each thing has its being: it knows what it does not know, unless it perceives and understands what those things are, which give each thing its substance: and this is the word of things through which all things were created, the universal power, containing universally the things of all, giving to each its own and proper existence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore because it gives to each its own and proper existence, it defines and determines, it also makes that being. By imposing a limit on the infinite things for their existence, it forms each thing, and by removing infinity it subjects intelligence. There is therefore in it the power of things to bring forth and make existences the word; from it, however, that defines, and concludes each thing giving form, being, it is now existing, when it has a certain form of what it is to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since this is the case, let us see if there is no word of the first which is to be. If we say infinite, if we say immeasurable, indiscriminate, we do not grasp, do not hold the things which consist in being: therefore it has no word. But since it cannot be, that it exists in any way and without its word this very existing which it is, it is infinite, without a doubt it has its word, but hidden, and occult, so that in it which is being itself the word is; or rather the word itself is nothing else than itself being: this is what I said truly first, that and universally universal living, although, as we taught, it is itself living, and life, and defined intelligence: for the power of the word; indeed it is something defined and formed: intelligence indeed and defining: yet because these are inside, and turned into themselves, all things are unknown, indistinct, unknown and indiscriminate: so also God who is being, that is, living, is unknown and indiscriminate; and its form, that is, the intelligence of life, is unknown and indiscriminate: for these are nothing else than being, which is living. Since it is infinite, and its form is infinite, remaining there, and nothing else than being existing.
  </p>
  <p>
    But when it begins to be outside, then the form appearing is the image of God, showing God through itself; and it is the word, no longer towards God, in which there is life and intelligence, now being; because certain knowledge and existence, which is grasped by intellect and cognition: but since these have existed outside, and whether that form, which is inside emitted, is outside, or it cast out itself? but since that inner form is indiscriminate and infinite, how and in that which is outside, it is known, or another from?
  </p>


  <p>
    Is this so? But if it is something else, then it is not born from that one, either by emission or by its own movement. And if so, then it is not a part of the other, nor the same, nor entirely of the same substance. Then from where did this appear?
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, are there two principles from the other, or from nothingness? Nothingness does not exist under the God of beings. Then if it existed by God's power or will, it is not nothingness. For if God is omnipotent, His omnipotence is the cause of everything, and it itself is existence. Shall we then dare to say that this form arose from itself? And how, when it was in the Father, without the Father knowing, or by His command? If by His command, then it did not arise from itself. Or without His knowledge? Therefore, there is something that was not by God's power, or something that existed without Him. Concerning the Word, which is said to be His form, it is written: <break time="500ms"/> All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made <break time="500ms"/> (John 1:3). What is this? What is the separation of such confusions? If it is not the truth or the life of truth, let the Holy Spirit be present. Whatever is inspired in us, let the listener now pay attention, we expound it with pure simplicity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, I advise one thing. It is fitting to understand these things without time, from eternity always without any beginning of time, but so that both principles, the begetter and the begotten, are one. First in eternal matters, especially divine and foremost, they remain at rest, and in that in which they exist, they generate without any change by movement. First God, then the Word, or Mind, or whatever the other is, or both, as spirit, as living, or life, as intelligence, or knowing. But the soul alone has motion and generations. All these things are like a house: God is threefold in power, that is, having three powers, to be, to live, to understand. So that in each there are three, and He Himself is one, taking any of the three names by which He presents Himself, as I have taught above, and to those many. For nothing should be said to exist unless it is understood. Therefore, a threefold singularity in each, and unity in the Trinity. But we will explain these three in their progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all things that are, and that can be, or could have been, their existence, life, and intelligence are granted according to the capacity of things and substances, and their participations. For in all things there is their being, their living, their understanding, and their feeling, so that these are a shadow or image of the three highest things. Therefore, since God is, as is said by all, one, and only one. However, some have said that God is one and all, and not even one. For He is the principle of all things, from which not all, but in that way all. This, however, is for this reason and first indeed, that God is one and only. Those three, because they do not consist by conjunction, but by existing as they are, and what we believe the other to be, they are necessarily one, and not in any way the other. But this has often been said. What is indeed said to be one and all, and not one, as He is the principle of all things, clearly and openly declares, the Father of all things and the principle of God. Who, although He is not one, is more all. Because He is both the cause of all things and the principle, and in all things everything. Since this is so, God will be all, existing, all-living, all-seeing, and all-knowing. And since we have said that power is brought forth by act: for thus the first things are, that since all things are from divine energy, that is, act and operations; it is necessary that from God, the principle of all powers, the source and origin of all universals are born. This indeed is the progression of things, that since all things are from God, powers and acts from God, who is accepted above powers and acts, these are believed to have arisen.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since we have said that God is a certain act, which is living, but this living which is above all living, and from eternity, and forever, living together with understanding accepted, and with that which is being, and with that which is understanding, but so together, that not even the fantasy of conjunction exists. But necessarily by the act of living, as I have taught, the form which we call universal power is confessed and exists, formed by each of those, which from all existence, from all-living all-livingness, from all-seeing all-seeingness. These individual powers are as known and determined. But since all things are in one, or one.

      But to be knowledge cannot be, unless it is knowable: in these first where being is, that is living, and understanding, being knowable cannot be, unless knowledge itself is not yet apparent, but holding itself within, remaining quiet, resting, and turned to itself making itself knowable.

  </p>


  <p>To be is either to live or to understand. Among beings, it does not see with a shifting view because it is also at rest. From the center, simultaneously, in all things one is seen. This is God. But how God is the Father, and who the Son is, or how the Son, and later how Jesus is the Son of all, to be the beginning, before all things to be, is of all to be. The beginning is not so much to be at rest as to be rest itself. For all things that are born or made are born or made from motion. But motion itself, the place where motion is, before it is moved, is at rest. For the birth of contraries is the destruction of contraries, so that by the contrary birth the contrary from which it was born perishes. Not to be, so from life comes death, and from death comes life. Likewise, from what is to be, and from what is not to be, it would be. And likewise, from rest comes motion, and from motion comes rest.</p>
  <break time="1s"/>
  <p>25. But let us consider more sharply, and with bold intelligence see the force and height of things. As these things are proposed, if a diligent observer pays attention, he will find that there is a certain existence even in these, whose fantasy is to perish. For when life is present, to which to be is added, from which death is born, there is also to be death, if from death life is born. Likewise, if from what is to be, non-being is produced, necessarily there will also be non-being itself, if from it is born what is to be. Likewise, if there is cessation, it is necessary for motion to be cessation, if motion is born. What then? Are not contraries believed to be born from the birth of contraries, or to die, or not to be? It seems so, but it is the opposite: for both remain, nor do they perish from their eternal substantial quality. How this is, I will say, God be present, the explanation will be easier. To be in eternal things, this is to be, which is to live, which is to understand. We have often said and proved these things. But to be so there, that there are living and understanding substances: let us take these as existing things to provide three things, and by their participation to retain all things, and to flourish in the intellect, to be simple, divine, eternal alone. In worldly and material things indeed to be present, but to be sustained by various and mortal bodies. Here therefore, if there is death, it is the death of bodies; and if more intention is applied, not even of bodies, that is, in what they are matter, but of these bodies, in the form that now is; the dissolution produced by a certain destruction. Therefore, only the form of the body is dissolved when it is dispersed into elements. They remain and are from where life is repaired. For since in the world and matter exists, which always exists in certain elements, and since the images of those three, here also, that is, in the world, appear, what does death do when even in their images they are eternal? I say images, powers flowing through all things from the lines of the soul. Since therefore these are eternal, the elements are eternal in matter. Death, if it dissolves only the compound, completely perishes. Hence it is rightly said, that from life death is produced, that from the vigor of living any compound of a body is made up to a certain dissolution, and again from death a new composition is made from the same things. In this way, both being in the world should be accepted, in this way here both rest and motion. But in divine things, because there are no bodies, there is no death, but life in another way, since that is principal and true. And therefore there progress is not natal, or if you prefer, natal more appearance and manifestation. Likewise, there to be in another way, and not to be, and in another way motion and cessation. For God lives; that is to be and to understand, which these three make up one, three powers: existence, life, understanding.</p>
  <break time="1s"/>
  <p>26. But because I have taught how those three are one: one thing is three in any way, so also these three are one. But in God these three are to be, in the Son to live, in the Holy Spirit to understand. Therefore, to be, to live, to understand are to be in God. Existence, life, understanding are forms: indeed by the inner and hidden act of that which is to be, to live, to understand: inside they are so and hidden, and more above to be, and above to live, and above to understand God is. Hence also <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ænʌsɪˌoʊs">anousios</phoneme>, or <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ænʌpəˌkrɒtəs">anupakrtos</phoneme> and likewise <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="æzɒn">azon</phoneme>, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ænˈuːs">anous</phoneme> is said, found by a certain pre-intelligence, and more by its form.</p>


  <p>
    Clinging, but inherent and consubstantial to itself. And this is what the Son is in the Father: that being the case, the Son is the same as the Father. Hence, the Son is God, because this is the form, because it is of the same nature. For, since God is being, living, and understanding, and form is existence, life, and intelligence, I wish you to understand me to say this, that God is above these things. If this is so, form becomes the same as substance. For these things, having or existing, being, living, and understanding, are equally valid and the same. Thus, when there are two reasons, one by which something is, another by which it is how it is, nonetheless, as it has the same power, how and what each thing is, it necessarily becomes one reason, form being the same as substance. Therefore, if it is the same, and the form is the same, of that substance as the substance itself, for the form is substantial, the Son will be the same as the Father, or neither the Father nor the Son before proceeding forth, but one and the same alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    This being so, since understanding and intelligence are the same to Him, intelligence is the same as life and being. But since the power of acting is greater, understanding is greater than being, than living. And since this being is to understand what it is, and this is living, understanding what it lives, necessarily, understanding, or intelligence, is God. Since God understands Himself, and when He understands Himself, not as one person understands another, it is that intelligence itself understands itself. When this happens, it makes itself be, and comes into existence, and becomes what it is to itself. And in the same way, by understanding, it exists and its own life, all of which are born from itself, or rather, existing from itself. God is unbegotten, existing from the unbegotten, which being one, are one and simple, one God, and this is like internal intelligence, which without any movement understands itself. For when it understands, it exists, and when it exists, it understands. And this is God, and certainly this is from eternity and to eternity.
  </p>
  <p>
    But since we call the Son the image of God, for He is a generated form, that from what is being, living, understanding, existence, life, and intelligence is generated. For there is a certain form in these, through which, as through an image, it is understood what it is to be, to live, and to understand. Necessarily, God is understood through the form, for no one has ever seen God <break time="500ms"/> <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dʒɑn">John</phoneme> <sub alias="chapter one verse eighteen">1:18</sub>. Therefore, when the form of God is taken in God, it is God. But when God understands Himself, He understands Himself through the form. But the form itself must also understand. For understanding and living existence, since it understands nothing else but what these things are, is God. And I have often taught this already. But when intelligence itself understands that it is intelligence (for it necessarily follows that intelligence also understands itself), as if existing from itself, it understood itself, and made itself outside, which is outside by its own movement, by understanding itself. Hence this external intelligence, and this is the Son, this is the reason, the Son born, because He is other than God, from God nonetheless, that is, from what is existing. And living, intelligence, which is God, and inwardly by understanding itself, intelligence projected itself outwardly, and existed to the Father, in whom it also was, and always is the image existing through internal intelligence, which is being and existing, and therefore the generated image of the image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, there are two intelligences, one existing within, which is its being, the other existing, which is its being by understanding. This one outside, this is the Son. But since by understanding itself intelligence understood God, certainly internal intelligence, and that is God, it understood also true being, and true living, and by understanding truly existed and itself true being, true living, true understanding. For He who understands one thing, and has one thing, and is one thing, according to His understanding with Himself, thus, the Son, that is, intelligence, generated by understanding itself, understood God, and all those things that are unbegotten God. And by understanding the fullness by seeking, and by understanding the fullness, hence He became the same as the Father. For since the Father is fullness necessarily, He has His place in.

  Finite, albeit finite in itself:
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Where it holds and contains its fullness, and in the same way,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The Son, by receiving and seeking: this is indeed
  <break time="500ms"/>
  To receive space, to exist, by understanding everything that
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The Father is fullness. He was begotten, and He Himself
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Is whole from the whole: and because intelligence is understanding
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Intelligence, since light of things is intelligence,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Light exists from light: and because intelligence
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Is both, true light from true light. Also,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Since God is intelligence within, by understanding
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Itself, intelligence is God from God: therefore, consubstantial
  <break time="500ms"/>
  In everything, in being, and living, and understanding.
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Also in that both are space and fullness:
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Also in that both are image and image: for it is said
  <break time="500ms"/>
  <phoneme ph="ˈdʒɛnəsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> 1:26, "In our image." And in that both are light and light, and in that both are true light
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And true light, and in that both are Spirit and Spirit:
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And in that both are motion and motion, but the Father is motion
  <break time="500ms"/>
  At rest, that is, internal, and nothing other than
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Motion, not moved by motion, but the Son is moved
  <break time="500ms"/>
  By motion, yet both are motion. Also, both
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Are action and work, both are life, and both have life
  <break time="500ms"/>
  By themselves, will and will, the same power,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Wisdom, Word, God, God and living God,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And living God, from eternity and from eternity, invisible
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And invisible: for it is said by <phoneme ph="ˈmæθju">Matthew</phoneme> 11:27, "No one knows the Son except the Father, nor the Father except the Son,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Both together: for this signifies consubstantial, beyond
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The same essence. All these can be understood by that fullness

  <phoneme ph="ʤɑn">John</phoneme> 16:15, "All that the Father has, He has given to me."
  <break time="500ms"/>

  He says: if all, the Son is consubstantial with the Father: Therefore the same:

  Jesus Christ <phoneme ph="fɪˈlɪpɪənz">Philippians</phoneme> 2:6, "Who, being in the form of God,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Did not consider it robbery to be equal with God."
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Many divine and magnificent mysteries
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Are contained here. First, that Christ is in the form of God,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  In which it is shown that He has everything that God has:
  <break time="500ms"/>
  For this is also said to be the image, as it is said of Him
  <break time="500ms"/>
  <phoneme ph="ˈsɛkənd kəˈrɪnθiənz">Second Corinthians</phoneme> 4:4 and <phoneme ph="kəˈlɑsɪənz">Colossians</phoneme> 1:15, "Who is the image
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Of God." Therefore, God also has His image: and the Son
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Is the image of God, for it is said <phoneme ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme> 33:20, "No one has ever seen the face of God." And it is said <phoneme ph="ˈɛksədəs">Exodus</phoneme> 33:23, "You will see my back." Without a doubt, there is a face
  <break time="500ms"/>
  For God, there is for the Son, or rather, the Son is the image of God, as
  <break time="500ms"/>
  It is said, "Who, being in the form of God." Hence rightfully
  <break time="500ms"/>
  It is said <phoneme ph="ˈdʒɛnəsɪs">Genesis</phoneme> 1:26, "Let us make man in our image
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And likeness." Therefore, the Son exists, and if another,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Exists: for the Father is not the same, the Son is not the same: in all those things
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Above mentioned by me, the same, but the same means
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Having the same existence of His own. Hence both
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The same, and different: for here it is said, "Being in the form
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Of God," indeed, it must be understood that the form is one thing,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  God another. But if you look, there is a place for calumny, that
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The form of God is in God Himself, so that there is one and indistinguishable
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Substance. How shall we understand the following?
  <break time="500ms"/>
  "He did not consider it robbery to be equal
  <break time="500ms"/>
  With God." In His own existence, He placed Himself, to believe Himself
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Or declare Himself equal with another. But what about that <phoneme ph="fɪˈlɪpɪənz">Philippians</phoneme> 2:7, "He emptied Himself, and took the form of a servant?" We understand
  <break time="500ms"/>
  This of Christ, who died, or of God?
  <break time="500ms"/>
  But no one ever said. Then when it is said of the Father,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Who raised His Son from the dead, is it not clear enough
  <break time="500ms"/>
  That one is the Father, another the Son,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  One is the raiser, another the raised? Therefore
  <break time="500ms"/>
  The form of God. One thing is the form, another is God; and indeed,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  There is a form for God, but the Son is the form of God manifestly,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  But God is in secret: for thus everything both existence,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  And life, and knowledge of God is inwardly in secret, but in the Son manifestly: and thus the other things, space, fullness, image,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  True light, truth, spirit, motion, action,
  <break time="500ms"/>
  Operation, life, and life by itself, will, power,

  In that, which...


    <p>The Son has from Himself, he says, but</p>
    <p>he added <s>John 5:26</s>: <s>"The Father gave Him to have life in Himself."</s></p>
    <p>Thus, true image and existence are the same in all things,</p>
    <p>but given by the Father: therefore both the Father and</p>
    <p>the Son are of the same substance, but given by the Father. For from what we have said, the Father</p>
    <p>is, lives, and understands; existence is begotten,</p>
    <p>as life and intelligence: and this is the form of God, this is</p>
    <p>the Son: but the Son, when He is in the Father, is one whole within,</p>
    <p>God acting, working, using Himself, enjoying Himself, the source and</p>
    <p>in Himself the fullness of all things.</p>
    <p>But since, as we have taught, intelligence by the power of its</p>
    <p>potency, necessarily while turning towards itself,</p>
    <p>understood itself, this in a way made it double,</p>
    <p>as if inside and outside, the Son is, begotten from the existence</p>
    <p>of the Father: for existence is intelligence, which</p>
    <p>is also life: appearing and existing, therefore, is God from</p>
    <p>God. And since in any one of the three are all things,</p>
    <p>being, living, understanding: when intelligence begets intelligence,</p>
    <p>the Son is begotten, and the Son has all</p>
    <p>that the Father has, and has it from the Father. Likewise, since</p>
    <p>through all these things all things are created:</p>
    <p>for whatever exists, receives its being, its</p>
    <p>living, its understanding; the Son, being all these things,</p>
    <p>as the image of the Father, and being in active act, that is,</p>
    <p>to provide this to others according to the nature of their existence, is</p>
    <p>necessarily the Word to all and entire things, that is,</p>
    <p>the force and power through which what exists comes to be,</p>
    <p>through whom God made and makes all things, and</p>
    <p>without whom nothing is made. This is called by some active motion,</p>
    <p>the word, reasoning power. However, since</p>
    <p>when it operates, the Father’s force is within it, it operates within itself,</p>
    <p>from which many things are said, so that although it is by itself that it acts,</p>
    <p>yet it refers all to the Father, as <s>John 6:58</s>: <s>"The Father sent me."</s> And <s>John 6:38</s>: <s>"I do not do my own</s></p>
    <p>will but the Father's:"</p>
    <p>And a thousand such things. Let us consider</p>
    <p>this passage: we will find that it acts almost by itself,</p>
    <p>as on its own will <s>Philippians 2:6</s>: <s>"He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped."</s> And again <s>Philippians 2:7</s>:</p>
    <p><s>"He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, who had</s></p>
    <p>dominion."</p>
    <p>All these are acts of his own will.</p>
    <p>But it can be believed that he acts, since the Father is in him, from</p>
    <p>which are also those <s>John 10:28</s>: <s>"I give eternal life."</s> And <s>John 10:7</s>: <s>"I am the door"</s> <s>John 14:6</s>, <s>"I am the life, I am the truth."</s> Also <s>John 5:21</s>:</p>
    <p><s>"Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so</s></p>
    <p>the Son gives life to whom he will."</p>
    <p>These true, these diverse, and</p>
    <p>in all things more true, intelligence makes and the Son is in</p>
    <p>the Father, and the Father in the Son, yet as the Father,</p>
    <p>they are distinct and one, yet two, since</p>
    <p>one is the Father, the other the Son: just as the Father is the</p>
    <p>source, the Son is like the river, which flows from the source: in</p>
    <p>the source, like water that remains, and is still, pure,</p>
    <p>immaculate, without the appearance of bubbling, with a hidden motion</p>
    <p>flowing more openly through different paths, affected by the qualities</p>
    <p>and conditions of the lands it furrows, and in a way it suffers;</p>
    <p>so also the Son, with his own water, and with his own substance, which is the Father's,</p>
    <p>always pure, immaculate, impassible, in the regions</p>
    <p>through which he flows, places, whether supra-celestial,</p>
    <p>celestial, or intra-celestial, he now foams, as when encountering rocks,</p>
    <p>which are from the kinds of souls, he flows calmly in the fields. He thus receives</p>
    <p>passions, not in what he is substantially, but in</p>
    <p>action and operation. For when he completed the mystery of his advent,</p>
    <p>then he already endured passion, to empty himself,</p>
    <p>to take the form of a servant. So also the rest,</p>
    <p>in all of which there is act and operation.</p>
    <p>Although also in the first act of his existence, as we have taught</p>
    <p>in many books, there was passion from the withdrawal</p>
    <p>from the Father, whence darkness, that is, matter followed,</p>
    <p>not created. But this is more fully elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Now what has been asserted, what proved?</p>
    <p>That God the Father and the Son are of the same substance, but</p>
    <p>also that the Father is in substance, and the Son in that substance,</p>
    <p>but existing in Himself action, acting in action</p>
    <p>passion existed, never separated from the Father, from</p>
    <p>eternity both existing, and having existed, and being to come. In action, because</p>
    <p>He is within the nature of acting, and with the Father, or in the Father</p>
    <p>to be;</p>


  <p>
    Beyond this, it is said that both inside and outside, when he acts, because the action is from the Father to him, it is said that he acts with the Father acting. Yet it is said that the Father does everything through him; that he is the Word of all things, universally of universals, of genera, of specifics, and of particulars.
  </p>
  <p>
    And because he is of all things, both incorporeal and therefore corporeal, according to their capacity to be, so they are the Word; whence also by the ordination of the mystery in the last ages, the Word, since the shadow of all existing things was incarnated by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary, he himself, whom we have shown above, the Son, in the same way to be in the body, as the Holy Spirit is in us, not entirely: for as God is everywhere, but as a part of him: for of all divine things, this part is always that which is the whole, as the soul is in bodies, as virtue and discipline in minds, or the sun or its light in the eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the Word itself, and the very one whom we have shown to be the Son, was in the body, all the Gospels declare, all the Apostles, all the Prophets. For when they predicted that Christ would come, they predicted that he would come in the flesh, indeed when they say he was seen and appeared in the flesh, as to Abraham, as to Jacob. And he himself said in the flesh <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">John chapter 8, verse 56</lang>:</s> 
    <s><phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈeɪbrəˌhæm">Abraham</phoneme> saw my day and was glad.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    And the Apostle, in this sacred and mystery-filled place, declares most clearly the Son of God before the flesh, and that he later took on flesh <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">Philippians chapter 2, verses 5 and 6</lang>:</s> 
    <s>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God.</s>
    Certainly this was when he was before the flesh, therefore he was before the flesh and was such and so great. Form, he says, of God. What is that? Form the same as the Father. What is form? In which the Father is seen <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">John chapter 14, verse 9</lang>:</s> 
    <s>Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    Certainly not in what was seen, but in that he himself is God, the divine substance, Word, life. Therefore this was before the flesh: for what does he add? He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped. Therefore he thinks of himself, and of God: he acts so that he is not equal, but was. What does he then add? But emptied himself <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">Philippians chapter 2, verses 7 and 8</lang>:</s> 
    <s>What did he empty? Or from where, if he was not?</s> He further adds: And took the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in human form. He humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. What here does not declare in every way Jesus Christ and the Son of God?
  </p>
  <p>
    For thus it is said <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">Galatians chapter 4, verse 4</lang>:</s> 
    <s>God sent his Son and sent him by his own power, and by his own will doing everything, so that he would not want to be equal, so that he would empty himself, so that he would take on the form of a servant: therefore he was the one who was the form of God, he was the one who emptied himself: and he himself is Jesus, who took on the image of a servant, and was found as a man, who submitted himself even to death, to be more fully designated Jesus Christ, even to death on a cross.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    These things are sufficiently proven to faithful men, that he was before the flesh, and that the same Son was in the flesh, he who was begotten before the ages, he who ascended into heaven, and descended from there, he who is our bread from heaven: he who in the flesh says <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">John chapter 17, verse 5</lang>:</s>

    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">John chapter 1, verse 1</lang>:</s>

    <s>He who became flesh.</s>
  </p>
  <p>
    You heard in the beginning, the Word, you heard that the Word himself became flesh: hear that he himself is the Son of God, and begotten of the Father, is that generation which we mentioned above. The evangelist says <break time="500ms"/> 
    <s><lang xml:lang="en-US">John chapter 1, verse 18</lang>:</s> 
    <s>No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.</s> However, we will say better in the bosom. The Greeks say in the bosom. But whether this word, or that, signifies both the begotten Son, which is to be outside, yet to be with the Father, when it is said: Who is in the bosom of the Father. Diligent and faithful inquirer will understand that all readings are so.
