I. If the divine scriptures were read simply, no one would ever misunderstand the reading of any chapter, but they would be received piously and justly as they are meant. There would be no philosophical disputes, no syllogistic arguments, no superstitious inventions: and never would there be any obscure discussions among people. All would be of one mind, agree with each other, and profess the same thing, as the most lucid reading reveals itself.

For our dear friend and companion raised a question for us, whether the whole world would have the same hours or not: "Indeed," he said, "I say, if it is the first hour here, the whole world would have the first hour. For it seems absurd to me to hear that different hours are said to be contained in the four parts of the earth. But I say, since all are habitable, how can it be proven to me that not all people hold one hour? But I say, when it is day here, show me in which part you assert it is night, when the entire sky is illuminated during the day. For Moses did not teach us otherwise in the book of Genesis, than that the day would be day in the whole world, and night would cover the entire world in darkness."

Therefore, friend, if these things you have said are enough for the question, I ask you to patiently allow and listen to what we say is true. Not so that you may catch human inventions, but rather to approve that they are divine words. Hence, if the reading is found authoritative, you have to grant us the place to speak, so you can more clearly learn how the most blessed Moses briefly indicated about day and night. For Solomon also teaches us saying:

Your good spirit is in all things; therefore, you correct those who stray, and admonish them about their sins by speaking to them, so that leaving their ignorance they may believe in the words of God

(Wisdom of Solomon, Chapter 12, Verse 1)

For all scripture is inspired by the Spirit of God, says the Apostle Paul, because it needs interpretation

(Second Epistle of Peter, Chapter 1, Verse 20)

. For Apollos was mighty in the Scriptures, who was also fervent in spirit: yet Aquila and Priscilla took him and explained to him the way of the Lord more accurately. For wise men are easily corrected. For the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.

II. Therefore, we explain in detail what the reading of Genesis teaches. But it is long to make a speech about what has been said above: and we should not now dispute about the heavens and the earth, the darkness and the abyss, water and spirit, because it is not yet time to speak of these things, but rather to respond to the proposed question and satisfy it. It is indeed that darkness possessed the whole world, as the reading of the previous text declares. For it was said: Let there be light, and there was light.

The wise ask where the light was made: for darkness was not substantive, as the philosophers say, and there was no material form in them: they are nothing. But let us not think with them, when the divine scripture says that God created darkness and made the heavens. What is made by God is believed to be substantive. Hence, if they are substantive, they were not reduced to nothing when light was made. Nor were they mixed together, because both are substances, which are contrary to each other even today, like heat to cold, or sweetness to bitterness. But when they are tempered together, they are recognized to be necessary for each other. Let the objection cease, if we said they are contrary in substance, but necessary in the creation of creatures, and in resting from all works. However, we show that when light was made, darkness was not removed, but rather the Scripture teaches that they were reduced to a part, that is, condensed in the middle of the world, so that the light made would illuminate the middle part of the world.

For the substance of God is not

There is a light of the world, which was made to possess the entire globe. But there is another light, the true one, which can illuminate the whole world, about which the Evangelist says: 
 "It is the true light, which enlightens every person coming into this world." 

Therefore, the true light illuminates the whole world, because darkness gives way to its creator: just as the sun will be obscured by the true light and covered in darkness. However, that which is not yet the true light could not, and indeed should not, illuminate the whole universe at once, lest a definite day be judged, but it should be set with the swift passage of hours. The weakness of the creature shows that it cannot encompass the whole world, and therefore it is recognized today to travel in parts.

But if it were to possess the entire globe with its light, it would never indicate an hour in any day. Whenever it illuminates the whole world, there would be no need to travel. According to this reasoning, which we have discussed, we can correctly understand the prophet Moses saying: 
 "And God separated the light from the darkness." 

But what is it to separate, if not to make a distinction between these? If he instituted a distinction and decided to call the light 
day
 and the darkness 
night
, then we hear one thing called by another name. Why was it not pleasing to call it something else if what was first announced sufficed? Later, he called it 
day
 as if it came to his mind. But let us not refuse to call it 
day
 with the given name remaining: which he followed up with a period of twelve hours. For today, even if it is called Sunday, it is not defined without the appropriate hours. Therefore, when you say 
day
, you set any specific hour up to the evening. Thus, my lord Moses says that the light was called 
day
, so that we would recognize that the use of twelve hours was called daily without fail. Finally, he adds: 
 "And there was evening, and there was morning, one day."

What if he calls it evening and later calls it 
day
, signifying the completed hours of that creation? For Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes asks: 
 "What has been done? The same that shall be: what has been, is what will be."

Therefore, my friend, if today the 
day
 is defined in this way, why do we not believe the prophet saying that it was made in the beginning as it is made today: there is nothing new under the sun, neither is anything added nor diminished? Evening remains until morning, fulfilling the hours of the night, and thus one 
day
 is definitively called, in which morning is not said to be of the first 
day
, but the beginning of the second is found. We ask whether our Lord worked during the 
day
 or at night? Certainly, if during the 
day
, that morning is not considered to be of the first 
day
, when the firmament of the sky is commanded to be made in it. But if the firmament was made on the second 
day
, the morning of the second 
day
 appeared. The balance of 
day
 and night was established: because of this, one 
day
 was called by number. Again, the scripture says: 
 "Let the water be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear," which he soon commanded to bring forth vegetation according to its kind, and fruit-bearing trees. In which 
 "there was evening, and there was morning, the third day."

Therefore, if you accept this morning as from the third 
day
, why does Scripture say: 
 "Let there be two great lights in the firmament of the sky, to give light upon the earth, to rule over the 
day
 and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years?" No one knowing the law would agree with you that the sun and moon were made on the third 
day
.

Perhaps if I ask you, you will answer me that they were made on the fourth 
day
 and insist that this morning is from the third 
day
. If this morning truly were from the third 
day
, our ancestors would never have professed that the sun and moon were made on the fourth 
day
. If they were made on the fourth 
day
...

This morning is not from the third day, but from the fourth, on which the sun, moon, and other things were made.

They divide the day and night in their beginnings. Thus, the Creator balanced them so that they would occupy and traverse the same amount of space in the world. They do not have a resting place after completing their duties but rather run endlessly within their limits.

The sun, which travels throughout the year, is known to be completed by the moon in thirty days. Returning to the starting point of the orbit, they did not rest after running the full cycle: or show that it is written, and I will rest. But you do not show it because you do not find it, as Solomon says: 
 "The sun rises, and the sun sets, and hastens to its place where it rises. It goes toward the south, and turns around to the north." 
 (Ecclesiastes 1:5).

If you think the sun sets, explain how it returns to its place. If you cannot grasp this, believe Solomon who says it goes toward the south and turns to the north: 
 “The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north; around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits, the wind returns.”

What more clearly can we argue when the prophet has briefly resolved our question, saying the spirit goes around the entire world endlessly? Thus, one day ends, and we transition to another morning, which is why days, months, and years were established.

Make yourself content with what our forefathers handed down, which we mentioned above, that this light does not cover the whole world but the middle. Therefore, wherever the sun looks, it becomes day and hours are made. As it travels, it changes the hours. If this is true, where morning has happened, it cannot stay longer because as the sun moves to other places, the hours always change, leading to evening.

The night follows, filling the hours. But when we see morning rise, we recognize the absence of darkness, and when evening comes, the day ends. Thus, the heavens are distinguished between day and night so that wherever the sun steps, it is morning; similarly, where the moon travels, it is evening, which is called the next day.

It is foolish to think that the night was made first according to the evening and then morning arose. If the evening had been made first, our legislator would not have hesitated to declare one night among the nights. No one despises what is first and principal and names what follows. Therefore, if humans do nothing like this, how do you consider that morning, made after, is called one day? Why do you not admit what you first read, that light was made and called day, and then darkness was called night? Night was not made before the day. Nor should you believe that evening came before morning, which was the first part of the day.

But scripture is silent about the morning. Instead, it reveals the reason when it commands light to be made. What else could the rising of light show if it did not define morning? Day could not be called outside of morning. Rightly, we say that when God called the light day, He included morning in it. For when the day ended, evening began, which, working through the night, reached the morning of the second day, in which the firmament was made. 

And although we have discussed the third and fourth days, on which the sun and moon were made, we should further investigate on which day man was made, whether the fifth or sixth, to determine if evening is prior to morning. For God said: 
 "Let us make man in our image and likeness. And God made man: in the image of God He made him."

He made them: male and female, and gave them all food for sustenance. And it was evening, and it was morning, the sixth day 
 (Genesis, Chapter 1, Verses 26, 27, and 31) 
. So, if this morning is from the sixth day, then man was made on the fifth day. For if man was made on the sixth day, it is confirmed that this morning is from the seventh day, on which God rested. But if not, show me here the works of the sixth day where they are, where everything that was said to be made on the sixth day was completed.

However, on the fifth day, I find that the waters brought forth reptiles and birds; not man, who was made from the earth along with four-legged animals and beasts of the earth. But if man was made on the fifth day along with the aforementioned, we neither find those things that the waters brought forth nor those that were completed on the sixth day. And how does Scripture say that God rested from all His works on the seventh day when I find that after man and those things made with man, the entire work which God had begun to do was finished? Therefore, if man and the aforementioned were made on the fifth day, we find that everything was completed on the fifth day, so that we may conclude that God rested from all His works on the sixth day.

But if you understand the evening after the creation of the waters, you could find not the beginning of the fourth day, but the beginning of the fifth night. If this is true, then this morning, which is called after the evening, does not pertain to the fifth day but to the sixth, because in it, Scripture teaches us that man was made. Hence, after the creation of this same man, it says that evening came, and morning, which is truly the beginning of the seventh day. For in that morning, God rested from all His works which He had begun to do: not in the evening which followed the sixth day.

Now, friend, examine the reading more clearly and satisfy your mind that night cannot precede day, nor evening the morning, in which the acts and works of the day are shown to be completed, and thus evening is called the following.

Finally, after the evening of the sixth day, it stopped mentioning it, just as with the morning, which the prophet openly and clearly declared to be the seventh day itself. Therefore, if it is not the same, now you explain about the seventh evening, so that it follows it and the morning. But if you do not find it, believe the reading that the seventh day itself is the one which after the evening is called the morning.
