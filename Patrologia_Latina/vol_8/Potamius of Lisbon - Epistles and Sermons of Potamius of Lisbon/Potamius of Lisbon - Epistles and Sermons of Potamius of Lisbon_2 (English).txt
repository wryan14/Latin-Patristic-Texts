Brothers, I am tormented by great amazement and wonder, caught in the swirling depths of confusion and care.

Lazarus is dead, a man close to God according to the Gospel of John 
(John 11:24)
, having paid the debt of his mortal body with the gesture of a forty-day fast.

As the end approached, what was owed to his earthly limbs, that is, more to the earth itself than to man, became clear.

According to the Book of Genesis 
(Genesis 1)
, the best solution for the clay from which we are made is to return to the ground.

While Christ was working His miracles in the regions of Judea, Lazarus was buried and entombed, so he might become what he was before, namely clay, ceasing to be what he had beenâ€”a formed body or a living story.

During the dark and gloomy days, through the cycles of four days, with the constant change of increase and decrease, Lazarus lay with his mouth gaping, teeth broken, and a foul smell emanating from his mouth.

Truly, as he was made of earthly material, his decayed body began to rot.

The pathways of his nerves and the miserable quality of his flesh condemned him to an unfortunate burial.

His contracted limbs stretched his skin tightly over his bony ribs, and the fluid released from his internal organs flowed as a foul and blue liquid over the corpse.

Alas, in those four days and nights, the body's corrupted parts, emitting a foul smell through the mouth, bile, and phlegm, could not produce anything but decay.

Even a beautiful rose, if plucked with a thumb from its bush, withers and loses its color and scent.

Water taken from a river soon perishes when removed from its source, losing its essence.

Similarly, when the spirit of wisdom that preserved a man with the fragrance of life departs, the clay body becomes a mass of decaying flesh, and the entire body succumbs to rot.

Therefore, through the diversity of things compacted into one mass, the nature of all body parts becomes inert.

When the soul, which maintained the body's vitality, departs, the entire material relaxes into decay, and the foul stench of death replaces the voice of the deceased.

The body, composed of earth, water, cold, and heat, is destroyed by these four elements in constant conflict.

Heat does not love cold, and cold is tormented by heat; opposites are bound together: earth is spoiled by too much water, and water becomes dirty from the earth.

These four elements, mixed into one mass, are kept in place by the soul, which, when removed by death, causes the body to disintegrate into its basic parts.

But because the Lord loved Lazarus in this world, He told His Apostles that Lazarus had fallen asleep 
(John 11:11 and following)
, promising that if He went to that city, He would awaken him.

Therefore, the sacred truth of God's mercy assured them that Lazarus, whose decaying limbs had weakened with blue veins, entombed in a cave with a heavy stone sealing the entrance, could rise again if they believed.

His sisters immediately...

The crowd of mourners, intoxicated with wailing, heat, fasting, and abundant tears, threw themselves at God's knees, prostrating their whole bodies in misery.

They mixed Hebrew words with broken Greek sobs, purifying their praises of the Savior.

How many people hurried there, I ask you? What kind of crowd was watching?

What kind of chorus could there have been for such a great miracle, where there were weeping girls, a dead brother, and Christ promising to raise a man?

Soldiers, Jews, Gentiles, proselytes, distinguished senators, noble judges, servants, and almost the entire city, I believe, came together eagerly to see if Lazarus, whose stench had already been wafting far from the tomb, could rise again.

When they saw it, the whole city was amazed.

How did you appear there, Christ Jesus? How golden, how beautiful, purer than a fountain, whiter than snow, brighter than the sun, and more brilliant than the moon?

Alas, why do I ask, since I did not deserve to see you then?

Now, however, I know who you are and how great your compassion is.

Look, in the midst of all this, Jesus Christ, the Savior of humanity, is said to have wept.

John
 11:35.

Come on, come on, Potami, servant of the living God: if you have any strength, tell at least a little about the praises of the Lord.

God wept, moved by mortal tears; and when he was calling Lazarus back from the chains of death by his power, he offered the duty of compassion through the comfort of tears.

God wept, not because he knew the dead man had perished before him, but because he was tempering the sisters' weeping.

God wept because the devil had taught sin to those he had given everything and had placed in power, even over paradise, flowers, and lilies without any toil, making nearly all of them exiles.

God wept because the devil made those he had created innocent to be found guilty through malice.

Alas, the delicate breeze from heaven, the body you ruled, you deserted with fading limbs.

But neither the Father nor the Son ever despised you.

For your death, even Christ himself became mortal.

At these tears and the scattered, pitiable hair of the weeping, the Savior, moved by compassion, responded to their tears with his own.

And because he himself was moved by the sisters' weeping, the fatherly nature of our Savior Jesus Christ was also moved by his son's tears among the heavens.

So Jesus Christ immediately went to Lazarus' tomb.

At his command, the stones were rolled away; the dreadful chamber was revealed.

Curious eyes were cast into the cave of the groaning people.

Lazarus was seen with his face covered, his hands and feet bound: and as proof of his powers, the dead man himself, still bound at his feet, as Christ had commanded, was unbinding himself with his own hands.

What voices, I ask you, brothers, were there? What pressure on the spectators?

How curious were the eyes of those marveling? What kind of crowd hung on the necks of those going ahead?

What weeping? What joy? What murmuring? How new and heavenly a miracle?

Death is conquered, man is restored, the chains of the underworld are broken, and after four days, the tongue of Lazarus moves, his hands are prepared for service, his eyes run in their sockets, his steps are freed, hearing is renewed in his ears, his gaze is directed at his parents, his relatives are counted with living looks, cold water is sought, bread is not refused, the home is sought, and Christ's miracles are recounted.
