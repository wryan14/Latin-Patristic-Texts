When Isaiah was preaching about Christ or announcing the sentence of future damnation to the people of Israel, the cruelty of the blasphemers was stirred. They violently sawed him in two from the head.

They ordered his neck to be cut from the head through the ears down to the shoulders.

As if piercing the martyr of God with a sharp sword or cutting into the innocent man's ribs with a cruel blade wasn't enough, they aimed to split his body into two nearly lifeless halves, cutting through the juncture.

In such a grand miracle of the heavenly arena, I think no one could see the spectacle of the result unless they tried to count the acts.

Therefore, with attentive eyes, observe the new celebration of passions from the old discipline; how noble, splendid, and strong that martyrdom was.

When the saw made its way at the head, the center of gathered senses, and with a back-and-forth screech drew furrows with its teeth, the blade slipped as it dug in. Through the hair, thick scalp, and calloused skin, it immersed in the Hebrew letters of the head's text.

Soon, as the diligent cutter aimed to reach the heart's bed, streams of purple fountain flowed freely from the loosened veins.

So that a profane thumb would not press the veins, a saffron rain poured abundantly, so the painting of the veins would not tremble or wonder at what made the defeated blush with shame.

The intricate connections of the pure young man's internal organs were exposed, the sound of the striking trumpet, profound vitality, and dry fasting of pleasures.

But Belias, son of Hezekiah, a bloody man and prodigal of genealogy, a mathematician of thieves, a priest of soothsayers and necromancers, was seeking within the sacred heart of faith, the assembly of preaching, the court of political letters.

And although the body was now divided into parts, it revealed the internal, disclosed the hidden, extended the obscure, and showed what made the defeated blush with shame.

So that the infamous persecutor could tear the man of God with alien teeth.

Nevertheless, the distinguished and illustrious prophet endured as long as it took for two to begin who would condemn the figures of the nations along with their persecutor.
