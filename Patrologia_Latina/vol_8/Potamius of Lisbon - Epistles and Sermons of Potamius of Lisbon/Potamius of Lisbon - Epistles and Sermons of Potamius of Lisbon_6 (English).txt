To the glorious and most blessed Lord Brother Athanasius, Bishop Potamius.

The pit of such a prison accumulates the raw filth of a damned workshop, as you rightly describe, the beginning and the bloody stench of the excrement of dead bodies, which hands of fiery virtues could have extricated or scraped away, unless your titles, achieved from exile with a crowned head, had excluded the sect of heresy with an 
anathema

You smiled upon us, I say, perfected in Catholic virginity, by slaughtering the faithless, condemning the perjurers. You conquered the corrupted minds of adulterers, ambiguities, and the lustful dealings of the accursed flock, damnably laden with poison, with the sword of one faith striking. 

Let the serpent lie, and the land that received it blacken with festering venom. Let the serpent lie, condemned by a heavenly blow. Let the serpent lie, touched with bloody horror. Let the serpent lie with its eyes crushed, its triple-mouthed bilge exposed, vomiting, draining out. Let the author of sins be tormented, for it was not enough that he deprived the first human of eternity, unless also the serpent, more virulent, broke out against the Savior.

He wished to separate our Lord Jesus Christ, as if the word of Christ could be cut, the bond of the Trinity's unity being fastened, as it is said in 
John
 10:30: 
I and the Father are one
. And in 
John
 14:9: 
Whoever has seen me has seen the Father
. And in 
John
 5:11: 
I am in the Father, and the Father is in me
. And in 
John
 1:1: 
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
.

A fierce butcher, a parricide deserter, with kite-like claws, as I think; or with unhealthy teeth, if he could, he attempted to tear apart. And after this, what shall I oppose to blasphemies? In 
John
 14:28: 
He who sent me is greater than I
. From whom is the Father born? Certainly, because the Son confesses; greater therefore because the Father is to the Son? Order is preferred, substance is not separated.

What do you say to this, infamous adulterer? Well that the antiquity of the fathers in a holier synod, inflated with the venomous will of impure virulence, also pierced you with chaste missiles. For here too you are taught to have laid traps of slander, as the Savior says in 
John
 6:38: 
I have come not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me
.

What do you say, serpent? Do you inject darkness into this light, this simple profession, which they think is a small matter? The time is at issue: the Savior among men, because he had put on the body of men, appeared in the body; therefore he said: I have come not to do my own works: did he deny the works of man in himself? He cries out therefore, to proclaim that arranger in himself, whom he remembers as his author Father in himself; because the Son follows in name, so he is greater who precedes; but both the sender and the sent, because the three are one, of the unity of divinity is one substance. In 
John
 10:30: 
I and the Father are one
. And in 
John
 14:9: 
Whoever has seen me has seen the Father
. And the Savior himself to the Apostles: All this time, he says, I have been with you, and you do not know the Father?

They also say that in the sacred books substance is never seen to be written. Return what you have stolen, most thieving tempter: behold, you are overcome to refute about substance; for indeed the good ancient flocks of the saints proclaim, as he says; the voice of substance from the birds of the sky to the cattle feared, and they cried out in 
Ezekiel
 12:11: 
I will give Jerusalem into exile
. Behold, when Christ God was not heard by the former people, the columns of Jerusalem fell with the inhabitants decayed.

Behold, wretch, though one sentence of God ought to have sufficed, which the holy prophet thundered in 
Jeremiah
 23:22: 
If they had stood in my substance, and they had heard my words, and had taught my people, I would have turned them from their many evil ways
. Behold here, the happy hearing of substance burst forth to the unhappy peoples, so that the prophet too, from the person of Adam, seeks Christ in tears in 
Psalm
 68:3: 
I am sunk in deep mire, and there is no substance
. Namely because the substance of the Father was not yet with Christ in the flesh.

Gathered together. Just like that Evangelist,

In 
Luke
 15, when he wasted his possessions by living extravagantly, he lost all his wealth.

As the holy prophet of God wrote in 
Wisdom
 1:5: "The Spirit of God flees deceit."

Therefore, he lost his wealth because he lacked holiness due to extravagance.

If it is enough for you, he said; for if you already feel it, everything is full.

If you still suffer, I emphasize; we read what is written in 
Ecclesiastes
 2:8: "For I gathered gold and silver and the wealth of kings and provinces."

This is that wealth, which the prophet mentions,

Saying in 
Psalm
 62:11: "God has spoken once, twice have I heard this."

In one voice, the prophet testifies to hearing these two things, as David says in 
Psalm
 45:1: "My tongue is the pen of a ready writer."

For just as the pen is guided by the even spacing of the teeth, and is facilitated by harmonious rays; so the Savior is united with the works of the Father in an inseparable connection.

For what the Father said, the Son declared; and what the Son spoke, the Father fulfilled.

Rightly, he said, "God has spoken once, twice have I heard this." Two persons carried one judgment, just as in the Decalogue one sentence is written on two tablets.

Let heresy, condemned to eternal silence, be struck down by divine blows, and cast into the abyss and Tartarus.

Only the ever-virgin mother, always with her laurels, one with God, a dove more fruitful in fertility, may she lift her crowned head to the clouds of heaven.

Blessed be she, united with the people in the unity of the Trinity; whose praise is full, from now and forever in the eternal ages to come,

May the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit bless.
