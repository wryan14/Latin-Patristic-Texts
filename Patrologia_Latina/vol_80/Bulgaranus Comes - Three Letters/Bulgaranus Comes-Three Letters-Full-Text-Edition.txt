Three Letters of Count Bulgaranus. Letter 1.

Meanwhile, we inform your holiness that common report has reached us: the virgin Brunhild and King Theuderic, spreading their usual bitter poison with malicious intent, have incited the most savage king of the barbarians to fight against the glorious King Theudebert, seeking to destroy a united people.
If this matter is truly unfolding as described, what is necessary except that before military weapons are taken up, all the people of God in this region should labor in prayer, imploring divine assistance? Therefore we ask that you inform us of the clear facts of the situation.
Then we too, made participants with the faithful and rising up with equal fervor of faith, together with all the priests, clergy, and the entire Christian population of this province, will approach the Lord, redeemer of all, with prayers through appointed litanies. We will ask that he extend the unconquered right hand of his power in defense of Catholics, and that he bring about the destruction deserved by the intention of the jealous, treacherous enemy. We will request that the authors of this conflict, stripped bare by the scheming of the ancient serpent, be laid low by the just vengeance of our Lord, made clear as an example to all around.
Please let us know more certainly: whether you have sent the letters directed to the glorious King Theudebert as you promised, or whether your messengers have already returned, what response you received, whether they are bringing back agreements to this place, or whether they have come to prepare for an audience with my most glorious lord King Gundemar. Also inform us how money is being prepared for you, so that we may truly, as we trust, shape reciprocal feelings of good will together with your blessedness and yours.

Letter 2.

Although the entire boundary of lands under the heavenly axis is seen to be established by the Lord as creator, and the division of all who flourish in power is confirmed by his marvelous ordering, it is nevertheless necessary that we, keeping his gospel voice, should both seek out and love those whom one faith in Christ unites. And however much we may be separated by temporal dominion of empire, it is fitting that we not be divided from the precepts of the eternal prince.
Therefore, we address your blessedness, flourishing with the spreading grace of heaven and abounding with spiritual generosity, whom we wish to bind in charity through this intervening letter with the Lord's favor. With these letters sent with greatest desire, we not only make inquiry but also share greetings with due discussion of necessary matters.
Christ has not undeservedly dedicated you as chief shepherd to his sheepfold, so that just as you excel through nobility of blood, most blessed father, so too you bear responsibility for the countless souls of his sheep. Indeed, such is the custom that persists for those to whom is committed greater or lesser care in oversight of peoples: that the more they are made sublime in divine regard, the more they ought to remain unceasingly vigilant concerning those over whom they are placed.
And because I do not think it is hidden from your blessedness that your son, lord Theudebert, has been bound together with the people of the Goths by princes falling away as in former times, he has now vowed through the representation of experts to strengthen perpetual peace through ambassadors of that same people. As a result, he has promised to bestow some amount of money as a gift of favor to the Frankish people.
Therefore I have already sent letters to your aforementioned son, lord Theudebert, through your venerable brother, a lord and true bishop who is a father to me in Christ. Through these letters I made known that money has already been sent by your son, my lord King Gundemar. He is known to me to be in Gaul, so that he may send prudent ambassadors from his presence. And that we might deliver at least to his appointed men all those things which the Gothic people hope for out of charity, he promises to hand over the agreements.
Therefore I ask your holiness with due humility that, as much as you love the Lord Jesus, who left peace for future ages after past ages, you would deign to attend delightfully only to the confirmation of this peace. And if you know that the letter we directed to lord Theudebert has arrived, or if those things which have been agreed upon with clear definition through the ambassadors of the Goths will remain truly as alleged, or to what extent your aforementioned son has triumphed in battle line against the Avars, may we deserve to be informed by your good will.
For indeed, it has become known to us through current popular opinion that Queen Brunhild and King Theuderic have summoned these same Avars to make war against lord Theudebert, and to migrate from their own territories into his province. It is unspeakable to declare to Catholic ears that persons under Christian religion, truly established far from the Lord, would provoke savages to rage against Christians. Nor do we believe they are better than those Avars, but we manifestly prove them to be allies who minister to the world the entangling bonds of owed crimes.
If therefore your holiness has clearly learned that an impious horde has poured out in hostility against the region of an orthodox prince by the counsel of the aforementioned kings, please declare this to us through your writing. Then in this province pertaining to our jurisdiction, belonging to your son, my glorious lord King Gundemar, let priests proclaim with the people solemn fasts to the Almighty, so that he may shatter with starry power the hearts of men who approach unjustly and far from the Lord, and who make war. And command that a praiseworthy trophy be conferred by heavenly mercy upon the people who guard the teaching of the Christian faith.

Letter 3. To the most beloved and most reverend father and bishop in Christ, from Bulgaranus.

It is known to the Lord Almighty, who judges the just servant and will destroy the unjust with just vengeance of condemnation, that some days ago—which I do not think has escaped your blessedness—letters from the most glorious kings and your same sons, Queen Brunhild and King Theuderic, were transmitted to us by the same messenger.
And the sequence of the aforementioned writings announced that we should hand them over as that man himself commanded, who brought the same writings of his lords to us along with his own petition. He humbly requests in writing our authorization to receive access to come to us.
For with no desire did he choose to seek us out, nor do we need to look into any matters with him. And even if he had come to announce a response from his lords, we would not have agreed. But since he scarcely hurried—for he is a most wicked man—concerning that man of yours for whom you seem to demand access to the presence of your son, my glorious lord King Gundemar: your mind ought to waste away at the very beginning of this proposal. For truth shines upon you with experienced light, and you conceal with unjust verbal excuses the justice which you perceive in the mirror of your interior self.
Who does not see through the character of your holiness, that you try to soothe with flattering snares of eloquence those things which you have made bitter by illicit actions? For we judge such dissimulation on your part, if you grant pardon for the expression, to be like this: as if some debtor, having removed human shame and driven by shamelessness, should strike the money-lender with preemptive objections, while the creditor who has the truth covers it timidly, and the slanderer is thoroughly shameless in speaking.
For there remains to your glorious son, my lord King Gundemar, and to the entire Gothic people not a small but a great claim for return of money. Noble ambassadors of that same people, traveling magnificently with the consolation of truth's favor, were unjustly captured by your prince. With doubled generosity of malice they endure every disgrace of banishment in the reproach of poverty.
Moreover, let it be clear that you imprisoned Totila and Gundirmir, illustrious men sent by my most serene lord King Gundemar, within your borders in a place called Irapinas, after inflicting contempt upon them. You shut them up by command and denied them access to come fully to you.
Behold, the things which your side has committed are not unknown to your minds. And while carrying so much bitterness of injury from you, you now complain in your dissembling letters about opening a way for your ambassadors to come to the presence of my illustrious lord.
Let the most high prince see this cause from his heavenly throne, and let him strike down with divine vengeance the party who is seen to have unjustly brought trouble upon the other party, and who by rejecting charity has deceitfully violated the peace beloved by the lofty power.
Although when I had received letters from your royal sons, I immediately composed a reply to them—whether the aforementioned glorious princes received it, or whether it was brought to your knowledge, we have learned from no one announcing it.
But we also declare to your honor that if you desire to keep peace with the pretense of simulation removed—which is known to be the greatest lot of lordship—and if you wish to remain fitted with devout heart in harmony with the Goths in love of Christ, it is not fitting that you merely speak these things with deceiving lips. Rather, you should demonstrate by completed works the peace into which you first broke while we were keeping it.
It is worthy of you that first the Gothic ambassadors be restored to their dignity, and that among a kindred people of blood keeping peace, with the Lord's help, the freedom of journey remain for your ambassadors, if necessary, to come to the presence of my glorious lord.
Now concerning the places about which you notified us, at Jubinianus and Cornelianus, which lady Brunhild is known to have possessed in the province of the Goths—that we should grant access to her men by her right after this: we marvel that your blessedness urges us to arrange this. For those places which our lord King Reccared of holy memory granted by right to the aforementioned lady for the stability of concord have now had the bond of charity disrupted by scandal nourished by your side. And the party which illicitly stirs up conflict should possess rights of the Gothic people?
For I judge that if you prefer to make amends for those things which your side is known to have unjustly committed, then the same lady Brunhild will be able by her own right to defend those places, with your people and nation joined in charity.
For you, most blessed man, whom we remember as being until now of benign spirit and vigilant in secular affairs and greatly fearing the Almighty—how can you take care, if in such times you are a bishop dedicated to God by princes to act for the unharmed charity of both sides, that the peace once bound together by the former leaders of both peoples now remains dissolved, when by your counsel it ought to have been strengthened to exist in perpetuity?
