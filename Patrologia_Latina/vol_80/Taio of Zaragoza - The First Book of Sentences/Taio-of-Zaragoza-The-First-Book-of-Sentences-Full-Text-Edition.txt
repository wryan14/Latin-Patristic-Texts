Chapter 1: God's Unchangeable, Supreme, and Eternal Nature

God alone is unchangeable in himself, because he alone possesses immortality. As the letter of James says: In him there is no change, no shadow cast by turning, from the first chapter, verse seventeen. And because mutability does not come to God, no shadow's shifting ever interrupts his light.
What is the changeability of things but a kind of death? For when something changes into something else, it kills what it was so that it may begin to be what it was not. But concerning the unchangeable God it is written: He alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, from Paul's first letter to Timothy, chapter six, verse six.
All the saints do not possess stability in themselves by nature. But when they earnestly desire to cling always to unchangeable truth, by clinging they act so as to become unchangeable. And when they hold to this truth with their whole affection, they sometimes receive the gift that, being led above themselves, they overcome the changeability they experienced in themselves.
Since God is of unchangeable nature, he is not disturbed in the wrath of judgment. But often in human language, God's emotion is called that very severity of his righteousness by which human wickedness is struck down. As it says through blessed Job: As soon as he stirs, you will be troubled, and his terror will rush upon you, from the book of Job, chapter thirteen, verse eleven.
God almighty, although he himself is eternity, how he is eternity itself remains unknown. For in what we hear about the power of the divine nature, we are accustomed sometimes to think of those things which we know through experience.
Everything that begins and ends is enclosed by beginning and end. If its ending is delayed by some duration, it is called long. In such length, when someone turns back the eyes of the mind through memory and stretches forward through expectation, the mind expands as if through a span of time.
And when someone hears of God's eternity, the mind straining in human fashion imagines long spans of life in which to measure always. But what has passed behind to be retained in memory, or what remains ahead to be expected from intention, the mind of human frailty cannot comprehend at all.
Whenever we think of past or future times in eternity, we have not yet known eternity. For there is that which neither begins with a beginning nor ends with an end, where nothing is awaited that will come, nor passes by that must be remembered.
There is one thing that always is. Even though we and the angels begin to see God with a beginning, yet we see him existing without beginning, where to exist always without end means the mind never stretches toward what follows, even if all things that exist were multiplied and made long.
Through the Spirit of prophecy it was said: Lord, you who reign forever and ever and ever, likely from the book of Exodus, chapter fifteen, verse eighteen. In the manner of sacred speech, the Spirit spoke to human beings in human fashion, saying ever where there is no expectation.
For eternity does not have what it always has in the sense of having it still. In eternity no part of its length passes away so that another part might follow. Rather, the whole exists simultaneously, so that nothing seems to be missing that it does not perceive. In eternity the mind sees everything that exists as neither slow nor long.
It is written: The Lord said to Moses: I am who I am, and you shall say to the children of Israel: He who is has sent me to you, from the book of Exodus, chapter three, verse fourteen. For God's being is to remain eternal and unchangeable.
For everything that changes ceases to be what it was and begins to be what it was not. But almighty God's being is to never be in a different way. For he alone truly exists who alone remains unchangeably.
Everything that is now one way, now another way, is close to not existing. For it cannot remain in its own state. And in some manner it goes toward not existing, since it is led from what it was to something else through moments of time.
Therefore, so that we may be something through participation in that essence, let us recognize ourselves as being almost nothing. The greatest virtue is to long for the joy of eternity, toward that to which nothing comes, nothing passes away.
Indeed, Truth, to pour into us somehow its always existing, hints through Moses as a mediator, as mentioned above, saying: I am who I am, and you shall say to the children of Israel: He who is has sent me to you, from the book of Exodus, chapter three, verse fourteen.
When the Psalmist looked upon God's unchangeable position in eternity, he said: You are the same, and your years will not fail, from Psalm one hundred two, verse twenty-eight. He declares this to be the place of the elect, saying: The children of your servants will dwell there, verse twenty-nine.
God most high, eternal and unchangeable, who contains all things without spatial location, remains to us who come to him a non-spatial place. When we reach that place, even the tranquility of our mind in this life shows us how great our disturbance had been.
For even if the righteous are now at rest in comparison with the wicked, they are not yet fully at rest when measured against the deepest rest.

Chapter 2: God's Immensity and Omnipotence

Almighty God has it within himself to arrange changeable things without change, to do different things without diversity in himself, and to form unlike things without any shifting of thoughts.
Therefore God, never unlike himself, works unlike things in very different ways. He is everywhere and is wholly everywhere.
It is written: Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool, from the prophet Isaiah, chapter sixty-six, verse one. And again it is written: He measures heaven with a palm and encloses earth in his fist, from Isaiah chapter forty, verse twelve.
From this we must consider that he who presides over heaven as over a throne is both above and within it. And he who encloses heaven in his palm and earth in his fist is outside, above, and below.
To show that almighty God is interior and superior to all things, he declared heaven to be his throne. Therefore, to show that he surrounds all things, he asserts that he measures heaven with his palm and encloses earth in his fist.
Almighty God is himself interior and exterior, himself lower and higher: higher by ruling, lower by carrying, interior by filling, exterior by surrounding.
Thus he is within so as to be without, thus he surrounds so as to penetrate, thus he presides so as to carry, thus he carries so as to preside.
Let us understand almighty God as within all things but not enclosed, outside all things but not excluded. He is interior so as to contain all things, exterior so as to enclose all things by his immensity.
Through being exterior, he is shown to be creator. Through being interior, he is demonstrated to govern all things. And lest created things exist without God, God is within all things. But lest anything exist outside God, God is exterior, so that all things are enclosed by him.
God does not fill heaven and earth so that they might contain him, but rather so that they might be contained by him. Nor does God fill all things in parts. But though he is one, he is nevertheless wholly everywhere.
Almighty God encloses all things by the immensity of his power, and no one will be able to find a way to escape his power, because he constrains all things on every side.
Within the omnipotence of divine authority, all things are constrained, whether those that must be kept safe or those that must be cut off to perish. Therefore we do not say that anyone can escape God in any way.
For whoever does not have him appeased will by no means escape him angered. Concerning the completion of some made thing, perfection is spoken of. But how is God, who was not made, perfect?
But human poverty takes this expression from our usage, just as with other words, so that what is ineffable might somehow be spoken. For human speech says nothing worthy about God.
God must not be thought to exist in all things in such a way that each thing receives him according to the size of its portion, that is, the greatest receiving more and the smallest less. Rather, he is wholly in the whole, wholly in all things, and all things are in him.
Though God is not spatial, he nevertheless walks locally in his saints when he is preached by them from place to place. For God, who is moved neither by place nor time, is nevertheless moved in time and place in his servants, as often as he is preached by them.

Chapter 3: God's Invisibility and Unlimited Nature

Almighty God is not at all perceived in clarity by lower beings, because he rules in higher realms. For it is written: Darkness is under his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew, from Psalm eighteen, verses ten and eleven.
For cherubim means fullness of knowledge. Therefore he is said to have ascended and flown above the fullness of knowledge, because no knowledge comprehends the height of his majesty.
Almighty God flew, because he snatched himself far on high from our understanding. He flew upon the wings of the winds, because he transcends the knowledge of souls.
While we are obscured by the darkness of our weakness, God is hidden from us through our ignorance, lest he now be seen by us in eternal, intimate, and unlimited brightness, as it is written: He made darkness his hiding place, verse twelve.
How can we see unlimited omnipotence, which we cannot comprehend at all? But there is something we ought to draw from bodily experience to spiritual understanding.
For if someone lies with closed eyes in darkness, and sudden lamplight bursts forth before him, his closed eyes are struck by the very arrival of light so that they open.
Why then were they disturbed if, being closed, they saw nothing? Yet it was not anything perfect that closed eyes could see. For if they had seen the whole thing perfectly, why would they seek when opened what they might see?
When we attempt to behold something of the incomprehensible Deity, by the very fact that the mind is struck by the brilliance of wonder, it both sees and does not see what cannot be seen, like one placed in darkness seeing the force of light with closed eyes.
Our creator, almighty God, has withdrawn from us the light of his vision and has hidden himself from our eyes as if in a hiding place of darkness.
We cannot yet see God, but we are already straining toward his vision if we marvel at him in the things he made. Therefore we call creation his footprints, because through these things that are from him, by following we go to him.
Hence Paul says: His invisible qualities are clearly seen through the things that are made, being understood, his eternal power and divinity, from Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter one, verse twenty.
To the human mind scattered outward by its sin, God has not yet made known what he is like inwardly. But when he sets forth the beauty of his creation outwardly, he signals to us as if by certain nods and shows what we should follow within.

Chapter 4: God the Father Almighty

The incomprehensible mysteries of divinity are separated from the knowledge of our weakness, and his power transcends created nature, because the height of divinity neither began to exist nor ceases, is neither born through a beginning nor confined by an end. God the Father almighty begot his Son without time.
And who can worthily speak of that ineffable birth, that the coeternal was born from the eternal, that he who existed before the ages begot an equal, that the one born is not later than the one begetting?
These things we can marvel at, but we can scarcely behold them. Yet to be able to marvel at the power of that birth is already, in some measure, to see it.
Whoever thinks the Son is less than the Father specifically detracts from the Father, for he confesses that his wisdom is unequal to him. For what powerful man would calmly endure if someone said to him: You are great indeed, but your wisdom is less than you?
The almighty Lord himself says: I and the Father are one, from the Gospel of John, chapter ten, verse thirty. And again he says: The Father is greater than I, from John chapter fourteen, verse twenty-eight. Concerning whom it is also written that he was subject to his parents, from the Gospel of Luke, chapter two, verse fifty-one.
What wonder then if, from his humanity, he declares himself less than the Father in heaven when by that same humanity he was subject even to his parents on earth?
Everything we speak passes away, what we write remains. The tongue of the Father is called the pen of a scribe, from Psalm forty-five, because from him is his Word, coeternal and begotten without passing away.
From the person of God the Father, David the prophet says: From the womb before the morning star I begot you, from Psalm one hundred ten. Not that God the Father has a womb as we do, or that he should be believed to be corporeal, but by womb he wished to be understood the substance from which the Son was born.
What the Father is, this he begot: God from God, light from light, God equal to himself from God, the Word with God, the Word of God through whom all things were made. Light from light, coeternal with him who begot, and one with him who begot.
And thus God the Father begot the coeternal Son not from nothing, nor from any other substance, but from himself.
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are appellative names. Although Father is said in relation to Son, and Son in relation to Father, these are called relative names.
But God is the proper name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, as it is written in the psalm: According to your name, O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth, from Psalm forty-eight, verse eleven.
Therefore the appellative names are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but the proper name is God, God, and God. It is written: Hear O Israel, the Lord your God, God is one, from the book of Deuteronomy, chapter six, verse four. In this testimony he united a threefold designation of God. It says Lord, God, and God. You have then what the Father is, what the Son is, what the Holy Spirit is. And immediately he added, he is one, who is, in the Trinity of persons one God.

Chapter 10: How Certain Human Attributes Are Applied to God

The power of divine majesty created all things without necessity, presides over everything without disdain, sustains all things without labor, governs without preoccupation, and corrects without disturbance. God shapes human minds to whatever purpose he wills, yet never passes from the light of his unchangeability into the shadow of variation. Divine words condescend to human terms so that mortals might somehow grasp the deeds of almighty God.
We should understand that God is not properly said to remember, for how can one remember who cannot forget? But because we embrace those we remember and keep at a distance those we hate, we use human language: God is said to remember when he bestows gifts, and to forget when he abandons someone in their guilt. Almighty God weighs all things and considers everything without interruption. He remembers the good, though he never actually forgets them, and in no way remembers the wicked, though he always beholds them in judgment.
God seems to return to the memory of the good, which he never truly abandoned, and seems not to regard the wicked at all, though he considers their deeds—yet he reserves judgment of condemnation for them at the last.
When we grow angry, we are inflamed by the breath of fury. So to show that the Lord is contemplating vengeance, he is said to breathe forth in anger. This doesn't mean that his nature undergoes any change or variation. Rather, after long patience, when he executes vengeance on the sinner, he who is tranquil in himself appears turbulent to those who are perishing.
The reprobate mind sees the judge opposed to its actions, and he appears agitated to it—though it's really the mind itself that's disturbed by its guilt in his presence. By our manner of speaking, God is said to be jealous or to grieve. Yet there is no turbulence of these emotions in God, in whom eternal tranquility resides.
God so mercifully accommodates human weakness that, because we cannot know him as he truly is, he reveals himself to us using our own manner of speech. That's why Scripture describes him as having bodily members like ours, and why he allows unworthy passions to be spoken of him in worthy terms—so that he might draw us to his reality through our own experience, and that by condescending to us, he might raise us up to himself.
In many ways God draws images from lower things to signify himself to humanity, though we know that in his own substance he is truly invisible and incorporeal.

Chapter 11: On the Wonders of God

What person can fully explore the wonders of almighty God—that he created all things from nothing, that the very fabric of the world is arranged by the wondrous power of his might, that heaven is suspended above the air and earth is balanced above the abyss? The entire universe exists from things both invisible and visible. The eternal God made man, gathering in brief compass, so to speak, another world—but a rational one. In forming man from soul and flesh, he mingled spirit and clay through an inscrutable arrangement of power.
From God's marvelous creation we know one thing and we are another, yet we neglect to wonder—because what is truly marvelous by any comprehensive investigation has become commonplace to human eyes. So if a dead man is raised, everyone leaps in amazement, yet every day a person who did not exist is born, and no one marvels. Clearly it is a greater thing to create what did not exist than to restore what once was.
Because Aaron's dry staff flowered, everyone marveled. Yet every day a tree is produced from dry earth, and the power of dust is transformed into wood—and no one marvels. Because five thousand people were fed with five loaves, everyone marveled that the food increased in people's mouths. Yet every day scattered grains of seed are multiplied into abundant sheaves—and no one marvels.
Everyone marveled when they saw water changed into wine that one time, yet every day moisture from the earth is drawn into the root of the vine and transformed through the grape cluster into wine—and no one marvels. Blessed Job said, 'He does great things,' and immediately added, 'and inscrutable things,' according to the book of Job, chapter five, verse nine. It would be less great to do mighty things if those things could be fully examined. He rightly added, 'and wonders without number'—for it would be of lesser magnitude if the inscrutable things he created were few.
We should understand beyond doubt that divine miracles must always be contemplated with diligence but never dissected by the intellect. Often the human mind, when it seeks the explanation of certain things and cannot find it, plunges itself into a whirlpool of doubt.
Some people consider how the bodies of the dead are reduced to dust, and because they cannot grasp the power of resurrection through reason, they despair that these bodies could return to their former state. God's miracles, which must be believed through faith, are not to be examined through reason—for if reason could fully explain them to our eyes, they would not be marvelous.
When the mind perhaps stumbles over God's wonders, it must recall to memory those things it knows through experience yet cannot grasp through reason—so that through the argument from similar cases, it may strengthen the faith it perceives to be weakened by its own cleverness.

Chapter 12: On the Creation and Permanence of the Angels and the Fall of the Proud

The angels were created in such a way that, if they willed it, they could persist in the light of blessedness, but if they did not will it, they could also fall. Thus Satan fell with his legions of followers. But after his fall, the angels who persisted were so strengthened that they could no longer fall at all.
The angelic powers that persisted fixed in divine love, when the proud angels fell, received this gift as their reward: they are no longer bitten by any rust of creeping sin, they remain in contemplation of the Creator without end of happiness, and they continue in eternal stability in what they were created to be.
In Moses, according to the book of Genesis, chapter one, verse six, the historical words testify about the very origin of the world, when heaven is said to have been made first and the same thing is later called the firmament. This is because the angelic nature was first created in its subtle form in the heights, and afterward was more wondrously confirmed so that it could never fall.
When the holy angels see the loss of their nature in others who are falling, they stand more cautiously and strongly in themselves. Thus it happens, with the Lord ordering all things wondrously, that the homeland of the elect spirits profited even from the loss of its ruin, since it was more firmly built up from the very thing by which it had been partly destroyed.
When the first angel fell from the citadel of blessedness, it is certain that even the elect angels trembled at his ruin. The fall itself through pride cast him out from their number, while fear itself strengthened the others to stand more firmly. It is written of the apostate angel, according to the book of Job, chapter forty-one, verse sixteen, 'When he is taken away, the angels will fear and, terrified, will be purified.' They were indeed purified, because when he departed with the reprobate legions, only those who would live blessedly remained in the heavenly thrones.
The fall of Satan both terrified and purified the good angels. It terrified them so they would not proudly despise their Creator. It purified them because, with the reprobate departing, it brought about that the elect alone remained.
God, the maker of all, who knows how to use even the evil actions of the reprobate for the protection of the good, turned the fall of the falling angels into the advancement of those who remained. The very thing that punished the guilt of the proud became the source by which increases of merit were found and established for the humble angels. When the proud fell, it was given as a gift to the humble that they could not fall at all.
That first apostate angel is able to accomplish much through strength because the Creator made him first in substance among the nature of things, as it is written in the book of Job, chapter forty, verse fourteen, 'He is the beginning of the ways of God.' Indeed, when God made all things, he created this one first and made him preeminent over the other angels.
He is said to have been made beautiful in many dense leaves, because having been placed over the other legions of angels, his appearance made him as much more beautiful as the multitude of angels placed beneath him adorned him. The apostate angel in God's paradise had as many dense leaves, so to speak, as he had legions of higher spirits placed under him.
He was condemned without pardon when he sinned because he had been created great beyond comparison. To the apostate angel it is said through the prophet Ezekiel, according to the book of Ezekiel, chapter twenty-eight, verses twelve and thirteen, 'You were the seal of the likeness of God, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty, you were in the paradise of God.' The prophet, about to speak much of his greatness, embraced everything in the first word.
What good did the first angel not possess, if he was the seal of God's likeness? From the seal of a ring, such a likeness is expressed in image as is possessed substantially in the seal itself. And although man was created in the likeness of God, the text attributes something greater, as it were, to the apostate angel: it doesn't say he was made in God's likeness but that he was the very seal of God's likeness—so that the more subtle his nature, the more fully the likeness of God is believed to be expressed in him.
The prophet Ezekiel, still contemplating the loftiness of the apostate angel's principality, adds, according to the book of Ezekiel, chapter twenty-eight, verse fourteen, 'You were an extended cherub, protecting, on the holy mountain of God; you walked perfect in the midst of fiery stones.' Cherub is interpreted as fullness of knowledge, and he is called cherub because he is understood to have surpassed all angels in knowledge.
He walked perfect in the midst of fiery stones because among the armies of angels, hearts kindled by the fire of charity, he stood out bright in the glory of his creation. The prophet reveals such marvelous things about what the apostate angel was and what he lost, in order to show terrified humanity what it will suffer for the guilt of pride if it becomes proud—since God did not spare in striking the one he elevated in creation to such glory and brilliance.
The angelic spirit, or the human soul, is immortal in such a way that it can die, yet mortal in such a way that it cannot die. For it ceases to live blessedly if it loses itself through vice or through punishment. But it does not lose essential life either through vice or through punishment.
It loses the quality of living, but even in dying it does not experience the destruction of subsisting in every mode. To put it briefly: it is immortally mortal and mortally immortal. When the elect spirits of the angels saw others fall through pride, they stood all the more firmly the more humbly they stood. Those inhabitants of the heavenly region profited even from their losses, being more solidly established in the state of eternity through part of their destruction.

Chapter 13: On the Nine Orders of Angels

The number of heavenly spirits is beyond the knowledge of human reason, because we do not know how great that multitude of the invisible army is, of which it is rightly said, according to the book of Daniel, chapter seven, verse ten, 'Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.' The number of heavenly citizens is expressed as both infinite and definite, so that what is countable to God is shown to be countless to us.
To assist is one thing, to minister is another. Those angelic powers assist God who do not go out to announce certain messages to humanity. Those minister who come to fulfill the duties of messengers, yet even they do not depart from the innermost things through contemplation. And because more minister than principally assist, the number of those assisting is shown as defined, while the number of those ministering is shown as indefinite.
The prophet Isaiah says, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter six, verse one, 'I saw the Lord seated upon a high and elevated throne.' God's throne is the angelic or human creature over which he presides through the understanding he gave it. He calls it a high and elevated throne because human nature advances when elevated to heavenly glory, and the angelic creature, now solidified in heaven so as not to fall while many spirits were falling, was elevated from the very source from which it was confirmed.
His temple is the same as his throne, because the eternal King dwells where he sits. The Lord created the nature of angels and humans to know him. When he willed them to endure to eternity, he created them without doubt in his own likeness.
There are nine orders of angels. But so that the number of the elect might be completed, man was created as the tenth. Man did not perish from his Creator even after sin, because eternal Wisdom, flashing with miracles through the flesh, restored him from the light of the earthen vessel.
We said there are nine orders of angels because sacred Scripture testifies that there exist angels, archangels, virtues, powers, principalities, dominations, thrones, cherubim, and seraphim. Nearly all pages of sacred Scripture testify that there are indeed angels and archangels, and the books of the prophets often speak, as is well known, of cherubim and seraphim.
The apostle Paul enumerates the names of four orders in his letter to the Ephesians, chapter one, verse twenty-one, saying, 'Above every principality and power and virtue and domination.' Likewise he says in his letter to the Colossians, chapter one, verse sixteen, 'Whether thrones or dominations or principalities or powers.'
He had already described dominations, principalities, and powers when speaking to the Ephesians, but when about to speak to the Colossians, he added thrones, about which he had not yet said anything to the Ephesians. Therefore, when thrones are joined to those four he mentioned earlier to the Ephesians—that is, principalities, powers, virtues, and dominations—there are five orders that are specifically expressed.
When angels and archangels, cherubim and seraphim are added to these, there are found without doubt to be nine orders of angels. To the angel who was created first it is said through the prophet, according to the book of Ezekiel, chapter twenty-eight, verse twelve, 'You were a cherub, the seal of likeness, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty, you were in the delights of God's paradise.'
Here it should be noted that he is not said to have been made in the likeness of God, but to be the seal of likeness—so that the more subtle his nature, the more closely the image of God is expressed in him. Immediately after this it is added, 'Every precious stone was your covering: sardius, topaz, jasper, chrysolite, onyx, beryl, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald.'
Behold, nine names of stones are mentioned, because there are indeed nine orders of angels. That first angel was adorned and covered with these orders because, being placed over all the armies of angels, he was brighter by comparison with them.
In the Greek language, angels are called messengers, while archangels are called chief messengers. We should also know that the word 'angel' is the name of an office, not of a nature. Those holy spirits of the heavenly homeland are always spirits indeed, but they cannot always be called angels, because they are only angels when certain messages are announced through them.
Thus it is also said in the Psalms, chapter one hundred three, verse four, 'Who makes his angels spirits'—as if to say openly, 'He who always has them as spirits also makes them angels when he wills.' It should be greatly noted that those who announce lesser things are called angels, while those who announce the greatest things are called archangels.
That's why not just any angel but the archangel Gabriel was sent to the Virgin Mary. It was fitting that the one who announced the greatest of all things should come for this supreme ministry. The holy angels are designated by personal names so that even in their work what they can do might be signified through their names. And when they come to minister something to us, they also draw their names from their ministries among us.
Whenever something of wondrous power is accomplished, Michael is said to be sent, so that from the very act and name it may be understood that no one can do what God prevails to do. Michael is interpreted as 'Who is like God?' Gabriel is called the strength of God. Gabriel, who is named the strength of God, was also sent to Mary.
He came to announce the one who deigned to appear humbly to conquer the powers of the air. Raphael is interpreted as the medicine of God, because when he touched the eyes of Tobit as if through the office of healing, he wiped away the darkness of his blindness. Therefore, because he was sent to heal, it was fitting that he should be called God's medicine.
But since we have briefly touched upon the interpretation of the holy angels' names, it now remains to briefly explain the terms of the offices themselves. Virtues are called those spirits through whom signs and miracles more frequently occur. Powers are called those who have received more powerfully than others in their order that the adverse forces should be subject to their authority, being restrained by their power so they cannot tempt human hearts as much as they wish.
Principalities are called those who preside even over the good spirits of angels themselves, who arrange good things to be done while others are subject to them, and lead them to fulfill divine ministries. Dominations are called those who transcend even the powers of principalities by a high dissimilarity.
Therefore, those armies of angels that stand out in wondrous power are called dominations because the rest are subject to them in obedience. Thrones are called those armies over which almighty God always presides to exercise judgment.
Because we call thrones 'seats' in Latin speech, they are called thrones who are so filled with divine grace that the Lord sits in them and decrees his judgments through them. Hence it is also said in the Psalms, chapter nine, verse five, 'You sit upon a throne, you who judge equity.'
Cherubim means fullness of knowledge. Those more sublime armies are called cherubim because they are filled with more perfect knowledge the more closely they contemplate God's brightness—so that according to the mode of creation, they know all things fully to the degree they approach the vision of their Creator through the merit of their dignity.
Seraphim are called those armies of holy spirits who burn with incomparable love from their singular nearness to their Creator. Seraphim are called burning or setting on fire, because they are so joined to God that no other spirits come between them and God, they burn all the more the more closely they see him.
Their flame is truly the ardor of charity, because the more subtly they perceive the brightness of his divinity, the more strongly they burn in love for him. That heavenly city above consists of angels and humans. We believe that the human race will ascend to it in such number as the elect angels remained there, as it is written in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter thirty-two, verse eight, 'He established the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.'

Chapter 14: On the Holy Angels Assigned to Nations

While supreme peace is maintained in the lofty orders of angels, what does it mean that the angel says to Daniel, according to the book of Daniel, chapter ten, verse thirteen, 'I came because of your words, but the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me for twenty-one days, and behold, Michael, one of the first princes, came to my aid'?
And a little later the angel says, 'Now I will return to fight against the prince of the Persians. When I was departing, the prince of the Greeks appeared coming.' What other princes of nations does he call except angels, who could resist him as he went out?
What peace can there be in the heights, if a struggle of fighting is carried on even among the angelic spirits themselves, who always stand in the sight of Truth? Certain ministries of angels are set over each individual nation to be governed. And when the conduct of their subjects merits the help of the presiding spirits against each other in turn, the spirits who preside are said to come against each other.
The angel who spoke to Daniel is recognized as having been set over the captives of the Israelite people established in Persia. Michael, however, is found to be the one placed over those from the same people who remained in the land of Judea. Thus by this same angel it is said a little later to Daniel, 'No one is my helper in all these things except Michael your prince.' Of whom he also says what we mentioned earlier, 'And behold, Michael, one of the first princes, came to my aid.'
When he is said not to be present together, but to come to aid, he is openly recognized as having been set over the people who were held captive in another part. What is it for the angel to say, 'I came because of your words, but the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me,' except to announce his works to his subjects? As if he were saying openly, 'The merits of your prayers demand that the Israelite people be freed from the yoke of their captivity, but there is still something in that same people that must be purged under Persian dominion. Therefore the prince of the Persians rightly contradicts their liberation, though the tears of those left in Judea help your prayers.'
The angel who was speaking to Daniel said, 'Michael your prince came to my aid.' And when he goes out to fight against the prince of the Persians, the prince of the Greeks appears coming toward him. From this it is implied that Judea had committed something against the Greeks, whose cause was indeed resisting their liberation.
The angel hears the prophet's prayers, but the prince of the Persians resists—because even if the life of the just one praying demands the liberation of the people, nevertheless the life of that same people still contradicts it. Since those who had been led into captivity are not yet fully purified, the Persians justly still rule over them.
Michael helps, but the prince of the Greeks comes to battle—because the long captivity of the oppressed could indeed merit pardon, but what they had done wrong against the Greeks still stood in the way of the benefit of their liberation. It is rightly said that angels come against each other, because the merits of the nations subject to them contradict each other in turn.
For the sublime spirits ruling over these nations do not fight on behalf of those acting unjustly, but examine their deeds by judging them justly. When the guilt or justice of any nation is brought to the council of the heavenly court, the leader of that nation is said either to have prevailed in the contest or not to have prevailed.
Yet for all of them there is one victory: the supreme will of their Maker over themselves, which they always behold—and what they cannot obtain, they never wish for.

Chapter 15: That Evil Has No Substance but Was First Invented by the Devil

Evil is not a nature, but the privation of good has received this name. Every nature is good—great if it cannot be corrupted, small if it can. Therefore there is no such thing as evil if there is no good. But a good lacking all evil is an integral good. One in which evil is present is a corrupted or vicious good. Evil can never exist where there is no good at all.
Evil would not exist at all unless what is good existed, since every nature is good. No thing would be evil if the thing itself that is evil were not a nature. Every nature, even if vicious, is good insofar as it is a nature; insofar as it is vicious, it is evil.
Evils arose from goods, and they do not exist except in some goods. There was no source from which any nature of evil could arise. For if there were, insofar as it was a nature, it would certainly be good. There was absolutely no source from which evil could first arise except from the good nature of angel and man.
From man's good nature, both a good will and an evil will can arise. Therefore we speak of a good angel and an evil angel, a good man and an evil man—but good in that he is an angel or man, evil in that he is vicious. When we say 'good,' we praise the nature; when we say 'evil,' we identify not the nature but the vice that is present in the good nature.
Therefore evil did not exist somewhere or at some time, from which the devil became evil. Rather, because evil is a vice, while he was a good angel, he became evil through pride. Therefore it is rightly said that evil was invented by him. Evil was not created by the devil but invented by him. Therefore evil is nothing, because it has no substance—for without God nothing was made, and God did not make evil.
Heretics believe that the mind was created by God and vices were created by the devil, from which they suppose there are two natures, good and evil. But vices are not natures, and though they truly come from the devil, they were not created.

Chapter 16: On the Beginning of the World and the Creation of Heaven and Earth

The substance of things was created simultaneously, but their species were not formed simultaneously. What existed together in the substance of matter did not appear together in the form of species. When heaven and earth are described as made together, it indicates that spiritual and corporeal things, whatever originates from heaven, and whatever is produced from earth were all made together.
Moses had said, 'In the beginning God created heaven and earth,' according to the book of Genesis, chapter one, verse one. But who would believe that he spoke truth about the past if he had not also said something about the future? At the very end of the book, in whose beginning he had spoken those things about the past, he mixed in something of prophecy through Jacob's voice about things to come, saying, according to the book of Genesis, chapter forty-nine, verse ten, 'The scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, nor the leader from his loins, until he comes who is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of the nations.'
He who had narrated that heaven and earth, shrubs and grass were created on different days, now shows that they were made in one day—to clearly demonstrate that every creature existed simultaneously in substance, though it did not proceed simultaneously in species.
The principle of the world should be considered from one man: for just as man moves toward his end through the stages of life, so also the world fails through being stretched out in time. Whatever makes man and world seem to grow actually diminishes both.
The matter from which the world was formed preceded the things made from it in origin, not in time—as sound precedes song. Sound is prior to song because the sweetness of melody pertains to the sound of the voice, but the sound does not pertain to the sweetness. Therefore both exist simultaneously, but that to which the song pertains is prior—that is, the sound.
The matter from which heaven and earth were formed is called formless because what remained to be formed had not yet been formed from it, yet the matter itself was made from nothing. It is one thing for something to be able to come into being, another for it to necessarily come into being. What God inserted into natures must necessarily come to be, but what is able to come to be is what the Creator reserved to make at some time outside the appointed course of natures whenever he willed.
After the enumeration of the creation of heaven and earth, the Spirit is named in Genesis, chapter one, verse three, so that—because he had to be said to be borne above—those things might first be named over which the Holy Spirit, their creator, would be said to be borne above. The Apostle also indicates this in Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter five, verse five, when he demonstrates the surpassing way of charity.
The Holy Spirit is said to be borne above the waters because he is the gift of God, in whom we who subsist find rest, and by protecting us he is borne above us.

Chapter 17: That the Essence of Heaven and Earth Endures Forever

Heaven and earth pass away in the form they now have, yet they endure without end in their essence. For Paul says in his first letter to the Corinthians, chapter seven, verse thirty-one, 'The form of this world is passing away.' Truth itself says in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-four, verse thirty-five, 'Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.'
Thus it is said by angelic voice in the book of Revelation, chapter twenty-one, verse one, 'There will be a new heaven and a new earth.' These are not to be created as other things, but these very ones are renewed. Heaven and earth both pass away and will be, because they are cleansed by fire from the form they now have, yet are always preserved in their nature.
Thus it is said in the Psalms, chapter one hundred one, verse twenty-seven, 'You will change them, and they will be changed.' At the end of this age, heaven and earth announce their final transformation to us through the very changes by which they ceaselessly alternate for our use.
The earth fails from its own form in winter dryness, and grows green with spring moisture. From this, then, let every faithful person conclude that the form of heaven and earth will perish yet be restored through renewal—which is now evidently being repaired, as it were, from failure through the constant alternation of changing forms.

Chapter 18: On the Distinction of Creatures

From insensible things we learn what to think about sensible and intelligible things. The earth is made fertile by air, and air is disposed according to the quality of heaven. Humans preside over beasts, angels over humans, and archangels over angels. That humans preside over beasts we both see by experience and are taught by the words of the Psalmist, who says in Psalm eight, verse eight, 'You have subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and moreover the beasts of the field.'
That angels preside over humans the angel testifies through the prophet Daniel, saying, 'The prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me,' according to the book of Daniel, chapter ten, verse thirteen. That angels are governed by the powers of higher angels the prophet Zechariah attests, saying, according to the book of Zechariah, chapter two, verse three, 'Behold, the angel who was speaking within me went out, and another angel went out to meet him, and said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls.'
For if in the very offices of the holy spirits the highest powers did not govern the least, the angel would in no way have learned from another angel what to say to the man. Because the Creator of all holds all things through himself, yet governs some things through others who dispense them to distinguish the order of the beautiful universe, we rightly understand the spirits of angels as kings, who govern their subjects all the more because they serve the Author of all more intimately.
Man would rest with the angels if he had not chosen to follow the tongue of the persuader. Therefore angels are not undeservedly called counselors, because they give counsel to the spiritual commonwealth when they join us to themselves as companions in the kingdom. When we recognize the will of the Creator through the holy angels announcing it, we find in them without doubt counsel from this distress of our tribulation.

Chapter 19: That Rational Creatures, Angels and Humans, Were Created Together

Every creature was created simultaneously by God the Author, who in his action is in no way stretched out by the extension of time. And if we examine the causes of things with subtle investigation, we know that angel and man were made together—together not in unity of time, but in recognition of reason; together through the received image of wisdom, and not together through the conjoined substance of form.
It is written of man, according to the book of Genesis, chapter one, verse twenty-six, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness.' And to Satan it is said through Ezekiel, according to the book of Ezekiel, chapter twenty-eight, verse twelve, 'You were the seal of likeness, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, you were in the delights of paradise.' Therefore in all creation man and angel existed together, because they proceeded distinct from all irrational nature.
In all the establishment of things there is no rational animal except angel and man. Whatever cannot use reason was not made with man. Although all things were created through the coeternal Word of the Father, nevertheless in the very plan of creation it is shown how much man is preferred to all animals, how much to heavenly things, yet insensible ones.
God said all things, and they were made, according to Psalm one hundred forty-eight, verse five. But when he determines to make man—and this should be reverently considered—he says first, 'Let us make man in our image and likeness,' according to the book of Genesis, chapter one, verse twenty-six. For it is not written of him as of other things, 'Let it be made, and it was made.' Nor did the earth bring forth man as the water brought forth birds. Rather, before he was made, 'Let us make' is said, so that because a rational creature was being created, it would appear to have been made, as it were, with counsel.
Man is formed from earth as if with careful attention, and is raised up by the inspiration of the Creator in the power of the life-giving spirit—so that he who was being made in the Creator's image might come into existence not through a voice of command but through the dignity of the operation.
It is written, according to the book of Genesis, chapter one, verse twenty-seven, 'God created man in his image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he made them.' Eve is not yet described as having been made, yet man is already said to be male and female. But because the woman was without doubt going to proceed from Adam's side, she is already counted in him by substance from whom she was to be produced by form.
Yet we can consider these things even in the smallest matters, so that from small things we may weigh greater ones. When grass is created, neither fruit nor seed is yet shown in it. Yet fruit and seed are present in it even when they do not appear, because they exist together in the substance of the root, though they do not come forth together through increases of time.
God had made two creatures to understand him, namely angelic and human. Pride struck both and broke them from the state of innate righteousness. But one had the covering of flesh, while the other bore nothing weak from the flesh. For the angel is spirit only, but man is both spirit and flesh.
The Creator, having mercy, had to bring back to himself the flesh in order to redeem man, which is known to have had something from weakness in the perpetration of guilt. And he had to repel the apostate angel all the more, because when he fell from the strength of persisting, he bore nothing weak from the flesh.
The Psalmist rightly expressed the very cause of mercy when speaking of the merciful Redeemer toward humanity, saying in Psalm seventy-seven, verse thirty-nine, 'And he remembered that they are flesh'—as if to say: The more he saw their weakness, the less strictly he wished to punish their sins.
There is yet another reason why lost man had to be restored and the proud spirit cannot be restored: the angel fell by his own malice, but man was cast down by another's.

Chapter 20: On the Perfection of the Number Seven

All time unfolds in seven days. For the eternal day, which follows after the completion of the alternation of seven days, is the eighth day. Thus the Psalmist, contemplating the day of resurrection, because he was about to speak of the severity of the final judgment, placed the title first, saying in Psalm six, verse one, 'To the end, a Psalm of David for the eighth day.'
To show what he meant by the eighth day, he followed with that day of fearful terror at the beginning of the psalm, saying, 'O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your fury.' The perfection of eternity is signified by the number seven, when the seventh day is called sanctified unto the Lord's rest.
No evening is said to belong to it, because the rest of eternal blessedness is not restricted by any boundary. This is also why the seventh day is commanded by the given law to be kept as a holiday, according to the book of Leviticus, chapter twenty-five, verses eight and nine, so that eternal rest might be designated through it. That the whole of present life is designated by the number seven is shown more clearly when the eighth is also added after it.
Indeed, when another follows the number seven, it is expressed by this very increase that the times that must end are concluded by eternity. It is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter eleven, verse two, 'Give portions to seven and also to eight.' By the number seven he expressed the present time that is conducted in seven days; by the number eight he designated perpetual life, which the Lord manifested to us by his resurrection.
He rose on the Lord's day, which, while following the seventh day, that is the Sabbath, is found to be the eighth by counting. In the course of years, the number seven multiplied seven times with one added leads to fifty, so that the most sacred rest of jubilee might be observed, signifying perpetual blessedness.
The number seven is held by the wise of this age to be perfect by a certain calculation of its own, because it is completed from the first even and the first odd number. For the first odd number is three, and the first even is four. From these two, seven is constituted, which when multiplied by its same parts rises to twelve. For whether we multiply three by four or four by three, we arrive at twelve.
Because we have received the teachings of truth from the heavenly gift, we trample these things by looking down from the established height of knowledge. We hold this with unshaken faith: that the sevenfold Spirit of grace perfects those whom he fills, and provides them not only knowledge of the Trinity but also the working of the four virtues—that is, prudence, temperance, fortitude, and justice.

Chapter 21: On the Soul and Its Senses

In sacred Scripture, teeth are sometimes understood to mean interior senses, as Jeremiah testifies, saying in the book of Lamentations, chapter three, verse ten, 'He has broken my teeth to pieces.' Through teeth food is broken so it may be swallowed. Therefore we rightly understand by teeth the interior senses, which chew and grind, as it were, individual things they think about, and transmit them to the stomach of memory.
The prophet says the interior senses of the soul are broken to pieces like teeth, because according to the measure of each person's sin, blindness of understanding is generated in the senses, and according to what each person has done outwardly, that person becomes dull in what he could understand about interior and invisible things.
Every person who eats a sour grape will have his teeth set on edge, according to the book of Ezekiel, chapter eighteen, verse two, and the book of Jeremiah, chapter thirty, verse thirty. What is a sour grape but sin? A sour grape is fruit before its time. Whoever desires to be satisfied with the pleasures of present life hastens, as it were, to eat fruit before its time.
Whoever eats a sour grape has his teeth set on edge, because whoever feeds on the delight of the present world has his interior senses bound, so that they can no longer chew, that is, understand spiritual things—because from what delighted them in exterior things, they become dull in interior things.
And while the soul feeds on sin, it cannot eat the bread of justice, because the teeth, bound by the habit of sin, can in no way eat the just thing that has inner flavor. We should greatly consider what the just are accustomed to do. They, for the most part, if they detect anything however slightly carnal in themselves, reconsidering these things in their interior senses, vehemently pursue them in themselves, grind themselves down with affliction and great torments, and judge and condemn through penance even the smallest evil things in themselves.
The elect act daily so that they themselves should be found, as much as possible, irreproachable in the sight of the eternal Judge, and those who see them judging themselves in this way should burn to correct themselves from graver faults.

Chapter 22: On the Condition of the First Man

The first man was created in such a way that while he remained, times would pass, and he would not pass with the times. For he stood while moments ran past, because he was in no way tending toward the end of life through the increase of days.
Before sin, the first man could have a fixed state because times passed while he remained standing. He stood all the more firmly the more closely he clung to the one who always stands. But after he sinned, he placed himself in a kind of slippery temporality. And because he ate the forbidden food, he immediately found the failure of his state. And soon, having offended the Creator, he began to move with time.
Man was created in paradise for this purpose: that if he bound himself to obedience to his Creator with the bonds of charity, he might at some time pass to the heavenly homeland of the angels without the death of the flesh. Thus the first man was created immortal, yet in such a way that if he sinned he could die. And he was created mortal in such a way that if he did not sin, he could not die, and by the merit of free will he would attain the blessedness of that region in which he could neither sin nor die.
Into the happiness of eternal blessedness, where after the time of redemption, with death intervening, the elect pass—there without doubt the first parents, if they had persisted in the state of their creation, could have been transferred even without the death of their bodies.
The first man had, as it were, a kind of silence when he received free will against his enemy. Because he yielded to the enemy of his own accord, he immediately found in himself something that clamored against him. Although man was created in silence by the Author, yet having voluntarily submitted to the enemy, he endured the clamors of battle. For the very suggestion of the flesh is like a certain clamor against the quiet of the mind.

Chapter 23: On the Trees of Paradise and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil

There was by no means an evil tree in paradise that God forbade man to touch. But so that man, who was well created, might grow better through the merit of obedience, it was fitting that God should forbid him even from a good thing—so that what he did would be all the more truly virtue, because by refraining even from good he would show himself more humbly subject to his Author.
God said, according to the book of Genesis, chapter two, verse sixteen, 'Eat from every tree of paradise, but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil do not touch.' For whoever forbids subjects from any one good thing must necessarily grant many things, lest the mind of the obedient person perish utterly if, completely repelled from all good things, it starves.
The Lord granted all the trees of paradise for food when he forbade one, so that he might more easily restrain his creature, whom he did not wish to be destroyed but to advance, from one tree, the more broadly he allowed access to all the rest.

Chapter 24: On the Transgression of the First Man

The cunning enemy and adversary of the human race does not cease to do daily what he did in paradise. He labors to uproot God's words from human hearts and to plant in them the false enticements of his promise. Daily the ancient enemy smooths over what God threatens and invites people to believe what he falsely promises.
For he falsely promises temporal things in order to minimize in human minds the eternal punishments that God threatens. The adversary of the human race, when he promises the glory of present life, what else does he say but, according to the book of Genesis, chapter three, verse five, 'Taste, and you will be like gods'? As if he were saying openly: Touch temporal desire, and appear exalted in this world.
When the ancient enemy tries to remove the fear of divine judgment from human hearts, what else does he speak but what he said to the first humans, 'Why did God command you not to eat from every tree of paradise?' But because redeemed man has received by divine gift the justice he lost when he was created long ago, he now exercises himself more strongly against the enticements of cunning persuasion, because he has learned by experience how obedient he ought to be to the commandment.
And whereas guilt then led him to punishment, now his punishment restrains him from guilt—so that he fears to sin all the more because, compelled by punishment, he now accuses what he has committed.
The cunning adversary raised himself against the first man, our parent, in three temptations, because he tempted him through gluttony, vainglory, and avarice. But by tempting he overcame him, because he subjected him to himself through consent.
He tempted through gluttony when he showed the food of the forbidden tree and persuaded them to eat. He tempted through vainglory when he said, 'You will be like gods.' He tempted through avarice when he said, 'Knowing good and evil.' Thus he drew him to pride by stirring him to the avarice of loftiness.
By the same means the devil overthrew the first man, by those same means he was defeated when he tempted the second man. He tempted through gluttony when he said, according to the Gospel of Matthew, chapter four, verse three, 'Command these stones to become bread.' He tempted through vainglory when he said, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.' He tempted through the avarice of loftiness when he showed all the kingdoms of the world, saying, 'All these I will give you if you fall down and worship me.'
What does it mean that the Lord walks in the breeze after midday, except that the more fervent light of charity had departed, and the coldness of guilt was constricting the sinful soul?
Therefore he rebuked Adam by walking, so that to blind minds he might reveal their wickedness not only by words but also by things—so that sinful man might hear through words what he had done, and through the walking, having lost the state of eternity, might perceive the inconstancy of his changeability, and through the breeze, with the fervor of charity expelled, might notice his torpor, and through the declining of the sun might know that he was approaching darkness.
It is written, according to the book of Genesis, chapter three, verse nine, 'God called Adam and said to him, Where are you?' What does it mean that the Lord seeks Adam after the fall, saying, 'Where are you?' Did divine power not know to what hiding places the servant had fled after his guilt?
But because he saw him fallen in guilt, now hidden from the eyes of truth as it were under sin—because he does not approve the darkness of his error—he acts as if he does not know where the sinner is. The almighty Lord both calls Adam and seeks him, saying, 'Where are you?' By calling, he gives a sign that he is calling back to repentance. By seeking, he openly suggests that he does not fail to know sinners who are justly condemned.
The human race possessed contemplation of interior light in paradise. But pleasing itself, it withdrew to itself, lost the light of the Creator and his face, and fled to the trees of paradise, because after sin it feared to see him whom it had been accustomed to love.
But behold, after guilt it came into punishment, and from punishment it returns to love, because it discovered what the fruit of guilt was. And aroused by punishment, it seeks that face which it feared in guilt—so that it may now flee the fog of its blindness and severely dread the very fact that it does not see its Author.

Chapter 25: On the Change and Instability of Times

We cannot have a fixed state of times in the present age, where we come to pass away and our very living is daily a passing from life. This lapse of times the first man could not have before sin, because times passed while he remained standing.
We, because we are born from the first man's lineage, retain the bitterness of the root as in a sapling. For since we derive our origin from him, we inherit his trajectory through birth, so that in the very daily moment in which we live, we unceasingly pass from life, and the space of living that we believe increases actually decreases. While infancy passes to boyhood, boyhood to adolescence, adolescence to youth, and old age passes to death in the course of present life, wretched humanity is compelled toward decline by its very growth, and always loses ground at the very point where it believes itself advancing in the span of life.

Chapter 26: On the discord between the holy angels and human beings established under transgression.

Before our Redeemer was born in the flesh, we had discord with the angels. Through the merit of the first sin and through daily transgressions, we were far removed from their brightness and purity. Because we were estranged from God through sin, the angels who are citizens of God regarded us as strangers to their company. But because we have acknowledged our King, the angels have recognized us as their fellow citizens. Because the King of heaven has taken on the earth of our flesh, angelic majesty does not despise our weakness. The angels return to peace with us, setting aside the intention of former discord, and those whom they previously despised as weak and abject, they now honor as companions.
In the Old Testament, Lot and Joshua adore the angels, and yet they are not prohibited from adoring. In the Apocalypse, John wished to adore the angel, but the same angel restrained him from adoring, saying: See that you do not do this: I am your fellow servant and that of your brothers.
What does it mean that before the Redeemer's coming, angels are adored by humans and remain silent, but afterward they refuse to be adored? It is because they fear to see our nature, which they previously despised, placed beneath them after they behold it assumed above themselves. They no longer dare to despise as weak beneath them what they venerate above themselves in the King of heaven. Those who adore the God-man above themselves do not disdain to have a human being as their companion.

Chapter 27: On the heavenly Jerusalem and its citizens.

Jerusalem is interpreted to mean vision of peace. Those dwell in Jerusalem who fix their minds on the vision of intimate peace. For it is written: Jerusalem which is built as a city, according to the Psalms, chapter one hundred twenty-one, verse three. Because that vision of interior peace is constructed from the gathering of holy citizens, heavenly Jerusalem is built as a city. While that supernal city of Jerusalem is struck with scourges and beaten with tribulations on this land of pilgrimage, its stones are squared daily.
This is the city, namely the holy Church, which while destined to reign in heaven still labors on earth. To its citizens Peter says: You also, as living stones, are built up, according to Peter's first letter, chapter two, verse five. And Paul says: You are God's cultivation, God's building, according to Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, chapter three, verse nine. The city of Jerusalem already has its great edifice here in the conduct of the saints. For in a building, stone is placed upon stone, and whoever bears another is borne by another.
The prophet Isaiah says: The Lord lives, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter thirty-one, verse nine. For it is greater to be a furnace than to be a fire, because fire can be small, but in a furnace a vaster flame is kindled. Zion means watchfulness, while Jerusalem means vision of peace. We contemplate our peace here in the meantime, that we may afterward see it fully there.
From love of the almighty Lord there is fire in Zion, but a furnace in Jerusalem, because here we burn somewhat with the flames of his love where we contemplate something of him. But there we shall burn fully where we shall fully see him whom we love.

Chapter 28: On Babylon and its citizens.

It should be known that Shinar is a very broad valley in which the proud began to build the tower of Babylon. Shinar is interpreted to mean their stench. This tower was destroyed when the diversity of languages was made, and it was called Babylon, precisely because of the confusion of minds and languages. Babylon is interpreted to mean confusion.
The unfruitful mind is therefore rightly called the daughter of Babylon. Because it in no way brings forth good works, while it is arranged by no order of right life, it is as if generated by confusion as its mother. It is written: Descend, sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground; there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldeans, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter forty-seven, verse one.
The human mind, after it has lost the state of salvation and added to the heap of its confusion, is called virgin or uncorrupted for what it once was. To it the divine voice aptly says by way of rebuke: Descend. For the human soul stands on high when it yearns for heavenly rewards, but it descends from this state when, shamefully conquered, it subjects itself to the flowing desires of the world.
Most certainly it is said to the daughter of Babylon: Sit in the dust. Since earth is always dust, what should we understand by dust except thoughts? These, while they fly inopportunely and silently in the mind, blind its eyes. And what is designated by earth except earthly action? The mind of the reprobate is first cast down to thinking depraved things, and afterward to doing them.
Rightly, therefore, it is said to the daughter of Babylon, who descends from this judgment of interior righteousness, through a striking sentence, that she should first sit in dust and then on earth, because unless she had prostrated herself in thought, she would not have stuck fast in evil work. For descending, she sits in dust, because abandoning heavenly things and sprinkled with earthly thoughts, she becomes worthless in the lowest things.
There are some who, while doing small things, think great things of themselves. They lift up their mind on high and think they surpass others in the merit of virtues. These indeed abandon within themselves the dunghill of humility and ascend the heights of pride, imitating him who first exalted himself before himself but by lifting himself up cast himself down.
Imitating him who was not content with the dignity of his created condition, saying: I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter fourteen, verse thirteen. Babylon, wickedly joined to the apostate angel, that is, the confused multitude of sinners, says: I sit as queen and I am not a widow, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter forty-seven, verse eight, following the Septuagint.
Whoever therefore swells up inwardly has placed himself on high before himself, but the more heavily presses himself down into the lowest things in that he scorns to feel truly about himself the lowest things. The city of this world, that is Babylon, is sometimes designated by the name of lioness, which rages with savagery of cruelty against the life of the innocent. United to the ancient enemy as to a most savage lion, she conceives the seeds of his perverse persuasion and begets from herself reprobate sons in his likeness, as it were cruel cubs.
The cubs of lions are any reprobates generated unto iniquitous life by the error of malignant spirits. All together they make up the universal city of the world, which we mentioned before as Babylon, and yet these same individuals are called sons of Babylon, as though not the lioness herself but the lioness's cubs. Just as Zion means the whole Church together, while the sons of Zion are remembered as individual saints, so also the sons of Babylon are individual reprobates, and the same Babylon means all the reprobate together.
Holy men, as long as they are in this life, guard themselves with anxious watchfulness lest the circling lion steal upon them by ambush, that is, lest the ancient enemy kill them under some image of virtue, and lest the voice of the lioness clamor in their ears, that is, lest the glory of Babylon turn their mind away from love of the heavenly homeland.

Chapter 29: What the ark of the flood signifies.

The ark of the flood, which is described as broad below but narrow above, represents the holy Church. It is gathered from three hundred and sixty and thirty cubits to one cubit, according to the book of Genesis, chapter six, verse fifteen. From that breadth which the holy Church has in its still weak members, gradually narrowed and advancing upward, it tends toward the one.
Reason requires that we believe that in that breadth of the ark all beasts and all quadrupeds and reptiles were in the lower parts, while man and birds were naturally in the upper parts. For near the upper part there was a window in the side, from which the man sent out a raven or dove to learn whether the waters of the flood had already passed.
And because the same ark was completed in one cubit, man and birds were near the cubit. The universal Church is rightly designated by the ark, which is still broad in its many carnal members, narrow in its few spiritual ones. And because it is gathered to one man who is without sin, it is as if completed in one cubit.
The ark on the waves of the flood bore the type of the Church, because it was broad in the lower parts and narrow in the upper, and at its summit it grew to the measure of one cubit. Below it is to be believed that it held quadrupeds and reptiles, but above, birds and humans.
The ark was broad where it held beasts, narrow where it preserved humans, because the holy Church is indeed broad in carnal members, narrow in spiritual ones. For where it tolerates beastly human conduct, there it extends its embrace more widely. But where it has those who are sustained by spiritual reason, there indeed it is led to the summit, but nevertheless, because they are few, it is narrowed.
For broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who go through it, and narrow is the gate that leads to life, and few are those who find it, according to the Gospel of Matthew, chapter seven, verse thirteen. The ark is narrowed at the top to the point that it is brought to the measure of one cubit, because in the holy Church the holier each one is, the fewer they are.
It is brought at the summit to him who alone is man among men, and who was born holy without any comparison. He who, according to the voice of the Psalmist, has been made like a solitary sparrow on a house, according to the Psalms, chapter one hundred one, verse eight.

Chapter 30: On the elect who arose before the law or under the law.

Many elect arose from the very beginning of the world before the time of redemption, and yet they took care to mortify themselves to this world. Not having the tablets of the written law, they were as if dead from the womb, because they feared their Author by natural law. And when they believed the Mediator was to come, they strove mightily to observe even those precepts they had not received in writing, mortifying pleasures.
That time which near the world's beginning brought forth our fathers dead to this age was like an aborting womb. For there was Abel, who is not read to have resisted his murdering brother, according to the book of Genesis, chapter four, verses eight and twenty-four. There was Enoch, who displayed such a life that he was translated to walk with the Lord, according to the book of Genesis, chapter five, verse twenty-two. There was Noah, who through pleasing the divine judgment survived the world while the world perished, according to the book of Genesis, chapter seven, verse twenty-three.
Abraham the patriarch, while he remained a stranger to the age, became a friend to God, according to the book of Genesis, chapter twelve, verse one. Isaac, with the eyes of flesh growing dim, through age did not see present things, but through the power of prophetic spirit he shone with great light of seeing even in future ages, according to the book of Genesis, chapter twenty-seven, verse one. Jacob humbly fled his brother's wrath and mercifully tamed it, according to the book of Genesis, chapter thirty-three, verse four. He was fruitful in offspring, but even more fruitful in abundance of spirit, binding that same offspring under the bonds of his prophecy.
From the world's beginnings, while we know a few elect through Moses' writing, the greater part of the human race is hidden from us. For it should not be believed that only as many just men existed until the reception of the law as Moses touched upon in his very brief description. Because, therefore, the multitude of good people brought forth from the world's beginning is for the most part withdrawn from our knowledge, it is called a hidden miscarriage.
There were in the Israelite people holy men, patriarchs and prophets, who could justly be called mountains, because through the merit of their life they drew near to heavenly things. But the incarnate Only-begotten was not equal to these mountains, because he transcended the nature, life, and merits of all by his divinity. The Lord Jesus Christ is called a mountain above the summit of mountains, because he was found exalted by his divinity even above the peaks of the saints, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter two, verse two, so that those who advanced much in God could scarcely touch his footsteps from the summit of thought.
The elect who were born in this world after receiving the law were conceived for their Author by the admonition of that same law. But nevertheless, though conceived, they scarcely saw the light, because they could not arrive at the coming of the Lord's incarnation, although they faithfully believed in it.
The incarnate Lord says: I am the light of the world, according to the Gospel of John, chapter eight, verse twelve. And that same Light says: Many prophets and just men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, according to the Gospel of Matthew, chapter thirteen, verse seventeen. Because aroused to hope of the coming Mediator by the open voices of the prophets, they could in no way behold his incarnation.
Before the coming of our Redeemer, the multitude of the elect had the form of faith, but did not bring it to the open vision of divine presence, because intervening death snatched them from the world before manifest truth illuminated the world. The coming of the Mediator, which the fathers placed under the law long awaited, the gentile peoples found for the repose of their life. Paul attests to this, saying: What Israel sought, it did not obtain, but the elect obtained it, according to Paul's letter to the Romans, chapter eleven, verse seven.

Chapter 31: On elect men who arose before the coming of Christ.

It pleases us to observe the wondrous works of divine dispensation: how each star comes in its turn into the face of heaven to illuminate the night of present life, until at night's end the Redeemer of humankind rises like the true morning star. For the nocturnal span, while illuminated by the courses of departing and succeeding stars, is completed with great beauty of heaven.
So that the ray of stars, brought forth in its time and exchanged in turn, might touch the darkness of our night: Abel came to show innocence; Enoch came to teach purity of action; Noah came to insinuate longsuffering of hope and work; Abraham came to manifest obedience; Isaac came to demonstrate the chastity of married life; Jacob came to insinuate the endurance of labor; Joseph came to repay the grace of good recompense for evil; Moses came to show meekness; Joshua came to form confidence against adversity; Job came to show patience amid scourges.
Behold what shining stars we discern figuratively in heaven, so that we may walk the journey of our night with unhindered foot of work. Divine dispensation displayed as many just men to human knowledge as heaven sent stars above the darkness of sinners, until the true morning star should rise, who, announcing eternal morning to us, would shine more brightly than other stars by his divinity.
All the elect, while they preceded the Mediator of God and men by living well, promised him both in deeds and in voices by prophesying. For there was no just man who was not a messenger of him through figure. It was fitting that all should show in themselves the good from which all would be good, and which they knew would benefit all. Hence it had to be promised without ceasing, which was given to be perceived without estimation and to be retained without end, so that all ages together might declare what the end of ages would display in the common redemption.

Chapter 32: On the love of God and neighbor.

The first virtue of obedience is in charity, which charity is distinguished in two precepts: that God and neighbor should be loved. And right action is perfected from the completion of the Decalogue, so that when good things begin to be done, no evil things are any longer committed. There are two precepts of charity: namely the love of God and the love of neighbor. Through both of these the sayings of Sacred Scripture give us life, because we grasp the love of God and neighbor in the divine words.
Through love of God, love of neighbor is begotten, and through love of neighbor, love of God is nourished. For he who neglects to love God assuredly does not know how to love neighbor. We advance more fully in love of God when we are first nursed in the bosom of that same love by charity toward neighbor. Because love of God generates love of neighbor, when the Lord was about to say through the law: You shall love your neighbor, he first said: You shall love the Lord your God, according to the book of Deuteronomy, chapter six, verse five; chapter ten, verse twelve; and the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-two, verses thirty-seven and thirty-nine. He did this so that he might first fix the root of his love in the earth of our heart, so that afterward fraternal love might germinate through branches.
Love of God grows strong from love of neighbor, as John testifies, rebuking certain people and saying: He who does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom he does not see? according to John's first letter, chapter four, verse twenty. Yet that divine love is born through fear, but is transformed into affection by growing.
Almighty God often, disposing all things in wondrous order so that it may become known how far each one is from love of him and neighbor, or how much each has advanced in it, presses down some with scourges and supports others with successes. And when he temporarily abandons certain people, he shows what evil lies hidden in the hearts of some. For very often those who honored us beyond comparison when we were happy pursue us when we are wretched.
Our journey on earth is made with unhindered foot if God and neighbor are loved with whole mind. For God is not truly loved without neighbor, nor is neighbor truly loved without God. The Holy Spirit is read to have been given to the disciples twice: first by the Lord dwelling on earth, afterward by the Lord presiding in heaven. On earth, that neighbor might be loved; from heaven, that God might be loved.
But why first on earth, then from heaven, except that it is clearly given to be understood because, according to John's voice: He who does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom he does not see, according to John's first letter, chapter four, verse twenty? Let us love and embrace our neighbor who is beside us, so that we may be able to arrive at love of him who is above us. Let the mind meditate in neighbor what it may display to God, so that we may worthily rejoice in him perfectly with neighbor.
For then we shall arrive at that joy of heavenly assembly, of which we have now received the pledge of the Holy Spirit. Let us tend with all love toward this end, namely toward the love of God and neighbor. Every commandment is about love alone, and all commandments are one precept. Because whatever is commanded is solidified in charity alone.
The Lord's precepts are both many and one: many through diversity of work, one in the root of love. How the love of God and neighbor is to be held he himself insinuates, who in very many sentences of his Scripture commands both that friends be loved in him and that enemies be loved for his sake.

Chapter 33: On the old law.

The harshness of the law decreed that each sinner be punished with bodily death. But after our Redeemer tempered the severity of legal sanction through gentleness, he no longer established that death of the flesh be inflicted for fault, but indicated how much the death of the spirit should be feared.
It is written in Exodus: The hands of Moses were heavy, so taking a stone they placed it under him, on which he sat, and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, according to the book of Exodus, chapter seventeen, verse twelve. Moses therefore sat on the stone when the Law rested in the Church. But that same Law had heavy hands, because it did not bear any sinners mercifully but struck them with severe strictness.
Aaron the priest means mountain of strength, while Hur is interpreted as fire. Whom therefore does this mountain of strength signify except our Redeemer, of whom it is said through the prophet: In the last days the mountain of the Lord's house shall be prepared on the summit of mountains, according to the book of Isaiah, chapter two, verse two? Or who is figured by fire except the Holy Spirit, of whom the same Redeemer says: I came to cast fire upon the earth, according to the Gospel of Luke, chapter twelve, verse forty-nine?
Aaron and Hur support the heavy hands of Moses and by supporting make them lighter, because the Mediator of God and men, coming with the fire of the Holy Spirit, showed to us more tolerable through spiritual understanding the grave commandments of the Law, which while they were held carnally could not be borne. For he as it were made the hands of Moses light, because he turned back the weight of the Law's commandments to the virtue of confession.

Chapter 34: On history and allegory.

The understanding of sacred discourse is to be weighed with such balance between text and mystery that, with the scale of each part moderated, neither the weight of excessive analysis depress it, nor the lethargy of carelessness leave it empty. Many sentences of sacred discourse are so pregnant with conception of allegories that whoever strives to hold them to history alone is deprived of their knowledge through his own carelessness.
But some so serve exterior precepts that if anyone desires to penetrate them more subtly, he finds nothing within, but even hides from himself what they speak outwardly. Before the eyes of our consideration the sentences of preceding fathers are placed like various rods. In these, when we often flee the understanding of the letter, we as it were remove the bark. And when we often follow the understanding of the letter, we as it were preserve the bark.
And when the bark of the letter is drawn away from them, the inner whiteness of allegory is shown, and when the bark is left, the green examples of exterior understanding are shown. Jacob placed various rods in water channels, according to the book of Genesis, chapter thirty, verse thirty-eight, because our Redeemer fixed in books those sentences of sacred knowledge by which we are inwardly infused.
Looking upon these, rams couple with ewes, because our rational spirits, while fixed in their intention, are mingled in each and every action, so that they may procreate such offspring of works as they see examples of predecessors in the voices of precepts, namely, that the offspring of good work may have diverse color. Sometimes with the bark of the letter removed, our mind considers interior things more acutely, and sometimes with the covering of history preserved, it forms itself well in exterior things.
In sacred discourse there is great discretion of understanding. For often in some places of it both history and allegory must be preserved, and often in some places allegory alone must be sought, but sometimes it is necessary that history alone be held.
In some places, as we said, history and allegory must be held simultaneously, so that both the slower may be fed through history and the quicker in wit through allegory. Hence when God was speaking and the people beheld lamps and the sound of trumpet and the smoking mountain, terrified they requested that the Lord speak to them through Moses, as it is written: The people stood afar off, but Moses approached the darkness in which God was, according to the book of Exodus, chapter twenty, verse twenty-one.
The crowd of people cannot penetrate the darkness of allegories, because it belongs to very few to probe spiritual understanding. Because the minds of carnal people are often fed by history alone, when God spoke, the people stood afar off. But because any spiritual persons penetrate the cloud of allegories to know God's words spiritually, Moses approached the darkness in which God was.
According to Paterius, book five
Gregory continues: The Law of the Old Testament placed eggs in the nest, so to speak, when it said in the book of Exodus, chapter twenty-one, verse twenty-four, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' But it brought forth its young later when it said in the book of Leviticus, chapter nineteen, verse eighteen, 'You shall not seek revenge, nor remember the wrongs done by your fellow citizens.'
Notice what is said about the mother of the young birds in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter twenty-two, verse six: 'You shall not keep her with her young, but you shall let her go, keeping the captured offspring.' This is because in certain passages we must set aside the historical narrative so that only the young of the mother—that is, the meaning of spiritual understanding—may come to us as food. The young, not the mother, should nourish us, because we ought not to be satisfied by the example of history, but by the insights of spiritual understanding.
When we read in the book of Exodus, chapter twelve, that gold and silver of the Egyptians was taken by the Israelite people through deceptive request, and again when we read of carnal sacrifices offered to almighty God—what else in this nest of words should we do but let the mother go and keep the offspring? For when we draw the alertness of mind from any secular writers to the defense of truth, and turn their eloquence to the service of righteousness, what else are we doing but taking gold and silver from the Egyptians, so that we may be made rich from it while they can be shown poor?
As it is written in Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, chapter ten, verse six: 'Taking every understanding captive in obedience to Christ.' We let the mother go and eat the young when we set aside historical examples but retain in our minds the allegorical meanings from them. Where it is rightly added in Deuteronomy: 'That it may be well with you, and you may live a long time.' For that person lives a long time who, through spiritual understanding, grasps the years of eternity.

Chapter 35: On Predestination

According to Gregory, book one of the Dialogues: Those things which holy men accomplish through prayer are so predestined that they are obtained through prayers. For the predestination of the eternal kingdom itself is so arranged by almighty God that the elect arrive at it through labor, so that by asking they may merit to receive what almighty God arranged before the ages to give them.
We know most certainly that the Lord said to Abraham in the book of Genesis, chapter twenty-one, verse thirteen: 'Through Isaac your offspring shall be named.' To him He had also said in chapter seventeen, verse four: 'I have established you as father of many nations.' To him again He promised, saying in chapter twenty-two, verse seventeen: 'I will bless you and multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven and like the sand that is on the seashore.'
From this it is clearly evident that almighty God had predestined to multiply the offspring of Abraham through Isaac. And yet it is written in chapter twenty-five, verse twenty-one: 'Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren. He heard him and gave conception to Rebecca.' If the multiplication of Abraham's race through Isaac was predestined, why did he receive a barren wife? But it is certainly clear that predestination is fulfilled through prayers, since the one through whom God had predestined to multiply Abraham's offspring obtained by prayer that he might have sons.
From book six of the Hypognostic Questions, included in the appendix of volume ten of Augustine's works: Predestination is so called from foreseeing or foreordaining something future. And therefore God, for whom foreknowledge is not an accident but essence, always has been and is—whatever He foreknows before it exists, He predestines, and He predestines it because it will be such as He foreknows it will be. Therefore the Apostle says in his letter to the Romans, chapter eight, verse twenty-nine: 'For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined.'
God does not predestine everything that He foreknows. For He only foreknows evils, but He both foreknows and predestines good things. Therefore foreknowledge predestines what is good—that is, it preordains it before it exists in reality. When this begins to exist with its very author, He calls it, orders it, and arranges it.
Hence what follows in Romans: 'For those whom He predestined, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; but those whom He justified, these He also glorified.' God, just and merciful and foreknowing the future, from the damnable mass not by acceptance of persons but by the judgment of His irreproachable—indeed incomprehensible—equity, those whom He foreknows He prepares by gratuitous mercy, that is, He predestines to eternal life. But the rest He punishes with due punishment. He punishes them because He foreknew what they would be, yet He did not make them to be punished or predestine them to punishment, but only foreknew them in the damnable mass.
We have said that from the damnable mass of the human race, God foreknew by mercy, not by merits, those whom He predestined to life by the election of grace. But the rest, who by the judgment of His justice are made devoid of this grace, He only foreknew that they would perish by their own fault—He did not predestine them to perish.
God almighty, just and merciful, those whom He foreknew in works of impiety and death, He did not preordain nor drive to this. These, provoking God to wrath, either refuse to accept the faith of salvation when it is preached to them, or by God's judgment cannot accept it, or having accepted it use it badly. And because of this they are handed over to a reprobate mind so that they do not do what is fitting. For these we rightly confess that punishment is predestined.
Since God foreknew that Judas would be utterly wicked in the vices of his own will—that is, that he would use badly the election to discipleship well conferred by Christ, and burning with avarice would betray the Lord to the Jews for a price—He predestined punishment for him according to merit. As David says by the Holy Spirit in Psalm one hundred eight, verse two: 'O God of my praise, be not silent, for the mouth of the sinner and the deceitful one has been opened against me'—that is, of Judas, or of the Jews against Christ.
The mouth of Judas, when he says in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-six, verse fifteen: 'What will you give me, and I will hand him over to you?' And after the promise of money, giving the sign of betrayal, he says: 'Whomever I kiss, that is the one; seize him.' Therefore it says 'has been opened against me.' For when he gave the sign, with deceitful mouth he revealed whom they should seize. The mouth also of the Jews, when wishing to destroy him by treachery, as the Gospel reveals, they cried out saying in the Gospel of John, chapter nineteen, verse six: 'Crucify, crucify him!'
This rule must be held unshakably: all sinners in their own evils, before they existed in the world, were only foreknown, not predestined. But punishment is predestined for them according to how they were foreknown. Also, little children not reborn from water and the Holy Spirit are liable to predestined punishment—they who are foreknown not in their own wills, of which they have none either good or evil, but only in Adam's sin which they contracted at birth, and remaining in this they completed the time of their present life.
The elect who live according to God's purpose must be said without doubt to be foreknown and predestined by the election of His gratuitous grace, and the kingdom of heaven is predestined for them. For the apostle Paul proves this when he testifies that they were predestined and elected before the world was established. Writing to the Ephesians, he says in chapter one, verse four: 'Just as He chose us in Him'—that is, in Christ—'before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love, who predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself.'
Let the human tongue be silent, lest it boast at all about merits in predestination. Pay attention to the Apostle's saying: 'Just as God chose us before the foundation of the world.' This is a gift of divine will, not a merit of human frailty. Finally, pay attention to what follows: 'In Him we have,' he says, 'redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight, to make known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him, for the dispensation of the fullness of time, to restore all things in Christ, those in heaven and those on earth in Him.'
The passage continues: 'In Him we also have been predestined according to His purpose, who works all things according to the counsel of His will, so that we might be to the praise of His glory, we who first hoped in Christ.'
To the predestined apostles, or generally to all the elect, it is said in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter twenty-six, verse forty-one: 'Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.' And again in the Gospel of Luke, chapter twenty-one, verse thirty-six: 'Watch at all times, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that are going to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.'
Those who are without the grace of predestination—that is, strangers to God's purpose—and who persist in evil works, even if they have departed from this life, we do not say that they were so ordained by God that they should perish, as if He created for them the habits of an evil life, as if He hurled them unwilling into every work of death. Far be this from the divine purpose! For God is not one who wills iniquity, as Psalm five, verse five says. Nor did He command anyone to act impiously, nor did He give to anyone license to sin, as Ecclesiasticus chapter fifteen, verse twenty-one says. For He made all things to exist, and the nations of the world to be healable, as the book of Wisdom chapter one, verse fourteen says. But through the envy of the devil death entered into the world, as chapter two, verse twenty-four says. Therefore those who are on his side imitate him.
Indeed, to deny predestination is a monstrous blasphemy. We ought to recognize it not only in the apostles, but in the patriarchs, prophets, martyrs, confessors, and in all saints worthily serving God. Let no one glory in himself, except in God. Let no one despair. For the Lord alone knows who are His, as Paul's second letter to Timothy, chapter two, verse nineteen says.
But as much as we are able, let us exhort all people to good work. Let us give despair to no one. Let us pray for one another. Let us humble ourselves in God's sight, saying as in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter six, verse ten: 'Your will be done.' It will be in His power to change the judgment of due condemnation in us, and to grant the undue grace of predestination.

Chapter 36: On Wisdom

According to Gregory's second book on Ezekiel, homily six: Wisdom and knowledge of spiritual doctrine are true riches, in comparison with which things that can pass away are called false. Apart from the fact that spiritual riches lead to the eternal homeland, there is a great distance between them and earthly riches, because spiritual riches grow when distributed, while earthly riches either are distributed and decrease, or are retained and are not useful. Therefore those who contain these true riches in themselves are rightly called treasuries of the spiritual building.
From the Moralia, book five: Wisdom does not lie on the surface of things—it shines because it is hidden in invisible things. And then we grasp wisdom by touching it through our mortification, if, having abandoned visible things, we hide ourselves in invisible things. We seek wisdom as if digging up a heart, so that the mind may cast away from itself by the hand of holy discernment everything earthly that it thinks, and may recognize the treasure of virtue that was hiding. Anyone easily finds the treasure of wisdom if he repels from himself the mass of earthly thought that had badly oppressed him.
From the Moralia, book twenty-five: It is written in the book of Proverbs, chapter eight, verse one: 'Wisdom cries aloud at the head of the roads. She stands in the middle of the paths.' Perhaps we could have passed through the path of temporal life in ignorance of it, if this same wisdom had stationed herself in the corners of the path. She would have had to be sought out, if she had wished to be hidden.
The most prudent Solomon says in the book of Proverbs, chapter nine, verses one through three: 'Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars, she has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine, she has also set her table, she has sent out her maidservants to call from the highest places of the city,' and so on.
From the Moralia, book thirty-three: Wisdom built a house for herself when the only-begotten Son of God within the womb of the Virgin, with the soul as intermediary, created a human body for Himself. The body of the Only-begotten is called the house of God, just as it is also called a temple—in such a way, however, that one and the same Son of God and man is both He who dwells and He who is dwelt in.
The house of wisdom is called the Church, which has hewn out seven pillars for herself, as it were, because she raised up the minds of preachers, disconnected from love of the present worldly life, to carry the structure of this same Church. These are designated by the number seven because they are supported by the virtue of perfection.
Wisdom slaughtered her beasts, because she permitted the life of preachers to be slain in persecution. She mixed wine, because she preached to us together the mysteries of both her divinity and her humanity. She also set a table, because by opening up the sacred Scriptures she prepared nourishment for us.
From the Moralia, book seventeen: The wisdom of God has set a table—that is, sacred Scripture—which refreshes with the bread of the word those who come to it weary and burdened by worldly troubles, and strengthens us by its refreshment against adversaries. Whence elsewhere it is said by the Church in Psalm twenty-two, verse five: 'You have prepared a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me.'
She sent out her maidservants—namely the souls of the apostles, weak in their very beginning—to call to the citadel and walls of the city. For while they proclaim the interior life, they lift us to the high walls of the heavenly city—walls which certainly none but the humble ascend.
From the Moralia, book thirty-three: This wisdom of God sent out her maidservants who would call us to the citadel and walls of the city, because she was eager to have weak and lowly preachers who would gather faithful peoples to the heavenly buildings of the spiritual homeland.
From the Moralia, book seventeen: By this same Wisdom it is added in Proverbs chapter nine, verse four: 'If anyone is simple, let him come to me.' As if she were saying openly: Whoever considers himself great narrows for himself the approach of access to me, because one reaches up to me more loftily the more truly each person's mind humbles itself.
From the Moralia, book eleven: It must be carefully observed that although wisdom is one, it dwells in one person less and in another more. It grants one thing to some, another to others, and uses us like various senses, in the manner of a brain. So that although it is never unlike itself, through us it always works diverse and different things—so that this person may receive the gift of wisdom, that one the gift of knowledge, this one varieties of tongues, that one the grace of healings.
From the same section: The words of wisdom, which the reprobate hear, the elect not only hear but also taste, so that what merely sounds in the ears of the reprobate, not in their minds, may have flavor in the heart of the elect. It is one thing merely to hear the name of food, another truly also to taste it. The elect therefore hear the food of wisdom in such a way that they taste it, because what they hear has flavor for them deeply through love. The knowledge of the reprobate extends only to recognition of sound, so that indeed they hear about virtues, but with cold heart they do not know how they taste.
From the same chapter: For those sayings are solidly rooted in wisdom which grow strong through the practice of living and even through the experience of actions. Because to many both longer life is granted and yet the grace of wisdom is not conferred. Rightly it is said through blessed Job in chapter twelve, verse thirteen: 'With Him are wisdom and might; He has counsel and understanding.'
From chapter eight: We not inappropriately understand these things about the Only-begotten of the supreme Father, so that we may recognize that He Himself is the wisdom and strength of God. For Paul also testifies to our understanding, saying in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, chapter one, verse twenty-four: 'Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'—who is always with Him, because as the Gospel of John chapter one, verse one says: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'
God has counsel and understanding: counsel, namely, because He arranges His own things; understanding, because He knows our things.

Chapter 37: How God is Seen by Holy People in This World

From the Moralia, book eighteen: Blessed Moses, who spoke with God face to face as a man is accustomed to speak with his friend, said to Him amid the very words of his conversation, as in the book of Exodus chapter thirty-three, verse thirteen: 'If I have found favor in your sight, show me yourself clearly, that I may see you.' Certainly if it was not God with whom he was speaking, he would have said 'Show me God,' and not 'Show me yourself.' But if it was God with whom he was speaking face to face, why did he ask to see Him whom he was seeing?
But from this petition of his it is gathered that he thirsted to perceive through the clarity of His uncircumscribed nature the One whom he had already begun to see through certain images—so that the supreme essence might be present to the eyes of his mind in such a way that no created image would temporally stand between him and the vision of eternity.
The Fathers of the Old Testament saw God, and yet, according to John's voice in the Gospel of John chapter one, verse twelve, 'No one has ever seen God.' And according to blessed Job's sentence in chapter twenty-eight, verse twenty-one, 'Wisdom, which is God, is hidden from the eyes of all living.' Because for those remaining in this mortal flesh, He both could be seen through certain circumscribed images, and could not be seen through the uncircumscribed light of eternity.
From the same section: If the eternal clarity of God can be seen by certain people still living in this corruptible flesh, but nevertheless growing in immeasurable virtue, by a certain sharpness of contemplation, this also does not contradict the sentence of that same Truth by which it is said in Exodus chapter thirty-three, verse twenty-one: 'For man shall not see me and live.' Because whoever sees wisdom, which is God, dies utterly to this life, so that he may no longer be held by love of it.
No one has seen God who still lives carnally, because no one can embrace both God and the world at once. For whoever sees God dies by that very fact by which he is separated with his whole mind from the delights of this life, either by intention of heart or by effect of work.
From the Moralia, book thirty-five: Truth is perceived only from the catholic Church, since the Lord testified to Moses that there is a place with Him from which He may be seen. And therefore Moses is placed upon the rock so that he may contemplate the form of God, because unless someone has held the solidity of faith, he does not recognize the divine presence. Concerning this solidity the Lord says in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter sixteen, verse eighteen: 'Upon this rock I will build my Church.'
While Truth itself says 'No one has ever seen my face,' how does Jacob testify in the book of Genesis chapter thirty-two, verse thirty: 'I have seen the Lord face to face'?
From the Moralia, book twenty-four: For when the interior eye of the human mind has been purified, when the rust of all vices has been burned away by the fire of tribulation, then with the eyes of the heart cleansed, that joy of the heavenly homeland is opened—so that we first purge by mourning what we have done, and afterward contemplate more clearly through joys what we seek.
First the intervening darkness of evils is wiped away from the sharp edge of the mind by burning sorrow, and then it is illuminated by the suddenly shining flash of uncircumscribed light. When this is somehow glimpsed, the mind is absorbed in the joy of a certain security, and as if after the failure of present life, carried beyond itself, it is in some way recreated in a certain newness.
There the mind is sprinkled from the immense fountain by the infusion of heavenly dew. There it contemplates that it is not sufficient for that to which it has been caught up, and by experiencing truth it sees, yet it does not see how great that truth itself is. To the supreme and uncircumscribed truth, the more anyone approaches, the more he considers himself far away—because unless he glimpsed it somehow, he would in no way feel that he cannot fully see it.
From the same section: The striving of the soul, when it stretches toward the vision of God, is beaten back by the flashing surrounding of His immensity. For this immensity, filling all things, surrounds all things. And therefore our mind in no way expands itself to comprehend the uncircumscribed surrounding, because the poverty of its own circumscription constrains it.
Whence it quickly falls back to itself, and having glimpsed as it were certain footprints of truth, the soul is recalled to itself. The vision of supreme truth made through contemplation, not solid and permanent, but, so to speak, a certain imitation of vision, is called the face of God.
For since we recognize anyone by their face, we not undeservedly call knowledge of God 'face.' Blessed Jacob, after he wrestled with the angel, said in Genesis chapter thirty-two, verse thirty: 'I have seen the Lord face to face,' as if he were saying: 'I have known God, because He Himself deigned to make Himself known to me.' Paul testifies that this knowledge will be made most fully complete at the end, saying in his first letter to the Corinthians chapter thirteen, verse twelve: 'Then I shall know even as I am known.'
Paul wrote to Timothy, saying in his first letter chapter six, verse sixteen: 'Whom no man has seen, nor can see.' From the Moralia, book eighteen: According to his custom calling 'men' all those who are wise in human things, because those who are wise in divine things are evidently above men. We will therefore see God if through heavenly conduct we merit to be above men.
Yet we will not see in the same way that He sees Himself. For the Creator sees Himself in a far different manner than the creature sees the Creator. As regards the immensity of God, a certain measure of contemplation is fixed for us, because we are circumscribed by that very weight by which we are creatures.
From the same section: But certainly we do not perceive God in the same way that He perceives Himself, just as we do not rest in God in the same way that He rests in Himself. For our vision or rest will be somehow similar to His vision or rest, but it will not be equal.
Lest we lie in ourselves in the torpor of negligence, the wing of contemplation lifts us up, and we are raised from ourselves to gaze upon God. Caught up by the intention of heart and the sweetness of contemplation, we go in some way from ourselves into Him. And now this very going of ours is less than resting, since to go thus is to rest perfectly.
Perfect rest is that by which God is perceived. And yet our rest is not to be equated with His rest, because He does not pass from Himself into another in order to rest. Therefore there is rest, so to speak, both similar and dissimilar—because what His resting is, our rest imitates.
The vision of God is now begun by faith, but then it is perfected in direct sight, when we shall drink the wisdom coeternal with God—which now we receive through the mouths of preachers as through flowing streams—in its very fountain.

Chapter 38: The Ways God Speaks to Human Beings

From the Moralia, book twenty-eight: It must be known above all that divine speech is distinguished in two ways: either the Lord speaks through Himself, or His words are formed to us through angelic creatures.
When the Lord speaks through Himself, only the force of interior inspiration is opened to us. When He speaks through Himself, the heart is taught from His word without words and syllables, because His power is known in a certain intimate elevation, toward which the full mind is suspended, the empty mind is weighed down.
For the force of divine speech is a certain weight that lifts every soul which it fills. It is an incorporeal light that both fills interiors and, having filled them, circumscribes them outwardly. It is speech without sound, which both opens the hearing and knows not how to have sound.
Concerning the coming of the Holy Spirit it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter two, verse two: 'Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.' Through fire indeed the Lord appeared, but He made speech inwardly through Himself. And neither was God the fire, nor was He that sound, but through what He displayed outwardly, He expressed what He accomplished inwardly.
The Holy Spirit, who inwardly made the disciples both inflamed with zeal and instructed in word, outwardly showed fiery tongues. Therefore the elements were brought forward for signification, so that bodies might sense fire and sound, but hearts were taught by invisible fire and voice without sound. So the fire that appeared was outside, but the one who gave knowledge was inside.
God's speech made to us inwardly is seen rather than heard, because when it insinuates itself without delay of words, it illuminates the darkness of our ignorance with sudden light.
From the same section: When the Lord makes known His will through an angel, sometimes He demonstrates it by words, sometimes by things, sometimes by words and things together, sometimes by images shown to the eyes of the heart, sometimes by images assumed temporarily from the air before bodily eyes, sometimes by heavenly substances, sometimes by earthly ones, sometimes by earthly and heavenly together. Sometimes through an angel God speaks to human hearts in such a way that the angel himself is presented to the gaze of the mind.
From the previous section: God frequently speaks through an angel by words, when nothing is shown in image, but words of heavenly speech are heard—as when the Lord says in the Gospel of John chapter seventeen, verse one: 'Father, glorify your Son, so that your Son may glorify you,' and immediately it is answered: 'I have glorified, and I will glorify again.'
Almighty God, who cries out without time by the force of intimate impulse, by no means uttered that voice in time through His own substance, which He articulated through human words circumscribed by time. But certainly, speaking from the heavens, He formed His words which He willed to be heard by men through the administering of a rational creature.
From the same section: Sometimes God speaks through angels by things, when nothing is said in words, but things that will be are announced by an image assumed from the elements—as Ezekiel in chapter one, verse four, hearing enigmas of words, saw the appearance of electrum in the midst of fire, so that while beholding only the appearance, he might perceive what would come in the last times.
From the same section: Sometimes God speaks through angels by words and things together, when He insinuates by certain movements what He narrates by speeches.
From the same section: Sometimes God speaks through angels by images shown to the eyes of the heart, as Jacob saw a ladder reaching to heaven while sleeping in Genesis chapter twenty-eight, verse twelve; as Peter, caught up in ecstasy, beheld a sheet full of reptiles and four-footed animals in the Acts of the Apostles chapter ten, verse eleven. If he had not perceived these things with incorporeal eyes, he would not have been in ecstasy.
Sometimes God speaks through angels by images assumed temporarily from the air before bodily eyes, as Abraham not only could see three men, but also receive them in an earthly dwelling, and not only receive them, but also offer foods for their use in Genesis chapter eighteen, verse two.
Unless the holy angels, announcing certain interior things to us, took bodies temporarily from the air, they certainly would not appear to our exterior gazes. Nor would they take foods with Abraham unless they bore something solid from the heavenly element for our sake.
From the same section: Sometimes God speaks through angels by heavenly substances, as when the Lord was baptized it is written that from the cloud a voice sounded saying in the Gospel of Matthew chapter three, verse seventeen: 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'
Sometimes God speaks through angels by earthly substances, as when He rebuked Balaam, He formed human words in the mouth of a donkey in the book of Numbers chapter twenty-two, verse twenty-eight.
Sometimes God speaks through angels by earthly and heavenly substances together, as when He uttered the words of His command to Moses on the mountain, He joined fire and bush in the book of Exodus chapter three, verse two, and united one thing from above, another from below.
From the same section: Sometimes God, even through angels, by their hidden presence infuses the power of His inspiration into human hearts. Hence Zechariah says in chapter one, verse fourteen: 'The angel who was speaking in me said to me.' When he says that the angel spoke to him, but nevertheless in him, he clearly shows that the one who was making words to him was not outside by bodily appearance.
Whence also a little later he added in chapter two, verse three: 'And behold, the angel who was speaking in me was departing.' Often the holy angels do not appear outwardly, but as they are angelic spirits, they make known the will of God to the senses of prophets. And thus they lift them up to sublime things, so that they demonstrate as present in original causes whatever things will be in reality.
For the human heart, weighed down by the very weight of corruptible flesh, and sustaining its own corpulence as an obstacle, does not penetrate interior things. And it lies heavy outwardly because it does not have an uplifting hand inwardly. Sometimes it happens that to the senses of prophets the very subtlety of angelic power appears as it is, and their mind is lifted up by which subtle spirit it is touched. And no longer lying torpid and sluggish in the depths, but filled with intimate breathings, it ascends to the heights, and from there, as from a certain summit of things, it sees what will come below it.

Chapter 39: The Ways God Questions Human Beings

From the Moralia, book twenty-eight, chapter four: Almighty God is accustomed to question the human race in three ways: either He strikes us with severity of scourging, and shows how much patience we have or lack; or He commands certain things we do not wish, and reveals to us our obedience or disobedience; or He opens certain hidden things to us and conceals others, and the measure of our humility is made known to us.
God questions man by scourging when He strikes with afflictions a mind well submitted to Him through tranquility—as blessed Job is both praised by the testimony of the Judge in the book of Job chapter two, verses three and seven, and yet is granted to the blows of the striker, so that his patience might shine forth all the more truly, the more harshly it had been tested.
Sometimes God questions us by commanding hard things—as Abraham is ordered to leave his land in the book of Genesis chapter twelve, verse one, and go where he did not know; to lead his only son to the mountain, and to sacrifice him whom he had received as an old man for consolation in chapter twenty-two, verse two. To this Abraham, responding well to the questioning—that is, obeying the command—it is said in verse twelve: 'Now I know that you fear God.'
Or as it is written in the book of Deuteronomy chapter thirteen, verse three: 'The Lord your God tests you, that He may know whether you love Him.' For God's testing is to question us by His great commands. And His knowing is to make us know our own obedience.
God questions us by opening certain things to us and closing others, as it is said through the Psalmist in Psalm ten, verse six: 'His eyelids question the sons of men.' For with eyelids open we see, with them closed we see nothing. Therefore what do we understand by the eyelids of God except His judgments, which are in one respect closed to men and in another respect opened?
People who do not know themselves are made known to themselves, so that while they comprehend certain things by understanding, but altogether cannot know certain other things, their hearts may secretly examine themselves—whether the divine judgments, either closed or opened, neither goad them to presumption when closed, nor inflate them with pride when opened.
The apostle Paul was tested by this mode of questioning, who after receiving interior wisdom, after the barriers of paradise were opened, after ascending to the third heaven, after the mysteries of heavenly speech, still says in his letter to the Philippians chapter three, verse thirteen: 'I do not consider myself to have comprehended.' And again in his first letter to the Corinthians chapter fifteen, verse nine: 'I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle.' And again in his second letter to the Corinthians chapter three, verse five: 'Not that we are sufficient to think anything from ourselves as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.'
Therefore, questioned with the eyelids of God opened, he responded rightly—he who both touched heavenly secrets and yet stood sublimely in humility of heart.
Again, when Paul was discussing the secret judgments of God concerning the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and could not arrive at understanding them, he was questioned as if with the eyelids of God closed. But he gave a very right response—he who knowingly bowed himself to God in that very ignorance, saying in his letter to the Romans chapter eleven, verse thirty-three: 'O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are His judgments, and how inscrutable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counselor?'
Behold, the same Paul, examined by hidden mysteries as if with closed eyelids, gave a pleasing and right response—he who, knocking at the entrance of the secret, because he could not be admitted to the interior through knowledge, stood humbly before the doors through confession, and what he could not comprehend within, he praised from without with fear.

Chapter 40: The Synagogue and Israel Under the Law

From the Moralia, book eleven, chapter sixteen: Before the incarnation of the Lord, the Jews were truthful, because they believed and announced that He would come. But after He appeared in the flesh, they denied that He was this One, because they denied as present the One whom they had predicted would come.
Whence blessed Job rightly says in chapter twelve, verse twenty: 'Changing the lips of the truthful, and taking away the teaching of the elders'—because the Jews by no means followed in believing what they remembered their fathers had predicted.
When the people of the Jews remained in the commandment of the Law, and all the Gentiles knew no precepts of God, the former seemed to rule through faith, and the latter lay pressed down in the depths through unfaithfulness. But when Judea denied the mystery of the Lord's incarnation, the Gentiles believed, and the princes fell into contempt, and those who had been oppressed in the guilt of faithlessness were lifted up into the freedom of true faith.
Jeremiah, seeing the fall of the Israelites long before, says in the Lamentations chapter two, verse five: 'The Lord has become like an enemy: He has cast down Israel; He has cast down its walls, He has scattered its fortifications.' Because that ancient people, who seemed to be faithful to God, with rejected heart was repulsed, so that, deceived by its own faithlessness, it afterward rose up against the very One whom it had previously preached.
From the Moralia, book nineteen, chapter twenty-three: If the Israelite people had not limped at all from good work, the Psalmist would by no means have said in the voice of the Lord in Psalm seventeen, verse forty-six: 'The alien sons have lied to me, the alien sons have grown old, and they have limped from their paths.'
The Israelite people are therefore called lame because they did not have sound footing in action, because they refused to use both feet, while they received one Testament and spurned the other. When the holy Church receives him coming to her, because she joins the New Testament to him already holding the Old, she joins as it were the other foot to direct his steps.
From the Moralia, book thirty-one, chapter fifteen: By the unicorn beast the Jewish people can be understood, who, when from the received Law they took not works but only pride among all men, bore as it were a single horn among the other beasts.
In place of the Synagogue, from which He was born according to the flesh, the Lord joined to Himself the holy Church in love and contemplation, so that she who was previously near by kinship—that is, known through predestination—might afterward, already joined in continuous love, become a wife.
From book one on the Gospels, homily three: The Synagogue is therefore not recognized by its author, because while holding the observance of the Law, it lost the spiritual understanding, and fixed itself on the custody of the letter outwardly.
