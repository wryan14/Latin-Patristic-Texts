00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Letter on Blessed Echeria

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,610
The letter praising the most blessed Echeria, written by the monks of Bergidensium and delivered by Valerius, begins.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,413
Dear holy and God-pleasing brothers, I urge you to thoughtfully consider the great efforts required to attain the rewards of the kingdom of heaven.

4
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:30,905
As we reflect on the deeds of the strongest and holiest men, we find even greater admiration for the remarkable strength of virtue found in feminine fragility, as demonstrated by the exceptional history of the most blessed Echeria, who proved stronger than all worldly men.

5
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:46,299
When the nurturing teachings of the Catholic faith and the bright clarity of sacred religion finally reached this western region, albeit late, the most blessed nun Echeria, driven by divine grace, embarked on a vast journey across the world with the Lord's help, showing unwavering courage.

6
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:59,835
With the Lord as her guide, she reached the most sacred and desired places of the Lord's birth, passion, and resurrection, as well as the sites of countless saints and martyrs in various provinces and cities, all in pursuit of prayer and spiritual growth.

7
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:05,621
The more she learned from holy teachings, the more the flame of holy desire burned inexplicably in her heart.

8
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:16,184
She diligently explored all the writings of the Old and New Testaments and sought out miraculous sites of saints documented across the world, in provinces, cities, mountains, and other remote places.

9
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:21,015
Despite many years of diligent exploration, she traversed all these places with God's help.

10
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:29,455
Finally, she reached the eastern regions, visiting with great eagerness the most glorious monasteries of the Theban monks and the holy retreats of the hermits.

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,960
Protected by the blessings of the saints and filled with the nourishing clarity, she turned her attention to all the provinces of Egypt.

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:50,444
She searched with great purpose for the ancient pilgrimage sites of the Israelite people, describing the abundance, fertility, and grandeur of each province, the fortifications of the cities, and their various beauties, praising the most charming ones of all.

13
00:01:50,444 --> 00:02:04,188
Following this, with the grace of prayer from the most sacred mountain of the Lord and driven by the desire to follow the footsteps of the Israelites leaving Egypt, she ventured into the vast wilderness and the different deserts, as detailed in the book of Exodus.

14
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:18,401
There, where the Israelites walked for three days without water, and the Lord provided miraculous water from a rock through Moses when they complained, their faith ungrateful, in her heart, thirsty for God, a fountain of living water flowed, springing up into eternal life.

15
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:31,156
And where the multitude, hungry, received holy manna from heaven by divine provision, yet longed for the undesirable food of Egypt, she, refreshed by the nourishment of God's word, tirelessly gave thanks to God and bravely continued her journey.

16
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:45,629
While they often heard the voice of the Lord, seeing His grace go before them day and night in a pillar of cloud and fire, yet thought of turning back uncertainly, she, having once received the evangelical voice, joyfully hastened to the mountain of the Lord without hesitation.

17
00:02:45,629 --> 00:03:01,821
While they, unable to endure Moses with the law of the Lord for forty days, made idols for themselves as gods, she, anticipating the coming of the Lord after the end of the world and almost seeing Him present, went to the holy mountain Sinai, from where we hope He will come in the clouds of heaven in His time.

18
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:10,723
She forgot her feminine frailty, moving with tireless steps uplifted by the divine right hand to the summit of this mountain, which reaches up to the height of the clouds.

19
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:19,375
With the help of divine grace, he reached the sacred peak of that rocky mountain where the almighty God chose to dwell when He gave the holy law to blessed Moses.

20
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:27,867
There, filled with joy and amidst frequent hymns of prayer, he offered sacrifices to God and gave immense thanks to His glorious majesty before moving on to see more.

21
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:34,773
In fact, he almost traveled across the borders of the entire world, also taking the opportunity to climb other enormous mountain peaks.

22
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:42,038
One such peak was the very high Mount Nebo, much like the often-mentioned Sinai, from whose summit blessed Moses gazed upon the Promised Land.

23
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:48,535
Another towering peak was Mount Pharam, where Moses prayed with raised arms while the people fought until victory was achieved.

24
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:55,288
He also climbed the summit of the massive Mount Tabor, where the Lord appeared glorified with Moses and Elijah before the disciples.

25
00:03:55,288 --> 00:04:02,245
Another similar peak, also very large, was Mount Hermon, where the Lord taught the Beatitudes to the disciples, known as a desert place.

26
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:09,765
Additionally, there was another very high mountain called the Mount of Elijah, where the prophet Elijah lived and one hundred prophets were hidden.

27
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:14,062
Similar to these is the mountain looming over Jericho, also consecrated by the Lord.

28
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:23,629
Climbing all these with the same purpose, and since altars of holy churches were built at each of these places, he offered vows with rejoicing and thanksgiving to almighty God everywhere.

29
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:38,106
Therefore, it is clearly understood that while he fervently sought to reach the heights of the kingdom of heaven, the companionship of the holy virgins in the paradise of delights, and the rewards of grace with a passionate spirit, he bore the hardship of such great heights lightly.

30
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:43,069
Supported by the Lord, he maintained unyielding determination on these countless mountain climbs.

31
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:47,704
Can you imagine the immense fear of future judgment that gripped her heart?

32
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:55,143
How her fear, driven by the love of the highest charity, surged within her, and how intensely the fervor of divine hope and faith burned?

33
00:04:55,143 --> 00:05:06,708
No journey across the world could shake her, no stormy sea or mighty river could stop her, no massive mountain or harsh terrain could lessen her resolve, and no fierce cruelty of ungodly nations could terrify her.

34
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:12,735
With the Lord's help, she undoubtedly fulfilled all her devout desires with unyielding courage to the very end.

35
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:21,423
So, dearest brothers, why aren't we ashamed, we who have physical strength and perfect health, that a woman fulfilled the holy example of the patriarch Abraham?

36
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:27,396
For the eternal reward of everlasting life, she transformed her fragile female nature into strength like iron.

37
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:34,129
Although she walked this world amidst the constraints of poverty, she reached paradise in the rest and glory of exultations.

38
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:38,093
Born on the far western shore of the ocean, she became known in the East.

39
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:43,414
While seeking remedy for her soul, she provided a remarkable example for many souls to follow God.

40
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:48,844
Here, she refused to find rest so she might confidently reach eternal rest with the palm of victory.

41
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:54,654
Here, she mortified her earthly body with earthly honor to prepare her innocent soul for the heavenly Lord.

42
00:05:54,654 --> 00:06:04,970
Here, she exercised her voluntary freedom as a pilgrim, so she might inherit the heavenly realms in the choir of holy virgins with the glorious Queen of Heaven, the Mother of the Lord, Mary.

43
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:17,643
Sometimes, dear friends, those of us who have chosen to faithfully serve the Lord in religious life, even if we can't fully emulate the incredible example of such a woman, should still strive to earn the Lord's grace.

44
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:21,204
There are many paths to merit that lead to the heavenly kingdom.

45
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:32,333
As much as our strength allows, with the Lord's help, we must prepare ourselves tirelessly, day and night, through hard work, vigilance, fasting, frequent prayers, and various acts of regular service.

46
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,896
We must abstain from all illicit pleasures, worldly temptations, and various sins.

47
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:57,597
Otherwise, while we spend this short time in negligence, when she, along with the holy virgins, meets the coming Lord with a lamp of shining holiness blazing with oil, we might, heaven forbid, find ourselves shut out with closed doors and darkened lamps, rejected wickedly, and asking in vain for entry into life because we waited for the Lord's coming with idle lethargy.

48
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:13,233
Let us remember the words of our Lord saying: "Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you." And: "The one who perseveres to the end will be saved."
For as one exits this life, so they will be presented in judgment, and each will receive according to their works.

49
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:16,848
Epitameron of the Consummation of This Book

50
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:29,732
In order to strengthen morals and guide souls, with the gracious help of the Almighty Lord, I have obediently and confidently followed your command, most blessed Father, aiming to reveal the path of a religious life to those brothers who are unaware.

51
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:37,257
To the best of my ability, I have frequently gone through the volumes with confidence until I completed this book of the teachings of the Fathers.

52
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,813
Here, we hope for the radiant light of doctrine to shine brilliantly.

53
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:48,132
Just as the rising sun dispels the night's darkness with the approach of day, this light enters the dark heart of ignorance, bringing clarity.

54
00:07:48,132 --> 00:08:01,377
Just as a sweet, flowing stream spreads abundantly over dry land, multiplying the earth's bounty a hundredfold,
it demonstrates that the harvest of souls is nurtured by this stream, enriching and fertilizing the most abundant and unfailing joys of paradise.

55
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:04,199
The Vanity of Worldly Wisdom

56
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,501
I urge you not to seek flashy decorations or get caught up in fancy language.

57
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:12,133
Don't focus on the paths of the wicked as they move through time.

58
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:17,664
The foolish often mistake the shocking madness of the wicked for wisdom, and it's truly astounding.

59
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:22,133
With trust in straightforward speech, I wish to speak to you, O gracious Father.

60
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:35,598
At the dawn of the world, after the angelic rebellion, God prepared hell with immense and terrible punishments for the devil and his angels; and created the indescribable beauty and pleasure of paradise for the first man and his descendants.

61
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:44,090
The fiercest enemy, driven by cruel zeal and inflamed by envy, sought to ensure that humans would not restore what the fallen angels lost through pride.

62
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,330
He ensnared humanity with the deceit of his own rebellion.

63
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,760
As a result, humans forgot and abandoned God, their creator, and instead worshipped empty, carved images, honoring the devil in vain.

64
00:08:55,152 --> 00:09:01,393
Seeing that Almighty God recognized the ignorance and blindness of human transgression, He sent His only Son into the world.

65
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:06,377
Like the rising sun, He banished all the darkness of the world with the brightness of His splendor.

66
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:16,847
At the first coming of His incarnation, our Savior, taking on human nature from the Virgin, brought light to a world destined to perish and enveloped in the darkness of ignorance, with His shining brightness.

67
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:27,469
He nurtured it like a nurse carrying a child in her arms, fostering it with the nourishment of His teachings, comforting it with the examples of the learned Fathers, and soothing it with the wonders of miracles.

68
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:31,446
Rescued from the shipwreck of the stormy sea, He led it to the harbor of faith.

69
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:36,026
The sacred teachings of the Gospels, which He spoke with His mouth, He fulfilled in action.

70
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:48,158
He redeemed His Church through His suffering, purchased it with the price of His blood, destroyed the destruction of death by His death, and through His resurrection revealed the confidence of human resurrection and the hope of eternal life.

71
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:52,789
He foretold with the voice of the Gospel that He would come again for the terrible judgment.

72
00:09:52,789 --> 00:10:02,202
Before His Ascension, He sent the assembly of His holy apostles and disciples, whom He had taught attentively and instructed perfectly, to the remaining darkness of the world's ignorance.

73
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:08,394
Following the example of their Master and Lord, they spread out across all parts of the world, filled with the Holy Spirit.

74
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:19,418
Like burning lamps through the dark blindness of the age, they illuminated the whole world, traversed the earth, preaching the word of God, and taught all nations, baptizing them in the name of the most blessed Trinity.

75
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,798
They expanded the Catholic Church in the order of their honor, appointing holy bishops.

76
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:32,707
With the palm of martyrdom and the victory of triumph, following in the footsteps of their Lord and Master, they now rejoice eternally in glory with Him in the heavenly kingdom.

77
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:44,874
Across the vast ranks of martyrs, from the elderly to the youngest infants, including young boys, teenagers, and adolescents, as well as virgins, widows, and married women, all turned away from worldly riches.

78
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:48,249
They saw earthly relationships and inheritances as worthless.

79
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:55,054
This wasn't limited to ordinary people but also included bishops, kings, leaders, and other powerful figures of their time.

80
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,480
Among them, as far as our limited knowledge allows, we'll highlight a few names.

81
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,689
From the heights of the papal priesthood, there were many.

82
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:12,371
In terms of royalty, there was a Caesar named Crispus, King Ermenegild of the Goths, King Aucuia of the Barbarians, Duke Hypolitus, Count George, and a queen named Alexandria.

83
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:20,780
Along with those mentioned, they relinquished their treasures and lands, and all vast wealth, as well as the ornate and luxurious displays of the world.

84
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:33,062
When severe persecution arose, they willingly offered themselves to their persecutors and executioners, enduring violent tortures, fires, beasts, racks, claws, prisons, chains, stones, whips, swords, and other punishments.

85
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:46,893
They did not spare their own bodies, surrendering their mortal and corruptible bodies to destruction, so that they might receive from the Lord a body comparable to the everlasting and immortal brightness of angels, remaining forever in eternal glory.

86
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:59,950
Therefore, rejoicing, they gave up their lives in death so that with the triumph of victory and the reward of virtue, they might ascend to the heavenly kingdom, receiving from the Lord unfading crowns and splendid robes of eternal life.

87
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:09,742
For this reason, they scorned the decay of riches and perishable treasures in this world, choosing instead to possess the immense and infinite treasure in the kingdom of heaven.

88
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:16,176
They rejected marriage, family ties, and temporary earthly inheritance, viewing them as worthless as dung.

89
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:23,388
This was all to partake in the indescribable glory of eternal life with the angels, with whom they will reign and rejoice forever.

90
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:23,665
Amen.

91
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:28,103
After their triumphant victory, monasteries were established for monks and nuns.

92
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:34,649
In these places, the nobly born of both sexes, who were wealthy in riches, scorned the pleasures of a frivolous world.

93
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:41,196
They saw the splendor of worldly delights as nothing, giving up worldly possessions and claiming nothing as their own.

94
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:47,908
They became like their own servants and various humble people, taming their hearts under the gentle yoke of the Redeemer.

95
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:53,456
Half-naked and driven by the fervor of faith, they eagerly dedicated themselves to serving the Lord.

96
00:12:53,456 --> 00:13:00,501
In a similar way, others left secular life, just as the Eastern Theban Fathers had done, fleeing to deserts and vast solitudes.

97
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:07,713
They lived in small and narrow huts, remained in caves and earth caverns, wore rough skins, and survived on bread and water alone.

98
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:14,814
Some abandoned worldly vanity so completely that they fled to the desert wilderness, rejecting all human contact and assistance.

99
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:20,972
Without homes or fixed residences, they wandered alone through various solitudes among beasts and wild animals.

100
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:29,238
They settled wherever nightfall found them, subsisting on herbs and roots until the end of their present life, enduring in this state of deprivation.

101
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:38,494
Here are the individuals we mentioned earlier, living with complete self-discipline, dedicating themselves to constant vigils, fasting, and uninterrupted prayers.

102
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:45,760
They engaged in various crafts, consistently pursuing all religious practices and the duties of psalmody, humbling themselves unto death.

103
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:54,351
They chose the narrow path, leading a life of strict martyrdom, as it is written, because there are two types of martyrdom: one in secret and the other in public.

104
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:59,601
The merit of secret martyrdom lies in the virtue of being ready to suffer, burning within the soul.

105
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:17,154
Those who endure the traps of a hidden enemy, love their adversaries in this world, resist all carnal desires, reject the temptations of a wanton age, live with strict abstinence, and practice all forms of spiritual exercise by offering themselves in their hearts to the Almighty Lord, were also martyrs even during peaceful times.

106
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:21,449
They received the same palms of victory and unfading crowns as the first martyrs.

107
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:25,851
They persevered in the hidden contrition of martyrdom until the end of their lives.

108
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:37,200
What is sometimes astonishing is that back then, as the Catholic faith was beginning, people who were not yet fully instructed in the teachings of truth, but had only just begun to believe, were fervent with faith.

109
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,836
They strived for the trophy of perfect martyrdom and the diverse prize of confession, and triumphantly entered the heavenly kingdoms as victors.

110
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:58,041
But in our times, people who are diligently learned in the knowledge of the Old and New Testaments hear the Lord daily through the voice of the Gospel, which cries out and says: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you.

111
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:04,245
Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

112
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:12,701
They're not unaware of the kingdom of heaven, the paradise of delights, the company of angels, eternal life, and the rewards for the righteous.

113
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:16,913
They surely understand that the coming of the Lord and His judgment is near.

114
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:24,117
For the worst hell-dark Tartarus, eternal fire, immortal worms, endless torments, wailing, groaning, and gnashing of teeth-awaits.

115
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:28,828
If there's any doubt about the terrors of hell, I point to sacred Scripture as proof.

116
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:36,532
On the island of Sicily, through the dreadful and terrible chasm of Vulcan's cauldron, a horrible abyss spews flames over that savage land.

117
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:41,575
So, even those who do not believe in the fires of hell should fear them when they see them.

118
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:50,996
We often hear the Gospel saying that those on the right of the Lord's fearsome majesty, placed at His terrible tribunal, are the righteous transformed to resemble angels.

119
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:58,534
Their faces will shine like the rising sun in all its strength, clothed in robes of dazzling white, shining in the presence of the Lord.

120
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:46,140
Standing in the glory of radiant whiteness, they will hear the sweet voice of the Lord, saying: "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world," and so on.
However, those on the left will hear the terrible and fierce voice of the Lord, saying: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
Then, because of the greatness of the Judge, the valley of tears, called Josaphat, will be torn apart, and a dreadful lake will appear, boiling with fire, pitch, bitumen, and sulfur among waves and storms of flames.
Filled with restless and immortal worms, prepared for the destruction of punishments, where no mercy or slightest breath of relief is found.
Into this, along with the devil and his angels, all the impious, the wicked, sinners, and unjust will be cast down.

121
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:55,388
Then, by the command of the Lord, the earth will close again from above, leaving the unfortunate in outer darkness, suffering various unjust and endless tortures.

122
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:59,899
They will burn forever, seeking an end to death, but they won't be able to find it.

123
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,704
This will be death without dying, unending decay, and an infinite end.

124
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:14,791
After this, a new heaven and a new earth will appear, shining seven times brighter than silver;
a radiant and immense light will shine with eternal clarity, remaining forever without any shadows of night.

125
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:24,520
Then, the holy heavenly city of Jerusalem will be revealed, glorious with pure gold, fortified with immense walls, and adorned with the transparent beauty of every precious stone.

126
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:38,977
Built square with three sets of enclosures and twelve gates on each side, each made from a single shining pearl, everyone will enter the Jerusalem of Almighty God with great joy and exultation, walking with pure and innocent steps on streets gleaming with pure gold.

127
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:48,651
Thus glorified with extraordinary beauty, they will worship their Lord and Creator, who shines on the throne of glory with indescribable brightness of His most excellent majesty.

128
00:17:48,651 --> 00:18:14,739
Moreover, each individual, gathered immediately in distinguished groups according to their virtues and merits, will be placed in the bosom of the stellar dwellings there, among indescribable groves and herbs with visible greenery and beautiful fertility, blooming forever, fragrant with the nectarous scent of ambrosial aroma, and overflowing with various delightful pleasures of paradise, and all that immense glory of the heavenly kingdom, which human frailty cannot comprehend.

129
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:22,156
In this, everyone will rejoice in the first bloom of youth during the flourishing summer and shine transformed with an angelic brightness.

130
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:30,060
They will celebrate the everlasting majesty of eternal life, praising the Lord, the creator of all, with whom they will reign forever through endless ages.

131
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,315
Amen.

132
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:36,842
Therefore, I ask each of you who thinks sensibly to consider how foolish it is for someone to boast about having worldly wisdom.

133
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:48,314
Or how utterly poor it is to gather perishable wealth through the insatiable greed of this world, when everyone knows without a doubt that immense treasures are reserved in the kingdom of heaven as a reward for the righteous.

134
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:51,986
And eternal punishment in the depths of hell is prepared for the unjust.

135
00:18:51,986 --> 00:19:09,730
Since each person on earth has been given the freedom of their own will to choose between these two paths, up or down, to possess whichever they choose, similarly, two paths have been set before us: the narrow and constricted one, which leads to the kingdom of heaven, and the wide and spacious one, which leads to the unspeakable torments of hell.

136
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,515
Each may walk the path they choose.

137
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:21,815
The narrow path requires a person to humble their body and break their heart with all the rigor of abstinence, rejecting everything that is evil and earnestly doing whatever is good and pleasing to God.

138
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:30,331
And whatever they do not want to happen to themselves, they should not do to anyone else, but whatever they wish for themselves, they should sincerely wish for others.

139
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:40,427
The wide and spacious path, however, is the pleasurable and detestable corruption of the flesh, along with lust and the shameful violation of decency through crimes and misdeeds, or all deadly sins.

140
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:52,359
Let us now see and consider more carefully with our hearts what this so-called wisdom of the world is, which is often praised by fools, so that they willingly abandon the path of eternal life and gladly walk the path of eternal death.

141
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,144
Oh, how often what the world calls wisdom is actually madness.

142
00:19:56,144 --> 00:20:02,176
God's chosen ones possess true wisdom, fully rejecting the pleasures of the world as if they were nothing but filth.

143
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:10,705
By choosing the narrow path, they become followers of the highest Shepherd, rejoicing with Him now in the kingdom of heaven, where they will reign forever and ever.

144
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:10,965
Amen.

145
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:21,002
Those who have mastered the deceptive tricks of the ancient enemy, driven by insatiable and detestable worldly desires-the root of all evil-engage in alluring acts of savage crime and impurity.

146
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:30,883
They walk the broad and spacious path, following in the footsteps of the devil, eagerly rushing toward eternal fires and the harshest torments in hell, prepared for the devil and his angels.

147
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,951
With them, they will be severely tortured for all eternity.

148
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:42,896
I urge you not to dismiss these words as mere ravings from new apocryphal writings, for these small streams are faithfully drawn from the vast river of the holy Scriptures.

149
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:49,864
If illness troubles us, we should not be saddened if, due to physical weakness and discomfort, we cannot stand to pray and sing aloud.

150
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:52,880
These challenges help us overcome the desires of the body.

151
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,573
Fasting and labor are established for us because of shameful pleasures.

152
00:20:56,573 --> 00:21:00,057
If this illness becomes overwhelming, be cautious in these matters.

153
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:04,997
Just as strong medicine is used to treat illness, so too is our life pruned by bodily sickness.

154
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:09,314
It is a great strength to show patience during illness and give thanks to the Lord.

155
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:16,750
If we lose our sight, let's not be overly troubled; we have lost an external service, but with our inner eyes, we behold the glory of the Lord.

156
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,027
If we become deaf, let's not think we've lost anything crucial.

157
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:25,955
Our hands may be weakened by some ailment, but we have fortified our inner selves against the enemy's temptations.

158
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:29,907
Even if weakness affects our whole body, health grows within our inner self.

159
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,927
Thanks Be to God Always

160
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:36,095
Blessed Valerius's Sayings to the Blessed

161
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,231
Donadeum's Writings

162
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:46,925
To clarify the two aforementioned rewards, I've decided to share something with your holiness that I recently discovered through divine arrangement in our times.

163
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:52,109
When I was a young man, eager for holy religion, I left my homeland to seek out places of peace.

164
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:58,156
I found myself staying for a while in a large and important church where a community of brothers often gathered.

165
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:05,446
Among them was a brother named Maximus, a writer of books and a meditator on psalms, who was very wise and composed in all his actions.

166
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:07,875
I felt a special connection of love with him.

167
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:14,301
During that time, he became gravely ill, suffered physically, and passed away, only to return to life after many hours.

168
00:22:14,301 --> 00:23:01,980
Once he regained his health, he told me in detail:
"As soon as I left my body, an angel of light, whose beauty is beyond description, took me to an incredibly delightful place. Its beauty surpasses anything in this world, even in springtime, and no thought can compare to it.
There, a splendid light of indescribable brightness shone brilliantly."
He led me, and I followed through the delights of that paradise.
The joyful landscape was adorned with various kinds of imperishable flowers; roses of glowing red, lilies of shining white, and an array of purple, saffron, and other colors, all radiating beauty.
I was amazed to see clear streams flowing throughout the forest groves, rich in delightful admiration; the ineffable beauty of everything was blooming with outstanding brightness and adorned with the sweet fragrance of thyme. An ambrosial, nectar-like scent filled the air.

169
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:11,413
As I marveled at these incredible wonders, which words cannot describe and my heart can barely comprehend, we arrived at the heart of this celestial paradise.

170
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:17,698
There, a life-giving stream of unimaginable beauty flowed, its waters clear and shimmering over silvery sand.

171
00:23:17,698 --> 00:24:37,900
The angel turned to me and said, "Taste this water." It had an exquisite, indescribable flavor and smelled like balsam. He asked, "Does your land have such water?" I replied, "My land has nothing good in it."
As he led me through these delightful places, we reached the end. He asked, "Do you like this place? Does your land have such beauty, or do you wish to live here?" I kissed his feet and replied, "I want to stay here with you forever, for my land is detestable and unspeakable, with nothing good but scandal and ruin."
Then, leading me to the edge where the land ended, he showed me a dreadful and terrifying abyss. The ground plunged down to the depths of hell. He said, "Now listen at this precipice."
Leaning toward that horrifying depth, I could see nothing, as a dark cloud rose from it, appearing like a wall of the same paradise. Listening closely, I heard nothing but wailing, groaning, lamenting, mourning, the gnashing of teeth, and a stench that was unbearable and horrifying. Terrified, I cried out, "Lord, hold me, lest I fall."
He reassured me, "Do not fear, for you will not fall now. Rise up." Trembling and afraid, I stood up, and he asked, "Which do you prefer? The beauty you saw before, or this hell you have just observed?" I replied, "I prefer to remain with you in that beauty, for I cannot even bear to look at that dreadful hell." He then said to me, "Good."

172
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,541
Go now, return to your home.

173
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:45,698
If you truly repent and come back to this beautiful place, I will welcome you, and you will stay with me forever.

174
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:52,291
But if you act wickedly and do not change your life through repentance, you will be cast into this terrible hell forever.

175
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,215
When I heard this, I fell at his feet, pleading: Lord, have mercy on me.

176
00:24:56,215 --> 00:25:00,519
Please do not send me back to that wicked land, for I want to be here with you.

177
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,372
But I do not know where to return.

178
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:05,696
He said: If you do not know where to return, I will show you.

179
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:07,712
Do you see the path on that mountain?

180
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,257
Follow it.

181
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:14,959
When you have crossed the mountain, you will find three men: one writing, another dictating, and the third holding a staff.

182
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:20,190
When you reach them, greet the one with the staff, and he will show you the way you should walk.

183
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,004
Hearing this, and not daring to object, I set off eagerly on the path.

184
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:30,324
When I reached the three men I had been told about, I greeted the one I was instructed to, and he showed me the way.

185
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:37,027
As I quickly continued on my journey, I suddenly opened my eyes and saw my neighbors gathered around, conducting a funeral.

186
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:40,514
My body was in the middle as they performed the customary rites.

187
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:44,818
I immediately recovered from my weakness and lived for some time in this world.

188
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:48,088
Finally, after doing penance, I departed from my body again.

189
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,831
The Monk Bonellus

190
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:54,712
As I share these stories with you, I'm reminded of another similar event.

191
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:57,211
A religious man named Bonellus once visited me.

192
00:25:57,211 --> 00:26:04,865
I'm going to tell you about the profound distress and sorrow he shared with me outside the window of my first prison cell, revealing everything.

193
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:16,454
He said: Since I was previously confined in the strictest prison, I tormented myself with harsh fasting and performed all my devotional exercises in great poverty, all while diligently fearing the judgment of the Lord.

194
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:22,142
One day, however, I was caught up in an ecstasy and guided by an angel into a most delightful place of joy.

195
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:28,255
There, he led me into a small room made of the purest gold, dazzling stones, and various sparkling gems and pearls.

196
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:40,216
The room had an incredible appearance, with shelves built on its sides and ceilings, all shining with the brilliant glow of gold and adorned with ornaments made of the most precious stones and pearls, radiating immense light.

197
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:42,555
What more can I say, or what should I think?

198
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:50,263
The beauty of this dwelling and that place is beyond estimation and comparison, as neither the words of man nor thought can adequately praise it.

199
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:55,632
Then the angel said to me: If you persevere until the end, I will receive you in this dwelling place.

200
00:26:55,632 --> 00:27:04,138
After some time had passed, an evil spirit of laziness and useless wandering strongly troubled me, and I was led away by my old habits, abandoning the dwelling.

201
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:10,517
Eventually, I lost my mind and was once again caught up in an ecstasy by a malicious angel and was thrown into an abyss.

202
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:15,195
It was not an entrance to a well, but rather like a pinnacle or a piece of land cut off.

203
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:24,232
As I descended with the first impact, like a stone dropped into the deep, I stopped after a vast distance, my foot catching on a small ledge on the side of the tall wall.

204
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:26,783
As I recovered there a little, a voice said: Go!

205
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:30,414
Once again, I was thrown down an even longer distance.

206
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:32,981
I landed a second time on a slightly wider step.

207
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:40,251
There, I encountered a poor man whom I immediately recognized because he had visited me during my earlier confinement, sick and begging.

208
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:42,015
I kept him with me for many days.

209
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:50,409
With the little resources provided by the Lord's kindness to good people, I nourished his soul, which had weakened from hunger, until he regained his health.

210
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:57,626
He pleaded on my behalf with the wicked and cruel executors who were leading me, asking them to grant me just a little more time there.

211
00:27:57,626 --> 00:29:03,063
As I was recovering slightly, I heard a voice shouting: "Go, go!" For the third time, I was thrown down a double height until I reached the depths of hell, where they brought me before the most wicked devil. He was terrible and fearsome, bound with the strongest chains. On his head sat an iron bird resembling a raven, to which the top of those chains was attached.
From the immense punishments, as much as I could remember, I will recount as he described.
A massive and indescribable fire burned like the thickest burning torch.
Above that fire was a nearby and not very high covering resembling brass, where the overflowing flame struck.
From that fire emerged a surging pitch-black sea, which covered an immense area.
It boiled with a cruel and most dreadful heat.
When I stood before that most atrocious judge, suddenly three most wicked angels arrived.
One of them was an enormous giant.
The second was shorter, reaching up to his shoulders.
The third was small, only up to his middle.
The first two presented two souls of sinners.
The smallest one, however, offered nothing, for which he was severely rebuked, and he ordered those who had brought the souls to throw them into that most dreadful fire, and so they did.

212
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:11,976
After these events, they led me down to that fiery sea and showed me the deepest pit of the abyss, known for being the most severe and cruel of all punishments.

213
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:19,065
Overwhelmed with fear, I couldn't bring myself to look inside, when suddenly, many archers appeared and began shooting arrows at me.

214
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:22,610
Yet, I felt their arrows as if they were just drops of cold water.

215
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:30,934
As I resisted them with the sign of the cross all around, someone came and rescued me from their unjust control and brought me back to this heavenly light.

216
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:41,675
After describing all these experiences, he said:
I want to create a retreat for myself, with just enough space for me on both sides, because I'm very afraid of falling into such a terrible ruin again.

217
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:48,012
And I told him: Start with that, which you can freely bring to completion without any danger of despair until the end.

218
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:52,738
For it is written: It's better not to start a plan than to lead it to a regrettable end.

219
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:58,592
So, he went to the city of Legion, returned to the bodies of the holy martyrs, and remains there to this day.

220
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:01,103
Heavenly Revelation

221
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:13,260
A long time ago, the blessed Fructuosus, of holy memory, began his fruitful conversion by living a hermit's life in the wilderness and vast solitudes of our shared world, among various rocks, caves, and mountain valleys.

222
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:23,316
He lived like the Eastern monks, in total abstinence and holy exercises, shining with such glorious miracles of virtue that he could easily be compared to the ancient Theban Fathers.

223
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:31,825
During those times, he had a young boy with him named Baldari, who was skilled in stonework and built a path for him through caves in inaccessible places.

224
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:36,522
I learned this directly from Baldari, who is now living in old age, as you know well.

225
00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:47,463
Just a few days ago, this man, whom I want to tell you about, recounted a miracle to me, trembling and with amazement, that Almighty God recently commanded to be shown for our edification this year.

226
00:30:47,463 --> 00:31:32,219
He said, "When I was lying down, overwhelmed by severe illness, as the night passed and dawn's light began to rise, my soul left my body and was taken by three very bright doves, one of which carried a banner above the head of the cross.
They swiftly carried me, and we ascended through the heights of the sky, reaching the East's expanse.
At first, we arrived above the stars of heaven.
There, they led me to a high mountain of incredible beauty, covered by a crowd of countless elders dressed in white.
They brought me to stand before the majesty of the Lord.
As I stood there, amazed and in awe, seeing him seated on the throne of his glory, surrounded by an innumerable multitude, I asked, 'Who is this powerful one who sits alone among such a host of powers?'
And they said, 'He is our Lord Jesus Christ.'

227
00:31:32,495 --> 00:32:43,055
While I stood in awe, amazed by such indescribable and immense beauty beyond comprehension, the Lord said to those who had brought me:
"Return him to his body, for his time is not yet complete."
As they were taking me back, the Lord told them,
"Wait a little, because the sun will rise soon. Let it pass first, so that its rays do not scorch him."
While we waited, the sun rose from the East, passing beneath us with great speed. It glowed with fiery brilliance and shone with immense brightness, unmatched in its enormous circular shape.
In front of it flew a large red bird, its back shaded in a darker color. It beat its wings with a loud, crackling sound, cooling the sun's intense heat with the air it stirred. This bird, moving with lively speed, passed by.
After this terrifying vision faded, we began to descend. With the full gaze of my mind, I saw the entire world, varied with seas and rivers, cities with walls, churches, mountain cliffs, and different buildings adorned with great beauty, filled with people and various nations.
As I looked longer, I was suddenly back in my body, opened my eyes, and removed the sorrow from those present, giving them the joy of consolation.

228
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,239
The Penance of the Monks

229
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:48,850
Two brothers, troubled by the spirit of lust, left and got married.

230
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:56,988
Later, they said to each other: What did we gain by leaving the angelic order and entering into this impurity, only to face fire and torment afterward?

231
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,114
Let's return to the desert and repent for what we've done.

232
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:05,665
Upon reaching the desert, they asked the Fathers to accept them as penitents, confessing their actions.

233
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:10,408
They were secluded for an entire year, both receiving equal portions of bread and water.

234
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:15,743
However, they appeared different; one was pale and very sad, while the other was strong and bright.

235
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:19,623
The Fathers were amazed since they had received the same food and drink.

236
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,881
They asked the sad and afflicted one: What were you meditating on in your cell?

237
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:30,617
He said: For the wrongs I did, I kept thinking about the punishments I was to face, and fear made my bones cling to my flesh.

238
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:34,067
They asked the other: What were you thinking about in your cell?

239
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:42,420
He replied: I was giving thanks to God for saving me from the world's defilements and the punishments to come, bringing me back to this angelic confession.

240
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,061
Remembering God's mercy constantly, I was joyful.

241
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,025
The elders said: Both have equal repentance before God.

242
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:51,551
About the Monkhood.

243
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:56,981
A seventh kind of monkhood has recently been added, which is considered worse than the previous ones.

244
00:33:56,981 --> 00:34:06,551
In the past, from the very beginning of the church's construction, there was a tremendous fervor for the Kingdom of Heaven, and the fear of the Lord deeply moved people's hearts.

245
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:16,497
This wasn't just because of the frequent gatherings of the cenobites, which multiplied the number of monks, but also because the deserts were filled with the cells of dedicated hermits.

246
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:27,357
Even in these distant western parts, a few sacred religious communities began to emerge, and monasteries were built in isolated areas by a few chosen and devoted men, with rare assistance from the Lord.

247
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:33,002
From these communities, the Redeemer welcomed many souls, purified from sins, into the heavenly kingdoms.

248
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:42,572
As the end of the world approaches, love diminishes, severe wickedness increases, and insatiable worldly desires burn stronger, while the envious hostility of demons intensifies.

249
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:47,572
In the most sacred places, only a few chosen men truly turn to the Lord with all their heart.

250
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:56,926
To prevent these monasteries from becoming desolate, swineherds are taken from their families, along with many others from various backgrounds, and children from their homes.

251
00:34:56,926 --> 00:35:03,001
They are unwillingly brought up in monasteries, shaved, and tasked with duties, and are falsely labeled as monks.

252
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:12,118
Some people, who have not been long exposed to the world through active life, worldly pursuits, or work, join holy religion in monasteries not by choice but unwillingly.

253
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:17,154
In their hearts, they do not develop a true fear of the Lord or a desire for the heavenly kingdom.

254
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:21,266
They are not rooted in the humility of obedience or the love of genuine charity.

255
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:30,518
Instead, they grow with the pride of arrogance, inflated with conceit, and become insatiably immersed in greed and the love of money, given over to gluttony and excessive drinking.

256
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:42,082
They are consumed by a fierce flame of envy, so when they see anyone wholeheartedly converting and faithfully serving the Lord, performing good works that please God, they become envious and blinded by the dark shade of envy.

257
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:54,263
Those originally belonging to these monasteries, who should defend their rightful duties and possessions, rise up fueled by envy and assume a cruel hatred against the just work, striving to hinder it with various public and secret plots.

258
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:59,762
Consider, I beg you, how much their own evil will punish them, those whom even the good of others punishes.

259
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:03,720
Who can help someone who makes themselves their own executioner through envy?

260
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,065
How can they find salvation when they turn the good of others into their own destruction through misuse?

261
00:36:09,065 --> 00:36:14,102
When they are fiercely elevated to the peak of pride, they incur the ruin of their first downfall.

262
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:24,381
It is written that when the cruel spirit of pride infects someone, it makes them like the devil; and whoever is made similar through vice will be delivered to endless torment with similar destruction.

263
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:36,562
Moreover, they are so ensnared by the hypocrisy of false religion that they display the false habit of sacred religion in the eyes of worldly observers, as if, despairing of true merit, they gained nothing but the empty name of holiness.

264
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:42,152
In response to what's been said, they create a variety of duties and perform them frequently.

265
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:48,851
They elevate this to an art form by singing melodies, and with frequent genuflections, they extend their prayers abundantly.

266
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:56,631
Both day and night, they indulge in lazy idleness and sleepy leisure, as it's written: Having the appearance of religion, but not its substance.

267
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,710
Like a centaur, you can't tell if they're horse or human.

268
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,977
As mentioned earlier, they deceitfully plot against the most faithful servants of God, inciting a cruel persecution.

269
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:12,244
They warmly embrace those they know to be thieves, murderers, and wrongdoers with a strong bond of love and charity.

270
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:17,971
From this, it's clear they despise God and serve the devil, becoming loyal to those they love and cherish.

271
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:23,698
They become enemies, outcasts, and strangers to the Lord, whose faithful servants they persecute and hate.

272
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:29,479
The Lord said: Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.

273
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:36,448
It's also written: He hates and despises the Lord, who not only doesn't fear God but also hates those who fear Him without cause.

274
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:46,659
Their leaders, though they might feel guilty before God, fail their flock by not preventing evil, and thus they face double condemnation for both their sins and those of their subordinates.

275
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:51,413
Here David prays: Cleanse me from my hidden faults, and spare your servant from others'.

276
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:57,582
When elders defend wrongdoers, it only encourages more defiance, making their hearts harder and more stubborn.

277
00:37:57,582 --> 00:38:01,230
By delaying correction, they prevent the wrongdoer from becoming humble.

278
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:13,646
They fail to consider making amends and seeking forgiveness, instead allowing repeated offenses, as Scripture clearly states that any sin committed carelessly and without discipline by a brother will immediately fall back on the negligent elder.

279
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:17,142
The elder will have to account for both themselves and the wrongdoer.

280
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:27,075
It is rightly believed that those who share in the error will also share in eternal punishment, because:
He who has the power to forbid but chooses not to, is as guilty as if he commanded the sin.

281
00:38:27,075 --> 00:38:36,956
The secretive nature of such transgressions and the widespread influence of worldly misdeeds should be thoroughly eradicated by strict divine judgment and the strong leadership of earthly powers.

282
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:47,700
This means cutting out wickedness from the hearts of wrongdoers with corrective measures and cultivating the ground with justice and truth, so they can yield a new harvest of faith and holiness for their Creator.

283
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,933
Let these few words about the despicable evil of hypocrisy be enough, as it is not my place to discuss more serious crimes.

284
00:38:53,933 --> 00:39:10,250
I will always remember this saying: "I placed a guard on my mouth while the sinner stood against me, so that my mouth would not speak the works of men."
The just judge, who sees into minds and knows secrets, will reward the good with eternal glory and will be the true avenger of the wicked according to each one's merits.

285
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:12,744
Valerius' Narratives

286
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:15,180
To our previously mentioned Father Donadeus.

287
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,229
Order of Complaint Preface of Danger.

288
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:25,590
I, an unworthy sinner from the province of Asturias, spent my youth entangled in worldly temptations, chasing after material gains and empty teachings.

289
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,356
I allowed myself to be consumed by the darkness of worldly concerns.

290
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:40,376
Suddenly, driven by a desire for divine grace, I sought to embrace the holy path with all my strength, setting out to cross the turbulent sea of life, hastening eagerly to the monastery of Complutum.

291
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:47,685
Motivated by intense longing and fear of future judgment, I hoped to finally find the light of truth through the path of confession.

292
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:55,382
Overwhelmed by the challenges of the worldly sea and often pushed back by the devil's torment, I struggled to reach my desired destination.

293
00:39:55,382 --> 00:40:00,864
Out of necessity, between the city of Astorga and the castle of Petra, I escaped to the wilderness.

294
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:07,952
In the hardness of my stubborn heart, I found a rocky place sacred to God, high on a mountain summit, far from human habitation.

295
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:13,324
It was barren, stripped of all greenery, lacking the beauty of a grove or the fertility of herbs.

296
00:40:13,324 --> 00:40:18,363
Buffeted by fierce winds from all sides, and facing harsh rains, snow, and unbearable cold.

297
00:40:18,363 --> 00:40:25,285
Amidst so many hardships and seeing my mind afflicted by deprivation, I endured everything patiently with a steadfast spirit.

298
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:36,415
I feared abandoning my journey and returning to old ways, for it is written that no one who turns back from avoiding the world's dangers will be saved, just as a dedicated plowman should not look back.

299
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,443
The cunning enemy often stirs the simple heart with various thoughts to deceive.

300
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:52,462
It's essential to resist strongly and fight back with all your might, so that neither the illusion of false justice deceives anyone, nor uncertain instability compels them to abandon what they've begun.

301
00:40:52,462 --> 00:41:02,772
It is particularly challenging when striving for high goals, as reaching the top requires hard work and perseverance, overcoming struggles that a delicate spirit might not naturally desire.

302
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:11,609
The first reward of victory is conquering oneself by submitting, armed with a fervent faith and unyielding strength of future hope, even to the contempt of death.

303
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:14,064
In truth, I would say that he fought and won.

304
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:24,265
After enduring all these challenges for a long time with the Lord's help, after a few years, Christian compassion, moved by piety, began to gather a diverse crowd of people of both sexes.

305
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:28,465
They offered help to me, an unfortunate person, providing service or support.

306
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:44,939
When utmost necessity, aided by the Lord's compassion, turned into willingness, suddenly a certain barbarous man, very slippery and occupied with all sorts of frivolities, named Flainus, a priest of the same small church, driven by the goads of the ancient enemy, was inflamed with the torches of envy.

307
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:56,449
As is the custom of the wicked to envy what they do not desire, blinded by the darkness of that envy, he began to rage against my smallness, plotting hatred and often creating obstacles, frequently causing loss.

308
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:11,941
Whenever he came to the same place, with a most hideous appearance-as it is written: "a forehead black with its own darkness is revealed"-clothed savagely and gnashing like a ferocious beast, he came more to relish in my downfall than to promote peace, charity, or the mercy of piety.

309
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:17,217
As these events continued for a long time, my heart began to fill with sorrow and anxiety.

310
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:26,789
I pondered how I could avoid the rivalry of that adversary, escape the unrest of the people, and navigate through all the temptations of this world while keeping my path untainted.

311
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:32,958
Then, trusting in the strength of the Lord's mercy, I withdrew into the deepest ancient solitude I had been seeking.

312
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:38,063
While I stayed there alone for some time, the false priest continued his persecution against me.

313
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:50,560
First, he took the books I had written about the Law of the Lord and the Triumphs of the Saints, works I had crafted for my own comfort during my journey and for the correction of discipline and knowledge, and did so with great insult.

314
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,154
Later, whether through his cunning deceit or the skill of his instigating devil, he knows who is aware of all hidden things.

315
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:03,801
I was often devastated by the cruelty of robbers and humiliated nearly to death by various scandals, barely clinging to life.

316
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:18,105
When the most faithful Christians learned of this, they quickly came to rescue me, despite my reluctance and longing for the end of death, from the danger of this disaster, and led me to the estate in the rocky fortress called Ebronauto, to the sanctuary of the saints.

317
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:25,444
After this, desiring the familiar peace of my former solitude, my soul once again became troubled by anxiety, fearing the public dwelling.

318
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:41,929
With great determination, I chose to dedicate myself to the sacred altars in a prison cell, so that I would no longer need the solitude of peace; ensuring my foot would not step out in disturbance, and that through these present confinements, the divine hand might lift me from the eternal prison of the abyss.

319
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:50,192
While I was finally taking a break in this place after enduring repeated trials and dangers, I found myself tucked away in a corner of the basilica.

320
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:57,923
It felt like being on a ship in the sea, hidden under the hull, trapped in the dark lower decks, and battered by the winds and storms of the world.

321
00:43:57,923 --> 00:44:03,393
Yet, I found a small sense of joy, as if I had managed to escape the tumult of life, even just a little.

322
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:10,547
But just as I had found some peace, the ancient enemy, driven by his envious malice, sought to disrupt good works with endless conflict.

323
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:16,858
He launched his first attack at night, surrounding me with the terrifying noise of a harsh voice, trying to frighten me.

324
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:23,959
However, when he saw that I was steadfast in the Lord's strength and could not be shaken by his threats, he rose again in notable fury.

325
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:33,163
Gathering his followers, he began to attack with even greater intensity, relentlessly persisting for nearly a year or maybe longer, always striving to bring about my downfall.

326
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:39,738
Yet, it was not through my own endurance, but through the mighty power of the Lord's rebuke, that he was finally driven away.

327
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:48,048
Realizing his malicious schemes had failed, the cruel adversary turned his attention to a distinguished man named Ric, who he knew was the lord of the estate.

328
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:54,096
When Ric was convinced that his death was near, he was incited to destroy my humble dwelling, which he swiftly did.

329
00:44:54,096 --> 00:44:58,778
He tore down the hut, casting me from the heavens back to the earthly stage of the world.

330
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:16,031
While he was trying to build a sacred altar for the church on the very spot where I was uprooted, he cleverly devised a plan inspired by the approaching enemy: to appoint me as a priest, supposedly tempted by worldly desires and rewarded with wealth, aiming for the greater ruin and destruction of the church itself.

331
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:24,077
For it is written: Just as a servant of the Almighty Lord fears losing the security of their poverty, so do the greedy rich guard their fleeting wealth.

332
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:26,777
And again: I will call upon tribulation and misery.

333
00:45:26,777 --> 00:45:33,553
Just as the proud call upon God, the holy and undefeated warrior seeks tribulation and misery to challenge and prove themselves.

334
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:37,417
Again: The ambition is small, and the pleasures of this world are slight.

335
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,911
They cannot be compared to the contemplation of future punishment.

336
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:47,634
Do not, through the troubles of this present life and minor engagements, bring upon yourself the punishment of future judgment.

337
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:55,415
For this present life is vanity, and the honor received is temporary; our stay in this world is brief, and its riches dissolve like a spider's web.

338
00:45:55,415 --> 00:46:05,738
Blessed is he whom God grants to keep his soul blameless before the Creator of all, so he may approach His power sincere and innocent, presenting it unblemished, as it was when received from Him.

339
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:14,102
For the man who wishes to rejoice in this world now and later with Christ, it is indeed more blessed to leave free than to seek freedom after being in chains.

340
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:18,495
It is better to live a laborious life than to pursue a life of criminal abstinence.

341
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:26,012
Often, it is preferable to leave this world as a traveler and needy rather than fall into the snare of error through the riches of this world.

342
00:46:26,012 --> 00:46:41,628
Indeed, the insatiable greed of the world frequently arises, but great and praiseworthy is the Lord's mercy, who will protect all who hope in Him with more frequent care and redeem His poor from the severe poverty of oppression, casting down the madness of the powerful from the height of pride.

343
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:56,329
And to continue the order of my story as I began it, while the above-mentioned Reccimirus was trying to complete the aforementioned church, the structure of the planned construction not yet finished, he suddenly died a cruel death and departed this present life.

344
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:00,409
And he left me in my unhappiness, often thrown back into the same shipwreck.

345
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:00,570
33.

346
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:14,636
While I was striving to reach the harbor's shore, repeatedly worn down by the anguish and sorrows amidst the stormy seas of this unstable world, that ancient enemy stirred up hatred with his usual malice and prepared the customary obstacle of latest destruction.

347
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:23,387
For he chose a most wicked man falsely named Justus, a tiny figure of insignificant stature, and with the most hideous appearance of the barbaric Ethiopian nation.

348
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:30,420
Outwardly he was filthy with pitch-black skin and a dark gaze, but in the depths of his heart he existed even blacker than a raven.

349
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,265
Indeed small in body, but abundant in criminal deeds.

350
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:37,077
Against my will, while I strongly resisted, they ordained him a priest.

351
00:47:37,077 --> 00:47:50,069
He attained this honor for no other reason than because, through his manifold reckless madness, for the sake of cheerful jokes, he took up various buffoonery of wanton luxury, and was led by the soothing art of musical comparison to the lyre.

352
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:57,424
Through this, running through the banquets of many homes with voracious wantonness, he often obtained fame for the melody of his singing.

353
00:47:57,424 --> 00:48:05,423
After recklessly and unjustly obtaining ordination to such a great honor, he even dared, through hypocritical pretense, to profane the holy religion.

354
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:12,778
For while publicly displaying holiness through a pretended appearance in the eyes of men, in secret he was working diabolical wickedness.

355
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:12,939
34.

356
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:20,180
After my most recent ordeal and warning, I found myself abandoned by everyone, left alone without any support or comfort.

357
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:26,776
The only person who stood by me was a devout deacon named Christian, whose name truly reflected his character-Simplicius.

358
00:48:26,776 --> 00:48:29,937
He welcomed me into his home with great love and humility.

359
00:48:29,937 --> 00:48:37,133
With utmost dedication and kindness, he took care of me, and together, we were the only ones who regularly attended church services.

360
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:40,731
However, the envious devil stirred trouble against the priesthood.

361
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:47,599
Driven by intense jealousy and malicious hatred, he schemed against us for a long time, trying to trap us with devious tricks.

362
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,979
But with the Lord's help, his efforts to harm us were in vain.

363
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:57,303
Enraged by diabolical fury, he publicly attacked me, repeatedly hurling unspeakable insults in front of many people.

364
00:48:57,303 --> 00:49:03,681
His madness reached such a fever pitch, tangled in indescribable rage, that he wouldn't even allow me peace at night.

365
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:09,078
When I tried to escape his torment in the quiet of night, he would shamelessly disrupt my solitude.

366
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:15,401
Brazenly entering my humble home at mealtime, he attacked me with violent arguments instead of offering any comfort.

367
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:27,721
As we shared a meal in charity, he, driven by his own pride and drunkenness, raged like a rabid and jealous dog, spewing wicked insults, grinding his teeth and foaming at the mouth, trying to tear me apart with his bare hands.

368
00:49:27,721 --> 00:49:33,009
Blinded by such hatred and consumed by jealous wickedness, he didn't even spare the sacred altar.

369
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:40,259
Amidst many grievous insults, he attempted to stab me with a knife in front of many, only stopped by a brother's timely intervention.

370
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:51,734
After the madness of such rage finally calmed down, he was so lost in his insanity that he forgot the unjust path he had taken and got caught up in the vulgar whirl of obscene theatrical indulgence.

371
00:49:51,734 --> 00:50:03,914
With his arms flailing and his feet moving in a lascivious dance, he spun around with unsteady steps, leaping with trembling feet, singing the wicked songs of a deadly chant, indulging in the luxury of diabolical corruption.

372
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:16,203
As he was consumed by the heat of wine and buried in drunkenness, he suffered thirst and hunger even while vomiting; he was devoted to sleep and wrapped in lazy torpor, unlike those who often spent nights singing hymns to God.

373
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:19,628
Christ never considered such plagues worthy to be His servants.

374
00:50:19,628 --> 00:50:31,210
Sometimes, adding to my heart's cruel sorrow, I often received the usual sustenance and charitable comfort from the same magnificent house I mentioned before, from which I had experienced upheaval and destruction.

375
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:37,137
Suddenly, by a most savage royal decree of fury, that house was immediately thrown into terrible devastation.

376
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:41,759
Its rightful heirs were captured and bound in dreadful chains of extensive captivity.

377
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:51,003
I, however, unfortunate as I was, was left not only unworthy due to the scarcity of food but also deprived of the support of comfort, leading a life of extreme necessity.

378
00:50:51,384 --> 00:51:01,574
Exhausted from enduring twenty continuous years, often facing the gravest dangers and feeling my strength wane, my body finally started to give out, worn down by weakness and fatigue.

379
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:02,854
I struggled to breathe.

380
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:08,979
At last, divine mercy, which never forgets those who place their hope in it, showed compassion for my frailty.

381
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:16,719
Seeing my misery, drowning in the world's turmoil, the kind Shepherd who gave His life for His sheep directed me to the most suitable path.

382
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:24,125
He did not hesitate to rescue a lost sheep from the shipwreck of the deepest sea and guide it to the long-desired haven of the shore.

383
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:39,605
In the Bergidensi territory, among other monasteries, near a castle named Rupiana by its ancient founder, there is a monastery nestled in the valleys of the high Alps, established long ago by the blessed Fructuosus of holy memory, where divine mercy placed me to remain forever.

384
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:47,791
When I shut myself again in the cell that Saint Fructuosus had prepared for himself, the envious enemy did not stop trying to thwart my intentions.

385
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:52,468
He arrived with great fury, employing many evil and constant temptations against me.

386
00:51:52,468 --> 00:52:01,544
Finally, while I was praying or lying down, he sat at my head, relentlessly breathing an unbearable and horrendous stench into my nostrils from his foulest depths.

387
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:13,015
I endured these and other temptations for a long time, and driven by his furious anger, he created such thunder and terrifying tremors that it seemed like the very rocks would shatter and scatter like salt.

388
00:52:13,015 --> 00:52:27,883
When I saw the dwelling shaking from its foundations and collapsing over me in the middle of the night, with God as my only witness, I cried out in terror, trusting in the Lord: "Depart, most wicked one, why do you destroy my hut?"
At this voice, he immediately left.

389
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,926
Despite going through countless and indescribable trials, with the Lord's help, I remained steadfast.

390
00:52:33,926 --> 00:52:42,671
However, the adversary eventually targeted Isidore, the bishop of Astorga, deceiving him into leading me to the public of Toledo under false pretenses of praise.

391
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:52,013
While Isidore was sent by the enemy to lead me to ruin and cause scandal among the brothers, by the just judgment of the Almighty Lord, he fell into the trap he set for us.

392
00:52:52,013 --> 00:52:55,544
We remained unharmed, while he was consumed by eternal damnation.

393
00:52:55,544 --> 00:53:04,344
Following these events, the adversary stirred such envy and hatred in the hearts of false monks that they abandoned me, leaving me imprisoned without any support.

394
00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:09,830
As the enemy pursued me and destroyed my humble dwelling, their hearts hardened and burned with envy.

395
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,926
For three long years, they offered me no remedy or cover.

396
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:20,639
Moreover, the furious enemy filled my cell with an intolerable plague of voracious fleas, which drained my blood, leaving me almost bloodless.

397
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,527
When my soul was on the brink of destruction from these troubles, divine mercy intervened.

398
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:33,023
Seeing my dire need, and through the kindness of good Christians, I received the support and assistance needed to protect us from poverty.

399
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:39,704
Meanwhile, due to the arduous demands of this desert, the generous and illustrious Basilian provided two transports for me.

400
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:50,436
To clearly expose the deceitful wickedness of those in this cell and to highlight the Lord's vengeance and mercy in defending His people, I'll briefly mention some recent acts of diabolic envy.

401
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:57,667
When my servant, John the deacon, first received a horse for transport, one elder, who oversaw this cell, was consumed by greed and envy.

402
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:02,154
He ordered someone from his hometown to come and steal the horse, leading it to ruin.

403
00:54:02,154 --> 00:54:07,539
As they attempted to capture it, the horse, through the Lord's just judgment, returned to us unharmed.

404
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:12,237
The thieves came back empty-handed and found their land devastated by a severe hailstorm.

405
00:54:12,237 --> 00:54:17,041
When they tried to recover their livelihood, various thieves came and stole all their oxen.

406
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:22,003
They couldn't recover them, leaving only hunger and misery for the masters and their servants.

407
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:32,930
Later, when the man gave us another horse as compensation and a new elder was appointed as the monastery overseer during this year's harvest, they couldn't bear the accusations against them for the invasion.

408
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,988
The horses were grazing while shackled.

409
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,525
Below this monastery is a very deep abyss, terrifying to look upon.

410
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:43,857
The elder, driven by diabolic envy, secretly ordered the shackled horses to be thrown into the abyss.

411
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:47,288
Who would have thought their bones could reach the valley intact?

412
00:54:47,288 --> 00:54:51,986
Yet, under the Lord's merciful care, they were found uninjured, without a single blemish.

413
00:54:51,986 --> 00:55:02,121
Here, it's worth considering how divine compassion will cast these wicked souls into eternal ruin when, after such a fall, the innocent lives of the animals were mercifully preserved unharmed.

414
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:09,633
After this, spurred by the devil, their envious malice grew so intense that one of them murdered Deacon John, and he died.

415
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:15,060
Over a span of 20 years, I've mentioned all these events elsewhere due to my difficult situation.

416
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,137
Here, my unfortunate soul has endured another 22 years.

417
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:33,578
It wasn't for the sake of vain glory that I decided to share a few brief stories of countless dangers, but to show those who wish to turn to the Lord in holy faith the many challenges posed by envious and persecuting enemies, and the dreadful perversity of those who are lost.

418
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:48,013
I wanted to illustrate how someone persevering in struggle might fight to achieve victory;
so that the length of this difficult journey doesn't lead to despair, but rather that the fear of the Lord and the hope of eternal life can strengthen them to the end.

419
00:55:48,013 --> 00:56:04,181
Therefore, in my misfortune, I continue to pray to the merciful Lord that He grants me triumph over the savage enemy until the end of this life, extinguishing the malice of evildoers, and not allowing me to be abandoned until death in this place which His kindness has recently granted me.

420
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:07,818
This place is so perfectly suited for peace, resembling paradise.

421
00:56:07,818 --> 00:56:29,301
Although surrounded by the tallest mountains, it isn't overshadowed by darkness but is distinguished by beautiful, shining splendor and the exceptional loveliness of flourishing greenery,
far from the world, undisturbed by secular noise or encounters with women, making it clear that it is prepared for the faithful who withdraw from worldly temptations to reach the peak of holiness.

422
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:35,120
Seeing this, the enemy tries through hypocrisy to drive out God's faithful by those under his influence.

423
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:37,368
Replication of Speeches

424
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:39,552
From the First Conversion

425
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:48,433
Reflecting on the first conversion, I'll share the desolation brought by the enemy pursuing my earlier contrition, followed by the Lord's merciful consolation.

426
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:54,577
On a high mountain peak, the people, in their madness, foolishly worshipped the shrines of demons like pagans.

427
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:59,548
This disgraceful practice was eventually eradicated with the help of faithful Christians.

428
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:04,799
This place, despite its poverty, quickly answers the prayers of those who ask with true faith.

429
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:10,999
To spark a deep desire for a religious life, I'll briefly mention two matters of mystical revelation and mercy.

430
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:19,992
Once, abandoned by human consolation and struggling on the steep mountain of necessity without help, a young cleric came to me, relying on his youthful strength.

431
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:22,618
He earnestly requested to be under my guidance.

432
00:57:22,618 --> 00:57:28,539
Seeing his capability for secular tasks, I appointed him to manage my work and provide for our sustenance.

433
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:35,968
After he had stocked grains and other supplies at his dwelling, I prepared to send a brother to him and remembered to give a message.

434
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:45,743
As he descended the steep mountain slope, I called out to him:
Tell that servant to give one measure of food to the blind man nearby and half a measure to another poor person.

435
00:57:45,743 --> 00:57:54,512
Later that night, as I lay in bed and drifted to sleep, I suddenly found myself being beaten, with two men standing by, cruelly burning my sides with swords.

436
00:57:54,512 --> 00:58:00,489
Despite waking frequently from the intense pain, I would fall back asleep, only to endure the same torment.

437
00:58:01,104 --> 00:59:28,272
When I finally woke up, I prayed, saying:
"Lord, in your mercy, please reveal to me why I am suffering. I don't understand what offense has brought such great wrath upon me."
Then, I heard a voice say:
"Didn't you hear the Gospel say that your charity should be in secret, yet you give alms from the mountaintop with a voice?"
Immediately freed from the bond, I thanked the Lord for deeming it worthy to correct my foolishness for my improvement. However, a few days later, the worldly rewards that had caused such terrible wrath were burned with fire.
From then on, fearful, I not only rejected the fleeting worldly substance but also distanced myself from the one who provided it. To make my request for the Lord's mercy clear, I will briefly explain.
While raising a boy named Bonosus in a place of necessity, I had written a special book for his education. When his parents tried to compensate me, I asked the boy's mother only for a cloak made of sackcloth. After one or two years had passed, and she had forgotten her promise, as the grape harvest approached, she prepared to celebrate it. The same matron, named Theodora, then fell ill.
While she was sick and sleeping at night, it was revealed to her that she should go with her husband, little boys, and girls to the church of Saint Felix to seek safety. Because a public road ran under that mountain, as they entered it, they encountered a crowd of people driving many yokes of oxen. In the midst of them, a one-footed ox, in a frenzy, struck the matron under the shoulder with its horn, violently tossing its head up, leaving the horn, cut off at the root, embedded in her flesh.

438
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:34,054
Despite all their strength and with others passing by, they tried to pull her away, but couldn't succeed.

439
00:59:34,054 --> 00:59:42,151
While they held her, barely alive, a very splendid man appeared to them, coming from the direction of the church of Saint Felix through the desert.

440
00:59:42,151 --> 00:59:45,951
His face shone like the sun, and his clothes were brighter than snow.

441
00:59:45,951 --> 01:01:05,810
As he approached, seemingly unaware, he asked, "What is the matter, people? What is the cause of your sorrow and trouble?"
They showed him the terrible wound and said, "Look, sir, at the disaster that has happened. The woman is dead, and we cannot help her in any way."
He replied, "You are many and cannot help? What will you give me if I, by extending my hand, help her?"
They all said, "If you request a reward, you can have it, because your glorious sanctity is so great that nothing is impossible for you."
Then he came close to her and said, "I won't help you unless you first promise me that before you go to Bergidum to collect the cilicium, you will make that cloak for Nunnius Valerius, which you promised."
She asked him, "Lord, who are you?"
He replied, "I am a servant of the Lord Felix."
Then, seized by fear and compelled by pain, she raised her hands to the church of Saint Felix and said, "By our Lord Felix himself, if you order me to be healed now, I will immediately start to make it."
After this, he removed the embedded ox horn from her body with two fingers, threw it far away, and placing his hand over her wound, said, "Behold, you are healed. If you do what you promised, you will go well to Bergidum and return well. However, if you neglect to do it, you will be responsible."
Hearing this, she became perfectly healthy, free from all pain.
As she awoke, she was filled with great anxiety, wishing for morning to come soon.

442
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:11,692
When the first rooster crowed, she immediately jumped out of bed and called her daughters and maidservants.

443
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:18,851
She cleverly planned that on the third day, after making preparations, she would personally present herself to me with many offerings.

444
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:21,416
She then told me everything she had experienced.

445
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:29,964
While I was struggling with extreme need on the often-mentioned mountain, many young men would come during peaceful times and devote themselves to my teachings.

446
01:01:29,964 --> 01:01:37,444
But when the stormy winter weather approached, they all left immediately, and I was left alone, suffering from hunger to the point of death.

447
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:41,344
One poor, religious man, wanting to console me, promised to stay with me.

448
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:46,580
But when the harsh snow and bitter storm trapped us inside, that poor man died from severe hunger.

449
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:52,136
I stayed beside his lifeless body for several days, tormented by the prospect of my own impending death.

450
01:01:52,136 --> 01:01:59,509
After many frequent and unbearable attacks from the ancient enemy in that place, he sought to disturb me more visibly with a great terror.

451
01:01:59,509 --> 01:02:07,363
One day, while finishing the morning hymns before dawn, I wanted to leave the chapel for a necessary reason through the small door into the desert.

452
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:13,934
I found the devil standing at the door, appearing as a terrifying giant, towering like a monstrous statue up to the clouds.

453
01:02:13,934 --> 01:02:17,674
Terrified with immense fear, I froze inside while he blocked the exit.

454
01:02:17,674 --> 01:02:23,337
I began to think to myself: If I go back, the enemy will grow stronger because I would be fleeing in fear.

455
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:35,999
Then, with the Lord's help, I gained courage and said to him: I know you are Satan; and signing my forehead, I said: Behold, the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ, who is my strength and victory; now it will be seen whether I flee or you do.

456
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:41,396
Then, moving forward, I exclaimed: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

457
01:02:42,144 --> 01:02:49,953
When I arrived at the place where he stood, he suddenly pulled back, weakened, and humbled to the ground before vanishing and dissolving.

458
01:02:49,953 --> 01:02:56,565
Though I couldn't overcome this on my own, even with the Lord's help, he attempted to trap me with another illusion.

459
01:02:56,565 --> 01:03:06,426
As I was teaching a young orphan boy to read, divine providence blessed him with such a remarkable memory that within six months, he memorized the entire Psalter with songs.

460
01:03:06,426 --> 01:03:13,380
One day, around noon, while I was working and he was reading in front of me, he suddenly shouted:
What is this that I see?

461
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,033
I asked him: What do you see?

462
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:21,588
He replied: Look, I see an angel of the Lord, whose face shines like the sun, and his clothes are whiter than snow.

463
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:29,682
He tells me: 'I have come for you, sent directly by the Lord, to lead you into His Majesty's presence so that He may repay you for your works.

464
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:35,040
'
I told him: Do not believe it, for it is not an angel of the Lord, but a demon of the devil.

465
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,061
Then, I called him over and asked if he still saw it.

466
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,056
He said: Look, it stands before us.

467
01:03:40,056 --> 01:03:47,295
So, I instructed him to recite selected psalms, saying: If it is an angel of God, it will stay; if it is a demon, it will flee.

468
01:03:47,295 --> 01:03:53,109
As we recited together for a long time, he said: Look, now it has moved away, dissolved, and vanished.

469
01:03:53,109 --> 01:04:02,685
Seeing my soul wasting away in such great calamity and miserable desolation, Almighty God stirred up a certain young man, flourishing in the bloom of youth, named John.

470
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:13,270
When his parents asked him to find a bride, he, filled with the flame of the Holy Spirit and inspired by a desire for holy devotion, chose instead to unite himself spiritually with God.

471
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:20,484
This spiritual union begins with sorrow but leads to eternal joy, unlike earthly marriage, which starts with joy and ends with sorrow.

472
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:26,028
He immediately turned away from all worldly temptations and quickly offered comfort in my humble state.

473
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:34,372
He was so deeply rooted in the fear of the Lord that, with voluntary love, he stood by me through every trial and necessity, becoming my steadfast partner.

474
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:41,370
The most vicious enemy, envious of our love and comfort, used his usual malice to try and destroy our union with deceitful tricks.

475
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:49,230
When he was my only companion in the vast solitude of the inner desert, the enemy sent merciless robbers to separate us through their wicked acts.

476
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,751
He was cruelly beaten, severely weakened, and dragged back to his previous location.

477
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:58,919
After this, I was taken and moved by Christians to another place, as the earlier story explains.

478
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:07,694
When he regained his health and hurried back to serve me as before, the hearts of wicked people, fueled by the zeal of the devil, refused to let him join me again.

479
01:05:07,694 --> 01:05:16,253
While I, following the aforementioned order, was led by the Lord to the same places, to the cell of the most blessed Fructuosus, he was not allowed to join me.

480
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:27,719
And because, when I left the often-mentioned mountain, he departed as well, the constant gathering of people, along with the growth from animals that once gathered there, led to a fire sweeping through the desert.

481
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,671
Entering through this growth, it burned down all the dwellings, including the church itself.

482
01:05:33,264 --> 01:05:38,747
After this, Brother John, with the Lord's help, built a new monastery at the foot of the same mountain.

483
01:05:38,747 --> 01:05:42,260
The bishop ordained him as a priest, even though he was reluctant.

484
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,721
While he was there alone, I felt deeply saddened by his solitude.

485
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:49,447
Then the Lord brought a young man named Saturninus from distant lands.

486
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:53,653
He was well-suited for active work and service and composed in all his actions.

487
01:05:53,653 --> 01:05:55,729
John welcomed him as his first convert.

488
01:05:55,729 --> 01:06:07,866
As they devoted themselves day and night to fasting, prayers, singing psalms, and various works and crafts with great discipline, Christian kindness, which had faded after I left, began to return and offer the necessary support.

489
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:15,106
After a few years of practicing these regular exercises, Brother Saturninus received a revelation urging him to join my company quickly.

490
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:17,289
He immediately obeyed the divine command.

491
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:26,818
I welcomed him with great joy and thanked God, the creator of all, for providing support in my old age and a long-sought remedy for salvation at what felt like the end of my life.

492
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:37,785
Near a rocky area below this monastery, where the blessed Fructuosus used to pray and where a wooden cross stood, Brother Saturninus began to think about building a small oratory with our limited resources.

493
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:45,131
When he shared this idea with me, I initially argued against it, saying the place was unsuitable and we didn't have the strength to do it.

494
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:53,649
But that same day, as I slept, divine mercy revealed to me how it should be done, that it was His will, and that His power would quickly bring it to completion.

495
01:06:54,288 --> 01:07:02,061
Once I understood the Lord's will, whether through my own efforts or where divine providence guided me to give, many workers were employed to help.

496
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:05,181
This was possible due to the generosity of good Christians.

497
01:07:05,181 --> 01:07:09,518
With their assistance and the Lord's support and strength, the task was completed.

498
01:07:09,518 --> 01:07:16,446
Although the site lacked flat ground, and a massive rocky cliff loomed dangerously, they managed to split the rock there with ease.

499
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:23,532
In that very place, in the name of the holy cross, Saint Pantaleon, and the other holy martyrs, a temple was constructed for the Lord.

500
01:07:23,532 --> 01:07:26,864
Though small in size, it was great in the height of its virtue.

501
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:32,416
The temple was consecrated to the Lord with utmost care by the most reverent man of God, Bishop Aurelius.

502
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:37,123
He also ordained the builder of this temple, Saturninus, as a priest with the Lord's aid.

503
01:07:37,123 --> 01:07:42,834
While Saturninus offered daily sacrifices to the Lord there, he witnessed several signs of answered prayers.

504
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:45,214
I will briefly recount a few that I remember.

505
01:07:45,214 --> 01:07:54,786
One day, while cutting stones from the overhanging rock, a large sharp stone suddenly broke loose and fell, striking his foot, penetrating to the bone and severing nerves and veins.

506
01:07:54,786 --> 01:08:01,555
Fearing he might become weak, lose the ability to walk, or even face death, he couldn't remain in bed once the bleeding stopped.

507
01:08:01,555 --> 01:08:10,598
Despite his weakness and with great effort due to necessity, he dragged himself to offer the sacrifice to the Lord as he was accustomed to, even though he was half-footed.

508
01:08:10,598 --> 01:08:16,468
As soon as he offered the sacrifice before the Lord, he emerged healed, as if not even a thorn had pricked him.

509
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:22,444
Finally, when it was time to celebrate the morning service, the doors were so blocked that he couldn't open them.

510
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:31,222
Disturbed in spirit, he approached the altar window and cried out, saying:
"Is this right, holy lords, that I come to your service, and you do not allow me to enter?"

511
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:38,758
As he said this and approached the door, the bar, which was locked from the inside, was heard moving away, opening the entrance.

512
01:08:38,758 --> 01:08:42,340
Seeing this, he and those with him were amazed and praised the Lord.

513
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:48,240
When he planted some vegetables in that desert, they grew abundantly and densely, thanks to the Lord's blessing.

514
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,086
As they ripened, he worried they might be destroyed by various creatures.

515
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:56,247
So, he blessed a small cloth over the altar as a sign and hung it in the field.

516
01:08:56,247 --> 01:09:03,464
Everyone was afraid to touch anything from there, but some foolish person entered with reckless daring and began to satisfy his gluttony.

517
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:08,153
He was immediately bitten by a snake and fell down, lying unconscious until he was found.

518
01:09:08,153 --> 01:09:16,002
He expelled more from his mouth and backside than he had eaten, all due to the Lord's grace, as no one else in those mountains was bitten by a snake.

519
01:09:16,002 --> 01:09:24,904
At another time, a man named Basil, driven by great need and weakness, came to him because his right hand and arm had withered and become stiff due to contracted nerves.

520
01:09:24,904 --> 01:09:29,593
Moved by compassion, he blessed some oil and prayed, applying it to the man's weak limbs.

521
01:09:29,593 --> 01:09:34,176
With the Lord's help, the man's limbs were immediately restored to their former health.

522
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:37,969
Thus, praising God, he returned home completely well and with great joy.

523
01:09:37,969 --> 01:09:46,766
While this holy man served the altar with great devotion, and I solemnly served in the cloister of the upper monastery, he became filled with the spirit of vain glory.

524
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:56,564
Hoping to gain more honorable recognition and greater veneration from the people of the world by separating himself from me, he withdrew to a tiny and narrow cell near his altar of work.

525
01:09:56,564 --> 01:10:02,622
From there, he only came out to perform the daily and nightly services and frequently offer sacrifices to the Lord.

526
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:11,684
After he had been there for a while, that greedy and insatiable wolf, the pursuer of our soul, rushed to separate him from the fellowship of my unity.

527
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:14,570
Like a wandering sheep, he would easily become prey.

528
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:25,115
The wolf furiously attacked the innermost part of his heart, causing him so much distress that he couldn't find rest, day or night, as he hurried around without even a brief moment of peace.

529
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:39,045
Defeated and easily overcome, he left, loaded the donkey we used for provisions in this desert, and, rashly persuaded by the enemy, was taken captive with the books I had written for the holy altar and other items I had gathered there with God's help.

530
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:48,647
Later, still suffering from my usual pain and tribulation, my aforementioned disciple, John, who was also his first teacher, was wickedly beheaded by a most evil countryman.

531
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:55,806
This act was driven by that envious persecutor, the devil, while John was lying in prayer before the holy altar in his monastery.

532
01:10:55,806 --> 01:11:05,296
At that time, although divine providence, which always carefully attends to the misery of its poor, did not leave me, the most miserable, without all means of consolation.

533
01:11:05,296 --> 01:11:10,236
It moved you from my birthplace to fear him, bringing me my brother Montanus's son, John.

534
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:20,725
Compelled by a pricked conscience, he left the service of the king, his wife, children, and all he had, and, with his servant Evagrius, devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Lord's service.

535
01:11:20,725 --> 01:11:23,500
He now faithfully works to provide for both cells.

536
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:34,449
With the Lord's help, who appointed him as the minister of His holy altar, he began cultivating vineyards in that very desert, alongside a vegetable garden and various small fruit trees.

537
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:41,921
He established places to live and tirelessly works each day, with God's guidance, to accomplish other necessary tasks here and there.

538
01:11:41,921 --> 01:11:45,461
His goal is to continue these efforts for the rest of his life.

539
01:11:45,461 --> 01:12:01,585
After enduring many hardships, hindered by enemies and facing the most bitter and sorrowful dispersions, that everlasting kindness- which seeks not the destruction of its creation-granted me a bit of peace, a long-awaited comfort, and relief after forty-two years of continuous struggle.

540
01:12:01,585 --> 01:12:10,799
Furthermore, He inspired the hearts of His faithful, including the merciful, noble prince, bishops, and other Christians, who generously supported me in my poverty.

541
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:15,068
May they receive a hundredfold reward from the Lord in heavenly inheritance.

542
01:12:15,068 --> 01:12:22,484
As it is written: Divine and eternal kindness brings calm after the most terrible storm, and after tears and weeping, it brings joy.

543
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:25,462
And again: Joy follows mourning; after joy, mourning.

544
01:12:25,462 --> 01:12:28,552
Laughter follows weeping, and songs follow lamentation.

545
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:32,260
And Truth itself says: He who perseveres to the end will be saved.

546
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:43,946
Sometimes, while I, unworthy as I am, steadfastly preside at the altar following the holy apostles, with no suitable flat area due to the nearby mountainside, God's hand provided a little help to our frailty.

547
01:12:43,946 --> 01:12:47,598
This short but suitable spot was leveled by the labor of workers.

548
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:56,261
Look now at the olive trees, yew trees, laurel trees, pine trees, cypress trees, and rosy myrtles, all enclosed and thriving with evergreen foliage.

549
01:12:56,261 --> 01:13:05,068
This is why this eternal grove is fittingly named Daphne's, with diverse shrubs intertwined with young plants and vines, creating a delightful canopy of greenery.

550
01:13:05,068 --> 01:13:10,233
Its charming shade refreshes even monarchs, offering a fruitful retreat from the scorching sun.

551
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:16,919
It's as if it shelters the body like caves and rocky shadows, while the gentle sound of the nearby stream soothes the ears.

552
01:13:16,919 --> 01:13:27,085
The fragrant aroma of blooming roses, lilies, and other herbs fills the air, and the grove's beautiful charm calms the spirit, allowing true and sincere love to flourish without pretense.

553
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:33,446
Near this location, with the Lord's help, we added a small garden, protected by a surrounding fence of planted trees.

554
01:13:33,446 --> 01:13:38,067
As time passes after my death, this protective enclosure of trees will grow stronger.

555
01:13:38,067 --> 01:13:47,472
Just like a small boat battered by stormy waves finally reaches a safe harbor, I, unworthy as I am, feel resurrected from the grave or released from a dark, infernal prison.

556
01:13:47,472 --> 01:13:55,843
Enjoying the splendid light after darkness, I offer immense thanks to the Almighty Lord for granting me a place of rest, which I often desired and sought.

557
01:13:55,843 --> 01:14:05,683
I trust that just as He allowed me to briefly escape the abyss of the world, He will also grant me victory over my most hostile enemy, allowing me to achieve the triumph of victory.

558
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:20,144
Cleansed from the stain of all sins through lamentation and repentance, along with those destined to be my comfort, He grants the nourishing fruit of repentance and the fellowship of eternal life, who destroyed the perishable empire through the triumph of the cross.

559
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:23,712
The Remaining Complaint from the Above Follows

560
01:14:23,712 --> 01:14:31,087
Once, as previously mentioned, I was forced by circumstances to be confined in a small, humble prison, similar to a worldly gathering.

561
01:14:31,087 --> 01:14:35,820
I was alone in a sorrowful darkness, constrained by poverty, as if trapped in a grave.

562
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:49,855
When I emerged from this situation, as described earlier, I found myself at the Rufian monastery, isolated from worldly interactions and surrounded by mountains as high as the tallest peaks of the French Alps, so secure that it doesn't even require walls.

563
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:56,350
However, for those coming from the opposite side of the habitable land, only one ancient, man-made path is accessible.

564
01:14:56,350 --> 01:15:02,074
With the rocks carved away, it forms a narrow and winding path where people walk cautiously, one by one.

565
01:15:02,074 --> 01:15:06,642
Near the monastery, on a high rock, stands the oratory of the most holy Fructuosus.

566
01:15:06,642 --> 01:15:16,109
With this cleared, and with the Lord's help, a holy temple was built for him, which serves as the boundary and enclosure of the monastery's dwelling since its construction.

567
01:15:16,109 --> 01:15:21,117
Here, next to the altar of the holy apostles, on the upper level, it is briefly understood.

568
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:21,668
Sixty-six.

569
01:15:21,668 --> 01:15:36,253
Regarding the volumes of books, both for daily offices and the annual celebration of holy festivals, as well as various holy Scriptures that aid in spiritual growth and teaching, I completed a comprehensive summary at the altars of the saints, with the Lord's help.

570
01:15:36,253 --> 01:15:45,390
For these works and the gathering of good people, driven by the highest love of charity, the residents of this place undertook the most severe labor of zeal and envy.

571
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:50,893
They engaged in both public and secret hateful persecutions and unspeakable acts of diabolic nature.

572
01:15:50,893 --> 01:16:01,571
Through these actions, the aforementioned individuals, and those who were publicly killed, others who remained were converted, their minds changed, disturbed, and scattered across various lands.

573
01:16:02,232 --> 01:17:51,216
The holy altar I had bought has been completely destroyed, and, as the prophet Elijah says:
"I alone am left." And: "They seek my life to take it away."
Among those wicked ones is a member of a secretive, whispering faction, a dullard and ignorant babbler named Firminus, who leads that sickly flock in its ruinous downfall. Recently, in his madness and folly, because he had nothing to accuse my misfortune of, he attempted to publicly defame me solely for accepting, loving, and cherishing good Christians.
He claimed that before me, there were two priests in this confinement who welcomed neighbors, acquaintances, and friends into the little courtyard and accepted those coming from afar through the window. Jealously envying their supposedly better conduct, after his slanderous accusations, he was the first of those confined to be defeated and wickedly overcome by the devil's persuasion and wanton desire, departing to return to worldly vanity; the other stayed so idle that he left no admirable work for others to follow.
From this, however, the Apostle James preaches, saying:
"Faith without works is dead."
Meanwhile, I, always observing the twofold variation of charity, both inward and outward, as taught by the holy Apostle Paul, remember his saying:
"I have become all things to all people, that I might save some."
To this, I will briefly add a few teachings from the Fathers. Blessed Arsenius, though noble by birth and exalted by the wealth of his people, was seized by the fear of the Lord and abandoned everything. Poor and almost naked, he entered the desolate wilderness of Scythia and enclosed himself in a small, narrow cell.
While he remained there for a long time, the man of God, Theophilus, the Archbishop of Alexandria, desired to see him and sent word saying:
"If I come to you, will you open for me so I can see you?"
To which he replied:
"If you come, I will open to you. But if to you, then to everyone."

574
01:17:51,216 --> 01:18:00,462
At the start of his conversion, he organized his life so that he could attend church alongside the congregation, accompanied by many other Fathers with the usual solemnity.

575
01:18:00,462 --> 01:18:07,557
He warmly welcomed many visitors, showing so much love that a noble religious woman from Rome, eager to meet him, sailed to see him.

576
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:41,316
When she sent messengers to request a meeting and he declined, she confidently stated, "I trust in God that I will see him." With determination and following the Lord's guidance, she found him outside his cell. She fell at his feet and remained there until he lifted her up.
It turned out that, although he had previously refused to meet a bishop, he later, by the Lord's will, accepted a faithful woman in love, albeit reluctantly. For in the future judgment, the Lord will not be concerned with closed or open places, not with monasteries, towns, villages, attire, or gender, but will reward each according to their own deeds.

577
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:44,040
On the Institution of a New Life

578
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:47,082
Dear son, embrace your tears and don't hold them back.

579
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:49,956
Be just as willing to cry as you were eager to sin.

580
01:18:49,956 --> 01:18:54,069
Let your dedication to repentance be as strong as your desire was to sin.

581
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:56,774
As deeply as you fell, so should you rise again.

582
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:59,704
Don't let anything make you feel secure in your sin.

583
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:02,577
Avoid being deceived by false security or flattery.

584
01:19:02,577 --> 01:19:07,423
Always keep both hope and fear in your heart - hope and fear together, fear and trust.

585
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:13,846
Let the hope of forgiveness uplift you, but let the fear of hell always keep you in check, and let fear guide you.

586
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:17,227
The fear of the Lord helps drive away sin and destroys vice.

587
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:19,425
Without fear, life falls into disorder.

588
01:19:19,425 --> 01:19:22,805
I wish for you to have more strength in spirit than in body.

589
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,510
Physical adversity can be a remedy for the soul.

590
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:31,201
If prosperity lifts you up, don't let it make you proud; if slander comes your way, don't lose heart.

591
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:38,582
Remember, you're tested in prosperity, not elevated by it, and take both the good and the bad with a calm mind as they come to you.

592
01:19:38,582 --> 01:19:42,245
If you can avoid anger, do so; otherwise, endure it or temper it.

593
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,893
Learn to endure wrongs rather than commit them.

594
01:19:44,893 --> 01:19:50,189
Rise above the errors of detractors by ignoring them, and surpass their insults with patience.

595
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:53,626
Be quick to raise the shield of patience against harsh words.

596
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:59,486
Even if someone mocks, provokes, insults, injures, or offends you with words, stay silent and ignore it.

597
01:19:59,486 --> 01:20:03,430
Practice silence; don't respond to insults or retaliate against abuse.

598
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:18,531
Learn modesty from Christ, learn tolerance; having suffered injury for us, he left us an example: even though he was struck with palms, beaten with lashes, mocked with spit, nailed with nails, crowned with thorns, and condemned to the cross, he always remained silent.

599
01:20:18,531 --> 01:20:24,616
It is a great virtue not to harm those who have harmed you, and a great glory to spare those you could hurt.

600
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:27,434
Respond to the one who curses you with a blessing.

601
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:29,688
Strive to turn away anger with patience.

602
01:20:30,984 --> 01:20:37,046
Overcome the wrongs of others with your own good actions, because you won't receive forgiveness unless you give it.

603
01:20:37,046 --> 01:20:45,585
Even if the other person doesn't ask for forgiveness, and even if they don't request to be forgiven, you should forgive from your heart and let go from your mind.

604
01:20:45,585 --> 01:20:53,651
This way, your Father in heaven may also forgive you, just as you forgive those who owe you, meaning those who persecute you, curse you, and slander you.

605
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:56,866
Don't hold onto the pain caused by someone else's wickedness.

606
01:20:56,866 --> 01:21:01,452
Envy devours good things with its harmful heat; envy eats away at the soul like a moth.

607
01:21:01,452 --> 01:21:05,775
It burns the heart, affects the mind, and consumes a person's heart like a plague.

608
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:09,781
Let kindness counteract jealousy, and let love be your defense against envy.

609
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,890
Always maintain the bond of consistency.

610
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:17,741
In all your actions, imitate good people, emulate the saints, and keep the examples of priests in front of you.

611
01:21:17,741 --> 01:21:23,170
Let the teachings of the Fathers motivate you; don't let favoritism mislead you or criticism break you.

612
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:26,122
The one who does not seek praise does not feel insulted.

613
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:29,233
For what good is it if you're called good while you're bad?

614
01:21:29,233 --> 01:21:34,662
Judge yourself by your own standards, not someone else's; be the kind of person you want to be seen as.

615
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:37,825
Show your profession not in your attire but in your conduct.

616
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:45,521
Let simplicity be in your approach, purity in your manner, gravity in your bearing, and let honesty shine in your conduct, with nothing frivolous.

617
01:21:45,521 --> 01:21:49,686
Let your actions not offend others, nor give them a reason to speak ill of you.

618
01:21:49,686 --> 01:21:53,165
Avoid wicked and unjust people, especially those inclined to vice.

619
01:21:53,165 --> 01:21:59,543
Surround yourself with good companions, because if you're in the company of good conversations, you'll also be in virtue.

620
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:03,180
Reject indecent talk, for idle talk is a sign of an empty conscience.

621
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:08,399
The mind of a person is revealed by their tongue; and the kind of speech shown, the mind is proven.

622
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:10,613
Speak not whatever, but what is necessary.

623
01:22:10,613 --> 01:22:15,885
Do not stain your mouth with the wrongs of others: focus on your own judgments, not those of others.

624
01:22:15,885 --> 01:22:21,051
Do not inquire into what doesn't concern you, nor desire to know what people say among themselves.

625
01:22:21,051 --> 01:22:24,635
By fulfilling these words of the law, you will achieve eternal life.
