      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n  <p>\n    The basis for Menard's distinction between the two lies in the dual Rule associated with Fructuosus. \n    One Rule, he notes, belongs to the renowned bishop Fructuosus of Braga, consisting of twenty-five chapters. \n    This is well recognized from chapter eighteen, which mandates a Lenten fast before the feast of Saints Justus and Pastor-a tradition established by Saint Fructuosus, as his monastery was dedicated to these martyrs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The other Rule is attributed to another Fructuosus, who is set apart from the first in this Concord, even though the two Fructuosi are sometimes confused due to scribes' errors. \n    We skip over the evidence from the Pseudo-Maximus Chronicle, which Menard, appropriately, views as almost worthless. \n    Both Rules, despite this learned analysis, seem evidently to be authored by the same Bishop Fructuosus of Braga.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The first Rule, with its twenty-five chapters, is aimed at monks, while the second is for both men and women seeking conversion, known as a common monastic Rule, and consists of twenty chapters. \n    We understand why Fructuosus wrote this latter Rule from chapter seventeen of the Life below. \n    There was such a flourishing of holiness and a growing reputation for perfection that men, along with their sons, joined the holy congregation of monks, while women and their daughters joined the holy community of virgins.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Thus, the sixth chapter of the common Rule addresses how men, along with their wives and children, should live in the monastery safely. \n    It's established so that monks do not live with sisters in the same monastery, nor use a common oratory. \n    This is thoroughly safeguarded in chapter fifteen and beyond.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Many aspects of both Rules are consistent. \n    Chapters on elders and the Lord's Day, which are absent in the monks' Rule or the first Rule, as noted by Holstenius, are included verbatim in the common Rule or the second Rule, forming chapters eight and thirteen in the manuscripts.\n  </p>\n</speak>",

Quod satis notum est ex cap. 18\nejusdem Regulae, in quo statuitur una Quadragesima\njejunanda ante festum SS. Justi et Pastoris, quam\nsane instituit S.
