Sermon on the Translation of Saint Hilary
by Peter Damian
Let us rejoice and be glad, beloved, as we gather solemnly to remember the lofty merits of the blessed Hilary.
The very dignity of his illustrious name calls us to let our minds be filled with spiritual joy and to cheerfully celebrate.
Likewise, it is fitting that as we honor the translation of this blessed man, we should also elevate our minds from earthly desires to heavenly ones.
As we observe the great honor given to his body's remains and the humble dust, may our minds consider the immense glory he possesses in heaven, where true and incomparable honor resides.
But let us now briefly recount the history of this translation, so that no one may doubt the distinguished origin of this celebration.
While Christ's confessor Fridelinus was honorably leading the monastery of the blessed Hilary, situated in the suburb of Poitiers, and was distinguished by the notable disciplines of holy conversation and the remarkable dignity of his conduct, the blessed Hilary appeared to him in a vision.
Among other things, he commanded with a certain authoritative vigor that both he and the Bishop of Poitiers should promptly go to the King of the Franks, who was then in power, to confidently request the funds needed to expand and enhance the monastery.
He added that once the monastery was newly restored, the holy Abbot should provide a suitable place where his body could be reburied after the translation.
The king graciously and kindly received their mission and generously bestowed great gifts upon them.
Thus, the monks, reconstructing the monastery from the ground up with masons and builders and splendidly restoring it, tirelessly worked on their tasks until they not only completed the rising structure but also adorned the walls inside and out with radiant mosaics.
When the royal funds ran out, the bishop did not cease to supplement what was lacking from ecclesiastical resources.
Finally, with the monastery not only completed but also dedicated with the blessings of priestly office, they proceeded to dismantle the tomb where the saint's body had been buried.
On the appointed day for the transfer of the holy remains, the night before, while the bishop and the abbot were keeping vigil and praying, they suddenly saw the holy Angels taking the saint's body from the tomb, which had already been opened, and carrying it to the prepared place with their own hands.
After these events, the blessed Hilary appeared in a vision to the holy Fridelinus, advising him to appoint a certain relative of his, a Scot, as the leader of the monastery, while he himself should hasten to Gallinaria Island to build a church in honor of the same blessed Hilary.
Fridelinus humbly obeyed the saintly command and not only did what was ordered but also built four other monasteries in his honor.
Although the life of the blessed Fridelinus, in which this story is said to be recorded, has not come into our hands, the account here written became known through the report of a brother.
This then is the reason for this sacred celebration.
This is the venerable subject of today's solemnity, that the faithful people may rightfully rejoice in the translation of the sacred body, for which the army of Angels conducted the funeral rites.
Moreover, upon the occasion of this venerable translation, we also recall the other deeds of the blessed man, so that what was done long ago may now seem recent and new to our sight.
For as soon as we begin to discuss the deeds of this venerable man, we immediately remember how he stood as an impenetrable wall of the Church against the arrows of heretics.
The invincible fighter crushed the perverse doctrine of the Arians with the grace of Catholic truth.
It is also worth noting that when he went to fight against the treachery of the heretics and sought Seleucia, a town in Isauria, a pagan girl, divinely inspired, announced the arrival of the holy priest. Thus, together with her father Florentius and the whole family, she deserved to receive the sacrament of divine baptism.
Nor should we forget the remarkable miracle that took place on the island of Gallinaria, where the venomous rage of massive serpents could not withstand the power of such an illustrious bishop. Terrified as if by a thunderous roar, they did not dare to cross even the insignificant staff he had set as a boundary.
Additionally, it is worth recalling that this same distinguished bishop resurrected a boy who had died without the grace of baptism. Not only did he return the boy alive and well to his mother, but he also instructed him in the basics of true faith and added him to the children of the holy Church.
Thus, these and many other notable acts of his virtue come to mind on the occasion of this venerable translation, which inspire us with love for God and devotion to this illustrious priest. Indeed, while the holy Church venerates the translations of many just men, which were diligently carried out by men, how much more should we solemnly commemorate this one, which was done by the hands of angels!
But what is it that the Lord Himself buried the body of Moses and yet did not want his tomb to be known to men? Whereas the body of the blessed Hilary was not only transferred before men by angels but was also elevated to such honor and reverence by the whole Church. For it is written about Moses:
"So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, at the command of the Lord, and He buried him in the valley of the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor, but no one knows his burial place to this day"
Deuteronomy thirty-four, verses five to six.
Why is it then that Moses remains unknown, while Hilary is visited daily with such glory of Christian devotion?
Why, I ask, is Moses hidden from human knowledge, if not to prevent the possibility that someone so dear and familiar to God might receive divine honor from the treachery of the Israelite people? Indeed, the bodies of other saints are not hidden: so that, visited frequently by Christian devotion, they may become shining signs of virtue, and their merits may be increased by the approach of the faithful.
Furthermore, some faithful are buried in prominent tombs after death to remind the living of them, so that they do not omit to provide acts of piety. Hence, burial is traditionally called a reminder: so that through it the living are remembered, and the dead receive refreshment.
But why did some of the saints take great care to provide tombs for their bodies? Abraham, for instance, bought a double cave from the sons of Heth for four hundred silver shekels. Jacob and Joseph, with all their heart's desire, aimed to be buried in the same cave
Genesis twenty-three, verse sixteen,
and demanded that their bodies be taken there after death.
Why did the holy Patriarchs, who clearly declared themselves to be dust and ashes, who certainly despised their bodies and all bodily things in the contemplation of heavenly things, so long to have their bodies rest in the land of the Canaanites? Why did they foresee that place above all others in the world for their rest, if not because they knew that the author of human salvation would be born there from their seed?
Hence, Jacob implored his son Joseph, saying:
"If I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place"
Genesis forty-seven, verses twenty-nine to thirty.
Why did Jacob ask his son to place his hand under his thigh as a sign of confirming the promise, if not because he knew that He who is the ultimate truth would be propagated from his own seed? The blessed men were already deeply attached to those borders of the land, which they foresaw would be trodden by the feet of the Savior.
With their earthly eyes, they were already seeing the precious blood of the Lord’s body being shed, so that their bodies might await their resurrection in the place where they knew the author of the blessed resurrection would rise.
To him, beloved, let us direct the clear vision of our minds. To him, although we cannot reach him by walking, let us hasten with the eagerness of our longing desires.
And while we show due reverence to the relics of any saints, let us direct the gaze of our minds to that singular body, which we believe is exalted in the glory of the Father’s majesty beyond words.
Surely, that is the land for which the blessed Patriarchs and Prophets longed, the land flowing with milk and honey.
Milk flows from the breasts of the flesh, while honey comes from above. And since the substance of the Lord’s body came forth from the womb of the Virgin, and his divinity descended from the majesty of the Father, the body of the Savior is rightly called the promised land.
This land is said to flow with milk and honey because in the body of our Redeemer, there is both the true substance and the ineffable sweetness of divinity.
For in him, as the Apostle says, all the fullness of the deity dwells bodily, and elsewhere: God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself  (Second Corinthians 5:19).
May he bring us to this land of the living, who did not disdain to endure mortal things in our land, so that we may be fed there with milk and honey, and be satisfied with the presence of our Savior and the sweet honey of his divinity, who lives and reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever.  Amen.
