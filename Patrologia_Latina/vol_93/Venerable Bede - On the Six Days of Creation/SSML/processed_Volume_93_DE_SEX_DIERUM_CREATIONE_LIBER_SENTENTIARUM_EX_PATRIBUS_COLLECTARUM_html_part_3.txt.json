Christ is the beginning, as He Himself says in the Gospel: <s>I am the beginning, who speaks to you.</s> So, in this beginning, God made the heaven, meaning the spiritual ones who meditate on and seek heavenly things. In Him, He also made the earthly ones, who have not yet let go of the earthly.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            But the earth was empty and void, meaning it was not yet separated from the sea. And void, meaning it was not surrounded by shores or adorned with vines, trees, or animals.\n        </p>\n    \n</speak>",

In hoc igitur\n principio fecit Deus coelum, id est, spiritales, qui\ncoelestia meditantur et quaerunt. In ipso fecit et carnales,\nqui terrenum necdum deposuerunt. Terra autem\nerat inanis et vacua, id est, Quia nondum erat a\nmari distincta. Et vacua, id est, quia littoribus non\nerat circumdata, vel vitibus ornata: id est, arboribus\nvel animalibus.",
