      "original_latin": "Recapitulatio. Dixit quoque Deus: Fiat lux. Id est, illuminatio\ncredulitatis appareat. Prima enim die lucem fidei\ndedit, quia prima est in conversione fides. Unde et\nipsum primum in praeceptis mandatum est: Dominus\nDeus tuus, Deus unus est. Propter quam fidem ipse\nDominus etiam invisibiliter in mundo apparere voluit. Jam tunc Deus juxta praesentiae suae gratiam divisit\njustos, id est, filios Dei et lucis, a peccatoribus, tanquam\na tenebris: istos vocans diem, illos noctem. Nam\nquia in Ecclesia lucis nomine justi appellantur, audi\nApostolum: Fuistis, inquit, aliquando tenebrae,\nnunc autem lux in Domino (Ephes. V). Factumque vespere et mane dies unus. Quid est vespere,\n nisi ipsa perfectio singulorum operum? et\nmane, id est, inchoatio sequentium.",
