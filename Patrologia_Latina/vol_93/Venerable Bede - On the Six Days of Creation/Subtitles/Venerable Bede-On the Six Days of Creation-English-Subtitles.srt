00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,456
A Collection of Sentences on the Six Days of Creation by Bede, Drawn from the Church Fathers

2
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:07,800
The First Day

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,852
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,923
This chapter is the head of all books.

5
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:17,719
All divine Scripture is divided into two parts: the Old Testament and the New Testament.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,188
Some parts reveal inner meanings, such as: In the beginning was the Word (John 1).

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:27,747
Others narrate events, such as: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1).

8
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:32,652
Some announce future events, like: When the Son of Man comes in his glory (Matthew 25:31).

9
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:37,121
Others prescribe actions to be taken, such as: Love your neighbor (Matthew 22:39).

10
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,265
How are they divided?

11
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:46,441
Some are spoken in a figurative sense, like the Song of Songs; and there is: Adam heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden (Genesis 3:8).

12
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:52,327
Others are according to the faith of historical events, such as when the people crossed the Red Sea on foot.

13
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:58,758
Some are stated in both ways, like the crossing of the Red Sea and the miracles that the Lord performed in the Gospel.

14
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:02,300
It says: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:11,674
We need to inquire what beginning this refers to, whether it is the beginning of time or the beginning as the start of His creation, from which other things began to exist.

16
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:13,909
They were not always co-eternal with God.

17
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:32,167
Let us say: In the beginning, co-eternal with Himself, God made the heavens and the earth,
that is, in the only-begotten Son, who is the Wisdom of the Father,
of whom the Apostle says: Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God (First Corinthians 1:24);
and in the psalm, it says: You have made all things in wisdom (Psalm 104:24).

18
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:44,865
Again, the Apostle says: For in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible (Colossians 1:16),
as the evangelist also says of Christ: He was in the world, and the world was made through him (John 1:10).

19
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:49,007
However, we must ask, did God first make the heavens and the earth or light?

20
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:53,858
And if light was created first, why does it not say: In the beginning, God created light?

21
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:58,490
We must understand that He created the heavens, the earth, and the light all at once.

22
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:10,739
Since the origin is the only thing that matters, just as a person can't tell two familiar stories at the same time, the Lord first explained the origin before describing what came from it, even though He could have done both simultaneously.

23
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,556
What comes first in action also comes first in storytelling.

24
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:17,547
Therefore, Holy Scripture needed to explain both the deeds done and the stories told.

25
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:21,725
It first had to explain where something came from before detailing what was made from it.

26
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,467
This was to help those who are slower to understand that physical things were created from something.

27
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:32,899
There's no difference between the creation of the heavens and the earth, and light, except the difference between the word and the voice.

28
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:40,974
That's why it doesn't say: In the beginning, God made the heaven and the earth, but rather: Created, because of the formlessness of matter and the deeper spiritual meaning.

29
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:44,115
In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.

30
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:49,157
Christ is the beginning, as He Himself says in the Gospel: I am the beginning, who speaks to you.

31
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:54,979
So, in this beginning, God made the heaven, meaning the spiritual ones who meditate on and seek heavenly things.

32
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:59,034
In Him, He also made the earthly ones, who have not yet let go of the earthly.

33
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:03,193
But the earth was empty and void, meaning it was not yet separated from the sea.

34
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:07,924
And void, meaning it was not surrounded by shores or adorned with vines, trees, or animals.

35
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,938
But the earth was formless and empty.

36
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:14,252
Our flesh, like the earth, was formless and empty before it received the shape of doctrine.

37
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:18,329
Darkness covered the surface of the abyss because there was no light to illuminate it.

38
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,557
If there were light, it would certainly remain.

39
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,268
But how was it?

40
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,354
It is the thickened air lacking daily light.

41
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,776
And darkness was over the face of the deep.

42
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:29,840
The blindness of sins and the profound darkness of ignorance covered our hearts.

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,329
And the Spirit of God was moving over the waters.

44
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,459
The blessed Apostle says: "Surpassing," he says, "the knowledge of the love of Christ" (Ephesians 3).

45
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,320
And elsewhere he says: "And it surpasses all understanding" (Philippians 4).

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:48,330
This shows that something had begun, over which the Spirit of God was said to move—not in place, but by surpassing and excelling in power.

47
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,952
There are two reasons why God loves His creation: because it exists and because it remains.

48
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:56,153
That it is formed and remains under the command of the Creator.

49
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:06,769
The Spirit of God was moving over the waters so that what existed would remain; hence, He first mentioned unformed things and then the Holy Spirit, because all small love is placed beneath the things it loves.

50
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,634
And the Spirit of God was moving over the waters.

51
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:11,842
This refers to the Spirit of God the Father.

52
00:04:11,842 --> 00:05:34,536
About this Holy Spirit, the Apostle says: "Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him" Romans 8.
If there is no difference between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, why doesn't he say: "Whoever does not have the Spirit of the Spirit," or "As the Spirit of the Father says," or "Spirit of the Son"? Why not say "Father Spirit," or "Son Spirit"?
Because there's no relational way to express it, like saying "Servant of the Lord," or "Lord's servant," or "Son of the Father," and "Father of the Son." If he had said "Father Spirit," it would imply that God is the Father of the Spirit. Or if he had said "Son Spirit," it would suggest that the Holy Spirit is the Father of the Son, which is not the case. The Holy Spirit is neither Father nor Son but proceeds from the divine substance.
Therefore, he doesn't say that the Holy Spirit is born of the Father or the Son, because the Holy Spirit is not born like the Only Begotten, nor made like us to be called a son by the adoption of grace. How is the Holy Spirit said to be co-eternal with the Father and the Son? Because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son and is co-eternal.
He has always proceeded, but he has not always been given, as he can always be a gift without being given. The Holy Spirit has always proceeded and was prepared by the Father to be given. For there was no one to receive him, neither angels nor humans, except the creator of all things alone.
If the three are one—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit 1 John 5—why then is the Father not said to be sent by the Son or by the Holy Spirit? The order of paternal reverence is maintained.

53
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:39,683
But the Spirit of God was already hovering over our dark and fluid hearts, just like over the waters.

54
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:44,781
In this Spirit, we would find rest, be brought to life by its breath, and be cleansed by its waters.

55
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,680
On the Creation of Light

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,356
God also said: Let there be light. But is this light visible or invisible?

57
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:55,125
It is said to be invisible because it refers to the angelic creation, which our eyes cannot see.

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:59,944
The reason is that on the fourth day, God created the stars in the sky, which our eyes could see.

59
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,230
Is this angelic creation temporal or timeless?

60
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,714
It was temporal in the angels but timeless in God.

61
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:16,836
It was temporal in the sense that we understand it as being expressed by the eternal God through the co-eternal Word in the spiritual creation, which He had already made when it was said: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

62
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:26,921
But this speaking was not only without any sound but also without any physical movement,
the spiritual creation being somehow impressed upon His mind and reason through the co-eternal Word of the Father.

63
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:46,247
However, it is very difficult to comprehend how it is said that God did not command temporally, nor did the creation hear it temporally,
as He, in the contemplation of truth, surpasses all times,
but rather it was intellectually expressed to them as the co-eternal Wisdom of the Father, communicating to those below what was to be done in temporal things, whether to be formed or governed.

64
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,240
And there was light.

65
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,711
That is, the angelic creation, because they then came to know or understand their Creator.

66
00:06:51,711 --> 00:07:01,300
This is why it does not repeat: And God made the light, as it does with other creations, such as in the firmament where it says: Let there be a firmament, and again: And God made the firmament.

67
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,460
This is because it was not necessary to say: God made the light, since it was an intellectual creation, that is, the angels.

68
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:21,271
However, when it says Let there be a firmament or other things in other creations,
this is said in the knowledge of the angels,
because it is no wonder that God wished to show His holy angels, who had turned to Him at the first condition of light, what He would make thereafter.

69
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:24,650
When it says: And God made, it means in the proper nature of things.

70
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:31,660
There was no need to repeat this about the angels again because they had already, as we said, turned to recognize their Creator.

71
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:44,042
When that eternal and unchangeable Wisdom, which is not made but begotten, transfers itself into spiritual and rational creatures (like holy souls, so that being illuminated, they could shine), a certain brilliant affection of reason arises in them.

72
00:07:44,042 --> 00:08:55,100
This can be understood as the light being made when God said, "Let there be light."
There was already a spiritual creation, signified by the name "heaven," when it was written: "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." This refers not to the physical heaven, but to the incorporeal heaven, in which all the holy angels are understood. And God saw that the light was good.
Why did He praise the light only and not the night? It's because night and day were not yet made, only the angelic light.
It was unworthy for God to praise something unformed, which was not yet made, but He praised what was formed: the angelic light. And He separated the light from the darkness.
What is the separation of light from darkness, if not the distinction of the formed from the unformed? And He called the light day.
Why did He call the light day, since the day was not yet formed? The same day was named after the appearance of the created thing. And He called the darkness night.
Why did He similarly call the darkness night, which was not yet formed? Because this night, which we know, is the absence of the sun over the earth. When the sun sets, we call it evening; when the morning begins, we call it day.
But here, night is the absence of work, or night itself is called the potential within created things, from which they can be made, even if they are not yet changed. And again, this is according to the spiritual sense.

73
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,296
God also said: Let there be light. That is, let the illumination of faith appear.

74
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:03,898
On the first day, He gave the light of faith because faith is the first step in conversion.

75
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,983
Thus, the first commandment is: The Lord your God is one God.

76
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:10,978
Because of this faith, the Lord Himself chose to appear invisibly in the world.

77
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:20,233
Even then, God, through the grace of His presence, separated the righteous, the children of God and light, from sinners, as from darkness: calling the former day and the latter night.

78
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:23,318
In the Church, the righteous are called by the name of light.

79
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:28,122
Listen to the Apostle: You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord (Ephesians 5).

80
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,803
And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

81
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,786
What is evening, if not the completion of individual works?

82
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:36,264
And morning, the beginning of the following ones.

83
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,303
On the Second Day

84
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,279
God also said: Let there be a firmament.

85
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,416
This is because of the stability of the firmament or the separation between the higher and lower waters.

86
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:54,258
However, we believe that the nature of the waters there is not vaporous but solid and icy, to mitigate the heat of the stars and prevent them from scorching God's creations below.

87
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:57,468
But how can there be any waters where we would least expect them?

88
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:01,123
Because the authority of this Scripture surpasses any human understanding.

89
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,939
However, we must question the consistency of the heavens.

90
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,977
The Lord speaks of one firmament, but the Apostle testifies that he was caught up to the third heaven.

91
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:16,732
What can we conclude, except that tiny drops gather to form a collection, and due to their weight, the air cannot support them, causing them to fall as rain.

92
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:24,783
Therefore, we understand that the sky is between the waters above and the waters below, with the air between the moist vapors where clouds form and the seas below.

93
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:30,710
The second heaven, which we perceive with the spirit, is where that disc full of animals descended to Peter in a vision.

94
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:44,639
The third heaven, which we know with the mind, is so secret and remote, or entirely purified and removed from the senses of the flesh, that those in that heaven can see the very substance of God, the Word through which all things were made, ineffably in the love of the Holy Spirit.

95
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,171
And God said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

96
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:56,642
Therefore, the Spirit of God should be written as being present, as if someone asked Him how it was made, He would rightly respond.

97
00:10:56,642 --> 00:11:00,593
God said: Let there be, that is, what was in the eternal Word of God to be made.

98
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,668
Then He begins to narrate each thing made.

99
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:45,648
When we hear, "And so it was done," we understand that the created thing did not exceed the boundaries set by the Word of God.
However, when we hear, "God saw that it was good," we understand that it pleased Him in His gracious Spirit. It wasn't that it was unknown and only pleased Him after it was made. Rather, it pleased Him in such a way that it remained exactly where He intended it to be.
Regarding the shape of the heavens, it should be briefly stated that our authors knew the truth. However, the Spirit of God who spoke through them did not wish to reveal anything that wasn't useful for salvation.
Concerning the debate that often arises about the shape of the heavens—whether it is like an extended skin, a sphere, or a vault—we do not see anything that prevents an extended skin from being curved like a vault or extended into a round cavity like a sphere.

100
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:50,355
Then on the second day, God created the firmament, which means the foundation of the Holy Scriptures.

101
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:55,622
In the Church, the firmament is understood to be the divine Scriptures because heaven will be folded like a book.

102
00:11:55,622 --> 00:12:03,125
He separated the waters above this firmament, which represents the heavenly hosts of angels, who do not need the Scriptures to hear the Word of God as they read.

103
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,058
Matthew twenty-four.

104
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,782
For they always see Him and love Him.

105
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:15,942
But He placed this firmament of His law over the weakness of the lower people so that those who receive it spiritually may know how to distinguish between the earthly and the spiritual, like the waters above and below.

106
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,759
On the Third Day

107
00:12:17,759 --> 00:13:06,192
Then God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear." But why didn't He say, "Let the dry land be visible," or "Let the waters be gathered," unless it's because they are closer to the same formless state as the heavenly bodies, so that from these, in the numbering of days, the weaker things of the world are fashioned?
He did not want it to be understood that it was commanded to be done like the higher things, but rather He commanded that the gathered waters appear by themselves as the weaker things of the world.
So, where were the waters gathered if they first covered the entire earth?
They were gathered where they were drawn back, allowing the land to be exposed.
And if any part of the dry land appeared before, where could it have been gathered?
Thus, the abyss did not occupy the whole. It is better understood that either the water first occupied the land like a mist, or it surrounded the land, providing a hollow place for the waters to run to, so the dry land could appear.

108
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:10,391
After these events, on the third day, He gathered the salty lower waters into one place.

109
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:17,073
This refers to the unbelievers, who are tossed by the storms of desires and the waves of carnal temptations, and are filled with bitterness.

110
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:21,654
He separated the dry land from them, representing the source of faith for those who are thirsty.

111
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:30,197
He set boundaries for the proud and restrained them, preventing them from disturbing the dry land—that is, the soul thirsting for God—with the turbulent waves of their iniquities.

112
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:33,586
He allowed it to produce the fruit of good works according to its kind.

113
00:13:33,586 --> 00:13:44,658
You shall love your neighbor by supporting their physical needs, having within yourself the seed according to likeness, so that from your own weakness you may feel compassion to help those in need, producing wood with strong timber.

114
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:54,012
And fruit-bearing, that is, providing benefit to rescue the one who suffers injustice from the hand of the powerful, and offering the shelter of protection with the strong timber of just judgment.

115
00:13:54,012 --> 00:14:02,793
And God saw that it was good, and He said: Let the earth produce green plants, making seed, and fruit trees, making fruit according to their kind, whose seed is in itself on the earth.

116
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:03,462
And it was so.

117
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:10,620
The earth produced green plants and brought forth seed according to their kind, and trees making fruit, each having its seed according to its species.

118
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,391
And God saw that it was good, and it became evening and morning, the third day.

119
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:20,118
What does it mean that He commanded all these things to happen together, the earth to produce, and the waters to gather?

120
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:22,743
It means that all these things are rooted in the earth.

121
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:31,238
Therefore, they are said to belong to the same day because, although they spread far and wide through their growth, they are not moved from their own places by their connections.

122
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:41,355
Trees live, yet not through the soul, but through their greenness, as the sap is poured into the root, then becomes the quality of the tree, spreading through the branches, and finally in the greenness of leaves.

123
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:49,368
And the fruit-bearing tree, because not all trees produce fruit, each tree has its own purpose and usefulness, both in obvious and hidden ways.

124
00:14:49,368 --> 00:16:13,656
God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to divide the day from the night, and let them serve as signs for seasons, days, and years. Let them shine in the sky and give light to the earth." And it was so.
God made two great lights: the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night, along with the stars.
He placed them in the sky to shine on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness.
And God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was morning, marking the fourth day.
According to the Word of God and the begotten Wisdom, this was first made in the spiritual creation, that is, in the angels. Then the lights themselves were made to serve as signs and seasons.
It's clear that the mention of time beginning on the fourth day is somewhat obscure, as if the previous three days could have passed without time, even though they had the time of their creation. These three days did not have the distinction of stars.
The greater light governs the day because we know that the day cannot shine without the light of the sun. Similarly, the night, when the stars appear, cannot be illuminated as it is by the presence of the moon.
There is also the question of whether these principal lights of the sky have equal power but appear larger or smaller to our eyes due to different distances in the sky. Just as the sky was made first, it had to be adorned first.
The stars were made on the fourth day. By their shining, the lower habitation on earth is illuminated, ensuring that its inhabitants are not led into a dark dwelling.
Thus, with the movements that follow, the weak bodies of the lower parts are restored to rest. With the sun's circuit, the alternation of day and night occurs, allowing for the alternation of sleeping and waking.

125
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,466
But that night wasn't without beauty.

126
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:24,326
It was adorned by the light of the moon and stars, comforting those who travel and work at night out of necessity, and gently consoling the animals that cannot bear the sun's light.

127
00:16:24,326 --> 00:17:28,102
When it says, "God said, 'Let there be,'" we understand that Scripture refers back to the eternity of God's Word. It did not recreate anything that wasn't already created in the Word of God.
Therefore, God didn't say "Let there be this or that" as many times as it's written in this book. He begot one Word in which He said everything before each individual thing was made.
And let them be for signs and seasons: not according to heretics or philosophers who follow vain signs, but according to the truth of the signs. Signs and seasons pertain to the moon and the stars of the sky.
We must inquire whether the sky revolves in a circle or if the stars move around. It is understood that the stars move around, but the sky stands firm.
And there was evening and morning, the fourth day. Why did He name evening and morning but not mention the night? What else can we say night is, but the absence of light, which seemed to remain between evening and morning? Or because the first light signified the creation of angels, who, by contemplating their Creator with harmonious love, continuously praise the Creator forever without the blindness of ignorance?
However, they clearly understood at the beginning and end of the work what is called evening and morning. And again, according to the spiritual sense.

128
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,653
On the fourth day, lights appeared, fixed in the firmament of the law.

129
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:38,214
These lights symbolize the evangelists, teachers, and holy Scriptures, which collectively shed the light of wisdom on everyone below.

130
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:43,345
At the same time, numerous other shining stars emerged, representing the many virtues within the Church.

131
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:47,095
In the obscurity of this life, like the night, these virtues shine brightly.

132
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:55,432
They differentiate, within the firmament of Scripture, the sensible and the intelligible, as if separating the light of the perfect from the darkness of the little ones.

133
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:57,702
These stars are signs of virtues and miracles.

134
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,698
They also mark times and years because preachers live and pass in their own eras.

135
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:03,770
Yet, the word of the Lord remains forever.

136
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,667
But why did the earth first bring forth life, and then the lights were created?

137
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:13,883
This is because, after performing good deeds, there comes the illumination of light to contemplate the form of supreme virtue.

138
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,912
On the Fifth Day

139
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:23,220
On the Fifth Day, God said: Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.

140
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:31,862
God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind.

141
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:39,467
God saw that it was good, and He blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.

142
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,183
There was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.

143
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:46,232
Why, then, did He decorate the waters with creatures before the land with animals?

144
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:55,170
The reason was that water appeared visibly first, so it was adorned first, or because, in the beginning, the sky received its decoration, that is, the angels when they were created.

145
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,886
Similarly, the earth was adorned with plants and trees.

146
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,886
Thus, the waters received their adornment with creatures, and the air with birds.

147
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:08,355
Why is it that we often read about the creation of the sky, earth, and sea in the same way, but nothing is mentioned about the air?

148
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,664
It is not to be assumed that this element was omitted in Scripture.

149
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:16,256
Rather, it is customary for divine Scripture to refer to the whole world as heaven and earth.

150
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:19,960
Therefore, it is to be understood that the air belongs to heaven and earth.

151
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,182
Whatever is moist or vaporously expanded pertains to the earth, while whatever is calm and serene is said to belong to heaven.

152
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:35,861
It is evident that the air is similar to water, as it is proven to be enriched by its exhalations, creating the spirit of the storm—that is, wind and clouds—and it can support the flight of birds.

153
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:48,651
It does not say: Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let the air bring forth birds above the earth; but it says: Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth, because the air comes from water.

154
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,219
And whatever is wavy or fluid was given to the fish.

155
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,674
Anything that is moist or suspended like vapor clearly belongs to the air.

156
00:19:55,674 --> 00:20:02,299
Just as fish swim in water using their fins, birds of the sky seem to fly through the air with their wings as if they were in water.

157
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:09,727
Therefore, it is said that they fly under the firmament of heaven, not in the firmament, because there is a continuous space where birds cannot fly.

158
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:16,905
This air flows from the luminous boundary of the sky down to the fluid waters and the bare earth; however, not all of it pertains to the earth.

159
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:20,920
From where it begins upwards, there are fire, hail, snow, ice, and stormy winds.

160
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,484
Whatever is above, due to its tranquility, is said to belong to heaven.

161
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:32,364
Demons are said to dwell in the air, and for this reason, the air tolerates them, because they use an aerial form, and from there they attack the human race.

162
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,927
As soon as they were created, they were cast out from the sight of God.

163
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:41,950
Thus, the Savior speaks to his disciples in the Gospel, saying: "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven" (Luke 10).

164
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,410
How could he be said to fall if he had not stood?

165
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,170
He did not persevere in the company of the holy angels.

166
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,336
As soon as he saw himself in the glory of God, he became proud against his Creator.

167
00:20:51,336 --> 00:21:21,150
He said: "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, and I will be like the Most High."
Immediately, he was cast out from the height of heaven into the air with all his followers who did not remain in divine love, unlike those who are confirmed so that they cannot sin even if they want to. They initially had free will, just as the human race now seems to have.
However, they fell from their own free will and received God's judgment that, even if they want to, they cannot be restored. Again, the Lord said: "He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth" (John 8).

168
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,208
How was he a murderer from the beginning?

169
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:29,331
He strangled the first Adam in paradise when he persuaded him to eat the fruit, and from being immortal, he became mortal.

170
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,895
Afterwards, he strangled the human race until the coming of the Savior.

171
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,371
How did he not remain in the truth?

172
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:41,231
Because he did not deserve to receive what was promised to him—to remain forever with his Creator and the other angels.

173
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:47,781
Instead, he was cast down to the earth with his followers, where they undoubtedly suffer punishment under a fiery, starry atmosphere.

174
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:50,587
They are confined to a kind of prison until Judgment Day.

175
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:55,660
Then, they will be thrown into eternal fire, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (Luke 13:28).

176
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,811
The air is often stirred up and becomes very cold, causing snow.

177
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:02,849
Sometimes, it becomes more tightly bound, creating storms, lightning, and thunder.

178
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:07,380
It eventually pours down to the lowest point because the air cannot sustain these phenomena.

179
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,255
Nonetheless, all these occurrences happen through divine providence and the hidden judgment of God.

180
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:20,183
Some relate the four elements of the world to the five senses of the body: fire to the eyes, air to hearing, moisture to smell and taste, and touch to the earth.

181
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:26,043
They say that nothing can be seen without fire, nor touched without earth, and thus all elements are present in humans.

182
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,407
Each element is named after what it has more of.

183
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:35,990
Therefore, when the body becomes excessively cold due to the deprivation of heat, the senses dull because the movement of heat within the body cools down.

184
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,801
Fire affects air, air affects moisture, and moisture affects the earthly, with the more subtle penetrating the denser.

185
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:49,828
The more subtle something is in physical nature, the closer it is to spiritual nature, although they are far apart in kind, since one is body and the other is not.

186
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:58,495
Since sensing is not of the body but of the soul through the body, it can be argued that the senses of the body are distributed according to the diversity of physical elements.

187
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:04,060
The soul, which possesses the power of sensing, exercises this power through the more subtle aspects of the body.

188
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:10,173
So, it begins movement in all senses towards the subtlety of fire, but it does not pertain to the same in all.

189
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:29,925
In sight, it reaches up to its light with suppressed heat;
in hearing, the heat of fire penetrates up to the thinner air;
in smell, pure air passes through and reaches the moist exhalation, where this thicker aura remains;
in taste, it passes through this and reaches the denser moisture, and once this is penetrated and transferred, when it reaches the earthly gravity, it activates the last sense of touch.

190
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:35,880
However, it is to be inquired when the smallest fish, or animals, or worms, which Scripture does not mention, were created.

191
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:45,853
When we must inquire from the largest elephant to the smallest worm, how they were created, we must understand by reason where this smallest creature comes from, since Scripture does not indicate this here.

192
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:53,889
It must be understood that when God separated the waters from the waters, then the smallest animals, which are made from the waters, had their nature in those waters.

193
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:57,278
And those worms, which come from dead bodies, where do they come from?

194
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,006
It must be understood that in the bodies they have their vigor of being born.

195
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:11,802
If the water covered the earth, or the earth covered the water, it is that the water covered the earth, as if some part of the land slid over the water, the water immediately returned to its place when the land was removed.

196
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:17,660
But how does it say in another place: because he founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers (Psalm 24)?

197
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:26,084
If here the water covered the earth, it says this either about higher land where mountains appear to be; or it was said about islands where the land is higher than the water.

198
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:35,718
But this is more to be understood according to the sense that the simple ones in the Church are founded upon the prudent ones; and so, living waters are said to sustain those whom they see as weaker.

199
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:42,011
Because as much as there is between the moon and the stars of heaven, so much is there between holy rusticity and holy simplicity.

200
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:45,691
But as for fish, where are they created from, from water or from themselves?

201
00:24:46,272 --> 00:25:02,448
This should be understood because they are created from waters, as it says:
"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures."
And He blessed them, saying:
"Be fruitful and multiply."
Why did these animals deserve to receive a blessing like humans?
This is so we understand that this blessing remains in the other animals.

202
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:09,315
On the fifth day, living creatures were created in the waters, symbolizing humans renewed to life through the sacrament of baptism.

203
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:13,195
Birds were also created, representing holy souls ascending to the heavens.

204
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,832
On the Sixth Day

205
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:24,392
Regarding the sixth day, God also said:
Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creeping things, and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds.

206
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:28,874
Livestock, and every creeping thing of the earth according to its kind of living creature.

207
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:35,149
Simple animals are given for human use, while creeping things that crawl on the ground include snakes or other such creatures.

208
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,232
Wild animals of the earth include bears, lions, leopards, or other such creatures.

209
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:42,668
Wild animals are defined as anything that fights with teeth or claws.

210
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:47,847
It is necessary to consider whether these venomous creatures had venom in the beginning, as they do now.

211
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:51,582
It is to be understood that just as they were created then, so they remain.

212
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:57,956
But in the beginning, they did not have the power to harm, as we can see when a viper attacked Paul’s hand and did not harm him.

213
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,097
It had the power to attack but not to harm.

214
00:26:00,097 --> 00:26:05,823
Similarly with wild animals, when Daniel was thrown into the lion's den, they did not harm him but licked his feet.

215
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:17,127
Or perhaps these venomous animals were created to frighten humans because God foresaw them sinning, so they would understand the punishments of hell, as it says elsewhere: Their worms do not die, and their fire is not quenched.

216
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:17,725
(Isaiah 66).

217
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:23,252
Therefore, wild animals harm each other, since they do not have the original sin from which to exact vengeance.

218
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:39,984
As the blessed Augustine says, "animals are fellow citizens in their kind." When they see an animal of another kind, they immediately quarrel among themselves, because animals live and feel; trees, however, live but do not feel. But man lives, feels, and understands, because he has the discernment to distinguish between good and evil.

219
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,744
On the Creation of Humans

220
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:46,823
And God saw that it was good and said: Let us make man in our image and likeness.

221
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:51,405
To suggest the plurality of persons, he speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

222
00:26:51,405 --> 00:27:04,297
Immediately after, he adds: And God created man to show the unity of majesty, in his image, so that he would remain immortal, and in his likeness, so that he would have the intellect of the mind, unlike animals who cannot distinguish between good and evil.

223
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:12,355
He did not endow him with bodily features, but with the intellect of the mind, so that he could understand his Creator and praise him forever without mortality.

224
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:17,995
However, when he was in honor, he did not understand; he was compared to senseless animals and became like them.

225
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:18,448
Psalm 48.

226
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:26,103
For when he did not want to observe the commands of his Creator, he became mortal like an animal in body, but not in soul, because he remained immortal.

227
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:30,384
Why then does he not repeat: And he made man, as with the other creatures he created?

228
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:34,110
It was not necessary, because he was an intellectual creature like angels.

229
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,448
Because to him, to be made is to understand the Word of God the Father, through whom all things were made.

230
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:39,801
John 1.

231
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:44,232
Why does he not say according to the kind, while the propagation of man is most evident?

232
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:57,829
It was not needed, because Adam was created in such a way that he would remain immortal, and time would pass, and he would remain immortal; or because the human race was to come from him, not from different creatures, like the different kinds of animals, fish, or birds.

233
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:10,570
It was not so with man, as if there were different kinds of humans on earth; but from one man, the human race came, because man surpasses animals, as his mind is directed towards heaven, and he understands to seek his Creator in heaven, who created him.

234
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,211
And let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the beasts, and all creatures.

235
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:23,412
That is, so that he would understand himself to be made in the image of God, while he surpasses so many animals with the intellect of his mind.

236
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:25,765
And God created man in His image.

237
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:29,152
In the image of God, He created him; male and female, He created them.

238
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:37,235
What does it mean that He created the female with the male, when she was not yet formed and would come from Adam, just as many things are hidden in the seed of a tree?

239
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:41,929
First, it is fixed in the root, then it becomes the tree, and later it spreads out into branches.

240
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,188
It grows leaves and so on.

241
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:47,544
In the same way, the woman was hidden in Adam's body because she was made from Adam's rib.

242
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:51,851
And He blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.

243
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:57,126
Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every living thing that moves on the earth.

244
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,772
Why did man deserve this blessing?

245
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:03,127
So that having children would not seem like a fault, which some might have said was a sin.

246
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:08,306
The Lord blessed man to have children to show that there was no sin in it, as long as it was done lawfully.

247
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:13,001
If Adam was created to remain immortal, what does it mean when it says: Be fruitful and multiply?

248
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:23,938
This should be understood to mean they should have children not out of carnal desire or any evil will, nor painfully as they do now, but as one commands their body to do something, like moving a hand to work or a foot to walk.

249
00:29:23,938 --> 00:29:26,552
They should have had children in paradise in this way.

250
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:32,892
If they were to have children in such a way, why did they not come together to have children in paradise before they were cast out?

251
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:38,312
Because the woman, soon after being created, transgressed and was cast down from high immortality to the depths.

252
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:41,216
How did their bodies change if they were to remain immortal?

253
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:44,507
If they had not sinned, they would not have been able to die at all.

254
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:51,283
Their bodies, without mortality, after that number was fulfilled, would have been changed for the better, according to the number of angels.

255
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:56,752
And God said: See, I have given you every plant yielding seed and every tree with fruit, for you to have as food.

256
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:01,146
If Adam was immortal or mortal; and if mortal, how was he immortal?

257
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,117
And if physical, how was he spiritual?

258
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,799
And if spiritual, then why did he eat food just like the other animals?

259
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,363
He was both mortal and immortal because he could die; immortal because he could not die.

260
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:16,704
If he had not sinned, he would not have been able to die at all; but after he sinned, he became mortal.

261
00:30:16,704 --> 00:30:18,104
He was mortal and immortal.

262
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:26,609
He was mortal by his nature, immortal by the grace of God, which he received from the tree of life, from which he was cast out when he sinned, so that he could die.

263
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:30,551
If that voice was striking the air, or how should this speech be understood?

264
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:40,404
His speech, before any sound in the air, and before any flesh, and the voice of the cloud, in that highest Wisdom through which all things were made, did not sound like it did to human ears.

265
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:45,953
So why is it that we, reborn through Christ, do not receive the same immortality which Adam had before sin?

266
00:30:45,953 --> 00:30:53,888
We did not receive what we lost in Adam, that is, the physical body; but we receive something much better, as the spiritual is greater than the physical.

267
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:59,385
Hence the Apostle says: “It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body” (First Corinthians 15).

268
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:10,120
We did not receive the immortality of the spiritual body, but we received righteousness, which Adam lost through sin, of which the blessed Apostle says: “Be renewed in the spirit of your mind” (Ephesians 4).

269
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,416
How are we to be renewed?

270
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:23,292
That is, we will be renewed from the oldness of sin, not into the former physical body, in which Adam was, but into something better, that is, into a spiritual body, when we become equal to the angels of God in heavenly dwelling.

271
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:29,671
We will be renewed also in the spirit of our mind according to the image of him who created us, which Adam lost by sinning.

272
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:41,028
We will also be renewed in the flesh, when this corruptible puts on incorruption, and this mortal puts on immortality, so that the body becomes a spiritual body, in which Adam was not yet changed, but was to be changed.

273
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:46,422
Because we bear the image of the earthly man in the body, but the image of the heavenly man in the mind.

274
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:51,303
The Apostle says:
If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

275
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:56,342
As it is written:
The first man, Adam, became a living soul;
the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.

276
00:31:56,342 --> 00:32:00,342
But the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.

277
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:04,549
The first man was of the earth, earthly;
the second man is from heaven, heavenly.

278
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,302
As was the earthly man, so are those who are earthly.

279
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,744
Let us also bear the image of the heavenly man.

280
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:13,951
We have borne the image of the earthly man since the beginning of the human race.

281
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:19,613
Now, by faith, we carry the image of the heavenly man, which we believe will dwell in us in the resurrection.

282
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,574
And God saw everything He had made, and it was very good.

283
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,911
There was evening and morning, the sixth day.

284
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:28,132
If God created everything very good, where did evil come from?

285
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:30,729
Evil would not have existed if we had not made it.

286
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:34,729
It was not inherently part of nature, but the loss of good gave it this name.

287
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:38,573
Why did He not bless the trees or herbs, but did bless humans and animals?

288
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:49,325
He blessed these because of their ability to reproduce, or due to the male and female sexes, or because trees do not have the sense to feel or understand;
animals, however, live, feel, and do not understand.

289
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,092
Humans indeed feel and understand.

290
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:54,104
Therefore, He did not say to the trees: Grow and multiply.

291
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:56,520
On the Seventh Day

292
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,875
So the heavens and the earth, and all their array, were completed.

293
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,926
God finished His work on the seventh day, which He had made.

294
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:08,874
He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all His work, which He had created to make.

295
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:12,331
In doing so, He perfected the creation of the heavens and the earth.

296
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:16,094
The heavens with all their ornamentation, and the earth with all its work.

297
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,127
He finished His work on the seventh day.

298
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:22,703
On the sixth day, when He said: It is finished, and bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

299
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:26,923
On the seventh day, He rested in the tomb, fulfilling all things written about Him.

300
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:30,990
The Jews observed this day in shadow, as commanded to them by God through Moses.

301
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,736
But for us, this day signifies rest, because if we complete our works in good deeds, we rest with Christ forever.

302
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:43,243
The Sabbath means rest, because Christ is our rest, in whom we rest, as through His death, He transferred us from death to life.

303
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,480
He blessed the seventh day and made it holy.

304
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,633
Why did He bless the seventh day, on which He created nothing?

305
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:53,768
It was not because He was tired like a man who says: I thank my God, because I have finished my work.

306
00:33:53,768 --> 00:34:01,953
Rather, the Lord created a day on which He created nothing to show it was no labor for Him to create everything, because He only said Let it be, and it was done.

307
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:05,512
Therefore, He rested on the seventh day, so that we might rest in Him.

308
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:07,393
In what did He bless the seventh day?

309
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:12,935
In nothing, except by Himself, because He is blessed by no one but Himself; sanctified by no one but Himself.

310
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:20,053
Although He did not create everything, He was not diminished, because nothing mutable is perceived in God—in eternity, in truth, or in will.

311
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,290
All remains fixed and unchangeable with Him.

312
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,154
What is this day?

313
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:28,188
It is the first, it is the second, it is the last, because it is the repetition of the seventh day.

314
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:34,029
And these three days that came before He placed the stars in the sky, do they count as days or not?

315
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:43,334
It should be understood that they do count as days because there was no light before that our eyes could see, as the authority of this Scripture is greater than any capacity of human intellect.

316
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:52,109
Just as Christ is light in one sense and a stone in another—light properly, stone figuratively—so also there was one kind of angelic light and another kind of the light of the stars.

317
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:58,040
So why did He not bless the first day, in which He created the angelic light, or that day in which He completed everything?

318
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:11,443
He did not sanctify the day in which He began this work, nor the one in which He completed it, so that it would not seem that His action brought joy either in the making or in the completion of these things, but rather in the day in which He rested in Himself after these works.

319
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:19,206
Yet, He never lacked that rest, but showed it to us through the seventh day, signifying that we would not attain His rest until after the completion of our work.

320
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:38,202
And thus it is known that on this day evening did not follow, because our rest after the completion of our work will be endless joy, as He ceased from all His work, that is, the creation of the new and unknown world, which God created to make, since He governs it until the end of the world, from where He Himself said in the Gospel: "My Father is working until now, and I am working" (John 5).

321
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:41,818
Why did He not place morning on the first day, nor evening on the last day?

322
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:47,700
Morning was not placed because it has no beginning; and evening because it has no end, nor is it enclosed by any boundary.

323
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,774
And again according to the spiritual sense.

324
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,824
Recapitulation of the Six Days

325
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:55,855
On the sixth day, the earth brings forth living creatures.

326
00:35:55,855 --> 00:36:03,329
When our flesh abstains from dead works, it gives birth to living virtues, according to its kind—that is, by imitating the lives of the saints.

327
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,464
As the Apostle says: Be imitators of me First Corinthians 4.

328
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:12,057
We indeed live according to our kind when we imitate holy men in good deeds, as if they were our neighbors.

329
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:17,335
Then the earth produced beasts, representing men in the power of things, or in the ferocity of pride.

330
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:27,422
Similarly, it produced cattle, representing faithful men living in simplicity, and serpents, representing harmless holy men who, through the liveliness of their cunning, discern good from evil.

331
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:33,642
To the extent that it is lawful, they explore earthly things by crawling, through which they understand eternal things.

332
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:37,980
Not those poisonous ones who place themselves in the earthly desires of this world.

333
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:50,000
After this, God made man in His own image—a perfect man who, not by imitating any of the holy men, but by contemplating the very truth, acts justly, so that he understands and follows the very truth, in whose image he was created.

334
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:05,209
This man also received dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and the cattle, wild animals, and creeping things, because anyone who has become spiritual and made like God, according to the Apostle, judges all things, but he himself is judged by no one First Corinthians 15.

335
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:10,854
As for what follows: He made them male and female, He shows them to be spiritual and obedient in the Church.

336
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:23,763
For just as a woman is subject to a man, so is the less perfect person obedient to the spiritual and perfect man, as the Apostle says: We ask you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord First Thessalonians 5.

337
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:35,156
They are told: Be fruitful and multiply, whether in languages or in spiritual degrees of understanding, so that they may rule through the intellect of reason over all carnal disturbances, as if over irrational animals.

338
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:43,356
All plants that produce seeds and all fruit trees, which have been given to humans as food, are faithful, and they share their offerings with the saints.

339
00:37:43,356 --> 00:38:34,777
Hence, the Apostle says:
"For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they ought to also be of service to them in material things."
These are the fruitful trees.
In these stages, it's as if there are evenings where the perfection of each work is completed, and mornings where the next works begin.
In the seventh, after these works, which are like the six days of creation, man hopes for the rest of the mind, established in the spiritual paradise, signifying a blessed life.
Here, the fountain of wisdom is divided into four parts of virtue, where one can eat the grace of the tree of life, and pick useful teachings of morals, like the fruits of trees.
Paradise is indeed the life of the blessed; the four rivers are the four virtues; its trees are all useful teachings; the fruits of the trees are the morals of the pious; the tree of life is the wisdom from which all good things come, as written by Solomon:
"The tree of life is for those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed."
(Proverbs 3).

340
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:38,687
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the transgression of the command.

341
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:47,100
The works of the six days, as they are spiritually understood in the Church, have been explained so far, and now we must add what they signify in the figure of the world.

342
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,367
God completed all His works in six days and rested on the seventh.

343
00:38:50,367 --> 00:39:11,203
The six ages of humankind in this world, through the succession of times, suggest God's works:
the first is from Adam to Noah; the second, from Noah to Abraham; the third, from Abraham to David; the fourth, from David to the Babylonian exile; the fifth, from the Babylonian exile to the humble coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; the sixth, which is now ongoing, until the world ends, until the Most High comes for judgment.

344
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:17,439
The seventh is understood to be the rest of the saints, which indeed does not have an evening, because it is closed by no end.

345
00:39:17,736 --> 00:39:23,495
Let's briefly go through these ages of the world and highlight their mystical differences by recounting their timeline.

346
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,206
In the first age, there was light, with man in paradise.

347
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:33,321
During this era, God separated the children of light, known as the sons of God, from the children of men, much like separating light from darkness.

348
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:35,645
The evening of this day was marked by the flood.

349
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:40,582
The second age was like a firmament between the waters: the ark floated between the rain and the seas.

350
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:43,728
The evening of this age was marked by the confusion of languages.

351
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:49,875
In the third age, God separated His people from the nations through Abraham, distinguishing them like dry land from the waters.

352
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:56,071
This was to bring forth the sprouting of herbs and trees, symbolizing the spiritual saints and the fruit of the Holy Scriptures.

353
00:39:56,071 --> 00:40:00,088
The evening of this age was marked by the sin and wickedness of the evil king Saul.

354
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:04,203
The fourth age began with David, when God set lights in the firmament of the heavens.

355
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:12,044
This represented the splendor of the kingdom like the excellence of the sun, and the light of the synagogue like the light of the moon, with its leaders as stars.

356
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:17,271
The evening of this age was marked by the sins of the kings, which led to the people's captivity in Babylon.

357
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:26,081
In the fifth age, during the Babylonian exile, it was as if animals in the waters and birds in the sky were created, because the Jews began to live among the nations like in the sea.

358
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,210
They had no stable place, like flying birds.

359
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:36,681
The evening of this age was marked by the multiplication of sins among the Jewish people, to the point where they were so blinded that they couldn't even recognize their Lord.

360
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:40,118
Now, the sixth age is upon us with the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

361
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:49,169
Just as on the sixth day the first man Adam was formed from the dust of the earth in the image of God, so in this sixth age, the second Adam, that is, Christ, was born of the Virgin Mary.

362
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:52,577
He is a living soul, here in a life-giving spirit.

363
00:40:52,577 --> 00:40:56,790
Just as a living soul was made on that day, so now, those desiring eternal life.

364
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:05,638
Just as on the sixth day the earth brought forth kinds of serpents and beasts, so in this sixth age of the world, the Church has generated peoples seeking eternal life.

365
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:08,218
This meaning was also shown to Peter in a vision.

366
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:14,538
Just as on that day male and female were created, so in this sixth age of the world, Christ and the Church are revealed.

367
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:23,333
Just as man is set over the beasts, serpents, and birds of the sky on that day, so Christ is set over the peoples, nations, and tribes in this age, to be ruled by Him.

368
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:30,127
Whether they are given to carnal desires like beasts, obscured by earthly curiosity like serpents, or lifted by pride like birds.

369
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:44,189
Just as man and the animals with him are fed with seed-bearing plants, fruit-bearing trees, and green herbs on that day, so in this age the spiritual man, a good minister of Jesus Christ, is spiritually fed with the elements of the Holy Scriptures and the divine law.

370
00:41:44,189 --> 00:42:00,673
To conceive fruitful thoughts and words like seed-bearing plants, partly for the benefit of human conduct, like fruit-bearing trees, and partly for the strength of faith, hope, and charity into eternal life, like green herbs, which do not wither under the heat of tribulations but are nourished by spiritual food.

371
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:03,622
So he is fed with these foods to understand many things.

372
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:11,206
The carnal, that is, the immature in Christ, like God's flock, believe many things they cannot yet understand, but they all have the same foods.

373
00:42:11,206 --> 00:42:32,588
May the evening of this age not find us, for it is about this that the Lord says:
"When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
Luke 18:8.
After this evening, morning will come when the Lord Himself will come in glory.
Then those to whom it was said:
"Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect"
Matthew 5:48, will rest with Christ from all their works.
For such people do very good works.

374
00:42:33,168 --> 00:42:37,288
After such works, rest is to be expected on the seventh day, which has no evening.

375
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:49,347
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heavens and the earth, and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew.

376
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:54,674
We must investigate whether all these things were made in one day or over six days, as Scripture recounts.

377
00:42:54,674 --> 00:43:01,357
If they were made over six days, how does the Holy Scripture say: He who lives forever created all things at once, Ecclesiasticus 18?

378
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:05,125
Because He created all things at once according to the substance of things.

379
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,693
However, according to their form, He did not create all things at once.

380
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:14,924
Just as a mother nursing her infant waits for it to grow strong, so the Lord waited for the slowness of human understanding.

381
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:23,767
In the beginning, all things were created with Him, but they did not immediately appear in form when He said: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth Genesis 1.

382
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:31,455
Then all things, as we said, were made with Him—whatever arose from the heavens and the earth—although He wished to divide them into forms over six days.

383
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:39,495
As it says on the fourth day, He placed the stars in the sky, yet on the first day they were made in the sky with Him, which appeared in form on the fourth day.

384
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:49,444
Just as many things are hidden in a grain of seed—root, bark, leaves, fruit, and many other things that come from the tree—so all these things were first hidden with God, which later came into form.

385
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:55,122
Therefore, He made all things at once, as the Lord said: My Father is working until now, and I am working John 5.

386
00:43:55,122 --> 00:44:00,901
Although He created all things at once, He still governs daily, in watering, planting, building, and other matters.

387
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:07,986
Just as a man who works a field, if he leaves it, it remains uncultivated, so the world created by God cannot exist without God's governance.

388
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:14,920
According to the apostle Paul: Neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth First Corinthians 3.

389
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:19,985
There are also others who interpret these seven days as the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.

390
00:44:19,985 --> 00:44:27,940
These gifts are the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord.

391
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,966
(Isaiah 11)
It is said that through the spirit of wisdom, God made heaven and earth.

392
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:36,135
Through the spirit of understanding, He created the firmament and separated the waters.

393
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:41,215
With the spirit of counsel, He divided the waters from the dry land and made the earth produce vegetation.

394
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:45,577
Through the spirit of strength, He placed lights in the firmament to divide day from night.

395
00:44:45,577 --> 00:44:49,938
Using the spirit of knowledge, He adorned the waters with creatures and the air with birds.

396
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:53,820
Through the spirit of piety, He populated the earth with animals and created man.

397
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,373
Finally, through the spirit of the fear of the Lord, He sanctified His work on the seventh day.

398
00:44:58,373 --> 00:45:02,254
Thus, we too should embody these seven gifts of the Holy Spirit within ourselves.

399
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:11,121
Through the spirit of wisdom, we should meditate on heavenly things and forsake earthly ones, or separate light from darkness, meaning our perfect works from the darkness of the wicked.

400
00:45:11,121 --> 00:45:17,111
With the spirit of understanding, we should create a firmament between virtues and vices, ensuring we do not fall into vices.

401
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:22,431
Through the spirit of counsel, we should distinguish the reprobate people from the soul that knows God's words.

402
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:31,584
With the spirit of strength, we should place lights in the firmament, symbolizing the love of God and neighbor, for as Saint John said, "Whoever hates his brother is a murderer." (First John)

403
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:42,594
Through the spirit of knowledge, we must fill the waters with creatures that crawl, and from the depths of our hearts, send our voices to heaven, just as fish leap from the water and birds soar through the sky.

404
00:45:42,594 --> 00:45:45,859
Similarly, we should always elevate our thoughts to higher things.

405
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:52,635
Through the spirit of piety, we should act with simplicity and wisdom to distinguish good from evil and produce the fruits of good deeds.

406
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:57,729
By doing so, we follow the examples of the saints and the truth itself, in whose image we were created.

407
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:06,137
Through the spirit of the fear of the Lord, we should rest in the peace of eternal life, for it is written: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Psalm 110).

408
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:09,896
Why did He not place morning on the first day or evening on the seventh day?

409
00:46:09,896 --> 00:46:15,832
He did not place morning because He foresaw that man would sin in paradise, and the night of ignorance would follow him.

410
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:22,113
He did not place evening on the seventh day because He foresaw that man would return to grace through the coming of the Savior.

411
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:25,081
In the beginning, did night follow day, or day follow night?

412
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,021
Night followed day.

413
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:33,440
And now, after the coming of the Savior, day follows night, symbolizing that man fell when he transgressed, and night, representing sin, followed him.

414
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:43,431
But after the Savior's coming, day follows night because He restored us to grace and, through His death, transferred us from death to life, which we had lost through the fault of our first parent, Adam.

415
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:48,228
Night followed him because holy men were confined to the underworld until the coming of the Lord.

416
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:53,323
Now, day follows us because after His resurrection, all the saints who leave their bodies go to Christ.

417
00:46:53,323 --> 00:46:56,043
What we lost in Adam, we regained through Jesus Christ.

418
00:46:56,736 --> 00:47:03,175
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, on the day the Lord God made the heavens and the earth.

419
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:11,200
Previously, seven days were counted, but now it is called one day, on which God made the heavens and the earth, every shrub of the field, and every herb of the region.

420
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:21,196
By the name of this day, according to the prophet, the entire span of this life is signified, in which the heavens and the earth were made—that is, in which visible creatures are arranged, managed, and exist.

421
00:47:21,196 --> 00:47:32,057
But what does it mean that now, having named the heavens and the earth, he adds the shrub of the field and the herb of the region, while remaining silent about the rest that is in the heavens, on the earth, or even in the sea?

422
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:37,391
This is because, by the shrub of the field, he shows the invisible creature to be understood, such as the soul.

423
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:42,437
The shrub is mentioned because of the vigor of life; the herb, because of the same life, never withering.

424
00:47:42,437 --> 00:47:46,714
Then, what he added: Before it was on the earth, is understood as before the soul sinned.

425
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:51,712
For being defiled by earthly desires, it is rightly said to be born on the earth, or to be on the earth.

426
00:47:51,712 --> 00:48:06,754
For the Lord God had not rained on the earth, and there was no man to work the ground: therefore the earth had not sprouted, because the Lord had not rained on the earth; and there was no man to work the ground, because the earth sprouts and produces fruit especially because of the rain and the man who works it.

427
00:48:06,754 --> 00:48:17,086
Hence he also added: For the Lord God had not yet rained on the earth, as if it were openly said: Before the soul sinned, the Lord had not yet granted the rain of the doctrine of the Scriptures to irrigate the soul.

428
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:22,564
Not yet had our Lord assumed the cloud of our flesh, through which he poured the abundant rain of the holy Gospel.

429
00:48:22,564 --> 00:48:28,139
That he adds: And there was no man to work the ground, means no man worked in the Virgin, from whom Christ was born.

430
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:38,471
For he is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, that is, without intercourse and human seed from the virginal womb, as if cut out of the mountain of human nature and the substance of the flesh (Daniel 2).
