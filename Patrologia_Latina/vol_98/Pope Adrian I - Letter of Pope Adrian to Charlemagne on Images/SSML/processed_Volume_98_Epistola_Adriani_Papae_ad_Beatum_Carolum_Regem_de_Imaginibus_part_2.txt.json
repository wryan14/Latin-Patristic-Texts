Thus, he is called the mouth, as if by the name of mouth the Word is openly declared, just as we also usually call words the tongue, so that when we speak of the Greek or Latin tongue, we show Greek or Latin words. Therefore, we rightly understand the mouth of the Lord as the one through whom he speaks all things to us. Hence, the prophet says: For the mouth of the Lord has spoken this, etc. <break time=\"500ms\"/> Isaiah.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

XX), et flatu suo dabat Spiritum sanctum, et donato\nintelligentiae lumine, sanctarum Scripturarum occulta\npandebat, et reliqua. Item ex sermone ejusdem sancti Leonis praecipui\ndoctoris de Pentecoste, inter caetera: Omnes ergo,\ndilectissimi, qui in Dominum Jesum crediderant, infusum\nsibi habebant Spiritum sanctum, et remittendorum\npeccatorum etiam tunc apostoli acceperunt\npotestatem, cum post resurrectionem suam Dominus\ninsufflavit, et dixit: Accipite Spiritum sanctum;\nquorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur eis: et quorum\nretinueritis, retenta sunt, etc. (Joan. XX.) Unde et egregius praedicator atque mellifluus doctor\nsanctus Gregorius papa in sancti Evangelii homilia\n26, inter caetera inquit: Cum venerit Paracletus,\nquem ego mittam vobis a Patre (Joan. XV). Si\nenim mitti solummodo incarnari deberet intelligi,\n sanctus procul dubio Spiritus nullo modo diceretur\nmitti, qui nequaquam incarnatus est. Sed ejus missio\nipsa processio est, qua de Patre procedit et Filio. Sicut itaque Spiritus mitti dicitur, quia procedit, ita\net Filius non incongrue mitti dicitur, quia generatur. Hoc cum dixisset, et insufflavit, et dixit eis: Accipite\nSpiritum sanctum (Joan. XX). Quaerendum nobis est\nquid est quod Spiritum sanctum Dominus noster\net semel dedit in terra consistens, et semel coelo praesidens. Item ejusdem sancti Gregorii papae ex libro XXVII\nsuper Job, inter caetera: De quo Joannes dicit:\nOmnia per ipsum facta sunt (Joan. I). Ita etiam os\ndicitur, ac si oris nomine patenter diceretur Verbum,\nsicut nos quoque pro verbis linguam dicere solemus,\nut cum Graecam vel Latinam linguam dicimus, Latina\nvel Graeca verba monstremus. Os ergo Domini non\nimmerito ipsum accipimus, per quem nobis omnia\nloquitur. Hinc est enim quod propheta ait: Os enim\nDomini locutum est haec, etc. (Isa.",
