Responsio. Ex libro beati Augustini de filio Abraham\nducto ad sacrificium, inter caetera: Non enim\n frustra moti estis, cum hoc dicerem: Crux cornua\nhabet. Sic enim duo ligna compinguntur in se, ut\nspeciem crucis reddant. Sicut ergo in imagine crucis\nmultis locis videmus, ut fiant duo cornua, quibus\ninfigantur manus, cornibus haerentem arietem crucifixum\nDominum video, etc.",
