00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,759
Letter from Pope Adrian to Charlemagne Regarding Images: A Refutation of Those Who Oppose the Second Council of Nicaea

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:17,697
To the most excellent lord, our spiritual son and godfather, Charles, King of the Franks and Lombards, and Patrician of the Romans, I, Pope Adrian, write to you.

3
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:23,969
Our Lord and Redeemer, who is the author of His wise counsel, descended from heaven from the bosom of the Father.

4
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:34,960
It is clear to those familiar with the Gospel that the holy leader of all apostles, Peter, was entrusted with the keys of the kingdom of heaven and the care of the entire Church by the Lord's voice.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,070
To Peter, it was said: Do you love me?

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,847
Feed my sheep.

7
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:38,291
John 21.

8
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:49,115
It was also said to him: Behold, Satan has desired to sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail, and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.

9
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:49,559
Luke 22.

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,442
Furthermore, it is said to him: You are Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

11
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:06,546
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.

12
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:07,156
Matthew 16.

13
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:11,153
Thus, the care and leadership of the entire Church are entrusted to him.

14
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:17,148
It is recognized that he entrusted his role to his vicars, the bishops, to carry out the care of the Church.

15
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:22,754
For he received the keys of the heavenly kingdom, and the power to bind and loose was granted to him.

16
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:46,790
Therefore, we are confidently assured that if your royal excellence, appointed by God, remains faithful in love and devotion towards His holy Catholic and apostolic Roman Church and us, as you have begun, until the end, you will not only cleanse and save it from every stain of sin but also, with its help, achieve immense victories over all barbarian nations in this world, and furthermore, attain the kingdom of heaven without end.

17
00:01:47,568 --> 00:02:00,334
Moreover, we received a direct message from your most gracious and noble royal authority, through your loyal associate, Engilbert, the abbot and minister of the chapel, who was raised in your palace from childhood and included in all your councils.

18
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:05,276
Therefore, just as he is familiar to you, he should be received and honored by us appropriately.

19
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:16,292
Out of the great love we have for your esteemed royal excellence, since you sent him with immense affection and exceptional warmth, we welcomed him as he wished and in the manner he desired, with great familiarity.

20
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:28,492
We listened to him with a calm ear and an open mind, as if you yourself were speaking to us, and we entrusted him with our advice patiently for the benefit of our holy Roman Church and the exaltation of your royal power protected by God.

21
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:34,978
Among these matters, he presented us with a document against the synod held in Nicaea regarding the erection of sacred images.

22
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:45,634
Because of your sincere royal affection, we provided a response to each chapter: not defending any individual, God forbid, but upholding the ancient tradition of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.

23
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:51,915
We follow the ancient teachings of our holy pontifical predecessors, vindicating the tradition of true faith in every way.

24
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:55,440
In the third action.

25
00:02:55,440 --> 00:05:01,608
In the first chapter, it was mentioned about the phrase: "And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father through the Son."
Criticism.
Tarasius is criticized for not properly believing that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, according to the Nicene Creed's faith.
Instead, he professes in his reading that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son.
Response.
Tarasius did not explain this doctrine by himself but confessed it through the teachings of the holy Fathers, whose writings we briefly share out of great respect for your most exalted and divinely protected royal excellence.
Namely, Saint Athanasius on the appearance of the Lord in the flesh, in the sermon on the human nature assumed by the only-begotten Word, among other things.
And for this reason, he breathed on the apostles' faces, saying: "Receive the Holy Spirit" as noted in the Gospel of John, chapter twenty.
This was to show that the Spirit given to the disciples comes from the fullness of divinity.
For in Christ, he says, dwells, that is, in his flesh, the entire fullness of divinity bodily, as noted in the letter to the Colossians, chapter two.
As the evangelist John also says: "We have all received from his fullness," as mentioned in John, chapter one.
In bodily form, indeed, the Holy Spirit appeared like a dove, descending and remaining upon him, as described in the Gospel of Luke, chapter three.
For in us, the first fruits and pledge of divinity dwell, but in Christ, the entire fullness of divinity.
And lest anyone thinks that he was receiving as if he did not have it: for he himself sent it to himself from above, as God, and he received it for himself from below, as a man.
Therefore, it descended from him into him, from his divinity into his humanity.
And after much more: It is clear that the Father did everything through him, through him he raises him, through him he sanctifies him, and through him he exalts him, and through him he gives life.
Also, from the same Saint Athanasius on Virginity, among other things: And in the Holy Spirit, who exists in the Father and the Son, who is sent by the Father and given through the Son.
Also from the Ecclesiastical History, book.

26
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:08,043
Eusebius of Caesarea, after much contemplation: speaks on the faith of Gregory, martyr and bishop of Neocaesarea.

27
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:17,611
He describes one God, the Father of the living Word, wisdom that exists, and His power and image—the perfect parent of the perfect, the Father of the only-begotten Son.

28
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,597
One Lord, the only one from the only God, the form and image of deity.

29
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:27,862
The Word that accomplishes all, wisdom that comprehends all, and the power through which all creation is made.

30
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:36,575
The true Son from the true, invisible from the invisible, incorruptible from the incorruptible, immortal from the immortal, and eternal from the eternal.

31
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:42,384
One Holy Spirit, having substance from God, who appears through the Son, the image of the perfect Son.

32
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:49,674
The perfect cause of the living, the provider of the holiness of sanctification, through whom God is known above all and in all.

33
00:05:49,674 --> 00:06:03,741
And not only does this historian mention the faith of Saint Gregory, but also the great preacher Saint Gregory of Nyssa, who in a Greek sermon, wonderfully and splendidly explained how and by whom it was arranged, shown, and seen to Saint Gregory.

34
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:18,092
Likewise, Saint Hilary in Book Eight on Faith, also known as Book Eight on the Trinity, states: Since the Holy Spirit, who is also the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God, is shown to be of one nature, I therefore ask how they are not one by nature?

35
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:25,211
The Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, is sent by the Son, and receives from the Son all that the Father and Son have.

36
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:30,735
Therefore, who receives from Him is the Spirit of God, but the same is also the Spirit of Christ.

37
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:39,619
And further: For the Spirit of God is in us, but also the Spirit of Christ is in us, and when the Spirit of Christ is present, the Spirit of God is present.

38
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:46,169
Thus, since what is God's is Christ's, and what is Christ's is God's, Christ cannot be anything different from God.

39
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,864
Therefore, Christ is God, Christ is one with God, as the gospel says: I and the Father are one, etc.

40
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,857
from the Book of John, Chapter Ten.

41
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:58,185
Likewise, from the letter of Saint Basil to Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

42
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:09,099
Regarding the Holy Spirit to Amphilochius, among other insights:
The Holy Spirit is united with the Father through the Son, completing the most praiseworthy and blessed Trinity.

43
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:15,066
Shortly after, it's stated: There is one knowledge of God, from one Spirit through one Son in one Father.

44
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:21,886
Again, natural goodness, sanctification, and royal dignity flow from the Father through the Only Begotten in the Spirit.

45
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:28,819
Similarly, Saint Ambrose in Book One, Chapter Three on the Holy Spirit, shares:
You will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

46
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:33,763
Soon after, he emphasizes: The unity of operation and proclamation cannot be separated.

47
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:54,166
If the Spirit is separated from the operation of the Father and the Son here, because it is said, "All things are from God," and, "All things are through the Son," then it would be incorrect, as the Apostle said of Christ, "Who is over all, God blessed forever" (Romans 9), to prefer the Father, which is blasphemous to suggest; but that's far from the truth.

48
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,087
The Father is not among all things or among a group of His creatures.

49
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:02,634
Above all creatures is the divinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

50
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:08,317
The creatures serve, while the divinity reigns; the creatures are subject, while the divinity rules.

51
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:22,468
In the same way, Saint Gregory the Theologian in his Oration on the Holy Lights mentions:
For us, there is one God the Father, from whom are all things, one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and one Holy Spirit, in whom are all things.

52
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:49,519
By saying "From whom," "Through whom," and "In whom," we do not divide the nature, as the prepositions do not alter the truth of the nature but indicate the property of each name of one nature.
This is clearly shown by the fact that this diversity is united into one; this is evident when one reads without overlooking what the Apostle himself wrote: "Because from Him, through Him, and in Him are all things" (Romans 11), and he concluded: "To Him be glory forever and ever."

53
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:54,177
Here is a passage from Saint Augustine's sermon on the Ascension of the Lord.

54
00:08:54,177 --> 00:09:01,027
Among many things, he said:
The Holy Spirit was given on earth, visible and close to those nearby, by breathing onto their faces.

55
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:04,585
From this great love in heaven, He sent the Holy Spirit from above.

56
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:12,232
Receive the Holy Spirit on earth and love your brother; receive it from heaven and love God, for what you received on earth is also from heaven.

57
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,099
Christ gave it on earth, but the giver is from heaven.

58
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,755
For He gave it, the one who descended from heaven.

59
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:28,747
From the same Saint Augustine on Pentecost, among other things:
Let the foolish stop flattering and asking us: What will we receive when we come to you, since you admit we already have the baptism of Christ?

60
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:34,004
Let us answer them: You have the baptism of Christ, come so you may also have the Spirit of Christ.

61
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:40,218
Fear what is written: But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him (Romans chapter 8).

62
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:44,678
You put on Christ in the form of the sacrament, put Him on by imitating the example.

63
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:58,432
And from the same Saint Augustine in Book 4, Chapter 10, of On the Trinity, among other things:
We cannot say that the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son; for it is not without reason that the same Spirit is called the Spirit of the Father and the Son.

64
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:04,380
Nor do I see what else He meant to signify when He breathed and said: Receive the Holy Spirit (John chapter 20).

65
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:16,222
That breath, proceeding from the body with a physical sense of touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit but a demonstration, indicating that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father but also from the Son.

66
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:22,276
For who would be so insane as to say there was one Spirit given by breathing and another sent after His ascension?

67
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:30,401
There is one Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit who works all things in all (First Corinthians chapter 12).

68
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:41,659
Also, from the same Saint Augustine in Book 15, Chapter 26, of On the Trinity, among other things:
It is taught that He proceeds from both, for the Son Himself said: He proceeds from the Father (John chapter 15).

69
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:52,373
After he rose from the dead and appeared to his disciples, he breathed on them, saying,
"Receive the Holy Spirit."
(John 20)
This gesture showed that the Spirit comes from him as well.

70
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:56,900
As the Gospel tells us, it was the power that emanated from him and healed everyone.

71
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:06,009
(Luke 6)
Shortly after:
This signifies that the Lord Jesus gave the Holy Spirit twice: once on earth for the love of neighbor, and again from heaven for the love of God.

72
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:26,652
According to the teachings of Saint Cyril, Ninth Anathema, among other things:
If anyone claims that the Lord Jesus Christ was glorified by the Holy Spirit as if by an external power, which worked through him against unclean spirits and performed divine signs, and does not acknowledge that it is truly his own Spirit through which he performed these signs, let him be anathema, etc.

73
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:33,173
From the same Saint Cyril to John of Antioch, among other things:
Do not move the eternal boundaries set by your fathers.

74
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:42,120
(Deuteronomy 16)
For they were not speaking by themselves, but by the Spirit of God and the Father, who proceeds from him yet is not separate from the Son in essence.

75
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,109
The words of the saints who passed down the mysteries confirm this for us.

76
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:53,601
It is written in the Acts of the Apostles:
Coming around Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.

77
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:58,290
(Acts 16)
The venerable Paul also writes:
Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.

78
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,194
But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.

79
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:07,345
If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to him, etc.

80
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:20,496
(Romans 8)
From Saint Cyril on the worship of the Spirit, from the first book, among other things:
Just as it is of God, and the Father, and also of the Son substantially, proceeding from both, namely from the Father through the Son, and so on.

81
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:32,569
From the same Saint Cyril from the acclamatory book to Emperor Theodosius, among other things:
Therefore, even if it is said that wherever the Father gives life, he does this entirely through the Son by the Holy Spirit, etc.

82
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:46,535
From the encyclical letter of Saint Leo the Pope to Flavian, Archbishop of Constantinople (Letter 12), among other things:
He entered through closed doors to the disciples John 20, and with his breath, he gave the Holy Spirit.

83
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:52,133
By granting the light of understanding, he revealed the hidden meanings of the Holy Scriptures.

84
00:12:52,133 --> 00:13:01,976
Also, from the sermon of the same Saint Leo, a prominent doctor, on Pentecost:
All, beloved ones, who believed in the Lord Jesus, had the Holy Spirit poured into them.

85
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:15,766
The apostles received the power of forgiving sins when, after his resurrection, the Lord breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins you retain, they are retained, etc.

86
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,238
John 20.

87
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:29,262
Therefore, the distinguished preacher and eloquent teacher, Saint Gregory the Pope, in his homily 26 on the Holy Gospel, among other things, says:
When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father John 15.

88
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:37,100
If being sent should only be understood as being incarnated, the Holy Spirit would not be said to be sent, for he was not incarnated.

89
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,640
But his being sent is the procession itself, by which he proceeds from the Father and the Son.

90
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:50,302
Just as the Spirit is said to be sent because he proceeds, so the Son is not incongruously said to be sent because he is begotten.

91
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:55,311
When he had said this, he breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit John 20.

92
00:13:55,311 --> 00:14:01,794
We must ask why our Lord gave the Holy Spirit once while standing on earth and once while presiding in heaven.

93
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:10,281
Also, from the same Saint Gregory the Pope's book 27 on Job, among other things:
About which John says: All things were made through him John 1.

94
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:22,893
Thus, he is called the mouth, as if by the name of mouth the Word is openly declared, just as we also usually call words the tongue, so that when we speak of the Greek or Latin tongue, we show Greek or Latin words.

95
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:29,140
Therefore, we rightly understand the mouth of the Lord as the one through whom he speaks all things to us.

96
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,383
Hence, the prophet says: For the mouth of the Lord has spoken this, etc.

97
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:33,795
Isaiah.

98
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,950
The holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, receiving the order of masses, solemnities, and prayers from Saint Gregory the Pope himself, has given us many prayers.

99
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:49,920
It teaches us to humbly ask for the Holy Spirit to be poured into us, enlightening and strengthening us through our Lord Jesus Christ.

100
00:14:49,920 --> 00:15:03,495
Among the many teachings of Saint Sophronius, whose orthodox doctrines are honored in the Holy Sixth Council:
The Father has done all things through the only-begotten Son in the Holy Spirit, maintaining them with wise providence, as God presides over His works.

101
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,168
IN THE SAME ACTION. CHAPTER 2 - Critique.

102
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:14,367
There is a question about whether Theodore, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, is correct in his belief.

103
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:25,032
He stated that he believes the Father is completely without beginning and eternal, and, using some obscure phrase, claimed that the Son knows no other origin than the Father and has His being from Him.

104
00:15:25,032 --> 00:15:25,510
Response.

105
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:37,713
Theodore, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, along with other major patriarchs, specifically Cosmas of Alexandria and another Theodore of Antioch, sent a letter of their true faith to our predecessor of holy memory, the former Pope Paul.

106
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:54,692
In this letter, they included a detailed explanation about the most sacred images, showing how they, along with our holy Catholic and apostolic universal Roman Church, and the other Eastern Orthodox bishops and Christian people, are fervent in faith with sincere affection of mind in the veneration of these holy images.

107
00:15:54,692 --> 00:16:06,259
Our predecessor, the former most holy Lord Pope Stephen, received and read this letter translated into Latin at his council, which he held with various bishops in parts of France and Italy concerning the sacred images.

108
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:39,952
They were pleased with both the testimonies of various French Fathers and the creed of faith where it was made, stating:
If anyone holds a different term of faith, creed, or doctrine from what was handed down by the six holy great and universal synods and confirmed by the holy Fathers who attended them, and does not worship the image or figure of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor confess His incarnation, as He descended and was incarnate for the sake of humanity, we anathematize such an impious person and consider them foreign and estranged from the holy Catholic and apostolic Church; and other things which are too lengthy to recount.

109
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:50,988
Therefore, the aforementioned Archbishop Theodore professed in this way, following the doctrine of the holy Fathers, namely Saint Hilary of Poitiers from Book One against the Arian heresy, among other things.

110
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,322
Indeed, it's clear that he was born to show that he has always existed.

111
00:16:55,322 --> 00:17:00,457
In him, there's not an exception to being unbegotten, but rather, an eternity of being born.

112
00:17:00,457 --> 00:17:03,639
Birth has a source, and divinity is not without eternity.

113
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,885
Similarly, from Saint Hilary in Book Eleven on Faith: It's well understood and believed by us.

114
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:13,406
We confess through words that he was born, yet we don't proclaim he was not born.

115
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:19,434
Being unbegotten is not the same as being born; the former is from another, while the latter is from no one.

116
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:25,630
It's one thing to be eternal without a source, and another to be co-eternal with the Father, who is the source.

117
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,532
Where the Father is the source, there is also birth.

118
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:32,383
And where the source is eternal, there is also the eternity of birth.

119
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:36,849
Just as birth is from the source, so from an eternal source comes eternal birth.

120
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:49,184
Similarly, from Saint Gregory, known as the Theologian, in his sermon on Epiphany, also called the Oration on the Holy Lights: The Father is the Father without beginning, as there is nothing else from which the Father is.

121
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:53,258
The Son is the Son, but not without beginning, for he is from the Father.

122
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:57,556
If you consider the beginning in terms of time, he is also without beginning.

123
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:01,240
He is the creator of time and does not take his beginning from it.

124
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,216
The Holy Spirit is truly the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father, but he is not the Son: he is not begotten but proceeds.

125
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:30,821
Similarly, from the same Saint Gregory the Theologian in the sermon on the Birth of the Lord: This is the Word of God himself, who is before the ages, invisible, incomprehensible, and incorporeal; who is the beginning from the beginning, light from light, the source of life and immortality, the true and express image of the substance of God, the seal of truth, the image of the invisible God the Father.

126
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:44,105
Similarly, from the same Saint Gregory the Theologian in the second Peaceful Sermon, Oration Two on Peace: I introduce the beginning of deity without time, indivisibly, and immensely, honoring the beginning and what is from the beginning.

127
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:48,515
Similarly, from the same Saint Gregory the Theologian in the Apologetic Sermon.

128
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:53,939
When discussing doctrines and constitutions, particularly in the middle, etc.

129
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,891
Whose Son would he be if his origin isn't traced back to the Father?

130
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:01,901
Thus, the one who begets exists, and the one begotten comes from him.

131
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:07,423
The origin of the Father is not insignificant or unworthy, but rather of divinity and goodness.

132
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:17,652
The Father is recognized as the origin in the Son and the Holy Spirit, and is perceived in him, whether as in the Son as the Word, or as in the Spirit proceeding from him, etc.

133
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:22,302
Similarly, Saint Augustine on Genesis literally, from the first book below, etc.

134
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:40,610
When Scripture states: In the beginning, God created heaven and earth (Genesis 1:1), we understand the name of God, also referring to the Son in the name of the beginning, who is the beginning of all creation, not for the Father, but by himself, especially for spiritual creation, and consequently for all creation.

135
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:48,805
When Scripture says: And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters (Genesis 1:2), we recognize the complete mention of the Trinity, etc.

136
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:59,732
Similarly, from the same Saint Augustine from book thirty-eight on the Gospel of John, among other things:
The Son is the Son of the Father, and indeed the Father is the Father of the Son.

137
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,626
The Son is called God from God; the Son is called light from light.

138
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:08,915
The Father is called light, but not from light; the Father is called God, but not from God.

139
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:18,621
If, therefore, God from God, light from light is the beginning, how much easier is it to understand the beginning as the light from which light, and God from whom God?

140
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:24,549
Isn't it absurd, my beloved, to say the Son is the beginning, and not say the Father is the beginning?

141
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,572
But what shall we do, shall there be two beginnings?

142
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,606
We must be careful not to say this.

143
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:35,244
So, if the Father is the beginning and the Son is the beginning, how are they not two beginnings?

144
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:39,893
How do we say the Father is God, the Son is God, and yet we do not say two gods?

145
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,753
It is incorrect to say two gods.

146
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:43,904
It is indeed wrong to say three gods.

147
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:56,109
And further: In what is said about the Spirit of the Father and the Son, there is nothing to say three; unless the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are one God, one Almighty: therefore, one beginning, etc.

148
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:58,957
Similarly, from the same from book six (chapter).

149
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:06,377
When discussing the Holy Trinity, we often consider questions like:
How is God from God, light from light?

150
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:11,808
It's not that both together are God from God; only the Son is from God, that is, the Father.

151
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:17,830
Similarly, not both together are light from light; only the Son is light from the light of the Father.

152
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:26,095
Now, let's look at the synodical letter of Saint Sophronius, Archbishop of Jerusalem, which was presented at the holy Sixth Council, Act 11.

153
00:21:26,095 --> 00:21:38,079
It states, among other things:
So, I believe, dear ones, as I have always believed, in one God, the Father Almighty, who is without beginning and eternal, the creator of all things visible and invisible.

154
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:56,674
I also believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, who was eternally and without suffering born from God and the Father, acknowledging no other beginning than the Father;
and He has no existence apart from the Father himself: light from light, consubstantial, true God from true God, co-eternal.

155
00:21:56,674 --> 00:22:03,581
And I believe in one Holy Spirit, who eternally proceeds from God the Father, recognized as light and as God himself.

156
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:09,311
IN THE SIXTH SESSION. CHAPTER 3 Critique

157
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:14,652
Tarasius made a mistake when he said that the Holy Spirit is a companion to the Father and the Son.

158
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:19,668
It would have sufficed to say co-eternal, consubstantial, and of the same essence and nature.

159
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:25,493
Response from Saint Sophronius himself:
Since he has sworn falsely, he should have sworn regarding the liar.

160
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:29,593
Among the choices of evils, it was better to choose the more beneficial one.

161
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:39,734
Also, from Saint Augustine in the preface to Psalm 31, among other things:
We should propose no works before faith, meaning no one should claim to have done good works before having faith.

162
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:44,804
For those works, said to be before faith, even if they seem praiseworthy to people, are empty.

163
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:48,796
To me, they seem like great strength and a very swift course off the path.

164
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:52,086
Therefore, no one should count their good works before faith.

165

In the Fourth Action
Chapter Fifteen Critique

166
00:22:57,263 --> 00:23:02,741
This wasn't written for those who reject the worship of images, as those who do worship them claim.

167
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:09,270
As it says in the Psalm:
"How the enemy has acted maliciously against your holy ones?"
(Psalm Seventy-Three)
Response.

168
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,870
These words were truly spoken against heretics.

169
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:59,066
The blessed Augustine explains in his commentary on the same Psalm:
"How maliciously the enemy has acted against your holy ones, in those things that were your holy things, meaning the temple, the priesthood, and all those sacraments that existed at that time,"
etc.
Similarly, even today, the enemy's greater evils have been nullified against the sacred Catholic and Apostolic Church, which maliciously opposes the ancient and orthodox tradition of sacred images.
Furthermore, Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, also known as the Theologian, in his sermon about the philosopher Iron (Oration in Praise of Iron, around the middle), says among other things:
"How could they not boast?
How indeed did they not defile the holy temple with various intrusions?
And in all evils, an impious and unjust man prevailed, not even carrying the name of Christianity,"
etc.

In the Fifth Action
Chapter 15 Critique

171
00:24:04,296 --> 00:24:22,556
The letter, reportedly from Saint Simeon Stylites to Emperor Justinian, is said to differ significantly from the divine Scriptures and the teachings of the holy Fathers, because it addresses the emperor directly:
For whom we mention and convey to your divine ears;
or because it's claimed that the emperor prohibited the use of mercy.

172
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,650
Here's the response.

173
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,664
When Saint Ambrose wrote to Emperor Gratian about the orthodox faith, did he err by calling him, Holy Emperor?

174
00:24:29,664 --> 00:24:36,936
What was out of line in addressing the most Christian Emperor Justinian, expressing thoughts to his divine ears for his faith's zeal?

175
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:44,973
When referring to divine ears, it means he listens to divine words and observes them faithfully and orthodoxly, thus rightly having divine hearing.

176
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:55,962
The prohibition of mercy is misunderstood; instead, it was a plea for swift and decent retribution, not lacking mercy, but showing great love towards the images of the saints by condemning the impious.

177
00:24:55,962 --> 00:25:07,444
Your God-inspired excellence surely acknowledges Saint Gregory's account in his Dialogues about the blessed Boniface, who sorrowfully struck down a wretch who, with a monkey, made cymbal sounds with his speech.

178
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:16,683
Shortly after, Saint Gregory (Book One, chapter nine) states:
The wrath of the just is fearsome because He who dwells in their hearts can enact the vengeance He desires.

179
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:31,008
Similarly, in explaining blessed Job (Book 34, chapter 10), Saint Gregory discusses the strong preachers of the holy Church, adding:
The Lord tells the prophet about good teachers: They will devour and subject to the stones of the sling (Zechariah chapter nine).

180
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:37,787
Indeed, the holy teachers, who guide others in virtue, conquer enemies by transforming them through the power of conversion.

181
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,245
Strong men emerge from that Church, striking fear into the hearts of the wicked as if hit by stone blows.

182
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:54,927
This is why even the mightiest Goliath falls to a stone from a sling, as told in First Samuel Chapter Seventeen, because diabolical pride is defeated by the cornerstone of the holy Church.

Chapter 17 Critique.

184
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:12,085
It is said that all heretics are worse than Samaritans, and those who destroy images are even worse than Samaritans, despite their ancestors being considered worse than all heretics because they destroyed images as well.

185
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:21,792
Response: In this context, the eloquent teacher, blessed Gregory the Theologian, in a sermon about the Birth of the Lord, says:
You are offended by the flesh; so were the Jews.

186
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:28,851
If you also call him a Samaritan, and to leave other things unsaid, you do not believe in the deity; even demons do not do this.

187
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:32,822
O, you are more unfaithful than the Jews and worse than the demons, etc.

188
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:40,875
Also from the edict of Emperor Justinian, it is noted:
But neither Theodore of Mopsuestia, who surpassed both Jews and Greeks in his impiety, etc.

189
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:52,457
Furthermore, the holy Pope Gregory, in his explanation of blessed Job from book 14, states:
Just as eating too much honey is not good for you, so the one who is a scrutinizer of majesty is overwhelmed by glory.

190
00:26:52,457 --> 00:27:00,895
(Proverbs 25)
And below: The glory of the invisible creator, when sought moderately, lifts us up, but when examined beyond our strength, it oppresses us.

191
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:06,741
Hence, the more heretics seek to fill themselves with lofty understanding, the more they empty themselves.

192
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:13,249
For those who crave the knowledge of the supreme with unrestrained ears, the more they seek it, the more they lose it.

193
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:27,424
In contrast, those who are truly humble and well-educated in the holy Church know how to grasp some heavenly secrets and revere those they do not understand:
So that they hold reverently what they understand and await humbly what they do not yet understand.

194
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:37,517
This bold presumption is well restrained by the excellent preacher, who advises:
Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.

195
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:45,569
(Romans 12)
Therefore, their predecessors, by exalting themselves and trying to impose novelty, became worse heretics and were reduced to nothing.

197
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:56,195
There is no Gospel passage that describes Jesus sending an image to Abgar, contrary to some claims.

198
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:56,679
Response.

199
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:09,136
Our predecessor, the revered Pope Stephen, presiding over the council mentioned earlier, shared many true testimonies, teaching as follows:
We should not ignore what we have often heard from trustworthy reports coming from the East.

200
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:20,627
Even though the Gospel does not speak of these events, the strength of faith is not entirely unbelievable, with the evangelist himself stating:
John did many other signs as well, which are not written in this book.

201
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:21,164
(John 20).

202
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:33,084
Indeed, it is reported by some, as Eusebius documents in Book One, Chapter Thirteen, that as the time of his passion drew near, the Redeemer of mankind responded to a certain king of Edessa who wished to see him in person.

203
00:28:33,084 --> 00:28:48,602
The king invited Jesus to escape Jewish persecution and share the miracles and healings he had heard about:
If you wish to see my face physically, here is an image of my face imprinted on a cloth, which can satisfy your desire and show that what you have heard about me is indeed possible.

204
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:57,998
However, after I fulfill what is written about me, I will send you one of my disciples, who will bring health to you and your people and guide you to the height of faith, etc.

205
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:20,282
Additionally, from the synodical letter of the three patriarchs—Cosmas of Alexandria, Theodore of Antioch, and Theodore of Jerusalem—which was read at the council and respected by all:
after many testimonies from the holy Fathers, Theodore, the patriarch of Jerusalem, stated:
It remains for me to recount the time concerning Abgar of Edessa, and other similar matters of the holy Fathers, which you also know well.

206
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:37,065
Keep going, most holy Father, continue with the same good faith, strengthened on the rock of faith, just as the divine voice spoke to the Apostle Peter:
"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell will not overcome it" (Matthew 16).

207
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:40,127
Truly, they will not overcome it forever and ever.

208
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:55,317
We want to let you know, most holy lord, that I, humble Theodore, Patriarch of Jerusalem, along with Cosmas, Patriarch of Alexandria, and Theodore, Patriarch of Antioch, understand and believe the same thing, as it is evident to your holiness, etc.

This might seem unrelated, as it's written:
"There is no longer a prophet, and we will not be recognized anymore" Psalm 74.
Response.
For those heretics who, during the false assembly under Constantine, once a heretic emperor, claimed to know and understand something, but in reality, did not, they themselves mentioned this in the psalm.
They are likened to the Jews, about whom the blessed Augustine explained in the same psalm, saying:
"Look, these Jews, who say they are not recognized yet;"
and shortly after:
"You no longer see your signs, there is no longer a prophet, and you say: 'And we will not be recognized anymore,' because you do not recognize yet.
There is no longer a prophet, and we will not be recognized anymore: until when, God, has the enemy reproached?"
Similarly, these heretics:
"until when their leader, namely Constantine the heresiarch, was reproached, they did not understand, and therefore they were reduced to nothing."

In the Sixth ActionChapter 20 Critique

212
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:13,420
How should we understand the words in the Song of Songs: "Show me your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely" (Song of Songs 2); which have been applied, perhaps controversially, to the vision of images?

213
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:25,147
Response: They have applied it appropriately, because the vision of holy images relates to the beautiful form of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ according to the flesh, His holy mother, and the saints.

214
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:31,474
In the person of Christ and the Church, various works of the holy Fathers have interpreted the Song of Songs.

215
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:54,869
If they wish to know how it should be understood, we present the exposition of Saint Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus, where he mentions:
"Show me your face, let me hear your voice" meaning, do not communicate with me just through the law and prophets, but reveal yourself to me entirely: just as Moses, filled with the same desire, confidently asked God: "Show me yourself, that I may see you" (Exodus 35).

216
00:31:54,869 --> 00:32:22,792
At that time, God said to Moses: "No one shall see my face and live." However, wishing to reveal Himself to His bride, He incarnated and appeared to her in the flesh, through virtue, support, and innocence, offering her a vision of piety.
He thus showed her His face, conceived in the virgin Mother of God (Matthew 5), and let her hear His voice when He taught the disciples on the Mount of Olives, and again when He spread the message of preaching through them to the whole world.

217
00:32:22,792 --> 00:32:26,681
For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely (Song of Songs 2).

218
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:31,732
His voice is indeed sweet, as it says: "Come, blessed of my Father," etc. (Matthew 25).

219
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:38,756
Your voice is sweet, as it made the blind see when He said: "According to your faith, let it be done to you" (Matthew 9).

220
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:43,226
Your voice is sweet, inviting: "Come to me all who labor," etc. (Matthew 11).

221
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:48,451
Your voice is sweet, saying to the paralytic: "Rise, take up your mat, and walk" (Mark 2).

222
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:53,443
The voice is sweet, reassuring: "Have courage, son, your sins are forgiven" (Matthew).

223
00:32:54,024 --> 00:33:06,192
Your voice is sweet, saying: "Have courage, daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace." (Luke 7) And many other things that would take too long to write out in detail.

Chapter 21 Critique

225
00:33:11,663 --> 00:35:05,112
The passage stating, "God created man in His own image and likeness," does not relate to the worship of images.
Response: If they understand that God created man in His own image and likeness, as mentioned in Genesis Chapter 1, due to the explanation given by Patriarch Tarasius for the worship of images, they seem to lack understanding, as it is written, and they could not grasp it.
When Patriarch Tarasius rejected the council of heretics and reproached them for daring to speak against the stability of sacred images in their obscurity, he said: "To the extent that God, the Creator, sees His own handiwork perish," etc.
He said this with the understanding that the earthly man is honored as the image of God, etc.
And shortly after: They boast fiercely about the making of images and their empty deliberation, and by weaving various speeches, they judge the Church of God as if it were in error, etc.
For God created man in His own image and likeness.
Blessed Augustine, in Book 5, regarding what is read in Genesis about what was made on the sixth day, says among other things: "And now pay attention: man is set in his punishment, and consider how much of the image of God remains in him."
He destroyed that image through sin, and it is restored through grace, by which lust is worn away.
Just as a coin loses the image of the emperor when rubbed against the ground, so does the mind of man lose the image of God when rubbed by earthly lusts.
But Christ, the money changer, comes to re-stamp the coins.
How does He re-stamp the coins? By forgiving sins through grace, showing that God seeks His image.
For when they asked Him about paying taxes to Caesar: "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar?" (Matthew 22; Mark 12) They were testing Him, so that if He said, "Do not give," they could accuse Him through the tax collectors: "Look, He teaches us not to pay the tax"; but if He said, "Give," they could say: "Look, He cursed Jerusalem: He made it subject to tribute."
So what did He say, and what did He advise?

226
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:09,632
Why do you test me, hypocrites? Bring me a coin. And they brought it to him.

227
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:13,915
He asked, Whose image and inscription are on it? They replied, Caesar’s.

228
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:18,673
Then he said, So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.

229
00:35:18,673 --> 00:35:23,075
If Caesar seeks his image on the coin, does God not seek his image in man?

230
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:40,682
Similarly, the holy Severian, Bishop of Gabala, in a homily given on Saturday, spoke about the Image and Likeness from the Book of Genesis, Chapter Eight, and said:
Just as we honor the emperor's image when he is not present, creation, not seeing the invisible one made in his image, honored him.

How to understand what is written.

233
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:53,777
Abraham worshipped the people of the land, the sons of Heth, as mentioned in Genesis 23.

234
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:56,705
It is also said that Moses worshipped Jethro.

235
00:35:56,705 --> 00:36:03,407
These examples are often used by those who hold councils for worshipping images to support their error.

236
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:10,238
However, neither Jacob worshipped Pharaoh, nor did Daniel worship Nebuchadnezzar the king, as they claim.

237
00:36:10,238 --> 00:36:13,492
These acts are not read anywhere to have happened.

238
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:25,073
Response:
Blessed Augustine taught us in Psalm 46, saying:
The Lord our God spreads the faith, in which we live, through His books, the Holy Scriptures, in many and various ways.

239
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:28,977
He varies the sacraments of words, yet recommends one faith.

240
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:38,086
The same thing is expressed in many ways to keep the manner of speaking varied and prevent boredom, while maintaining one faith for harmony.

241
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:50,448
Also, from the same blessed Augustine about Abraham's son brought to sacrifice, among other things:
The two servants left behind and not brought to the place of sacrifice signified the Jews.

242
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:54,091
That donkey, I don't know what it signified of the Jews.

243
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:58,516
Do not be surprised because one thing can be signified in many ways.

This chapter isn't about the worship of images, nor is it mentioned in our translations from the Hebrew texts.

246
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:19,332
Contrary to what some say in their synod, there's no record of Jacob receiving Joseph's torn robe from his sons, kissing it with tears, and placing it on his eyes.

247
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:31,475
From the third peaceful sermon of Saint Gregory the Theologian, Oration 2 on peace:
Peace, my friend, praised as good by everyone yet preserved by few, where have you gone for so long, and when will you return to us?

248
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:36,310
I embrace the present, and I call upon the departing with many lamentations and tears.

249
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:49,185
Neither Jacob's sorrow for Joseph, the patriarch sold by his brothers and not captured by a beast as he feared, nor David's grief for Jonathan, his friend, or for his son Absalom, one of whom was torn from his heart, can compare.

250
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:53,457
A beast has taken him, Jacob cried, Joseph, a most wicked and untamed beast.

251
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:58,067
And the boy's torn garment was placed, as if he were kissing the boy’s flesh, etc.

252
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:02,678
Thus, many Fathers have included assertions from various histories in their works.

253
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:12,291
In the third book of Saint Ambrose to Emperor Gratian, Chapter 3, it is noted:
Do not conclude that because Gabriel does not die, Raphael does not die, Uriel does not die.

254
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:16,733
Indeed, in our books, translated from the Hebrew truth, Uriel is not mentioned.

255
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:23,929
Similarly, in the second book of the same Saint Ambrose on the Holy Spirit, Chapter 7:
Ezra taught us, saying in the third book.

256
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:31,125
However, the third book of Ezra is not included in our books, which are translated from the Hebrew truth; only two are included.

257
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:37,197
Additionally, Saint Gregory, the distinguished pope, mentioned it in his letter to Theoctista the patrician.

258
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:47,998
In letter thirty-nine, he mentions how powerful the forerunner of our Redeemer was, describing him not only as more than a prophet through sacred words but also as an angel.

259
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:53,266
Yet, as the story of his death reveals, after he died, his body was burned by persecutors.

260
00:38:53,266 --> 00:38:59,880
The Gospel of Matthew, chapter fourteen, tells us that Saint John the Baptist's body was buried by his disciples.

261
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,679
Blessed Gregory recounts in history that Saint John the Baptist's body was burned.

262
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:12,581
Thus, as we've discussed, the words of the saints are never dismissed, for who can fully comprehend all of the sacred divine Scripture?

If you accuse me of worshipping the wood of the cross as God, why do you not accuse Jacob of worshipping the top of Joseph's staff?

265
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:34,477
It's clear that he did not worship the wood he saw, but God through Joseph's staff, just as we worship Christ through the cross.

266
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:42,782
Here's the response:
The staff, specifically the scepter, was beautifully explained by the blessed Augustine as a symbol of the cross in Psalm Thirty-Seven.

267
00:39:42,782 --> 00:39:47,839
Among other things, he said:
Let us rejoice that it is already happening in the name of Christ.

268
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,193
Now, holding the scepter, they submit to the wood of the cross.

269
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:58,007
What was foretold is now happening: All the kings of the earth will worship him; all nations will serve him (Psalm Seventy-Two).

270
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:03,064
Now, on the foreheads of kings, the sign of the cross is more precious than the gem of a crown.

274
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:18,353
Holy Scripture always instructs us to bless: Bless and do not curse Romans 12.

00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:21,426
Additionally: Bless all the works of the Lord Daniel 3.

276
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:31,762
We are taught: and again, in prayer, spiritually prostrate before the Holy of Holies, we chant: May God, our God, bless us, may God bless us, and may all the ends of the earth fear Him.

277
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:43,496
Therefore, if we aim to discuss the blessings of Divine Scripture, before the discourse concludes on the page, as we presume, we add one more testimony from Saint Augustine about Jacob wrestling with the angel.

278
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:47,966
Among other things, he says: I will not let you go unless you bless me Psalm 67.

279

This chapter discusses the vain hope of those who believe they can achieve salvation through images, claiming:
"Just as the Israelites were saved by looking at the bronze serpent, so we will be saved by looking at the images of saints."
Response.
This has already been addressed by the sacred councils of my most holy papal predecessors, as well as by the most holy Fathers.
For the understanding of unbelievers and the guidance of the Franks, it must be noted what God commanded His servant Moses, saying:
"As written in the Book of Numbers, against the plague that afflicted them: Make a serpent and set it up as a sign; whoever is bitten and looks at it will live."
So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it up as a sign; when those who were bitten looked at it, they were healed.
Numbers twenty-one.
O madness of those who rage against the Christian faith and religion, claiming not to worship or venerate images, which depict our Savior, His mother, or the saints, whose virtue sustains the world and grants salvation to humankind.
Do we believe the Israelites were freed from their calamity by looking at the bronze serpent, yet doubt that we can be saved by looking at and venerating the images of Christ our God and the saints?
Let us not succumb to the wicked audacity of such insanity: let us follow the ancient traditions of the Fathers and not depart from their teachings for any reason.
By doing so, we can obtain the full grace, just as our predecessors and fathers did.
Also, from the blessed Augustine on how God appeared, with the rod and the hand turned white, and water turned into blood:
"Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life."
John three.
This means that whoever is struck by the serpents of sin should look to Christ and will have healing through the forgiveness of sins.
Also from the same Saint Augustine on the Gospel of John, in the same sermon homily.

282
00:42:50,423 --> 00:42:56,940
In the twelfth chapter, among other topics, we find this:
Brothers, let's look to Christ crucified to heal us from sin.

283
00:42:56,940 --> 00:44:44,489
Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, it is said: "But may have eternal life"; and later: "That he may have eternal life."
This illustrates the difference between a symbol and the reality itself: the symbol provided temporary life, while the reality, which the symbol represented, offers eternal life.
Similarly, in Saint Augustine's book three on the Trinity, chapter ten, it states:
Just as the anointing of the stone represents Christ in the flesh, anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, the rod of Moses turning into a serpent symbolizes Christ becoming obedient to death on the cross.
That's why it's said: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may not perish but have eternal life."
John Chapter Three.
Just as those who looked at the serpent lifted up in the desert were saved from its bites,
our old self was crucified with him.
The serpent represents death, which was brought about by the serpent in paradise, metaphorically showing the cause and its effect.
Therefore, the rod turning into a serpent symbolizes Christ's death, and the serpent turning back into a rod symbolizes Christ's resurrection, all connected to his body, which is the Church.
Additionally, in the sermon by Saint Severian, Bishop of Gabala, on the Holy Cross, it is discussed:
Do you think it would have been right to say: "If any of you is bitten, let him look up to heaven to God, and he will be saved?"
He could not say: "If anyone is bitten, let him look at the light of the lamp, and he will be saved,"
or "Look at the table of the showbread, and he will be saved,"
or at the altar, the veil, the ark, the image of the cherubim, or the mercy seat.
Instead, the great lawgiver presented none of these, but only fixed the image of the cross, using the cursed serpent as a symbol.
As a faithful servant, consider: Do you do what you forbid? Do you build what you renounce?

284
00:44:44,543 --> 00:45:01,632
You say, "Do not make carved images," yet you sculpt a molten serpent?
I established that law to eliminate sources of impiety and to save this people from idol worship.
Now, however, I create the serpent to foreshadow the Savior's plan, paving the way for the apostles.

Leo of Phocaea, the bishop, persistently and nonsensically spoke about the worship of images, using a verse from the Psalmist for himself, saying:
"You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and clothed me with joy." Psalm thirty.
Response.
Every Christian is allowed to pray with the Psalmist, so that when they come from darkness to light through the grace of Christ, they can rightly say:
"You have turned my mourning into joy for me," because when they are delivered from heresy, their sackcloth is torn.
And when they recognize the truth of the true faith, they are surrounded by the joy of the orthodox of the holy Catholic Church.
On this very matter, Saint Augustine similarly states in the explanation of the same psalm:
"You have torn the lament of my sins, the sorrow of my mortality, and clothed me with the first robe, immortal joy."
And again:
"So that I may not mourn, but sing to you, not in humility, but in my glory; because you have already exalted me from humility, and I am not troubled by the conscience of sin, the fear of death, the fear of judgment, and so forth."

This doesn't relate to the worship of images, despite what the Psalmist sang:
"Each one speaks lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak" (Psalm twelve, verse two).

289
00:46:26,721 --> 00:47:03,328
Response:
It's not that they ignored what the Psalmist sang:
"Each one speaks lies," etc.;
but rather, in rejecting the nonsense of heretics in their misguided presence, they sang with the Psalmist about them:
"Each one speaks lies to his neighbor," and so on.
In Saint Augustine's explanation of the same psalm, among other points:
There is one truth by which holy souls are enlightened.
However, since there are many souls, many truths can be spoken within them, just as many images appear in mirrors from one face.
And shortly after:

John, the presbyter and delegate of the Easterners, stated, perhaps too boldly or flatteringly, during the participation of the blessed Pope Adrian and Tarasius, that this has been fulfilled.

293
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:35,550
Response: It is rightly said because God showed mercy on the Church of Constantinople and met the truth of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.

294
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:42,263
The Roman Church always upheld justice, as it is written: The seat of justice, the house of faith, the hall of modesty.

295
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:48,863
The Church of Constantinople embraced this justice, faith, and modesty when it turned away from error and made peace.

296
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:52,248
Only the seat of Constantinople resisted the orthodox faith.

297
00:47:52,248 --> 00:48:02,402
The seats of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem always held the ancient tradition with us, namely the orthodox faith, as their synodical acts for the stability of holy images show.

298
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:09,115
Blessed Augustine, in his explanation of the same psalm, said: Because righteousness and peace kiss, they do not argue.

299
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:10,807
Why do you argue with justice?

300
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,248
Look, justice tells you: Do not steal, and you do not listen.

301
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:17,181
Do not commit adultery, and you do not want to hear.

302
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:20,058
Do not do to others what you do not want to suffer.

303

Do not say to others what you do not want to be said to you.

304
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:27,222
Peace tells you, you are an enemy of my friend, why do you seek me?

305
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:28,633
I am a friend of justice.

306
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:32,412
Whoever I find to be an enemy of my friend, I do not approach them.

307
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:34,274
So, do you want to come to peace?

308
00:48:34,274 --> 00:48:34,894
Do justice.

309
00:48:34,894 --> 00:48:39,971
Therefore, another psalm tells you: Turn away from evil and do good, as found in Psalm 37.

In explaining this psalm, Blessed Augustine, about midway through, mentions:
I am not afraid to worship the footstool of my Lord, because the psalm instructs: Worship at His footstool;
and soon after, he adds: I turn to Christ, because I seek Him here, and I understand how the earth can be worshiped without wrongdoing, how the footstool of His feet can be revered without sin.

315
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:28,444
He took earth from the earth, as flesh comes from the earth, and He took flesh from Mary's flesh.

316
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:44,450
Since He walked here in that flesh and gave us that flesh to eat for our salvation:
no one eats that flesh without first worshiping it;
this shows how such a footstool of the Lord can be worshiped, and not only do we not sin by worshiping, but we actually sin by not worshiping.

317
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,544
And a little later.

318
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:55,333
Thus, any earth, when you bow and prostrate yourself, you do not regard it as just earth, but as Him who is holy, whose footstool you worship;
you worship because of Him.

319
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:59,651
So, he also adds here: Worship at His footstool, for it is holy (Psalm 99).

The idea that the worship of images can be justified by the scripture, "Worship in his holy mountain," from Psalm 99:9, is challenged.
The response to this is found in Blessed Augustine's commentary on the same psalm, where, towards the end, he explains:
"Heretics do not worship on this mountain, because this mountain has spread over the entire earth.
They focused on a part and lost the whole.
If they recognize the Catholic Church, they will worship on this mountain with us.
Indeed, that stone, which was cut from the mountain without hands, we can see how much it has grown, how many regions of the earth it has reached, and to which nations it has spread."
Shortly after, he continues: "We see all the kingdoms of the earth broken by that stone," referring to the book of Daniel, chapter 2.
"What were all the kingdoms of the earth?
The kingdoms of idols and demons are broken.
Saturn once ruled over many people; where is his kingdom now?
Mercury ruled over many; where is his kingdom now?
They are broken; they have been brought into the kingdom of Christ, in whom he reigns."
And shortly after: "Therefore, that stone was born from the mountain without hands; it grew, and by growing, broke all the kingdoms of the earth.
It became a great mountain and filled the entire earth.
This is the Catholic Church, with which you are glad to be connected.
But those who are not connected with it, who worship and praise God outside of this mountain, are not heard unto eternal life, etc."

No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket Luke Chapter 11.

327
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:32,792
Response.

328
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:45,126
Very beautifully and appropriately, they said that a lamp is put under a basket against those who disdain images, because the lamp represents our faith, specifically that of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.

329
00:52:45,126 --> 00:53:00,298
About this faith, Saint Ambrose, bishop of Milan, testifies in his explanation on the holy Gospel according to Luke (Book 7, Chapter 11), saying among other things:
No one lights a lamp and puts it in secret or under a basket, but on a lampstand Luke Chapter 11.

330
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:07,190
Therefore, since the Church is preferred over the Synagogue, it encourages us to place more of our faith in the Church.

331
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:12,286
For the lamp is faith, as it is written, Your word is a lamp to my feet, Lord Psalm 119.

332
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:17,555
The word of God is our faith, the word of God is light John Chapter 1, and faith is a lamp.

333
00:53:17,555 --> 00:53:21,667
And shortly after: Therefore, let no one establish faith under the law.

334
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,852
For the law is within measure, beyond measure is grace.

335
00:53:24,852 --> 00:53:40,719
The law obscures, grace clarifies; therefore, let no one confine their faith within the measure of the law, but bring it to the Church, where the sevenfold grace of the Spirit shines, illuminated by the brightness of divine majesty, lest the shadow of the law extinguish it.

336
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:59,828
Also, Saint John Chrysostom, in his interpretation of the Gospel according to Matthew (Homily 15, after the middle), says among other things:
Indeed, he says, I have lit the light: but let it be burning by your speed: not only for you, but also for those who are to come, to be gladdened by this brightness and led to virtue, etc.

338
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:14,192
The statement by the blessed Athanasius, bishop of the city of Alexandria, should not be interpreted as those who try to apply it to the worship of images might think.

339
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:14,681
Response.

340
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:23,218
Many statements by the blessed Athanasius are mentioned in the same council, but they did not specify which statement they were referring to in this chapter.

341
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:32,515
However, just as the statements of the holy Athanasius are included among other things in the holy councils of our most holy predecessors, we faithfully present them here.

342
00:54:32,515 --> 00:55:17,590
Question of Antiochus to Saint Athanasius regarding images:
The law from the prophets says, "You shall not worship statues and likenesses," so how do you justify making images and worshiping them?
He replied:
We believers do not worship images as gods; far from it, pagans do that.
Instead, we approach them with affection and love in our souls toward the appearance of the image's face.
Therefore, many times we discard the face, treating it as plain and ordinary wood, and burn what was once an image.
Just as Jacob, near death, worshiped the top of Joseph’s staff—not honoring the staff, but the one who held it, as mentioned in the book of Genesis chapter forty-seven according to the Septuagint—so too do we believers venerate images, driven by our desire for the person depicted.
And many other similar explanations follow.

The response?

345
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:34,377
They presented testimony from the holy Sixth Council to clearly demonstrate that even during the time of the holy Sixth Council, sacred images and painted histories were venerated since ancient times.

346
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:46,758
Therefore, the holy Sixth Council faithfully established in its orthodox canons, stating: In some paintings of venerable images, the lamb shown by the finger of the forerunner is designated, which was left as a sign of grace.

347
00:55:46,758 --> 00:55:55,508
And shortly after, Canon eighty-one states: We decree that according to the human form and in images, it is now called a new name instead of the old lamb, etc.

348
00:55:55,508 --> 00:56:12,787
And thus, blessed Augustine explained in Psalm ninety-three: If you do not worship these earthly things in Christ, although some resemblance is given to signify the saints, from whichever creature the likeness is derived, understand it as the likeness of the creature, and worship the Creator of the creature, etc.

In the Fourth ActionChapter 36 Critique

350
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:23,786
The apostles never established, either by example or word, the worship of images, contrary to what some claim.

351
00:56:23,786 --> 00:56:24,285
Response.

352
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:32,656
Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, who was the bishop of Athens, was highly praised by Saint Pope Gregory, affirming him as an ancient Father and teacher.

353
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:37,035
He lived during the time of the apostles, as shown in the Acts of the Apostles.

354
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:37,867
Acts seventeen.

355
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:54,332
Therefore, his true testimonies supporting the veneration of sacred images were confirmed by our most holy predecessors, the popes, in their sacred councils, among other things:
This is embraced from the letter of Saint Dionysius, Bishop of Athens, which was directed to Saint John the Evangelist.

356
00:56:54,332 --> 00:57:00,430
And further:
Is it any wonder if Christ, who is truthful, and his unjust disciples are cast out of the cities?

357
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,587
They rightly judge for themselves, and the wicked withdraw from the sacred.

358
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,246
In truth, images are the visible representations of the invisible.

359
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:19,334
In the ages to come, no one will be blamed for respecting God through various colors, allowing us to silently transition through the most sacred images with a pious mind to the simple and incorporeal.

360
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:36,741
Indeed, it is impossible to reach with our mind that incorporeal imitation and vision of the heavenly host unless we can transition from the visible to the invisible and most beautiful representation through elements, and through visible and fragrant images, the invisible is made to shine with rational tradition.

It's not about the worship of images, as some claim, but rather follows the teachings of Blessed Cyril in his explanation of the Gospel according to Matthew.

363
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:57,970
Response:
Saint Cyril of Alexandria and Saint Gregory of Nyssa both supported the veneration of sacred images in the story of Abraham.

364
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:14,365
In the sacred councils of our most revered pontiffs, regarding the sermon of Saint Cyril of Alexandria, bishop:
It's noted that if someone gazes at a beautiful image and admires the figure of the king depicted in it:
By recognizing this and seeing its portrayal, they are inspired to admire the king himself.

In the Sixth Action Chapter 38 Critique

366
00:58:19,224 --> 00:58:25,565
It's a great rashness and an enormous absurdity to equate the often-mentioned images with the body and blood of the Lord.

367
00:58:25,565 --> 00:58:26,036
Response.

368
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:39,924
They did not equate them, but rather spoke more scripturally:
For none of the holy apostles or our respected Fathers, who spoke without blood of our offering, which is done in memory of the passion of Christ our God and all His plan, called it an image of His body.

369
00:58:39,924 --> 00:58:50,668
Nor did they receive from the Lord to speak or confess so, but they hear Him saying in the Gospel:
Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.

First Corinthians 11.

373
00:58:56,118 --> 00:59:08,801
We did not wish to write them all down, because it is written in order in the same synod:
For to equate, as the Iconoclast heretics say in their false writing, the venerable images with the body and blood of the Lord, they insensibly equated.

Tarasius and his followers are boldly and ignorantly equating sacred vessels with something else.

376
00:59:19,204 --> 00:59:20,274
Here's the response.

377
00:59:20,274 --> 01:00:19,381
At the council, Tarasius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, stated:
"We have various sacred vessels that we kiss and embrace, hoping to receive some sanctification from them."
The heretics, in their misguided assembly, were speaking nonsense, not consecrating the sacred prayer to sanctify it, leaving it common and dishonored, just as the painter created it.
But we, in truth and faithfulness, affirm that the practice of our holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church has been and continues to be that when sacred images or stories are painted, they are first anointed with sacred chrism, and then venerated by the faithful.
This follows the Lord's command to Moses:
"You shall make the holy anointing oil, a perfumed compound, according to the art of the perfumer, and you shall anoint the tent of meeting with it, the ark of the testimony, the table with its vessels, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense and of burnt offering, and all the furnishings used in worship."
"And you shall sanctify them, and they shall be most holy: whoever touches them shall be sanctified."
(Exodus thirty).

381
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:46,630
Response: They spoke prophetically and sang with the Psalmist, as the blessed Augustine explained in this psalm, saying: May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, etc.

382
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:58,787
When he said "all," who would think themselves exempt?

What their ancestors claimed was not fulfilled, as it is written: "The enemies have perished, their weapons destroyed, and you have ruined their cities."
Response: This verse was always spoken prophetically by the prophet in a psalm-like manner.
Thus, the blessed Augustine explained in the same psalm, saying (after the beginning): "The enemies have perished, the weapons destroyed;" not enemies in the plural, but this enemy in the singular.
But whose enemy, if not the devil's weapons that have perished?
These are understood to be various erroneous opinions.
And shortly after: "And you have ruined their cities."
These cities are where the devil reigns, where deceitful and fraudulent councils hold the place of courts, and so on.
And thus, it was fulfilled in the heretics themselves when they arrogantly removed sacred images.

How should we understand the phrase: "Lord, in your city you will bring their image to nothing" (Psalm Seventy-Three)?

387
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:06,802
This chapter, like others, is often interpreted differently than originally intended.

388
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:13,034
Response:
It's understood in relation to the wealthy of this world who are misguided, among other interpretations.

389
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:32,442
Even Saint John Chrysostom, in his homily about the Old and New Testament having one legislator, explained it by saying: "I also loved an image infused with wax, filled with piety. For I saw an angel in the image pursuing a multitude of barbarians, and David truly saying: 'Lord, in your city their images you will bring to nothing' (Psalm Seventy-Three).

390
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:36,050
Behold, the father very clearly shows how it should be understood.

391
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:57,481
"
Additionally, Saint Athanasius on the interpretation of the psalms says: "The city of the Lord is Jerusalem above; but their image is earthly. What he means is this: Because they have embraced an earthly image, and not a heavenly one, they will be brought to nothing. For at that time they will hear: 'I do not know you' (Matthew Twenty-Five), as those not clothed in the image of the Lord.

392
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:29,901
"
Saint Augustine, in his explanation of the same psalm, adds: "Whoever doesn't have these things, don't desire them; whoever has them, don't rely on them. Behold, I tell you: I do not say: Be condemned because you have them; but be condemned if you rely on such things, if you're arrogant because of them, if you think highly of yourselves because of them, if you ignore the poor because of them, if you forget the common condition of humanity because of vain excellence. For it is necessary that God will repay in the end, and in his city, he will bring the image of such people to nothing."

It is not, as they claim, said for those who worship images: "Because the Lord will not allow the rod of the wicked to rest on the lot of the righteous, so that the righteous will not reach out their hands to do wrong" (Psalm One Twenty-Five).

395
01:03:47,844 --> 01:04:19,003
Response: They rightly spoke with the prophet because the rod of the wicked refers to the heretics, and the lot of the righteous refers to the orthodox, as Saint Augustine explained in the same psalm, saying: "The rod of the wicked is felt for a time on the lot of the righteous, but it is not left there; it will not be forever."
The time will come when Christ, appearing in His glory, will gather all nations before Him and separate them, as a shepherd separates the goats from the sheep.
He will place the sheep on His right, and the goats on His left, etcetera.

I saw an angel in a vision chasing a multitude of barbarians.

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:45,505
Who is this angel, if not the one mentioned in the Scriptures, where the angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrians in one night, Second Kings Chapter 19, around Jerusalem while they were encamped?

399
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:46,003
Response.

400
01:04:46,003 --> 01:04:53,589
We have already explained why Saint John Chrysostom mentioned this vision, but the diverse multitude from which it originated has passed.

401
01:04:53,589 --> 01:05:05,163
Therefore, John the presbyter, by his own judgment, believed, according to the divine Scripture, that the angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrians in one night around Jerusalem while they were encamped.

402
01:05:05,163 --> 01:05:10,811

There's a statement made by John, priest of the East, which seems quite foolish and irrational.

405
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:25,968
He claims that when the emperor isn't present, his image is still honored, not dishonored.

406
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:32,513
Similarly, even though Jesus Christ, the ruler of all, doesn't appear to us visibly, his image should still be honored.

407
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:39,884
Christ is invisible to our physical eyes, yet, as God, he is present everywhere, just like the emperor is perceived through his image.

Response.

409
01:05:40,379 --> 01:05:43,900
John, priest of the East, didn't make this statement on his own.

410
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:49,675
He was referencing a book by Saint Anastasius, bishop of Theopolis, which was read during the same synod.

411
01:05:49,675 --> 01:05:58,366
Therefore, he stated that the Father showed that when the emperor isn't present, his image is honored, not dishonored, and what follows, as mentioned earlier.

This concerns John, a priest and envoy of the Easterners, who is said to have carelessly tried to establish the worship of images:
Jacob set up a pillar to God, and in doing so, he blessed him.

414
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:22,093
Response:
This was said in a symbolic sense because when he woke up, he set up a stone pillar at the place where God had spoken to him.

415
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:26,418
He poured offerings on it, anointed it with oil, and called the place Bethel.

417
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,967
Therefore, it seems to have multiple interpretations.

From the book of blessed Augustine, on the Treatise of Esau and Jacob:
Your holiness understands, he says, that the Church is represented in many ways.

419

Because one thing is represented in many ways, which is none of these things in reality, but is all of them in figure, etc.

421
01:06:52,680 --> 01:07:02,402
It's quite absurd for some to use divine law to justify images, citing that Moses made the mercy seat, the two golden cherubim, and the ark of the covenant at the Lord's command.

422
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:02,893
Response.

423
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:09,830
We've already gently explained how our holy predecessors, the popes, used divine law to affirm images in their sacred councils.

424
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:36,320
Saint Gregory the Theologian, in his Easter sermon, says:
"And the one who spoke to Moses, when he gave the law about these things, said, 'See that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain' (Exodus 25), indicating that invisible things were made visible: and I am convinced that none of these were without reason, nor arranged irrationally, nor crawling on the ground, nor anything unworthy of both the ordinances of God and the ministry of Moses, etc.

425
01:07:36,320 --> 01:08:33,724
"
Similarly, the blessed Augustine in his book on Exodus says:
"We believe the deeds, just as we read the deeds, and yet we know by apostolic doctrine that these deeds were shadows of things to come."
"Thus, we think that what has been done should be closely investigated, yet we cannot deny that they were done, etc."
Chapter 48: Criticism.
It's a significant error to interpret the Holy Scriptures incorrectly and to apply them to meanings they don't contain, just like in the erroneous council held in Nicaea during Constantine's reign, with Irene his mother mediating and Tarasius, the newly appointed bishop of Constantinople, presiding.
Response.
The following criticisms aren't taken from a council, but from the sense derived from the book of the blessed Augustine about when God appeared to Moses, where it's explained:
"Therefore, all the signs and mysteries of the future people are about our Lord Jesus Christ, and if there are any other sacraments in the old books, whether we understand them or not, they require a seeker, not a critic."

426
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:37,114
Let's ask, search, and knock so that it will be opened to us.

427
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:42,087
The future sacraments were foretold to them, but we experience the present ones in the Church.

Chapter 49 - Critique: What's the difference between image and likeness, or equality?

429
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:52,455
Response: Which of the faithful would ever think they don't understand what image, likeness, or equality means?

430
01:08:52,455 --> 01:08:56,369
In the holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, grace is given to the humble.

431
01:08:56,369 --> 01:09:16,840
Indeed, the mathematicians' difference in the external art of discipline looks down on maintaining the faithful, as Blessed Ambrose notes in the first book on Faith, chapter three, where he says:
We must say what is written: Beware lest anyone deceive you through philosophy and empty seduction, according to the tradition of men and the elements of this world, and not according to God.

433
01:09:18,057 --> 01:09:26,838
For they place all the power of their arguments in dialectical reasoning, defined by the philosophers' opinion, which focuses not on building up, but on tearing down.

434
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:30,223
But it did not please God to save His people through dialectics.

435
01:09:30,223 --> 01:09:35,037
For the kingdom of God is found in the simplicity of faith, not in the contention of words.

436
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:50,748
Chapter 50 - Critique: It goes against the teachings of Blessed Gregory to worship or break images, and because the Old and New Testaments, and almost all the principal doctors of the Church, agree with Blessed Gregory in not worshiping images, we should not worship anything besides Almighty God.

437
01:09:50,748 --> 01:09:53,868
This is confirmed in many places by Saint Gregory the Pope.

438
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:59,899
Response: He never disrespected sacred images, but rather consistently observed and revered their representations.

439
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:13,758
As for the claim that almost all the principal doctors of the Church agree with Blessed Gregory, it was unreasonable to write this because Saint Gregory was obedient and aligned with his predecessors—the Fathers and principal doctors of the holy catholic Church.

440
01:10:13,758 --> 01:10:19,947
For those who lived in this world did not know Blessed Gregory, except for the one who foreknew and predestined them.

441
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:23,667
Here’s how Saint Gregory revered his holy predecessors.

442
01:10:23,667 --> 01:12:05,280
We present a letter from the same Saint Gregory (Book 7, Letter 7) addressed to Eulogius, the Patriarch of Alexandria, where, among other things, he says:
"Regarding the heretic Eudoxius, about whose error I found nothing in the Latin language, I am very pleased to have been abundantly informed by your blessedness."
"You have provided the testimonies of the brave men Basil, Gregory, and Epiphanius, and we clearly understand that he has been utterly defeated, against whom our heroes launched so many attacks," etc.
Regarding the veneration of sacred images, as Saint Gregory taught in his other letters, he also addressed this in his letter to Januarius, Bishop of Cagliari (Book 7, Indiction 2, Letter 5), which begins as follows:
"Jews coming from your city have complained to us that their synagogue in Cagliari was occupied by Peter, who, by the will of God, was led from their superstition to the worship of the Christian faith, along with some undisciplined people."
"On the day after his baptism, which was on the Lord's Day during the Easter celebration, he occupied it with great scandal without your consent, placing there an image of the Mother of God and our Lord, a venerated cross, and a white garment he had worn when he rose from the baptismal font."
"Considering your intention and judgment on this matter, we urge you to restore what was taken by force, with the image and the cross removed with the veneration they deserve."
"Therefore, the aforementioned Peter, or others who supported him in this misguided behavior, should not claim they acted out of zeal for the faith, as if it was necessary to convert people this way."
"They should be admonished and understand that they should exercise more restraint, so they may be drawn willingly and not brought unwillingly, for it is written: 'I will sacrifice to you voluntarily,' etc." (Psalm Fifty-Four)

443
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,400
Saint Gregory did not dare to contradict the faith regarding sacred images.

444
01:12:09,400 --> 01:13:23,784
Instead, he confirmed it by saying, "Let them not be brought unwilling."
Chapter 51: Reproach. Those who curse their parents act against the Lord's command. If they believe their predecessors were heretics, they themselves are born, taught, and consecrated by heretics. Whether it's about not judging those who have passed or how their error differs from their parents' error, as some broke images while others adored them.
Response. Those who wrote this from their own understanding should heed the powerful words of the prophet Ezekiel, who says, "As I live, says the Lord, this proverb shall not be used by you anymore in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul who sins shall die."
And later: "But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and does what is just and right, they will save their life."
And after many things: "I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways, why will you die, house of Israel?"
Therefore, you, son of man, say to the children of your people: "The righteousness of the righteous will not save them when they disobey; and the wickedness of the wicked will not cause them to fall when they turn from their wickedness," etc. (Ezekiel 18 and 33).

445
01:13:23,784 --> 01:13:35,541
As Saint Gregory mentions in his Dialogues, Book 3, Chapter 31, what harm came to King Hermenegild, who converted from the Arian heresy to the Catholic faith, from his father, Arian King Leovigild of the Visigoths?

446
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,299
We truly believe there was none.

447
01:13:37,299 --> 01:13:44,276
When his Arian father killed him for his true and orthodox faith, Hermenegild became a steadfast confessor of God and a martyr.

448
01:13:44,276 --> 01:13:48,286
His Arian father, however, was led into eternal fire for his Arian faith.

449
01:13:48,286 --> 01:13:51,198
How could he have harmed his faithful son in any way?

450
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:58,566
The holy Catholic and Apostolic Church truly rejoices when it sees its enemies, especially heretics, return in true confession.

451
01:13:58,566 --> 01:14:02,169
As the Lord says:
"There will be joy over one sinner,"
(Luke 15).

452
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:06,326
And if there is joy over one, imagine the joy over the return of thousands!

453
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:09,263
Who among the faithful would dare to resist this joy?

454
01:14:09,263 --> 01:14:42,351
Also, from Saint Augustine on Psalm 84, he says:
"The sins of the parents do not belong to the children, which parents commit after their children are born.
For the children born already belong to themselves, and the parents to themselves.
Therefore, those who are born, if they follow the bad ways of their parents, must bear their own merits.
But if they change and do not imitate their bad parents, they begin to have their own merit, not the merit of their parents.
So much so that your father's sin does not harm you, if you change, nor does it harm your father, if he changes,"
(Chapter 52).

455
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:42,849
Reproach.

456
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:49,833
The Greeks tried in vain and recklessly to anathematize the Catholic Church in their synod because it does not worship images.

457
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:55,264
They should have first thoroughly examined what each part of the Church thought about this matter.

458
01:14:55,264 --> 01:14:55,763
Response.

459
01:14:55,763 --> 01:14:58,313
They did not anathematize the Catholic Church.

460
01:14:58,313 --> 01:15:11,282
Instead, upon returning to it, they anathematized the false logic and its heretical accomplices, who shamelessly and recklessly not only removed the sacred images established in the holy Church from ancient times but even burned them.

461
01:15:11,282 --> 01:15:19,650
Thus, following the tradition of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, having returned from heresy, they specifically anathematized it with contempt.

462
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:26,190
Also, from the letter of Saint Gregory directed to Eusebius, Archbishop of Thessalonica
(Book 7, indiction 2, letter).

463
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:31,562
We urge you to continually and diligently investigate this matter with brotherly care.

464
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:42,947
If you find them innocent of this wickedness, clear the scandal from the minds of your children by providing reconciliation and specifically anathematizing Severus and Nestorius along with all other heresies.

465
01:15:42,947 --> 01:15:45,957
This is what they did, returning from their own heresy.

466
01:15:45,957 --> 01:15:46,559
Chapter 53.

467
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:46,997
Reproof.

468
01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:51,430
A woman should not teach in a synod, as it is said that Irene did in their synod.

469
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,922
Response.

470
01:15:51,922 --> 01:16:03,361
At the very beginnings of Christianity, when Emperor Constantine converted to the faith, his mother Helena Augusta came to him in Rome with twelve scribes and Pharisees, as well as Jewish teachers and leaders.

471
01:16:03,361 --> 01:16:08,999
Together with her son Constantine Augustus, she decided to hold a council with the Jews and Christians.

472
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:21,477
This council, presided over by the holy Pope Sylvester with many very holy bishops, expanded the Christian faith significantly through both sacred Scripture and miracles, under the Lord's protection, and they emerged victorious.

473
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:29,085
Additionally, the eminent Pope Leo, a distinguished teacher, sent his letters to Pulcheria Augusta for the sake of the holy fourth council.

474
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:34,558
Consequently, she herself sat in the holy fourth synod, alongside the most faithful Emperor Marcian.

475
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:45,997
Also, from the book of Saint Augustine, regarding what is read in Genesis on the sixth day: The earth produced grass for food and fruit-bearing trees, and likewise, people in the Church produce works of mercy.

476
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:55,301
These works were also offered to the Lord when he was in the flesh, not only by men, such as Zacchaeus, but also by women who ministered to him from their resources, etc.

477
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:55,903
Chapter 54.

478
01:16:55,903 --> 01:16:56,341
Reproof.

479
01:16:56,341 --> 01:17:06,904
Images should not be worshipped because, as they say, some signs seem to have been demonstrated through them, when not all things through which or in which miracles appear are to be worshipped.

480
01:17:06,904 --> 01:17:07,397
Response.

481
01:17:08,328 --> 01:17:18,320
Earlier, we discussed the concept of worshipping images, explaining that acts like offering a kiss and an honorable greeting to them do not constitute true worship according to our faith.

482
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,152
True worship is reserved for the divine nature alone.

483
01:17:21,152 --> 01:18:11,596
From the book of Saint Augustine on Psalm Seventy-Six:
"You are truly a great God, performing wonders in the body, alone in the soul."
And a little later:
"Moses did it, but not alone; Elijah, Elisha, and the apostles did it, but none of them acted alone.
When they acted, you were with them; when you acted, they were not with you.
For they were not with you when you acted, when you also made them.
You are God, who performs wonders alone."
Chapter Fifty-Five: Criticism.
This chapter addresses how apocryphal and absurd ideas were inserted into their discourses.
Response: To the scorn and reproach of the heretics who made false arguments, they presented their apocryphal nonsense, highlighting the errors they attempted to introduce into the holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
Therefore, those who returned from that heresy sang with the prophet against those heretics: "The enemy's swords have failed, etc." (Psalm Nine) and many more.

484
01:18:11,596 --> 01:18:50,551
Also, from Saint Gregory the Theologian in the sermon on Epiphany (Oration on the Holy Lights), he says:
"Let us approach the light and become light ourselves by sharing in the eternal light."
And a little later:
"Do the delirious stories and obscure mysteries of pagans have anything like this, the inventions of demons, or the crazy creations of a frenzied mind, confirmed by time and praised in tales?
For those things, which they worship as true, they again teach to be false and made up through stories.
If they were true, they would certainly not be fables, since truth and fiction are opposed to each other in every way.
But they do everything as if they were truly children playing in the streets and mocking each other."

485
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:59,175
There is no assertion of manly sense or perfect reason here, nothing they can offer against the worshippers of the word of God, and many other similar things.

486
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:00,407
Chapter 56 - Criticism.

487
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:11,655
Regarding the fact that the more they disdain or despise examples and images of heretics, the more they dishonor their parents with greater insults and injuries, whom they claim to have followed in this regard.

488
01:19:11,655 --> 01:19:12,137
Response.

489
01:19:12,137 --> 01:19:18,672
They often refer to this very issue in this chapter, because they despised their parents and dishonored them with insults.

490
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:28,099
As we have written above, we briefly add that good parents cannot benefit bad children, nor can good children help bad parents; each will give an account to God for themselves.

491
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:37,955
Those who do not follow their parents in the most savage error and have returned to the true faith of the orthodox holy Catholic and apostolic Church are indeed much more praiseworthy.

492
01:19:37,955 --> 01:19:56,541
From the book of Saint Augustine on prophecy (Tractate on the Sheep, near the end), where God speaks to the sheep, among other things:
Therefore, whoever has crossed over from heretics to the Catholic Church will not bear the reproach of the nations, nor carry the curse of dissension, because they remain rooted in unity, in the planting of love.

493
01:19:56,541 --> 01:20:03,987
They will not carry the curse, and they will know that I am the Lord their God, and they my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord God.

494
01:20:03,987 --> 01:20:05,486
Ezekiel chapter thirty-four.

495
01:20:05,486 --> 01:20:06,718
Chapter 57 - Criticism.

496
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:11,646
That it is not against the Christian religion, as they say, not to worship and adore images.

497
01:20:11,646 --> 01:20:12,128
Response.

498
01:20:12,128 --> 01:20:23,644
From the book of the blessed Augustine on the treatise on the Proverbs of Solomon, among other things:
You find a man extending his hand with alms to the poor, yet not thinking of God, but desiring to please people.

499
01:20:23,644 --> 01:20:26,805
A woolen garment may be seen, but it lacks an inner lining.

500
01:20:26,805 --> 01:20:35,964
You find another saying to you:
"It is enough for me to worship God in my conscience, to adore God: what need do I have to go to church or to visibly mix with Christians?"

501
01:20:36,768 --> 01:20:41,709
He wants to have a line without a tunic: this woman neither knows nor recommends such works.

502
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:50,035
Spiritual matters should indeed be discussed and taught without the physical, but those who receive them should embrace the spiritual and not act carnally.

503
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:51,270
Chapter 58 – Criticism.

504
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:57,447
It's a significant mistake to equate handmade images with the Ark of the Covenant, as was attempted in their synod.

505
01:20:57,447 --> 01:20:57,930
Response.

506
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:06,041
Referring to the treatise of Saint Augustine on Esau and Jacob, among other things: Two Testaments are mentioned in the Law, one Old and the other New.

507
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:10,607
The Old Testament had promises of a temporal nature but meanings that were spiritual.

508
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:11,950
Pay attention, dear ones.

509
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:17,858
If the land of promise was offered to the Jews, it signifies something spiritually about that land of promise.

510
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:25,270
If the city of peace, Jerusalem, was promised to the Jews, it signifies something about the name Jerusalem, and many other similar things.

511
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:33,381
As we previously noted in the same book of Saint Augustine, one thing is signified in many ways, which is not evident but understood through symbolism.

512
01:21:33,381 --> 01:21:34,617
Chapter 59 – Criticism.

513
01:21:34,617 --> 01:21:53,255
Images should not be equated with the relics of holy martyrs and confessors, as attempted in their erroneous synod, because relics are either part of the body, from things in the body, or from things around the body of a certain saint; whereas images are neither believed to have been nor to be in the body or around the body of those they depict.

514
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:53,738
Response.

515
01:21:53,738 --> 01:22:19,252
In the sacred councils of my most holy predecessor pontiffs, these testimonies were presented, particularly by Saint Gennadius, Bishop of Marseille, regarding the veneration of the bodies and relics of saints, chapter 40:
The bodies of the saints, especially the blessed relics, should be sincerely honored as if they were members of Christ, and the churches named after them, as places devoted to divine worship, should be visited with pious affection and faithful devotion.

516
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:23,818
If anyone opposes this decree, they should not be considered Christian, but Eunomian.

517
01:22:24,623 --> 01:22:41,046
Regarding the request made by the clergy and monks of the holy Church of Antioch against Severus the heretic during the holy Fifth Council:
He showed no respect for the holy altars, even tearing apart some of the most sacred vestments and vessels, and distributing the remaining items to those who sided with him.

518
01:22:41,046 --> 01:23:43,797
(In the council under Menas, act one)
He boldly seized the golden and silver doves, which were symbols of the Holy Spirit hanging above the sacred fonts and altars, along with the relics, claiming:
"It is not necessary to name the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove," and so on.
Chapter sixty – Reproach.
This assembly, which should not even be called a council, cannot in any way be compared to the Council of Nicaea, even though it occurred in the same location, as John the priest is said to have flattered:
It is known to differ from it not only in other aspects but also in the creed.
Response.
We have already mentioned above that the divine doctrines of this council are faultless, as evidenced by the wondrous works of the foremost holy Fathers.
If anyone claims to differ from the creed of the aforementioned council, they appear to differ from the creed of the six holy councils, since these did not speak of their own accord but through the constitutions of holy doctrines.
From the book of the holy Sixth Council, among other things (Act seventeen):
Indeed, this pious and orthodox symbol of divine grace was sufficient for the perfect knowledge and confirmation of the orthodox faith.

519
01:23:43,797 --> 01:23:55,392
But since the inventor of malice did not cease from the beginning, using the serpent as his tool to bring poisonous death to human nature through him:
So also now, finding instruments suited to his own will, and so forth.

520
01:23:55,392 --> 01:24:14,962
Also from the book of Saint Augustine on Prophecy, where he addresses the sheep, among other things:
"You pushed with your sides and shoulders, and struck with your horns, and crushed all that was weak until you scattered them abroad: and I will save my sheep."
As detestable as their iniquity and cruelty are, the mercy of our shepherd and our God is equally praiseworthy.

521
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,578
And a little later, it says: And over all the earth, your glory.

522
01:24:18,578 --> 01:24:21,063
The groom is in heaven, the bride is on earth.

523
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:24,035
He is above all the heavens, she is over all the earth.

524
01:24:24,035 --> 01:24:29,114
O heretic, do you believe in what you cannot see in heaven but deny what you can see on earth?

525
01:24:29,114 --> 01:24:32,789
Let her speak, then, let her voice be heard, let her save her sheep.

526
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:42,353
And I will save, he says, my sheep, and they will no longer be in ruin:
and I will judge between one sheep and another, and I will raise up over them one shepherd, and the rest.

527
01:24:42,353 --> 01:24:42,893
CHAPTER 1.

528
01:24:42,893 --> 01:24:43,487
--- Rebuke.

529
01:24:43,487 --> 01:24:51,809
Against those who say: Just as we have the books of Holy Scripture, we also have images for the memory of veneration, maintaining the purity of our faith.

530
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:52,295
Response.

531
01:24:52,295 --> 01:25:02,994
From Saint Gregory the Pope's letter to Serenus, the Bishop of Marseilles (Book 9, letter 9), among other things:
Tell me, brother, from which priest have you ever heard of doing what you have done?

532
01:25:02,994 --> 01:25:10,775
If nothing else, that should have held you back, so you would not consider yourself the only holy and wise one, disregarding the other brothers.

533
01:25:10,775 --> 01:25:16,989
For it is one thing to adore a painting, and another to learn from the story of a painting what ought to be adored.

534
01:25:16,989 --> 01:25:28,444
For what Scripture provides to those who read, the picture provides to the unlearned who see it:
because in the picture, the ignorant see what they ought to follow, and those who do not know the letters can read.

535
01:25:28,444 --> 01:25:36,009
Therefore, especially among the nations, the picture serves as reading: which you should have greatly attended to, living among the nations.

536
01:25:36,009 --> 01:25:43,195
And a little later: And because in venerable places of the saints, ancient times have allowed stories to be depicted for good reason.

537
01:25:43,195 --> 01:25:52,489
And again: Because the images, which were made for the edification of the unlearned, allow those who do not know the letters to learn by attending to the story itself, etc.

538
01:25:52,489 --> 01:26:08,105
Also, Sophronius, Bishop of Jerusalem, explained in his holy synodical letter, which was presented and wonderfully received at the holy Sixth Council, speaking about the Holy Spirit: Truly co-eternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial and co-equal, of the same essence and nature.

539
01:26:09,023 --> 01:26:21,792
In the same way, the Trinity of divinity is of the same essence, deserving equal honor, and is a natural and related companion, forming one divinity: unified into one common lordship, without personal confusion or substantial division.

540
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:25,975
Therefore, we believe in the Trinity in unity and glorify the Trinity as one.

541
01:26:25,975 --> 01:27:34,979
Also, from the letter of Saint Athanasius to Epictetus, among other things:
Those who are believed to have the correct faith according to the holy Fathers, but who wish to change something for inquiry's sake, end up doing nothing but, as it is written: "They indeed drink folly to their neighbor": they offer no benefit, only disrupting the simple-minded.
Also, from Saint Augustine's Book Seven on the Trinity, chapter six, among other things:
Let us speak of the three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, just as some are called three friends, or three relatives, or three neighbors, in relation to each other, not in isolation.
Thus, each is a friend, relative, or neighbor to the other two, because these terms are relational.
Also, from the same Saint Augustine's Book Eight on the Trinity, at the beginning, among other things:
There is such equality in the Trinity that not only is the Father not greater than the Son in divinity, but the Father and Son together are not greater than the Holy Spirit, nor is any individual person of the three less than the Trinity itself.
These ideas have been expressed, and even if repeated in various ways, become more familiar: yet a method should be applied, and God should be approached with utmost devotion.

542
01:27:35,087 --> 01:27:39,407
First Action
Chapter Four Critique

543
01:27:39,407 --> 01:27:42,770
In the first section of Chapter 4, we look at Archbishop Basil.

544
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:53,231
In his expression of faith, after acknowledging the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, he included the kissing and adoration of images and relics, claiming he believed in being sanctified through them.

545
01:27:53,231 --> 01:27:58,728
However, he entirely omitted the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, or the future life.

546
01:27:58,728 --> 01:28:00,436
Now, let's look at the response.

547
01:28:00,436 --> 01:28:08,334
Saint Ambrose, the Bishop of Milan, in Book 1, Chapter 2, on Faith, which he sent to Emperor Gratian, spoke orthodoxly about the Father and the Son.

548
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:15,059
He mentioned, among other things:
For there is the fullness of divinity in the Father and the fullness of divinity in the Son.

549
01:28:15,059 --> 01:28:19,809
He didn't mention the Holy Spirit because he was only focusing on the Father and the Son.

550
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:30,590
Basil, rejecting and condemning the heresy, made a confession of the true religion of the orthodox faith, showing reverence for sacred images and relics of the saints, which he previously misunderstood.

551
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:51,565
Regarding the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, or future life, he did not err, and he didn't contradict the orthodox faith of the holy catholic and apostolic Church in these aspects, unlike those pitiable and unfortunate heretics who attempted to belittle the images and relics of the saints, contemptuously rejecting and denying them along with the sacred images themselves.

552
01:28:51,565 --> 01:29:00,584
But woe to those who, by straying from the right path and walking through a misguided path full of obstacles, fell into the pit they created, and they will burn forever.

553
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:09,391
If we were to explore the veneration of the relics of the saints through the works of the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers, who could possibly document it all?

554
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:16,489
We briefly mention a few from the many writings of Saint Basil, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, in his interpretation of Psalm 115.

555
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:25,135
He noted, among other things, that previously, priests and Nazarenes were told that anyone who touched a dead body would be unclean and should wash their clothes.

556
01:29:25,775 --> 01:29:33,330
When someone touches the bones of the martyrs, they receive a portion of sanctification from the body, due to the grace present there.

557
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,769
The death of His saints is precious in the sight of the Lord.

558
01:29:36,769 --> 01:30:52,711
(Psalm 115)
In his sermon on the Letter of the Blessed Apostle Paul to the Romans, Sermon 32, Saint John Chrysostom, Bishop of Constantinople, said:
"This is why I love Rome.
Besides its greatness, antiquity, beauty, population, power, and military skill, I bless it most for this: Paul wrote to them while living, loved them deeply, spoke to them in person, and ended his earthly life there. They have his holy body, making the city more honorable than others.
Just as a great and strong body has two shining eyes, the sacred bodies of Peter and Paul are like two bright lamps of the Roman city, shining throughout the world.
From there, Paul and Peter will be taken.
Imagine the awe: what signs will Rome witness when Paul and Peter rise to meet Christ?
What gift does Rome present to Christ?
What crowns does the city hold?
What golden chains bind it?
What fountains does it possess?
I admire the city not for its gold, columns, or splendor, but for the extraordinary peaks of the supreme Church.
Who will grant me the honor of being near Paul's body, to cling to the sacred burial, and see the holy dust of his body, in which he imitated Christ, bore the marks of Christ, and spread the Gospel everywhere?
The dust of his body, through which he appeared everywhere?
The dust of his mouth, through which Christ was proclaimed, and light shone."

559
01:30:52,823 --> 01:31:05,911
From a sermon by Saint Augustine on the feast day of the holy apostles, among other things:
This most blessed Peter, a fisherman who wasn't even given the role of a caretaker but was the lowest servant, now has an emperor kneeling and worshiping him.

560
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:18,004
Also from Saint Augustine in the exposition of Psalm Forty-Five, among other things:
"The daughters of kings were delighted with your honor"
(Psalm Forty-Five); because they did not seek their fathers' honor, but sought your honor.

561
01:31:18,004 --> 01:31:22,454
Show me a temple in Rome held in as much honor as I can show you the memory of Peter.

562
01:31:22,454 --> 01:31:25,229
In Peter, who is honored but the one who died for us.

563
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:39,887
Also from a letter by Saint Gregory the Pope addressed to Eusebius, Bishop of Thessalonica
(Book Nine, Letter Sixty-Nine), among other things:
If Theodore the reader wishes to come here to pray to the saints at the apostles' place, let your brotherhood send him without any delay.

564
01:31:39,887 --> 01:31:45,122
And there are many other such testimonies that we foresee would be too lengthy to write out in full.

565
01:31:45,384 --> 01:31:49,752
In the Same Action Chapter Five Critique

566
01:31:49,752 --> 01:32:02,421
Theodosius, the bishop of Amorium, was criticized for being silent about the faith of the holy and unique Trinity, yet he spoke recklessly and unusually about images:
I confess, promise, accept, kiss, and adore images.

567
01:32:02,421 --> 01:32:15,380
And a little later: Anyone who does not diligently teach all the people beloved by Christ to adore and venerate the sacred and venerable images of all the saints who have pleased God since the beginning, let them be cursed.

568
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:15,904
Response.

569
01:32:15,904 --> 01:32:22,471
We believe that Theodosius, with zeal for the faith, confessed to such a speech as explained in their definition.

570
01:32:22,471 --> 01:32:36,418
We also find that our predecessors, specifically the most blessed pontiffs Gregory and Gregory, Zachary and Stephen, Paul, and again Stephen, were fervent in the Holy Spirit for the erection of sacred images, having zeal for the true faith.

571
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:53,098
For this reason, Lord Pope Gregory the Second, along with seventy-nine most holy bishops, presiding before the confession of the blessed Peter, the prince of the apostles, strengthened the testimonies of many holy Fathers and decided in their council to venerate and adore sacred images.

572
01:32:53,098 --> 01:33:09,428
Furthermore, our predecessor of holy memory, the late Lord Pope Stephen, also presiding with bishops from the regions of France and Italy in the basilica of Our Lord Jesus Christ the Savior, called the Constantinian, confirmed and embraced the venerable council of his predecessor.

573
01:33:09,428 --> 01:33:17,855
He, along with all the presiding bishops, adhering to the testimonies of the holy Fathers, decided to adore and venerate sacred images even more.

574
01:33:17,855 --> 01:33:25,526
Hence, the blessed Apostle Paul teaches, saying: Hold fast to the traditions you have received, from Second Thessalonians chapter 2.

575
01:33:25,526 --> 01:33:33,488
And again: But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you, let him be cursed.

576
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:41,217
As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be cursed, etc.

577
01:33:41,217 --> 01:33:42,786
, from Galatians chapter 1.

578
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:47,904
In the Third Action Chapter Six Critique

579
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:55,842
Theodore, the archbishop, childishly and absurdly claims in the statement of faith: "God is wonderful in his saints" (Psalm sixty-seven).

580
01:33:55,842 --> 01:34:05,576
He then adds: "To the saints who are on his earth, he has made all my desires wonderful among them" (Psalm fifteen), as if this verse directly follows the previous one.

581
01:34:05,576 --> 01:34:23,190
Response:
They try to falsely accuse in this way because the holy Church, when rising to sing praises to God in the morning, first says: "O Lord, you will open my lips" (Psalm fifty), followed by: "Come, let us exult in the Lord" (Psalm ninety-four): and thus it begins: "Blessed is the man" (Psalm one).

582
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:29,912
Similarly, the apostle Paul, while diligently listing the prophets, mentioned David after Jephthah, and then Samuel.

583
01:34:29,912 --> 01:34:39,530
We also find many works of the saints that first testify to the New and then to the Old Testament: however, no faithful person would mock such things because of this.

584
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:53,436
Moreover, Saint John Chrysostom, in his interpretation of the epistle of the blessed apostle Paul to the Hebrews (Homily seven), says among other teachings: "The Lord will not see, nor will the God of Jacob understand" (Psalm ninety-three).

585
01:34:53,436 --> 01:34:57,550
And again: "Our lips are our own; who is lord over us?" (Psalm eleven).

586
01:34:57,550 --> 01:35:00,969
And again: "Why has the wicked provoked God?" (Psalm nine).

587
01:35:00,969 --> 01:35:08,675
And again: "The fool has said in his heart: There is no God. They are corrupt, and they have done abominable works" (Psalm thirteen).

588
01:35:08,675 --> 01:35:26,405
Similarly, Saint John Chrysostom, in his interpretation of the epistle of the blessed apostle Paul to the Romans (Homily seven), notes that Matthew, when beginning the Gospel, first mentions both and then presents their ancestors in order, saying: "The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ" (Matthew one).

589
01:35:26,405 --> 01:35:37,820
He did not wait to mention Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but placed David before Abraham, which is notable, saying: "The son of David, the son of Abraham," and then he began to list them in order, etc.

590

In the First Action
Chapter Seven Critique

591
01:35:42,984 --> 01:36:39,888
There is a reproof for those who say, "With God's help, we decided to gather you," or, "God gathered you, wanting to establish his own council."
The response can be found at the end of the Gospel of Saint Mark, where it is written, "But they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following" Mark 16.
Also, Saint Cyril, in his sermon about the Holy Mother of God, says, "Indeed, glory to you from us, holy mystical Trinity, who has called these and all of us to this calling of the Mother of God, Mary," and so on.
Moreover, from the holy synod in the eighteenth action, after the subscriptions of the bishops and the emperor, Constantine, the most pious emperor, declared, "We bring forth God as a witness."
He continued, "Since it pleased God to grant time, we invited your gathering to consider the holy Scriptures of God and to expel any new voice or assertion added to our undefiled Christian faith in these recent times by some who hold wrong views," and so forth.

592
01:36:39,888 --> 01:36:44,304
In the Third Action, Chapter Eight: Critique.

593
01:36:44,304 --> 01:36:49,889
This section addresses those who claim that the honor given to an image is transferred to the original form.

594
01:36:49,889 --> 01:36:56,819
Response: Anyone arguing against this is contradicting Saint Basil's explanation in his Book on the Holy Spirit, Chapter Seventy-Five.

595
01:36:56,819 --> 01:37:00,749
We believe no faithful person would oppose him regarding his orthodox faith.

596
01:37:00,749 --> 01:37:06,179
Saint Basil explained this in his very sacred letter to Amphilochius, among other points in this chapter.

597
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:38,553
Additionally, Saint Severian, the bishop of Gabala, in a homily where he elucidated the Scriptures as explained by the Lord, said:
"If you insult the imperial garment, do you harm the one who wears it?
Don't you know that insulting the image of the emperor harms the dignity of the original form?
Don't you realize that if someone tears down an image from wood, they are judged not merely as one acting against lifeless matter, but as one who, by extending their hand against the emperor, defiles the material, separated from the emperor, without the emperor's soul?
For if an image is harmed, the injury reaches the emperor."

598
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:43,656
In the same proceeding. Chapter Nine: Critique.

599
01:37:43,656 --> 01:38:46,153
It's unfortunate, and perhaps rash or foolish, that Constantine, the bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, said:
"I receive and honorably embrace the holy and venerable images, offering them in worship to the substantial and life-giving Trinity.
To those who do not share this belief or glorify in this way, I separate them from the holy catholic and apostolic Church and subject them to anathema.
I consign them to the group of those who denied the incarnate and saving dispensation of Christ, our true God."
Response:
Turning away from the wrong heresy, they made every effort to satisfy the holy catholic and apostolic Church with their confession.
Thus, they professed belief in the worship of sacred images as established in the synod's definition, among other things.
(Acts Seven): To restore the venerable and holy images, which are appropriately made of colors, metal, and other materials in the holy churches of God, in sacred vessels, garments, on walls and panels, houses, and roads:
Including the images of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, of our undefiled lady the holy Mother of God, of the precious angels, and all the saints and just men.

600
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:53,387
As these are frequently seen through imagined reformation, those who behold them are inspired to remember and love the original form.

601
01:38:53,387 --> 01:39:00,730
They are to render a kiss and honorable greeting to them, but not in the form of worship which is reserved for the divine nature alone.

602
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:08,236
This is akin to the reverence shown to the sign of the precious and life-giving cross, the holy Gospels, and other sacred adornments, etc.

603
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,912
In the second action, Chapter Ten: Critique.

604
01:39:12,912 --> 01:39:24,716
It is noted that Euthymius, the bishop of Sardis, holds views similar to the error of the aforementioned Constantine when he states:
I wholeheartedly accept the venerated images, with appropriate honor and affectionate reverence.

605
01:39:24,716 --> 01:39:31,934
For I declare and announce as heretics those who think differently or oppose the holy images, considering them alien to the Catholic Church.

606
01:39:31,934 --> 01:39:32,397
Response.

607
01:39:32,397 --> 01:39:45,749
As mentioned above, according to the definition of the synod, they confess to making the pure confession of the Catholic Church, particularly where he says he wholeheartedly receives the venerated images and embraces them with appropriate honor and reverence.

608
01:39:45,749 --> 01:39:57,502
As stated in the synod's definition: Not at all according to our true faith, which is due only to the divine nature, but just like the sign of the precious and life-giving cross, and the holy Gospels, and other sacred ornaments.

609
01:39:57,502 --> 01:40:03,534
And so he said, with appropriate honor; and he promised to declare as heretics those contrary to the Catholic Church.

610
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:08,544
In the Fourth Action
Chapter 11 Critique

611
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:16,852
There's no authority or reference in any authentic books about the claim that someone was deterred from committing adultery by the image of a certain Polemon.

612
01:40:16,852 --> 01:40:23,057
They try to compare this to the miracle of the fringe of the Lord's garment, which a woman touched to receive healing.

613
01:40:23,057 --> 01:40:23,531
Response.

614
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:28,106
In this chapter, those who wrote these accounts aim to accuse and contradict the truth.

615
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:34,258
They cannot substantiate the claim that they dared to equate Polemon's miracle with the fringe of the Lord's garment.

616
01:40:34,258 --> 01:40:50,087
However, during the council, the miracle of Polemon's image was presented as evidence from the words of Saint Gregory the Theologian, who deliberately wrote a verse, which was individually addressed by Basil of Ancyra, Tarasius the Patriarch of Constantinople, and Nicephorus the Bishop of Dyrrachium.

617
01:40:50,087 --> 01:40:55,924
Bishop Basil indeed replied: Saint Gregory the God-speaking Father regarded the image of Polemon as remarkable.

618
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:59,184
The patriarch added: Indeed, chastity was achieved through it.

619
01:40:59,184 --> 01:41:04,443
For if the prostitute hadn't seen the image of Polemon, she wouldn't have turned away from adultery.

620
01:41:04,443 --> 01:41:11,490
Similarly, Bishop Nicephorus commented: A wonderful and very worthy image, as it was able to rescue a woman from the path of disgrace.

621
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:27,003
Following this, another reader read from the sermon of the blessed Bishop Antipater of Bostra on the flow of blood, where, after much explanation, the saint said: Having received the gift, she erected a monument to Christ, spending wealth on the poor and offering the remaining wealth to Christ.

622
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:37,362
After this, separately addressing the miracle of the woman with the flow, the patriarch responded: Just as she offers the image titled to Christ, just as the woman with the flow erected a monument.

623
01:41:37,362 --> 01:41:43,515
Similarly, Bishop Basil remarked: He instructs to speak properly and extensively and accepts those who create images.

624
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:50,772
However, your divinely inspired truthful excellence can have the council read in the fourth session to verify whether this is true or not.

625
01:41:51,456 --> 01:41:57,840
IN THE SIXTH ACTION. Third volume. CHAPTER 12. Critique.

626
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:18,085
Contrary to what some foolishly and irrationally believe, the lawgiver's words do not support the worship of images:
Behold, I have called by name Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding to work with gold and silver; and I have given him as a partner Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, etc.

627
01:42:18,085 --> 01:42:18,641
Exodus 31.

628
01:42:18,641 --> 01:42:19,141
Response.

629
01:42:19,141 --> 01:42:33,324
Our most holy predecessor, Lord Gregory II, junior pope, provided these solid examples in his sacred council, which was accepted and venerated in another council held by our predecessor, Lord Stephen the pope, along with the priests from France and Italy.

630
01:42:33,324 --> 01:42:51,623
In the presence of the most holy and blessed former Lord Gregory the pope himself, he also said:
If those with contrary opinions, who seek to invalidate the ancient traditions of the Fathers, were to convert to salvation, surely what we have already said based on the testimonies or sacred documents of the Fathers would suffice.

631
01:42:51,623 --> 01:43:07,418
However, because we, with sorrow, see many troubled minds attempting to disturb the established rules of the Church, we feel compelled, dear brothers, to extend the discourse and share more from ancient documents to restrain the madness of error: perhaps the restless will reconsider.

632
01:43:07,418 --> 01:43:18,153
In the book of Exodus, it states:
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring me offerings; from every person who offers willingly, you shall receive them.

633
01:43:18,153 --> 01:43:27,719
And these are the things you shall take, and so on, up to the two cherubim, which shall be above the ark of the testimony, all that I command you to the children of Israel.

634
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:28,275
Exodus 25.

635
01:43:28,275 --> 01:43:35,784
Another testimony from the third book of Kings, also known as First Kings, is cited to silence those who chatter against God's command.

636
01:43:35,784 --> 01:43:42,235
After Solomon constructed the temple, among other things, he made two cherubim of olive wood in the inner sanctuary.

637
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:47,883
Below, he carved images of cherubim, palm trees, and striking reliefs, all covered with gold.

638
01:43:47,883 --> 01:43:51,660
Everything, including the cherubim and palms, was overlaid with gold.

639
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,974
First Kings chapter six.

640
01:43:52,974 --> 01:43:59,160
Dearest brothers, let's consider what Moses did at God's command and what the wise Solomon built by divine order.

641
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:14,050
Shouldn't we, with pure hearts and minds, honor and adore Christ our God, who was depicted, along with His ever-virgin mother Mary, the apostles, and all the saints, through their holy images and likenesses, asking for their intercession for mercy and forgiveness of sins?

642
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:19,141
We create and venerate images for no reason other than the Word of God made incarnate for us.

643
01:44:19,141 --> 01:44:30,746
If all handmade things are to be rejected, then neither the Ark of the Covenant nor its golden, engraved cherubim should have been accepted, as they were crafted by Bezalel and Oholiab according to God's command.

644
01:44:30,746 --> 01:44:36,604
If those were accepted, then these images are also rightly accepted because they are made according to God.

645
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,505
Therefore, they, like the ark, perform many miracles.

646
01:44:39,505 --> 01:44:44,268
Just as the ark and the cherubim were lifeless, handmade, and carved, so too are these.

647
01:44:44,268 --> 01:44:53,191
But just as God worked through those and was glorified, these are made similarly, distinguished by colors according to the visions and revelations of the prophets.

648
01:44:53,191 --> 01:45:05,344
If anyone presumes to criticize the veneration proclaimed by our most holy predecessors, let them know that they taught such veneration as our predecessor, the illustrious teacher and pope Saint Gregory, did in his letter.

649
01:45:05,344 --> 01:45:10,763
This letter was presented at the aforementioned council by Herulph, bishop of the province of Gaul.

650
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:25,544
Among other things, he instructed Secundinus, a servant of God in Gaul, saying:
We know you do not request the image of our Savior to worship it as God, but for the remembrance of the Son of God, so that you may be rekindled in His love, whose image you consider seeing.

651
01:45:26,256 --> 01:45:29,075
We don't bow down to that Divinity as if it's a god.

652
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:35,255
Instead, we worship Him, remembering Him through the image, whether He is born, suffering, or sitting on a throne.

653
01:45:35,255 --> 01:45:39,321
The picture itself brings the Son of God to mind, just like a written word.

654
01:45:39,321 --> 01:45:44,092
It either fills us with joy about the resurrection or comforts us regarding the passion.

655
01:45:44,092 --> 01:45:51,465
So, we have sent you two cloths featuring the image of the Savior, Mary the holy Mother of God, and the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

656
01:45:51,465 --> 01:46:00,410
These are being sent with our aforementioned son, the deacon, along with a cross and a key for blessing from the most holy body of Peter, the prince of the apostles.

657
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:05,506
With these, you may be protected from the evil one, trusting in the holy wood for your safety.

In the fourth action, Chapter Thirteen. Critique

659
01:46:11,136 --> 01:46:21,140
The criticism was that Bishop Theodosius of Myra acted foolishly and childishly by presenting his archdeacon's dreams at the same synod to support the adoration of images.

660
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:27,693
Response: Who can doubt that in both the Old and New Testaments, the future was revealed to many through dreams?

661
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:32,666
To highlight the best example among many, we refer to Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.

662
01:46:32,666 --> 01:47:46,912
In his exposition on the holy martyrs Gervasius and Protasius, Book Seven, Letter Fifty-Three, he states:
"On the third night, after fasting, when my body was exhausted, not while sleeping but in a stupor, a third person appeared to me, resembling the blessed Apostle Paul, whose face I had learned from a painting," etc.
This testimony was presented by the most holy former Archbishop Sergius of the Church of Ravenna through his deacon John at the aforementioned council of holy memory of my predecessor, Lord Stephen, in support of the veneration of sacred images.
Similarly, Saint Gregory the Theologian, in the epitaph of his brother Caesarius, "Funeral Oration in Praise of Caesarius," near the end, states:
"Then I will see my Caesarius, never leaving, never returning, never lamented, never pitied, but splendid, glorious, exalted, just as you appeared to me in a vision."
This is dear to me, brother," etc.
Moreover, Saint Gregory the Pope, in his Dialogues, mentions certain most blessed men and religious women, along with young girls, who saw the holy Mother of God Mary and the chief apostles Peter and Paul, and the holy martyrs at their passing.
How did they recognize them except through paintings, as the blessed Ambrose, as we mentioned earlier, said?

663
01:47:47,088 --> 01:47:51,336
In the same action. Chapter 14. Critique

664
01:47:51,336 --> 01:47:57,420
There's a nonsensical and absurd claim about someone supposedly swearing an oath to a demon and then breaking it.

665
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:07,650
The abbey leader is known to have been quite delirious, suggesting it was better for him to visit every brothel in the city than to deny worshipping the image of the Lord or His holy mother.

666
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,134
Response.

667
01:48:08,134 --> 01:48:18,741
This testimony comes from the book of the eminent teacher Saint Sophronius, and we believe there is no orthodox Christian who would dare reject his divine teachings or any of his explanatory works.

668
01:48:18,741 --> 01:48:28,648
Similarly, Saint John Chrysostom, in discussing the beheading of Saint John the Baptist, among other things, emphasized the necessity of not forbidding the veneration of sacred images.

669
01:48:28,648 --> 01:48:38,178
Furthermore, in a letter from Saint Pope Gregory to Januarius, the bishop of Cagliari, as found in Book 7, Indiction 2, Letter 5, we have already addressed this issue in detail.

670
01:48:38,448 --> 01:48:42,984
In the Secon Action. Chapter 2 Critique

671
01:48:42,984 --> 01:48:53,959
Agapius, the bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, is criticized for making a statement considered useless, foolish, and worthy of ridicule because he said: It is written in our divine Scriptures.

672
01:48:53,959 --> 01:48:54,474
Response.

673
01:48:54,474 --> 01:48:59,675
It seems that the divine Scripture is preached by the faithful for the salvation of people.

674
01:48:59,675 --> 01:49:13,681
Therefore, we believe he intended to say: In our divine Scriptures, seeking to gain glory and honor from them, and simultaneously, to express what is taught by the same sacred Scripture, as is written in the works of the holy Fathers, and so on.

675
01:49:13,681 --> 01:49:25,571
Saint Augustine, in his treatise on the proverb of Solomon, stated among other things:
They also have our sacraments, they have our Scriptures, they have our Amen and Alleluia, many have our creed, and so on.

676
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:30,336
In the Fourth ActionChapter 3 Critique

677
01:49:30,336 --> 01:49:42,753
It's considered useless and foolish, full of error, to claim that anyone who fears God honors, worships, and venerates Him in the same way as Christ, the Son of God, our Lord, the sign of His cross, and the image of His saints.

678
01:49:42,753 --> 01:49:53,202
Response: From the book of Blessed Augustine about the son of Abraham being led to sacrifice, among other things:
You were not moved without reason when I mentioned this: The cross has horns.

679
01:49:53,202 --> 01:49:57,797
For two pieces of wood are joined in such a way that they form the shape of a cross.

680
01:49:57,797 --> 01:50:03,596
So, as we see in many places in the image of the cross, two horns are made, on which the hands are nailed.

681
01:50:03,596 --> 01:50:06,933
I see the crucified Lord in the ram caught by its horns, etc.

683
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:49,656
Here's what John mistakenly said:
"Through the image, which appears through colors, his strength is worshiped and glorified, and we come to remember his presence on Earth."
In response,
from the letter of Saint Gregory the Pope, Book Seven, Epistle Thirteen, addressed to Secundinus, a servant of God living in seclusion, we find:
"Your request for the image of the one you worship to be sent to you through your deacon Dulcitius greatly pleased us, because you seek with all your heart's intention the one whose image you wish to have before your eyes, so that the daily physical sight always brings the desired one closer."
"And while you see the painting, you are inflamed in your mind toward the one whose image you believe you are seeing, et cetera."

684
01:50:49,656 --> 01:50:54,024
In the Fifth Action Chapter Five Critique

685
01:50:54,024 --> 01:51:30,168
They say:
"He who disdains images is guilty of the same crime as Nebuchadnezzar, who disturbed the bones of the kings of Judah from their tombs, blinded the Jewish king after killing his sons, and removed the cherubim from the temple."
Response.
We have already mentioned in a letter from Pope Saint Gregory that images are not to be disdained, but venerated.
Therefore, our predecessors, the frequently mentioned most holy pontiffs, in sacred councils, made the following ruling:
"If anyone refuses to venerate the holy images of our Lord Jesus Christ, His mother, and all the saints, according to the teaching of the holy Fathers, let them be anathema."

686
01:51:30,168 --> 01:51:34,680
In the same action, Chapter Six, Critique.

687
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:45,822
According to Demetrius the deacon, their parents acted recklessly and disorderly by burning two silver-plated books because they contained something about images, and cutting out two pages from another book.

688
01:51:45,822 --> 01:51:54,057
Response: This is shown to be typical behavior of heretics, similar to their actions in the false council under the former heretical Emperor Constantine.

689
01:51:54,057 --> 01:52:04,500
In a letter from Saint Cyril to Bishop Successus of Neocaesarea, towards the end, he mentions:
Failing to counter these reproaches, they devised something bitter and worthy of heretical impiety.

690
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:13,543
They corrupted the letter by removing some parts and adding others, making it seem as though the memorable person shared similar views with Nestorius and his followers.

691
01:52:13,543 --> 01:52:25,385
Also, in the holy sixth council during the third action, it discusses:
The sermon of Menas, Archbishop of Constantinople, to the most blessed Pope Vigilius of Rome, concerning the belief that there is one will of Christ.

692
01:52:25,385 --> 01:52:32,382
The apostolic see's envoys from Rome protested, saying: Most pious lord, the present book of the fifth council has been falsified.

693
01:52:32,382 --> 01:52:42,017
It is also mentioned in the same holy sixth council, Act Eight, after the middle:
The holy sixth council stated: Behold, you have also destroyed this testimony of the holy Father.

694
01:52:42,017 --> 01:52:48,746
It is not fitting for the orthodox to mutilate the words of the holy Fathers in this way; this is rather typical of heretics.

695
01:52:48,746 --> 01:52:55,905
The heretic Macarius said: And I have already mentioned that in seeking to destabilize my intention, I have mutilated it in this way.

696
01:52:55,905 --> 01:53:00,211
The holy council exclaimed: He has clearly demonstrated himself to be a heretic.

697
01:53:00,696 --> 01:53:05,088
In the same action, Chapter 7 Critique.

698
01:53:05,088 --> 01:53:14,876
In this section, Leontius, the keeper of secrets, upon seeing images on silver tablets, claimed he had discovered the oldest and most ingenious benefit of his mistake.

699
01:53:14,876 --> 01:53:15,403
Response.

700
01:53:15,403 --> 01:53:50,042
Similarly, from the same holy Sixth Council, among other things, in Act 8, after the middle:
Constantine, the most pious emperor, and the holy synod said, "Let Macarius explain why he has removed these necessary things from the testimony of the holy and reputable Father."
Macarius, the heretic, replied, "I have taken excerpts according to my own intent."
And shortly after, the holy synod remarked, "Look, most gracious lord, he has also removed this testimony."
For after the testimonies are re-read by the order of your strength, they will show that his excerpts have obscured them, etc.

701
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:54,960
In the Emperor's Letter, Chapter 8: Critique.

702
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:05,625
Regarding what Constantine and Irene wrote in their letter to the venerable Pope of the city of Rome:
We ask your fatherhood, and especially God asks, who does not want anyone to perish.

703
01:54:05,625 --> 01:54:11,302
Response:
In the Holy Gospel, the Lord says: Simon, behold, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat.

704
01:54:11,302 --> 01:54:18,297
But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers, etcetera.

705
01:54:18,297 --> 01:54:18,871
(Luke 22).

706
01:54:18,871 --> 01:54:31,485
Also, in the letter of the blessed Apostle Paul, among other things:
For God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their sins against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.

707
01:54:31,485 --> 01:54:36,646
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us.

708
01:54:36,646 --> 01:54:39,914
We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

709
01:54:39,914 --> 01:54:41,233
(Second Corinthians 5).

710
01:54:41,233 --> 01:54:54,708
Also, Saint John Chrysostom in his sermon on the Ascension of the Lord, among other things:
Learn that it was not through our pleading, as we had offended him, but through his request, who was justly angry with us, that peace was made.

711
01:54:54,708 --> 01:55:00,844
For on behalf of Christ, says the Apostle, we serve as ambassadors, as though God were pleading through us.

712
01:55:00,844 --> 01:55:01,991
What does this mean?

713
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:04,112
Is he the one who was wronged asking?

714
01:55:04,112 --> 01:55:05,030
Indeed, he says.

715
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:08,699
For God is merciful, and like a compassionate father, he pleads.

716
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:17,301
And see who is the intermediary, who has approached as the reconciler, not an angel, not an archangel, but the very Son of the one pleading, etcetera.

717
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:26,762
Also, the same Saint John Chrysostom in the interpretation of the Letter to the Romans (Homily 5, towards the end), among other things:
What then after these things?

718
01:55:26,762 --> 01:55:38,517
No longer prophets, no longer angels, no longer patriarchs, but he sent his own Son: and he was killed, and he came himself, and even then did not extinguish love but kindled it more, and remains pleading.

719
01:55:38,517 --> 01:55:45,512
And below:
And Paul cries out, saying: For we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us.

720
01:55:45,512 --> 01:55:48,780
We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

721
01:55:48,780 --> 01:56:01,166
And shortly after:
Let us consider how many times we have offended him after a thousand good deeds, yet he persisted in pleading, how many times we have transgressed against him, yet he does not neglect us, etcetera.

722
01:56:02,256 --> 01:56:06,840
In the fourth action, Chapter Nine - Critique.

723
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:51,072
Regarding what John mentioned earlier: He wrestled with him in the form of a man and called him Israel, which means "a mind seeing God."
Response.
From the book of Saint Gregory the Theologian on divinity, Oration Two on Theology, after the middle, he notes:
For Jacob saw a high ladder.
And shortly after: And as though with a man, he wrestled with God.
And among other things: The struggle of faith was rewarded with a change of name, from Jacob to Israel, etc.
Also, from Saint Augustine about Jacob's wrestling with the angel, he states:
He held on and wrestled, as if wanting to embrace Jacob in a physical form, he said: Let me go physically, for behold, it is already morning, so that you may be spiritually enlightened, etc.

In the Same Action
Chapter 10 Critique

725
01:56:55,536 --> 01:57:16,566
It’s a misconception to think that those who say:
If, according to the lawful tradition of Moses, people are commanded to place purple hyacinth in the fringes on the edges of garments as a reminder to keep the commandments, then we should, even more so, use the depicted likeness of holy men to see the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith according to apostolic tradition.

726
01:57:16,566 --> 01:57:17,647
Hebrews, Chapter 13.

727
01:57:17,647 --> 01:57:18,620
Now, the response.

728
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:25,378
We believe you’re aware of what Pope Gregory the Great mentioned in his letter, Book 9, Letter 9, as we have written earlier.

729
01:57:25,378 --> 01:57:31,703
The wisdom of old times did not, without reason, permit the depiction of histories in the venerable places of saints.

730
01:57:31,703 --> 01:57:42,462
He further elaborated on this while discussing the sacred distinction of words during his interpretation of the prophet Ezekiel in Homily 10, at the beginning:
Sacred Scripture is our food and drink.

731
01:57:42,462 --> 01:57:48,084
And a little later:
For in more obscure matters, which can’t be understood unless explained, it is food.

732
01:57:48,084 --> 01:57:52,896
Because whatever is explained, so it can be understood, is almost chewed to be swallowed.

733
01:57:52,896 --> 01:57:54,842
But in clearer matters, it is drink.

734
01:57:54,842 --> 01:57:56,842
For we swallow drink without chewing.

735
01:57:56,842 --> 01:58:02,032
Therefore, we drink the clearer commands because we can understand them even when not explained.

736
01:58:02,032 --> 01:58:16,197
This was also clarified in the sacred councils by my very holy predecessors, the pontiffs, that among many things promulgated concerning old histories:
If indeed those were accepted, then these images are appropriately accepted as they are made according to God.

737
01:58:16,197 --> 01:58:17,927
Hence, they also have an effect.

In the Fourth Action
Chapter 11 Critique

739
01:58:23,328 --> 01:58:33,343
John the priest was mistaken when he defended the worship of images by saying that Joshua set up twelve stones as a memorial to God as mentioned in Joshua, chapter four.

740
01:58:33,343 --> 01:58:47,091
Response: In the book of Joshua, it is written that Joshua tore his clothes and fell face down to the ground before the ark of the Lord until evening, along with all of Israel, putting dust on their heads from Joshua, chapter seven.

741
01:58:47,091 --> 01:58:52,247
Shortly after, the Lord said to Joshua: Get up, why do you lie face down on the ground?

742
01:58:52,247 --> 01:58:56,277
Israel has sinned and broken my covenant from Joshua, chapter seven.

743
01:58:56,277 --> 01:59:02,440
And again shortly after: Get up, consecrate the people, and tell them: Be consecrated for tomorrow, etc.

744
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,040
from Joshua, chapter seven.

745
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:08,663
Behold, Joshua was heard when he lay prostrate before the ark of the covenant.

746
01:59:08,663 --> 01:59:30,530
From this, the eloquent holy teacher, Pope Gregory, in his letter Book 7, letter 53 which we discussed earlier, addressed to Secundinus, a servant of God secluded in Gaul, advised, saying: We do not prostrate ourselves before an image as if it were Divinity, but we worship Him whom we remember through the image, whether born, suffering, or sitting on the throne, etc.

747
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,182
Chapter 12.

748
01:59:31,182 --> 01:59:40,012
Criticism: The worship should not be considered equal to the reverence of the prophet Nathan toward King David, as compared to the worship of images.

749
01:59:40,012 --> 01:59:51,094
Response: From the book of Saint Gregory the Pope on Job Book 4, chapter 1 it is explained that when only the history is viewed in sacred scripture, nothing more than the surface is seen.

750
01:59:51,094 --> 01:59:58,028
But when we engage with it consistently, we penetrate its deeper meaning, as if from the familiarity of conversation.

751
01:59:58,028 --> 02:00:05,554
By connecting one thing to another, we easily recognize the difference between what the words imply and what they directly say.

752
02:00:05,554 --> 02:00:11,954
However, one becomes a stranger to its deeper understanding the more one is bound to its surface alone, etc.

753
02:00:11,954 --> 02:00:20,429
Similarly, in the same book, it mentions: What is represented by David, who is interpreted as strong or desirable in hand, if not our Redeemer?

754
02:00:20,429 --> 02:00:23,332
What is signified by his gift, if not the Church?

755
02:00:23,332 --> 02:00:31,451
And shortly after: The inquiry into the Lord's divinity is like a hidden spring; but the appearance of His incarnation is an open spring.

756
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:38,056
What is meant by Jerusalem, which is interpreted as the vision of peace, if not the holy Church itself?

757
02:00:38,056 --> 02:01:32,753
In the heart of the world, they contemplate the Lord, about whom it is written:
"He is our peace, who made the two one," etcetera.
Ephesians Chapter Two.
Chapter Thirteen.
Reproof. The opinion of John of Constantinople, which is cited as evidence for the worship of images, is not understood to mean what they think.
Response.
Many statements by Saint John of Constantinople are referenced in the frequently mentioned synod, and they did not specify which statements do not align with their beliefs.
In the councils of our holy predecessor pontiffs, the opinion of Saint John Chrysostom is presented as follows, among other things:
"All things serve you, man, but even more so the image; because when imperial faces and images enter the city, the judges and senate greet them with praise and fear, not honoring the panel or the writing on the wax, but the face of the emperor.
In the same way, let us honor not the appearance of the lands, but the heavenly face of the world of people," etcetera.

In the Fourth Action
Chapter Fourteen Critique

759
02:01:37,488 --> 02:01:44,073
In Chapter 14, the judges present at the council attempted arrogantly and inappropriately to elevate the art of painting.

760
02:01:44,073 --> 02:02:58,313
They stated, "The art of the painter is indeed pious, and some people criticize it foolishly and wrongly. The Father Himself commends the painter who acts piously."
In response, Blessed Asterius is revered as holy throughout the East.
When he preached about the deeds of Saint Euphemia, he praised her martyrdom as he had seen it clearly depicted in order.
Similarly, they praised the painting against heretics, noting that they criticize it foolishly.
Saint Gregory the Theologian, in his sermon on blessed Gregory of Nyssa, says:
"Do you think these are enough, or shall a brief discourse also describe the man to us?
If necessary, just as diligent painters often mix colors, I will add the perfect form of speech for you, and describe to you the purest and clearest."
Similarly, Saint John Chrysostom, in his sermon at the Lord's Supper, explains:
"Just as painters shade a panel with certain outlines before perfecting it with a variety of colors, so did Christ.
At the table, He depicted the types of the Passover and revealed the true Passover."
Also, from the book of Saint Augustine on the Proverb of Solomon:
"Our mouth is open to you, O Corinthians."
He attentively opened his mouth and set the order of his tongue, praising the creature as a creature, the Creator as the Creator, angels as angels, heavenly things as heavenly, earthly things as earthly.

761
02:02:58,368 --> 02:03:03,144
In the same action, Chapter 15: Critique.

762
02:03:03,144 --> 02:03:11,202
John, the priest and envoy of the Easterners, makes a misleading and worthless statement, claiming that painters do not contradict the Scriptures.

763
02:03:11,202 --> 02:03:17,494
Instead, he says, they depict whatever the Scripture conveys, ensuring that their work aligns with the Scriptures.

764
02:03:17,494 --> 02:03:39,462
Response: We've already discussed several times above how the holy Gregory, the esteemed teacher and pope, through his sacred letter to Serenus, bishop of Marseille, taught, among other things:
Book nine, letter nine:
He suggested that paintings of images were created to educate unlearned individuals, so that those who cannot read might understand the stories by viewing the images, and so forth.

765
02:03:39,462 --> 02:03:48,735
Additionally, Saint John Chrysostom, in his interpretation of Psalm fifty, says:
Painters use art to imitate nature, blending colors to create visible images of bodies.

766
02:03:48,735 --> 02:03:58,229
He continues, describing how they portray an emperor seated, a subdued barbarian, a sharp sword, flowing rivers, fields adorned with various colors, and everything visible.

767
02:03:58,229 --> 02:04:02,700
Through their artistry, they present a marvelous story to the viewers, and so on.

768
02:04:02,976 --> 02:04:09,528
In the fifth action, it was found in the fourth. Chapter 16: Critique.

769
02:04:09,528 --> 02:04:17,748
The extremely false and utterly ridiculous statement of John the priest, who seems to have been as crazed as the others in the worship of images.

770
02:04:17,748 --> 02:04:51,366
For he says: "Whoever worships an image and says, 'This is Christ, the Son of God,' does not sin."
Response from Saint Augustine in his explanation of Psalm 86, after the beginning, among other things:
Almost all physical bodies have limitations and cannot be everywhere or always.
However, divinity, which is present everywhere, can be approached from all sides by likeness and can be entirely present in likenesses, because none of them are in their own properties.
Is Christ a door in the same way we see doors made by a carpenter?
Certainly not, and yet he said: "I am the door" (John 10).

771
02:04:51,366 --> 02:04:55,278
Or is he a shepherd in the same way we see those who tend sheep, etc.

772
02:04:55,392 --> 02:05:00,432
From the Sense. Chapter 17. Critique

773
02:05:00,432 --> 02:05:08,440
Those books, the Lives of the Fathers, whose authors are unknown, are not entirely suitable for providing testimony or supporting arguments in debates.

774
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:08,918
Response.

775
02:05:08,918 --> 02:05:21,647
In the book of Saint Augustine on the Questions in the Gospel according to Luke, it is mentioned: His vessels in the house are the fleshly senses by which many, in their quest for truth that the intellect comprehends, have completely erred.

776
02:05:21,647 --> 02:05:25,996
The Lives of the Fathers, lacking credible authors, are seldom read in the Church.

777
02:05:25,996 --> 02:05:29,868
However, those works endorsed by the orthodox are both accepted and read.

778
02:05:29,868 --> 02:05:36,763
Furthermore, the sacred canons have allowed the reading of the passions of the holy martyrs in the church during their feast days.

779
02:05:36,763 --> 02:05:37,346
Chapter 18.

780
02:05:37,346 --> 02:05:37,876
Criticism.

781
02:05:37,876 --> 02:05:43,764
Those who create images to avoid forgetting the saints, or even the Lord Himself, do not possess a good memory.

782
02:05:43,764 --> 02:05:44,241
Response.

783
02:05:44,241 --> 02:05:53,629
In Saint Jerome's commentary on Matthew the Evangelist, it is noted: People like this, while attempting to criticize another's ignorance, reveal their own lack of understanding.

784
02:05:53,629 --> 02:06:37,120
Even though thin moisture and liquid food, once digested and processed in the veins and limbs, travel through the hidden channels of the body, known to the Greeks as "pores," to the lower parts and are expelled.
Additionally, from Saint Augustine's interpretation of Psalm Ninety-Eight: Zion is referred to as the city, which is Jerusalem.
Zion receives its name from a certain interpretation, as it is said to mean a lookout, implying vision and contemplation.
To look out is to look forward, or to see, or to focus with the intent of seeing.
Zion is every soul that aims to see the light that is meant to be seen. For if it looks at itself, it becomes darkened; if it gazes at that light, it becomes illuminated.
Since it is evident that Zion is the city of God, what else could the city of God be but the holy Church?

785
02:06:37,704 --> 02:06:39,487
Question. Chapter nineteen.

786
02:06:39,487 --> 02:06:51,048
Can someone point out where, in either the Old or New Testament, or within the six synodal councils, it is instructed to create images or to worship those that already exist?

787
02:06:51,048 --> 02:07:00,686
As we've already mentioned, both the Old and New Testaments, along with the six synodal councils, have always revered sacred images, considering them among the holy of holies.

788
02:07:00,686 --> 02:07:05,973
They should have informed us about any criticism of sacred images in those six synodal councils.

789
02:07:05,973 --> 02:07:18,915
In the first holy council, it was clearly demonstrated that Saint Sylvester, the pope, and Constantine, the most Christian emperor, both venerated sacred images and displayed them faithfully and wonderfully in the name of Christianity.

790
02:07:18,915 --> 02:07:29,875
From that time to now, the churches of the holy pontiffs, namely Sylvester, Mark, and Julius, of remarkable size, have been depicted among us, adorned with sacred images in mosaics and other artwork.

791
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:40,670
Similarly, in the second holy council, the elegant Pope Saint Damasus created his own church, which Saint Gregory the Pope mentions in the Dialogues, and it bears the name of its founder, Damasus.

792
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:44,635
From then until now, it has been painted with sacred stories and images.

793
02:07:44,635 --> 02:07:49,371
In the third holy council, Pope Saint Celestine decorated his cemetery with paintings.

794
02:07:49,371 --> 02:07:57,357
Additionally, his successor, the blessed Pope Sixtus, built the basilica of Saint Mary, Mother of God, known as Major, also called at the Manger.

795
02:07:57,357 --> 02:08:01,267
He adorned it with sacred images in golden metals and various artworks.

796
02:08:01,267 --> 02:08:15,972
At his request, Augustus Valentinian created a golden image with twelve gates and the Savior, adorned with precious gems, which he placed in gratitude over the confession of the blessed Apostle Peter, and it has been venerated by all the faithful among us ever since.

797
02:08:15,972 --> 02:08:25,225
In the fourth holy council, the distinguished and remarkable preacher, Pope Saint Leo, also built churches, decorating them with mosaics and various artworks or images.

798
02:08:25,776 --> 02:08:36,167
In the basilica of Saint Paul the Apostle, he created a larger arch and depicted our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in mosaic, along with the twenty-four elders, adorning it with verses in his name.

799
02:08:36,167 --> 02:08:39,507
From that time until now, it has been faithfully revered by us.

800
02:08:39,507 --> 02:08:48,732
Regarding the Fifth Ecumenical Council, Pope Vigilius beautifully adorned the Lateran Patriarchal Basilica with paintings, featuring both historical scenes and sacred images.

801
02:08:48,732 --> 02:09:00,184
His holy successors, Pelagius and John, constructed a remarkably large church for the apostles, decorating it with various mosaic stories and colorful sacred images, which have been revered by us from then until now.

802
02:09:00,184 --> 02:09:07,076
Pope Gregory also created a beautiful oratory in his monastery, painting it with various stories and erecting sacred images there.

803
02:09:07,076 --> 02:09:16,407
Together with Saint Eleutherius, he entered there for his stomach ailment, and their prayers were heard together, as mentioned in Book Three of Dialogues, Chapter Thirty-Three.

804
02:09:16,407 --> 02:09:25,367
The holy man Eleutherius, known for raising the dead, did not hesitate to prostrate himself before those sacred images, praying for divine mercy alongside Saint Gregory.

805
02:09:25,367 --> 02:09:30,085
With perfect faith, they were heard together, and they have been revered by us until now.

806
02:09:30,085 --> 02:09:38,939
The church of the Arians, mentioned by Saint Gregory in his Dialogues, Book Three, Chapter Thirty, was pleasing to Saint Gregory to be dedicated in the Catholic faith.

807
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:44,718
The relics of Saint Sebastian and Saint Agatha the martyrs were brought there, and the dedication took place.

808
02:09:44,718 --> 02:09:55,533
After a miracle occurred in the church, the blessed Gregory had it painted with various stories, both in mosaic and colors, and erected venerable images there, which have been revered from then until now.

809
02:09:56,064 --> 02:10:09,985
If we were to list all the churches our predecessors, the popes, have built up to now, with their magnificent sacred images and painted stories, we would run out of time to name them all and describe their sacred artworks and tales.

810
02:10:09,985 --> 02:10:16,226
In the Sixth Holy Council, not only did they not ignore these sacred images, but they also revered them.

811
02:10:16,226 --> 02:10:23,907
They decreed, as stated in Canon 82, that the Lamb of Christ, our God, should be depicted in human form, replacing the old lamb.

812
02:10:23,907 --> 02:10:34,408
Therefore, Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, in the third book on Faith, Chapter 7, taught: Let us uphold the teachings of our elders and not recklessly alter inherited symbols.

813
02:10:34,408 --> 02:10:43,889
Neither elders, powers, angels, nor archangels dared to open the sealed prophetic book from Revelation Chapter 5; only Christ had the privilege to explain it.

814
02:10:43,889 --> 02:10:50,790
Who among us would dare to unseal the priestly book, sealed by confessors and consecrated by the martyrdom of many?

815
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:55,171
Those who were forced to unseal it later signed it with condemned deceit.

816
02:10:55,171 --> 02:10:58,891
Those who refused to violate it became confessors and martyrs.

817
02:10:58,891 --> 02:11:02,552
How can we deny the faith of those whose victory we proclaim?

818
02:11:02,552 --> 02:11:04,832
Let no one fear, let no one be afraid.

819
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:12,813
If the heretics had not attacked the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, the six holy synodal councils would not have been necessary.

820
02:11:12,813 --> 02:11:23,614
Similarly, if the Church had not been attacked by the heretical emperors Leo and Constantine over sacred images, my most holy predecessors, the popes, would not have held councils.

821
02:11:23,614 --> 02:11:33,815
Nor would we have agreed to do so later, if not for the sake of so many thousands of souls endangered in the devil's snare, remaining in heresy and perishing daily in it.

822
02:11:34,536 --> 02:11:49,094
As defined by the holy Fourth Council, those who speak the true faith declared:
We must passionately uphold the faith handed down to us by our ancestors and maintain the unblemished dignity of proper veneration for the blessed apostle Peter, especially in our times.

823
02:11:49,094 --> 02:11:58,890
This ensures that the most blessed bishop of Rome, to whom history has granted leadership of the priesthood over all, may have the authority to judge matters of faith and priests.

824
02:11:58,890 --> 02:12:10,603
Therefore, our most holy predecessor, Pope Gregory the Younger, wrote to the heretical emperors Leo and Constantine, saying:
For sacred images, we are willing to offer everything, even our own bodies, if necessary.

825
02:12:10,603 --> 02:12:15,419
We never accept novelty, nor do we deviate from the faith of our fathers for any reason.

826
02:12:15,419 --> 02:12:22,260
The divine voice warns, which must be heeded above all:
If anyone gains the whole world but loses his soul, he gains nothing.

827
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:25,653
This is from the Gospel according to Matthew, chapter sixteen.

828
02:12:25,653 --> 02:12:44,316
Again, in another letter concerning these sacred images, he reasonably rebuked them, saying among other things:
Pope Gelasius, in letter 10 to Emperor Anastasius, stated:
It is recorded that a most learned and venerable Father said there are two principal powers governing this world, namely the sacred authority of pontiffs and royal power.

829
02:12:44,316 --> 02:12:50,118
The responsibility is heavier for priests because they must account for even kings before divine judgment.

830
02:12:50,118 --> 02:13:11,517
Therefore, no one can make us transgress the boundaries set by our fathers or impose new doctrines:
By remaining in the orthodox faith we have received and embracing ancient tradition, we undoubtedly venerate and uphold the councils of our most holy predecessors, the pontiffs, regarding sacred images, without accepting any contrary speech from anyone on this matter, nor giving an account.

831
02:13:11,517 --> 02:13:18,851
The holy Gregory, the eloquent doctor, emphasized the importance of maintaining these traditions in his homily on the prophet Ezekiel.

832
02:13:19,344 --> 02:14:21,930
While discussing the understanding of sacred words over time, he added:
"Many will pass through, and knowledge will be manifold" Daniel 12.
The holy fathers, whom we know through sacred scripture, were saved in the knowledge of one God before the law. They possessed perfect obedience in their simple lives and often saw angels, thus experiencing a bit of contemplation.
However, once the law was given, the holy fathers were also taught through the Ten Commandments, so that through the knowledge of one God, they also practiced the works of the law.
But with the grace brought by the New Testament, all faithful people recognized that one God is a Trinity and completed the strength of the Ten Commandments in this knowledge.
Hence, we must understand that the knowledge of the spiritual fathers grew over time.
For Moses was more learned than Abraham, the prophets more than Moses, and the apostles more than the prophets in the knowledge of the almighty God.
I would be mistaken if I didn't support these claims with the testimonies of scripture itself.
"Many will pass through, and knowledge will be manifold," he says (Daniel 12).

833
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:29,037
But let's illustrate, if we can, what we said about Abraham, Moses, prophets, and apostles from the words of that same scripture.

834
02:14:29,037 --> 02:14:31,572
Who does not know that Abraham spoke with God?

835
02:14:31,572 --> 02:15:16,418
Yet the Lord says to Moses: "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: but I did not reveal my name, Adonai, to them" Exodus 3 and 6.
Behold, more was revealed to Moses than to Abraham, as he revealed to Moses what he narrates he did not reveal to Abraham.
But let us see if the prophets could comprehend divine knowledge more than Moses.
Behold, the Psalmist says: "How I love your law, Lord! It is my meditation all day long" Psalm 119; and adds: "I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation."
And again: "I understand more than the elders."
Therefore, he who remembers meditating on the law and testifies that he understands more than all his teachers and more than the elders, demonstrates that he received divine knowledge more than Moses.

836
02:15:16,584 --> 02:15:21,598
However, how can we demonstrate that the holy apostles were taught more than the prophets?

837
02:15:21,598 --> 02:15:35,582
Truth clearly states:
"Many kings and prophets wanted to see what you see, and did not see it."
(Luke 10)
The apostles possessed more divine knowledge than the prophets because what the prophets heard in spirit, the apostles also witnessed physically.

838
02:15:35,582 --> 02:15:48,564
Thus, the prophecy of Daniel that we mentioned is fulfilled:
"Many will pass through, and knowledge will be greatly increased."
(Daniel 12)
As the world approaches its end, the path to eternal knowledge opens wider for us, and so on.

839
02:15:48,564 --> 02:16:26,784
Similarly, Saint Gregory, in his commentary on Job, Book 4, Chapter 10, says:
"Holy teachers, who instruct others in virtue, conquer enemies by transforming them within their own bodies through the power of conversion.
They subject them to the stones of a sling, because when they train strong men in the holy Church, they break the hard hearts of arrogant adversaries through them."
What does the sling represent if not the holy Church?
Just as a sling, when spun around, sends out stones to strike the hearts of adversaries, the holy Church, as it is guided through the cycles of time by tribulations, brings forth strong men from whom the stony blows strike the hearts of the wicked.

840
02:16:26,952 --> 02:16:32,088
In the seventh action, Chapter 20 — Critique.

841
02:16:32,088 --> 02:16:37,425
How the mystery of the Lord's cross differs from the images that some try to equate with it.

842
02:16:37,425 --> 02:16:47,811
Response from Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, from the book on the Incarnation, Chapter 7:
Among other things: Do we divide Christ when we worship both his divinity and his flesh?

843
02:16:47,811 --> 02:16:51,988
Do we divide him when we venerate in him the image of God and the cross?

844
02:16:51,988 --> 02:18:10,721
Surely the Apostle, who said about him, quote: "For even though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God," in Second Corinthians, Chapter 13, also said: "Is Christ divided?" in First Corinthians, Chapter 1.
Also, from the same Saint Ambrose in the book on Faith, Chapter 4:
Among other things: The Apostle speaks of an image, and Arius says it is dissimilar?
Why call it an image if it has no likeness?
People do not want paintings to be dissimilar, yet Arius claims the Father is dissimilar in the Son.
And shortly after: The prophets say, quote: "For he is the brightness of eternal light, the spotless mirror of God’s majesty, and the image of his goodness," from the Book of Wisdom, Chapter 7.
Also, from the letter of Saint Gregory the Pope sent to Leontius, former consul, Book 7, letter 34:
Among other things: We have received the oil of the holy cross and the wood of aloes: one to bless by touch, the other to give a pleasant fragrance through incense.
Therefore, it was fitting for a good man to send things that could appease the Lord’s wrath towards us.
And shortly after:
Furthermore, we sent you the blessing of Saint Peter, the prince of the apostles, and the key of his most sacred tomb, in which the blessing from his chains is included, so that what bound his neck for martyrdom may release yours from all sins.

845
02:18:10,896 --> 02:18:17,352
It discusses what Constantine and Irene assert in their writings: Through Him, who reigns with us, God.

846
02:18:17,352 --> 02:18:26,316
Here's the response from the Proverbs of Solomon, among other insights:
Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and strength.

847
02:18:26,316 --> 02:18:29,638
By me kings reign, and lawmakers decree what is just.

848
02:18:29,638 --> 02:18:32,898
By me princes rule, and the powerful decree justice.

849
02:18:32,898 --> 02:18:34,465
I love those who love me.

850
02:18:34,465 --> 02:18:35,782
(Proverbs Chapter 8).

851
02:18:35,782 --> 02:18:42,175
And after many reflections:
Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is upheld by mercy, etc.

852
02:18:42,552 --> 02:18:47,232
IN THE FOURTH ACTION. CHAPTER 22. Critique.

853
02:18:47,232 --> 02:18:57,673
There's a misunderstanding about the phrase: You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only, as if it refers to worship and service in an absolute sense, directed only to Him.

854
02:18:57,673 --> 02:18:58,184
Response.

855
02:18:58,184 --> 02:19:10,101
Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, in the fifth book on Faith, says:
When we read: You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only Matthew 16, do they believe that Christ should not be worshiped or served?

856
02:19:10,101 --> 02:19:29,338
If the Canaanite woman, who worshiped Him, was deemed worthy of receiving what she requested, and Paul the Apostle, who declared himself a servant of Christ in the introduction of his writings, Romans 1; Galatians 1, was worthy of being an apostle, not by men or through man, but through Jesus Christ, let them decide which path to follow.

857
02:19:29,338 --> 02:19:48,575
Would they rather align with Arius in his treachery, denying that Christ is the one true God because they believe He should neither be worshiped nor served, or would they prefer to side with Paul, who, by serving and worshiping even Christ, did not deny in word or feeling that He was the one true God, whom he honored with devout service?

858
02:19:48,575 --> 02:20:01,684
But if anyone argues, Because the Son also worships God the Father, as it is written: You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know John 4, let them reflect on when, before whom, and with what intention they speak, etc.

859
02:20:01,968 --> 02:20:07,200
IN THE SAME ACTION. CHAPTER 23 Critique

860
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:15,201
Even though God isn't confined to any specific place, some have mistakenly claimed: We honor and worship as if it were the dwelling of God.

861
02:20:15,201 --> 02:20:15,719
Response.

862
02:20:15,719 --> 02:20:25,677
Blessed Augustine, in his commentary on Psalm 86, mentions:
The foundation, as the Apostle says, cannot be laid by anyone except what is already laid, which is Christ Jesus.

863
02:20:25,677 --> 02:20:27,289
First Corinthians chapter 3.

864
02:20:27,289 --> 02:20:30,109
So how are the prophets and apostles foundations?

865
02:20:30,109 --> 02:20:32,872
And how is Christ Jesus the ultimate foundation?

866
02:20:32,872 --> 02:20:41,392
We can understand this by noting that, as it is clearly stated, the Holy of Holies, Daniel chapter 9, is figuratively the foundation of foundations.

867
02:20:41,392 --> 02:20:53,365
Therefore, if you consider sacraments, Christ is the Holy of Holies; if you consider the followers, Christ is the shepherd of shepherds; if you consider the structure, Christ is the foundation of foundations.

868
02:20:53,365 --> 02:21:06,028
And further on, he continues:
But divinity, which is present everywhere, can be approached from all directions by likeness, and can be fully represented in likenesses, because none of these is in its own properties, etc.

869
02:21:06,028 --> 02:21:16,677
Similarly, in Saint Augustine's second book on the Trinity, Chapter 17, he says:
What does it mean when the Lord says: Behold, there is a place with me, and you shall stand on the rock?

870
02:21:16,677 --> 02:21:17,714
Exodus chapter 33.

871
02:21:17,714 --> 02:21:22,261
What earthly place is with the Lord, except that which reaches Him spiritually?

872
02:21:22,261 --> 02:21:28,708
For what place is not with the Lord, who reaches from end to end mightily, and arranges all things sweetly, etc.

873
02:21:28,708 --> 02:21:29,687
Wisdom chapter 8.

874
02:21:29,687 --> 02:21:36,364
Also, from Saint John Chrysostom on the sermon of Saint Paul the Apostle, where he states:
What I want, I do not do.

875
02:21:36,364 --> 02:21:37,342
Romans chapter 7.

876
02:21:37,342 --> 02:21:46,955
And since Jacob became a figure of Christ, among other things:
He came amidst the rivers, and when he saw the dream, he said: This is none other than the house of God.

877
02:21:46,955 --> 02:21:48,049
Genesis chapter 28.

878
02:21:48,049 --> 02:21:50,639
For you did not see a building, but a ladder.

879
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:57,432
But because he knew that the ladder was a symbol of the Church, he said: This is the house of God, this is the Church.

880
02:21:57,432 --> 02:21:59,734
And why is this house of God the Church?

881
02:21:59,734 --> 02:22:02,670
Paul writes to Timothy:
I hope to come to you soon.

882
02:22:02,670 --> 02:22:09,750
But if I am delayed, you will know how to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, etc.

883
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:11,132
First Timothy chapter 3.

884
02:22:12,456 --> 02:22:17,232
In the same action, Chapter 25: Critique.

885
02:22:17,232 --> 02:22:26,871
It's mentioned that Solomon made bulls and lions in the temple, and some argue that this could support the worship of images, as those who are eager for such worship claim.

886
02:22:26,871 --> 02:22:31,131
There's also the reference in Ezekiel: Faces and cherubim up to the ceiling.

887
02:22:31,131 --> 02:22:31,747
Ezekiel 41.

888
02:22:31,747 --> 02:22:32,252
Response.

889
02:22:32,252 --> 02:22:40,827
We have often recorded these chapters, showing how our most holy predecessors, the popes, in their sacred councils, established the veneration of images.

890
02:22:40,827 --> 02:22:45,199
It's clear that their apostolic guidance should be observed and revered by us.

891
02:22:45,199 --> 02:22:54,951
Also, from the book of Saint Augustine on Psalm 84, among other things:
In the Old Testament, the New Testament was foreshadowed, and this expression of truth was prefigured.

892
02:22:54,951 --> 02:23:02,461
In that figure, according to a certain prophecy of future things, the land was given to those people, called the land of promise, etc.

893
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:14,959
From the book of Saint Augustine on Questions in the Gospel according to Luke, Book 2, question 41, among other things:
The Lord says: He who is on the roof, and his belongings in the house, should not go down to take them.

894
02:23:14,959 --> 02:23:15,407
Luke 17.

895
02:23:15,407 --> 02:23:20,115
On the roof is he who, cutting off carnal things, lives spiritually in the open air.

896
02:23:20,115 --> 02:23:31,885
And shortly after: Therefore, this spiritual man's belongings are left in the house because, with a mind superior to the body, seated as if on a roof, he enjoys the clarity of wisdom like the clearest sky, etc.

897
02:23:31,885 --> 02:23:33,118
Chapter 26: Criticism.

898
02:23:33,118 --> 02:23:54,920
The last chapter is so that the lord apostolic and our Father, and the entire Roman Church, may know that according to what is contained in the letter of the most blessed Gregory, Book 7, letter 9, which he sent to Serenus, Bishop of Marseille:
We allow images of the saints to be created by anyone who wishes, both in the church and outside the church, for the love of God and his saints.

899
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:58,507
However, we do not compel those who do not wish to worship them.

900
02:23:58,507 --> 02:24:03,383
We also do not permit anyone to break or destroy them, even if someone wishes to do so.

901
02:24:04,224 --> 02:24:11,951
We openly declare that we follow the beliefs of the most holy Gregory in this letter, which pleases the universal Catholic Church in the eyes of God.

902
02:24:11,951 --> 02:24:17,241
This sacred and venerable chapter stands out significantly from all the previously mentioned chapters.

903
02:24:17,241 --> 02:24:27,872
Therefore, we recognize it as the rightful property of your God-preserved and orthodox royal excellence, wherein the full essence of the correct faith is entirely confessed to follow the most holy Gregory.

904
02:24:27,872 --> 02:24:43,897
Your exceedingly excellent royal knowledge recalls that in Pope Gregory's letter to Bishop Serenus of Marseille, it is reported, among other things, where he admonishes the bishop, saying:
It is one thing to worship a painting, and another to learn, through the story of the painting, what is to be worshiped.

905
02:24:43,897 --> 02:24:54,529
For what writing provides to readers, a painting provides to those who see it:
because even the ignorant can see what they ought to follow in the painting, and those who cannot read can understand from it.

906
02:24:54,529 --> 02:25:02,101
Hence, especially for the nations, a painting serves as a form of reading; something you should have greatly considered, living among the nations.

907
02:25:02,101 --> 02:25:08,635
And a little later: And because the old times allowed stories to be painted in places venerable to the saints for good reason.

908
02:25:08,635 --> 02:25:18,126
Further on: Because the images were made for the education of unlearned people, so that those who do not know letters might learn what has been done by focusing on the history itself.

909
02:25:18,126 --> 02:25:28,031
Again, a little later: But let your brotherhood diligently remind them that from seeing the event, they may gain a fervor of compunction and humbly bow in adoration of the holy Trinity alone.

910
02:25:28,031 --> 02:25:34,877
Similarly, we briefly noted another letter he directed to Januarius, Bishop of Cagliari, concerning the veneration of sacred images.

911
02:25:34,877 --> 02:25:43,953
We also mentioned a letter directed to Secundinus, a servant of God, in Gaul, in which it is stated:
We have sent the images that you requested through your deacon, Dulcitius.

912
02:25:44,472 --> 02:25:50,599
We're delighted by your request because you earnestly seek the one whose image you wish to keep before your eyes.

913
02:25:50,599 --> 02:25:59,383
Having a visual reminder every day keeps you constantly engaged, and when you look at the picture, your spirit is inspired by the one whose image you long to see.

914
02:25:59,383 --> 02:26:09,360
We understand that you're not asking for an image of our Savior to worship as God, but as a reminder of the Son of God, so that you may grow in His love, whose image you desire to see.

915
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:19,174
Indeed, we don't bow before the image as though it were divine, but we honor the one we remember through the image, whether it depicts Him born, suffering, or sitting on the throne.

916
02:26:19,174 --> 02:26:23,566
The image itself serves to remind us of the Son of God, much like Scripture does.

917
02:26:23,566 --> 02:26:28,609
It brings joy to our spirit about the resurrection or provides comfort regarding the passion.

918
02:26:28,609 --> 02:26:37,827
Therefore, we've sent you two cloth banners with images of the Savior, Mary, the holy Mother of God, and the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, through our son, the deacon.

919
02:26:37,827 --> 02:26:43,900
Also included are a cross and a key for blessing, so you may be protected by Him from evil, armed with His sign.

920
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:51,166
May your royal, orthodox mind, inspired by God, remember and learn how Pope Saint Gregory instructed Bishop Serenus about holy images.

921
02:26:51,166 --> 02:26:59,137
By witnessing the event, they may feel the fervor of contrition; looking at these holy images, they humbly worship the almighty Holy Trinity alone.

922
02:26:59,137 --> 02:27:11,120
Similarly, Secundinus, the servant of God, said in Book Seven, Letter Fifty-Three:
You ask not to worship it as God, but to remind you of the Son of God, so that you may grow warm in His love, whose image you wish to see.

923
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:20,067
Indeed, we don't prostrate ourselves as before the Divinity, but we worship the one we remember through the image, whether born, suffering, or sitting on the throne.

924
02:27:20,664 --> 02:27:33,224
As he advised Bishop Serenus, who, when looking at sacred images, humbly bowed in adoration only to the almighty Holy Trinity, he also instructed Secundinus, a recluse servant of God, not to worship the images as if they were God.

925
02:27:33,224 --> 02:27:44,911
Instead, he taught him to bow before these sacred images—not as if before Divinity itself—but as a way to honor Him whom we remember through the image, whether it depicts Him born, suffering, or seated on a throne.

926
02:27:44,911 --> 02:27:56,215
In the same way, following the blameless and orthodox beliefs of Saint Gregory the Pope, we issued a declaration during the reign of Emperors Irene and Constantine to promote the veneration of sacred images.

927
02:27:56,215 --> 02:28:02,878
We stated that throughout the whole world, where Christianity exists, these sacred images are honored by all the faithful.

928
02:28:02,878 --> 02:28:15,002
Through the visible images, our minds are drawn with spiritual affection to the invisible majesty of Divinity, contemplating the image portrayed in the flesh, which the Son of God deemed worthy to assume for our salvation.

929
02:28:15,002 --> 02:28:22,429
In this way, we adore our Redeemer, who is in heaven, and glorify Him in spirit, praising Him, because, as it is written, God is spirit.

930
02:28:22,429 --> 02:28:26,306
Let it be clear that we do not deify these images, as some might claim.

931
02:28:26,306 --> 02:28:30,511
Instead, we express through them our love and devotion to God and His saints.

932
02:28:30,511 --> 02:28:37,228
We keep the books of divine Scripture and these images as reminders of our veneration, maintaining the purity of our faith.

933
02:28:37,228 --> 02:28:47,386
The testimonies we have recorded from the holy works of the Fathers align with the teachings of our predecessor, Saint Gregory the Pope, holding the same sense of faith and preaching it.

934
02:28:47,386 --> 02:28:59,837
Those we sent, namely Peter, the archpriest of our Holy Roman Church, and Peter, a devoted priest and abbot of the venerable monastery of Saint Saba, embraced our apostolic letters and promptly arranged for a council to be held.

935
02:29:00,384 --> 02:29:06,339
However, when a rebellion was sparked by heretics on the island of Sicily, our envoys returned without a response.

936
02:29:06,339 --> 02:29:09,787
Later, after sending them again to Constantinople, they succeeded.

937
02:29:09,787 --> 02:29:16,892
As a result, they convened this council according to our agreement and restored the sacred and venerable images to their rightful state.

938
02:29:16,892 --> 02:29:29,116
Just as Saint Gregory's understanding of images and ours was upheld, they also recognized this in the same council, offering these images a kiss and honorable greeting; not as an act of worship, which is due only to the divine nature.

939
02:29:29,116 --> 02:29:36,691
Additionally, they condemned the false decree made by heretics under the heretic Emperor Constantine, along with their followers and accomplices.

940
02:29:36,691 --> 02:29:44,266
Returning to the orthodox faith of the holy catholic and apostolic Church, they made a confession of true faith through their written statements.

941
02:29:44,266 --> 02:29:57,326
Therefore, we accepted this council: for if we had not accepted it and they had reverted to their former error, who would have been accountable for the loss of so many Christian souls before the dreadful judgment of the divine judge, if not us alone?

942
02:29:57,326 --> 02:30:21,618
For if there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents as written in the Gospel of Luke chapter Fifteen, how much more should one rejoice over so many thousands of Christians who have returned from error, and sing with the Psalmist: "Look to him and be radiant, and your faces shall never be ashamed" and so forth from Psalm Thirty-Four.
However, we have not yet given any response to the emperor regarding this council, fearing they might revert to their error.

943
02:30:21,984 --> 02:30:31,648
Some time ago, when we encouraged them to set up sacred images, we also asked them to return the dioceses of both archbishops and bishops to the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.

944
02:30:31,648 --> 02:30:36,013
These were taken away along with our properties when they removed the sacred images.

945
02:30:36,013 --> 02:30:38,403
They didn’t even provide any response to this.

946
02:30:38,403 --> 02:30:43,911
This shows that even if they have corrected one error, they remain in the same error in two other matters.

947
02:30:43,911 --> 02:30:55,498
If the canonical Churches of Christians everywhere still have their dioceses intact, how much more should the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church, which is the head of all God's Churches, hold and possess its dioceses?

948
02:30:55,498 --> 02:31:04,747
This includes those of the archbishops and bishops, as well as its properties for the maintenance of lights and the support of the poor, by an unbreakable right and in every way.

949
02:31:04,747 --> 02:31:14,412
Therefore, if your royal excellence, protected by God, agrees, we encourage the restoration of sacred images with the same fervor, giving thanks for their return to their original state.

950
02:31:14,412 --> 02:31:28,909
However, we again admonish and remind about the diocese of our Holy Roman Church, both of the archbishops and of the bishops, as well as the properties, that if they do not wish to restore them to our Holy Roman Church, we will declare him a heretic for persisting in this error.

951
02:31:28,909 --> 02:31:35,248
For we desire more to preserve the salvation of souls and the stability of true faith than to possess such worldly wealth.

952
02:31:35,664 --> 02:31:41,692
We rely on your outstanding virtue, protected by God and bolstered by the steadfastness of the orthodox faith.

953
02:31:41,692 --> 02:31:46,295
This firm foundation is never shaken or moved by those who are wicked and faithless.

954
02:31:46,295 --> 02:31:55,831
We believe it will remain blameless forever in the teachings of the true faith, upholding the spiritual teachings of its holy mother, the Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.

955
02:31:55,831 --> 02:32:03,174
Therefore, we trust in the power of our God, as you maintain faith and love towards the Church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

956
02:32:03,174 --> 02:32:06,955
You always strive for its progress and exaltation with royal support.

957
02:32:06,955 --> 02:32:12,874
May He graciously defend and protect you with His might in royal triumphs against hostile and unjust people.

958
02:32:12,874 --> 02:32:23,779
So that, together with our spiritual daughter, your queen, and your noble offspring, you may reign in this world for a long time and, in the future, be worthy of eternal life in the heavenly kingdom.

959
02:32:23,779 --> 02:32:26,136
May divine grace keep your excellence safe.
