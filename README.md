# Latin Patristic Texts

Welcome to the Latin Patristic Texts repository! This repository houses plain text files of Latin Patristic works that have been translated using modern AI technology. These texts are part of a personal project to make classical Church history more accessible.

## About the Translations

Translations were generated using AI (Claude, GPT-4) and should be treated as introductory guides rather than scholarly editions. Audio versions were produced using OpenAI TTS and Amazon Polly.
