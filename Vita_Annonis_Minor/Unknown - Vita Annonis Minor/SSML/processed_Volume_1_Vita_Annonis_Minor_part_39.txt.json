      "original_latin": "(Visio qua de exitu suo premonitus est) \nCum dehinc positus in quiete noctis iavius somnium su√¶ dissolutionis presagium conspexit in hunc modum. Videbatur sibi domum quandam mirifico decore intus ac foris splendidam subire, ubi in subselliis iudicialibus tamquam ad concilium solemniter collecti residebant: Heribertus Coloniensis, Bardo Mogontinus, Poppo et Everhardus Trevirenses, Arnolfus Wormaciensis et complures ex aliis Galliarum presules, quorum aliquos ipse in carne noverat, alios fama tantum vel lectione conpererat, amici omnes stolis pontificalibus habentesque vestem nivis instar candidam. Ipse quoque precioso sibi ac splendido videbatur amictu circumdatus, sed partem candentis indumenti eam, que pectus contegebat, sordida quedam caligo fuscabat, quam tamen ipse rubore perfusus obiecta manu, ne aspicientes offenderet, tegere conabatur. Vidit preterea inter eos sibi quoque seden magni decoris paratam. Quam, dum occupare gaudio plenus properaret, surgens Arnolfus Wormaciensis modesta illum voce prohibuit dicens reverendos patres nolle eum suo admittere concessu pro eo, quod vestem ipsius illa talis macula fedaret. Cumque iussus loco cedere flens confectoque nimium animo egrederetur, insecutus illum idem presul: \"Animequior\", ait, \"esto, pater. Macula tantum, que vestem tuam infecit, maturius abluatur, quia non multo post beate huius mansionis et sanctorum conssessus voti compos adipisceris consortium.\" Mane facto, cum familiari cuidam suo visum retulisset, ille rem sapienter coniciens: \"Macula,\" inquit, \"vestis tue non aliud est, ut arbitror, quam memoria iniurie civium tuorum, quibus te divine pietatis intuitu iam dudum veniam dedisse oportuerat. Hec pectori tuo tenacius que insidens cetcram sanctitatis tue claritatem indigna quadam caligine obducere videtur.\" Tum episcopus teste conscientia monitus non inficiari, quod audiebat, tamquam Deo commonente humiliter agnovit.",
