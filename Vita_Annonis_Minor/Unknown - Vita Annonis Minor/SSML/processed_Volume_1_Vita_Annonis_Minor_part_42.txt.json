      "original_latin": "(Quod longo podagre dolore confectus sit) \nDenique Coloniam regressus eo, qui podagra dicitur, morbo mox acriter vexari cepit. Ardens tamen in Domino ad consueta missarum solemnia festo sancti Geronis consisterat, ubi tantam incidit defectionem, ut ad sacramentorum vix sufficeret completionem. Inde lectum doloris ascendit, quo novem circiter septimanis exercebatur, quousque pellis tantum marcida hereret ossibus exsiccatis.",
