      "original_latin": "(Descriptio conversationis et actuum illius) \nVII. A primis ordinationis su√¶ diebus in opus evangelii totum se coepit impendere omnemque episcopatus sui parrochiam perlustrans homines solo nomine christianos fidei scilicet ac pene totius ignaros religionis praedicationibus assiduis et informationibus erudivit, breviter et lucide complexus, quid credi, quid sperari et amari oporteat. Postremo exhortans imperabat praesentibus, ut audita quisque domui suae evangelizaret, bonam pro hoc illis a Deo mercedem dicens recompensari. Quod usque adeo valuit, ut pueri quoque tenelli de fidei symbolo ad invicem conferrent et tamquam pro lege haberent fidem, quam didicerant, Dei audientiae vespere ac mane recitare. Quis autem tam saxei pectoris extitit, ut Annonem audiens praedicantem non emolliretur eique exitum lacrimarum deducenti non collacrimaretur? Plurimi denique ab exteris ac remotis provinciis sola illius fama ducti confluebant doctrina eius instrui, ab ipso indulgentiam absolvi ac benedici summopere praeoptantes. Praeterea misericordiae et largitatis operibus se bonis imitabilem per cuncta praestabat. Unde agricolas ac redituum debitores considerans exactionum pressuris praegravatos exactoribus, ut parcerent, iussit singulis vel totum vel ex parte debitum remittens. Pauperum, peregrinorum et infirmorum prima illi et perpetua erat sollicitudo ita, ut primo diei crepusculo talium examina cotidie fores eius obsiderent alimenta singulis statuta hora percepturi. Ex quibus miserrimi quique numero XXIIII sordium disponebantur, quorum vestigiis Pontifex procumbens, lavando, tergendo, osculando, inde cum cibo ac potu cuique nummum porrigendo, formam simul humilitatis et opus explebat caritatis. Considerit ad mensam, quotquot supervenerant, peregrini solito introducebantur ad convescendum coram eo. Tum ex omnibus cibariis decimam fere partem colligens ad reficiendos quascumque domorum aegrotos seponebat.",

Sed et matres talium familiari ausu necessitates illis suas insinuabant certum habentes, quod suis eas solatiis non destitueret. Facilis namque, cum esset omnium inopiae condolere, circa pauperculas tamen earumque infantulos singulari quadam compassione movebatur. Unde illae nonnunquam in plateis se transeunti ingerentes parvulos ei suos obiciebant aliquae proprios non habentes alienos assumebant non ambigentes episcopum super eas misereri, si talibus onustas sarcinulis conspexisset. Inter haec solitus erat a Dominici natalis vigilia usque ad intactae Genitricis eius purificationem continuis XL diebus, quamlibet haberet lactantem, cuius manibus ipse aquam praebebat, ipse parvuli pedes ac manus lavabat datisque alimentis solidum porrigebat.
